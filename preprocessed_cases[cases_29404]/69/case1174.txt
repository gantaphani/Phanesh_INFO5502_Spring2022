background 
plaintiffs third amended complaint brought on behalf of certain named plaintiffs and those similarly situated,asserts claims against for sex discrimination under title vii of the civil rights act.plaintiffs allege that women employed in stores are paid less than men in comparable positions,despite having higher performance ratings and greater seniority and receive wait longer to management positions than men.plaintiffs contend that strong,centralized structure fosters or facilitates gender stereotyping and discrimination,that the policies and practices underlying this discriminatory treatment are consistent throughout stores,and that this discrimination is common to all women who work or have worked in stores.
plaintiffs sought to certify a nationwide class of women who have been subjected to these allegedly discriminatory pay and promotion policies.the proposed class consists of women employed in a range of positions,from hourly employees to salaried managers.the class seeks injunctive and declaratory relief,back pay,and punitive damages,but not traditional compensatory damages.plaintiffs proposed that the district court certify the following class pursuant to rule 
all women employed at any domestic retail store at any time since december,who have been or may be subjected to challenged pay and management track promotions policies and practices.

after the parties had conducted extensive discovery and filed copious briefs,the district court heard oral argument.at the hearing,emphasized the historic nature of plaintiffs motion,including the size of the putative class,involving women employees at stores in regions.the court acknowledged concerns but noted that,while the class size was large,the issues were not unusual 
district court proceedings 
the district court issued an order granting in part and denying in part plaintiffs motion for class certification.see id.at.with respect to plaintiffs claims for equal pay,the district court granted plaintiffs certification motion as to issues of alleged discrimination and all forms of requested relief.with respect to plaintiffs promotion claim,the court holding was mixed.the court certified the proposed class with respect to issues of alleged discrimination including liability for punitive damages,as well as injunctive and declaratory relief however,the court rejected the pro posed class with respect to the request for back pay,determining that data relating to the challenged promotions were not available for all class members.the court also exercised its discretion to provide for notice and an opportunity for employees to of the punitive damages portion of the class.

ii.standards for class certification under rule 
a district court may certify a class only if 
the class is so numerous that joinder of all members is impracticable 
there are questions of law or fact common to the class the claims or defenses of the representative parties are typical of the claims or defenses of the class and the representative parties will fairly and adequately protect the interests of the class.
the district court must also find that at least one of the following three conditions is satisfied the prosecution of separate actions would create a risk of a inconsistent or varying adjudications,or b individual adjudications dispositive of the interests of other members not a party to those adjudications the party opposing the class has acted or refused to act on grounds generally applicable to the class or questions of law or fact common to the members of the class predominate over any questions affecting only individual members,and a class action is superior to other available methods for the fair and efficient adjudication of the controversy.see id.b.
the party seeking certification bears the burden of showing that each of the four requirements of rule a and at least one requirement of rule b have been met.zinser accufix research,cir,amended by cir.
the parties vigorously contest the standards governing the district court in finding the rule requirements satisfied.for a number of reasons,we must clarify this standard.first,the parties briefs demonstrate the degree of debate over the standard in this circuit.second,a number of recent cases in other circuits have endeavored to clarify the standard,and we find it prudent to follow suit given evidence of confusion.third,it is only very recently that any case in this circuit has interpreted language under the standard that drifts away from our clear case law,and we write to clarify our precedent.fourth,we are not aware of a circuit that has detailed the issue in the title vii context,and the typical situation presented in such a case implicates significant differences in the doctrine that require explanation to reach a resolution here and in future title vii class action certification decisions.
supreme court authority 
the supreme court has provided clear,if sometimes misunderstood,guidance on the issue of what standards a district court applies when deciding whether to certify a class.
the leading case describing these standards is falcon,where the plaintiff successfully certified a class of claiming racial discrimination.after a full trial on the merits,however,the district court findings distinguishing the named representative claims from those of the class called the propriety of continued class certification into question on appeal,the supreme court held that because of the district court findings at trial,falcon complaint provided an insufficient basis for concluding that the adjudication of his claim of discrimination in promotion would require the decision of any common question concerning the failure of general telephone to hire more.id.at.
the court described the implications of its holding,noting that s ometimes the issues are plain enough from the pleadings to determine whether the interests of the absent parties are fairly encompassed within the named plaintiff claim,and sometimes it may be necessary for the court to probe behind the pleadings before coming to rest on the certification question.id.at.in either case,the court held,a title vii class action,like any other class action,may only be certified if the trial court is satisfied,after a rigorous analysis,that the prerequisites of rule a have been satisfied.id.at.in conducting this rigorous analysis,the court explained that the class determination generally involves considerations that are enmeshed in the factual and legal issues comprising the plaintiff cause of action.id.at internal quotation marks omitted.
illustrating further,the court approvingly cited judge godbold concurring opinion in the fifth circuit case that had announced the rule the court was reviewing in falcon.judge godbold concurrence addressed the role of the district court in understanding the likely course of the litigation,and the supreme court praised his focus on the need for more precise pleadings.id.at internal quotation marks omitted.the court approved of his statement that without reasonable specificity the court can not define the class,can not determine whether the representation is adequate,and the employer does not know how to defend.id.at quoting johnson.highway express,cir godbold,specially concurring.
falcon thus provides relatively straightforward guidance.when considering class certification under rule,district courts are not only at liberty to,but must,perform a rigorous analysis to ensure that the prerequisites of rule a have been satisfied.see id.at.it does not mean that a district court must conduct a trial on the merits prior to certification.a district court analysis will often,though not always,require looking behind the pleadings,even to issues overlapping with the merits of the underlying claims.see id.as we describe in more detail below,every circuit to have considered this issue,including our own previous decisions,has reached essentially the same conclusion falcon central command requires district courts to ensure that rule requirements are actually met,not simply presumed from the pleadings.
we also agree with the second circuit recent decision in miles merrill lynch in re initial pub.offerings securities litigation ipo,which explained that,to the extent lower courts have evidenced confusion regarding the rule standard after falcon,this confusion has existed because those courts have misread a supreme court statement made eight years before the court handed down falcon.see,cir.specifically,courts have misunderstood eisen carlisle jacquelin,in which the supreme court stated,we find nothing in either the language or history of rule that gives a court any authority to conduct a preliminary inquiry into the merits of a suit in order to determine whether it may be maintained as a class action,d.this statement has led some courts to think that in determining whether any rule requirement is met,a judge may not consider any aspect of the merits ipo,at.it has led other courts to think that a judge may not do so at least with respect to a prerequisite of rule that overlaps with an aspect of the merits of the case.id.
as the ipo court recognized,the distinguishing features of falcon and eisen are the purposes for which the certifying court is using the underlying to address a merits issue unnecessarily or to determine whether,for example,the plaintiffs have demonstrated questions of law or fact common to their proposed class.see ipo,at.an easy way to understand this distinction is to analogize to a familiar dispute over the admissibility of alleged hearsay evidence.offered for the truth of the matter asserted,an statement by someone not testifying is,of course,inadmissible hearsay.however,that same evidence used to impeach a witness may be properly admitted.so,too,with inquiries into facts overlapping with merits issues in the rule context.it is whether courts are using the facts to probe the plaintiffs claims of compliance with rule,or to hear either parties claims directed to merits issues,that renders a court use of the facts proper or improper.courts have thus strayed from falcon when they have myopically invoked eisen to avoid considering facts properly relevant to the rule determination because the facts happen to be relevant to the later merits inquiry as well.
case law in other circuits 
like our decision today,and in part because of courts misunderstanding of eisen,many of our sister circuits have recently been called upon to clarify the standard that a district court applies when deciding whether to certify a class under rule.
though ipo is the most notable of these decisions,other courts often trace the explanatory effort back to the seventh circuit decision in szabo bridgeport machines,cir.in szabo,the court rejected a nationwide products liability class because the class was generally unsuitable for resolution because of choice of law problems on the state and fraud claims.id.at.the seventh circuit also found that the district court below had certified the class without resolving factual and legal disputes that strongly influence the wisdom of class treatment because the district court had stated that the plaintiffs allegations in the complaint are accepted as true for purposes of the class motion.id.at.analogizing to the preliminary jurisdictional inquiries that district courts routinely make under federal rules of civil procedure b and b,the court explained that,b efore deciding whether to allow a case to proceed as a class action,therefore,a judge should make whatever factual and legal inquiries are necessary under rule.id.at.
the second circuit decision in ipo agreed with szabo,providing what is now the leading case on the extent to which a district court must resolve rule issues that overlap with the merits of the case.ipo held that factual disputes concerning each of the rule factors must be analyzed and resolved.at.this is a similar holding to our previous in more detail a district court must make determinations that the prerequisites of rule a have been satisfied before it certifies a class,which may require review of the same facts and the same law presented by review of the merits.falcon,at blackie barrack,cir.ipo explained that the obligation to make such determinations is not lessened by overlap between a rule requirement and a merits issue.at.ipo expressly rejected the second circuit approach in caridad commuter railroad,cir,and stores,visa in re visa check mastermoney antitrust litigation visa check,cir,which had permitted class certification based on some showing that the rule factors were met,obviating the need to assess conflicting expert testimony pertinent to the rule inquiries.ipo,at.
since ipo,a number of other circuits have detailed the issue.the first circuit has reviewed these appellate cases,noting that o ur sister circuits agree that when class criteria and merits overlap,the district court must conduct a searching inquiry regarding the rule criteria,but how they articulate the necessary degree of inquiry ranges along a spectrum which suggests substantial differences.brown am.honda in re new motor vehicles canadian export antitrust litig,cir new motor vehicles.
though,of course,different circuits have used different words in articulating the review necessary,we think new motor vehicles overstates the degree of difference among the circuits.the core holding across circuits that have considered the issue is essentially unanimous district courts must satisfy themselves that the rule requirements have been met before certifying a class,which will sometimes,though not always,require an inquiry into and preliminary resolution of disputed factual issues,even if those same factual issues are also,independently,relevant to the ultimate merits of the case.see,joseph mclaughlin,mclaughlin on class actions ed.consensus is rapidly emerging among the united states courts of appeal.the first,second,third,fourth,fifth,seventh,eighth,tenth and eleventh circuits have expressly adopted certification standards that require rigorous factual review and preliminary factual and legal determinations with respect to the requirements of rule even if those determinations overlap with the merits.
a closer discussion of the cases the first circuit has cited demonstrates the truly narrow range in which this spectrum actually exists.requiring the district court to make specific findings that each rule criterion is met represents,the first circuit has claimed,around the more rigorous end of the spectrum,and has been embraced by the second,fourth,fifth,we would add.new motor vehicles,at citing ipo,at,unger amedisys,cir requiring courts to find facts favoring class certification through the use of rigorous,though preliminary,standards of proof gariety grant thornton,llp,cir requiring that the factors spelled out in rule be addressed through findings szabo,at see blackie,at.
on the other end of this spectrum,according to the new motor vehicles court,are cases in the third and eighth circuits which sometimes require an inquiry into and preliminary resolution of disputes,but they do not require findings and do not hold that such inquiry will always be necessary.new motor vehicles,at citing blades monsanto,cir newton merrill lynch,pierce,fenner smith,cir.
in our review of these cases,we find this spectrum of certification standards narrower and more internally consistent than does the first circuit.to begin with,we respectfully disagree with new motor vehicles characterization of the third circuit approach.the case new motor vehicles cited,newton,at,only discussed a presumption of conformity with rule in the context of the presumption in a securities class action.
the third circuit has since provided clarification.it has noted that newton does not hold that a district court can presume rule requirements met from contested pleadings outside the context.vallies sky bank,wl,at cir.it has also demonstrated its conformity with the other circuits standard more broadly.in in re constar international.securities litigation,the court explained that we require that each rule component be satisfied,cir emphasis added citing in re hydrogen peroxide antitrust,cir hydrogen peroxide.recognizing the importance of the class certification decision,the court emphasized that district courts,where appropriate,are to delve beyond the pleadings to determine whether the requirements for class certification are satisfied.id.quoting hydrogen peroxide,at newton,at.it further elucidated,a n overlap between a class certification requirement and the merits of a claim is no reason to decline to resolve relevant disputes when necessary to determine whether a class certification requirement is met.id.internal quotation marks omitted.the third circuit thus requires a district court determination that the requirements of rule have been satisfied.id.while we readily recognize the benefit of the additional cases available to us in conducting our review,we respectfully disagree with the first circuit conclusion that the third circuit allows a more lax standard of review than do other circuits.
new motor vehicles is on firmer ground describing the eighth circuit decision in blades,though we find the language in that case more nuanced than new motor vehicles describes,and we disagree that blades suggests substantial differences from other circuits.new motor vehicles,at.the blades court cited falcon in describing the standard as follows 
to determine whether common questions predominate,a court must conduct a limited preliminary inquiry,looking behind the pleadings.in conducting this preliminary inquiry,however,the court must look only so far as to determine whether,given the factual setting of the case,if the plaintiffs sic general allegations are true,common evidence could suffice to make out a prima facie showing for the class 
the preliminary inquiry at the class certification stage may require the court to resolve disputes going to the factual setting of the case,and such disputes may overlap with the merits of the case.see szabo bridgeport,cir.nonetheless,such disputes may be resolved only insofar as resolution is necessary to determine the nature of the evidence that would be sufficient,if the plaintiff general allegations were true,to make out a prima facie case for the class.
blades,at some citations omitted emphasis added.
while this language is not as definitive as that used by the second circuit in ipo,for example,it sets up essentially the same standard.under blades,district courts in the eighth circuit must resolve factual disputes going to the setting of the case,which we understand to mean the factual circumstances dictating whether the plaintiffs have met the rule requirements.id.at.supporting this understanding is blades later statement explaining that t o certify a class action under rule b,the court must find that common questions predominate and class resolution is superior to other available methods for the fair and efficient adjudication of the controversy.id.at emphasis added.finally,like ipo,blades understands eisen as prohibiting the district court from making preliminary findings on merits issues not related to the rule resolution.see id.at see also richard nagareda,class actions in the administrative state kalven and rosenfield revisited,nagareda,class actions.not surprisingly,then,ipo cited blades as a key case supporting its conclusion to require district court determinations that each of the rule requirements is met.ipo,at.
we thus view whether an appellate court requires district courts to resolve,find,unger,at or determine,ipo,at,that rule requirements have been met,as essentially,even if not precisely,the same standard to characterize such usage as embodying substantial differences seems to create a distinction where none exists.see new motor vehicles,at see also richard nagareda,class certification in the age of aggregate proof,nagareda,aggregate proof describing federal courts as moving toward an essentially uniform standard that is law.under any of these articulations,the charge to the district court follows the analysis the ipo court explained,and we agree,that falcon and eisen require.ipo,at.the district court must analyze underlying facts and legal issues going to the certification questions regardless of any overlap with the merits.however,this does not mean a district court should put the actual resolution of the merits cart before the motion to dismiss,summary judgment,and trial horses by reaching out to decide issues unnecessary to the rule requirements.
having discussed our sister circuits treatment of this issue,we now turn to the standard in our circuit as established by our previous cases.
ninth circuit precedent 
since we first addressed the issue in the wake of the eisen and falcon decisions,our cases have made clear that a district court inquiry overlapping with the merits is permissible,and often required,under rule.see moore hughes helicopters,cir although some inquiry into the substance of a case may be necessary to ascertain satisfaction of the commonality and typicality requirements of rule a,it is improper to advance a decision on the merits to the certification stage.citation omitted.later,we said that a district court is at liberty to consider evidence which goes to the requirements of rule even though the evidence may also relate to the underlying merits of the case.hanon dataproducts,cir internal quotation marks omitted see also staton boeing,cir the court may not go so far,of course,as to judge the validity of the merits claims but the breadth and consistency of class counsel initial evidence places the district court finding of commonality well within that court discretion.citation omitted.we have also specifically cited eisen in rejecting a party argument that eisen prohibits any inquiry overlapping with the merits and explaining that such an overlapping inquiry is sometimes necessary under rule.see blackie,at nor is the class issue separable from the merits in all cases including this one.the common questions,typicality,conflicts and adequacy of representation,and predominance tests,are determinations which may require review of the same facts and the same law presented by review of the merits.citations omitted 
we have adhered to the supreme court guidance in holding that a class may only be certified if we are satisfied,after a rigorous analysis,that the prerequisites of rule a have been satisfied.hanon,at quoting falcon,u.at.we have also,however,recognized that falcon contemplated cases in which the issues are plain enough from the pleadings and do not require analysis beyond those papers.at chamberlan ford motor,cir per curiam the supreme court thus recognized over twenty years ago that a rigorous analysis does not always result in a lengthy explanation or review of the record.hanlon chrysler,cir.thus,in some cases,the pleadings will be sufficient to render the certification decision,and in others,the district court must make determinations on facts overlapping with the merits.
in addition,our cases have understood that falcon,like rule itself,requires questions of law or fact that were common to the claims.at emphasis added.therefore,we have found class certification proper where a plaintiff is attacking defendants discriminatory practices against females,and this is not just as it applied to plaintiff only,because such a claim identifies a common legal issue,discrimination against women,and a common factual problem,discrimination as applied by the defendant.bouman block,cir internal quotation marks omitted see also rodriguez hayes,wl,at cir,t he commonality requirements ask s us to look only for some shared legal issue or a common core of facts.we have also,of course,rejected the claims that falcon prohibited,and we have denied class certification when a rigorous analysis did not show the class would implicate common questions.see,lozano v.at t wireless,cir citing falcon in rejecting certification of a class action based on the unconscionability of a class action waiver because the district court did not perform the requisite analysis.as one example,we have explained that commonality is satisfied where the lawsuit challenges a practice or policy that affects all of the putative class members,because such a system implicates common factual questions.armstrong,at.
our most recent statement considering falcon and eisen comports with this understanding as well.writing for the court in united steel workers conocophillips,judge bybee explained that it is the plaintiff theory that matters at the class certification stage,not whether the theory will ultimately succeed on the merits.see,wl,at cir.we thus found reversible error because the district court did not consider whether the plaintiff legal theory was one in which common issues of law and or fact did not predominate,and instead found the class did not meet rule requirements because there can be no assurances that plaintiffs w ould prevail on this theory.id.citing the district court first emphasis added.in short,we have consistently held that when considering how the facts and legal issues apply to a class under rule a,the district court must focus on common questions and common issues,not common proof or likely success on the questions commonly raised.see id.
for the most part,the dozens of district court cases in this circuit parsing eisen,falcon,and our precedent,have considered eisen language in context,concluding that they must make determinations that the requirements of rule have been met,and acknowledging that these determinations will sometimes require examining issues that overlap with the merits.see,endres wells fargo bank,no.c,wl,at,t he court is not permitted to make a preliminary inquiry into the merits of the plaintiffs claims at that stage of the litigation.nevertheless,the court must consider evidence relating to the merits if such evidence also goes to the requirements of rule.internal quotation marks and citation omitted westways world travel,amr,although the supreme court once stated that courts have no authority to conduct a preliminary inquiry into the merits of a suit in order to determine whether it may be maintained as a class action,citing eisen later cases make clear that a preliminary inquiry into the merits is sometimes necessary to make a meaningful determination of class certification issues.at the same time,the court is required to take the allegations of the plaintiff complaint as true.plaintiff bears the burden of showing that the elements of rule are met.citations omitted these cases have correctly threaded the needle between eisen,falcon,and our precedent.
in the less typical instances in which district courts in this circuit have been led astray,a common reason seems to have been a misreading of our statement in footnote of blackie barrack,in which we explained that district courts are bound to take the substantive allegations of the complaint as true,thus necessarily making the class order speculative in the sense that the plaintiff may be altogether unable to prove his allegations.at see also edwards city of long beach,d,the court is bound to take the substantive allegations in the complaint as true.but,that statement is taken out of context when relied on in this manner the subsequent sentences in blackie,which the erring district courts almost universally neglect to include,explained that,although the court may not put the plaintiff to preliminary proof of his claim,it does require sufficient information to form a reasonable judgment.lacking that,the court may request the parties to supplement the pleadings with sufficient material to allow an informed judgment on each of the rule requirements.at emphasis added.discussing when a certification inquiry overlaps with the merits,we further explained in blackie 
nor is the class issue separable from the merits in all cases including this one.the common questions,typicality,conflicts and adequacy of representation.a,and predominance tests.b,are determinations which may require review of the same facts and the same law presented by review of the merits.
a better reading of blackie,then,is to understand it as having the meaning that our cases,and the majority of district court opinions,have ascribed to it blackie is entirely consistent with the supreme court guidance,explicitly requiring a district court to probe behind the pleadings if doing so is necessary to make findings on the rule certification decision.thus,blackie does not,and could not,require the district court to unquestioningly accept a plaintiff arguments as to the necessary rule determinations.the sense in which blackie referred to class certification as speculative is the same way in which we most recently,and more artfully,described the inquiry 
a court can never be assured that a plaintiff will prevail on a given legal theory prior to a dispositive ruling on the merits,and a full inquiry into the merits of a putative class legal claims is precisely what both the supreme court and we have cautioned is not appropriate for a rule certification inquiry.
united steel workers,wl,at.
in short,the explanation we provide today is not a new standard at all.though a small number of district courts in this circuit have misunderstood blackie and relied on eisen in the way that the second circuit has cautioned against,and that we now reject,the precedent from this court is consistent.we are unable to find a single case in our court that incorrectly relied on the no merits inquiry language from eisen in certifying a class without examining necessary issues because they overlapped with the merits.caridad,at applying the no merits inquiry language from eisen out of context to prohibit the proper rule analysis.our explanation confirms what our decisions have held for more than years a district court must sometimes resolve factual issues related to the merits to properly satisfy itself that rule requirements are met,but the purpose of the district court inquiry at this stage remains focused on,for example,common questions of law or fact under rule a,or predominance under rule b,not the proof of answers to those questions or the likelihood of success on the merits.falcon,at requiring a specific presentation identifying the questions of law or fact that were common to the claims of respondent and of the members of the class he sought to represent emphasis added united steel workers,wl,at district court erred in basing its decision on whether the plaintiffs could prove merits rather than whether their claims implicated common questions of law or fact.of course,for class certification to be proper,the common questions can not simply arise from artful pleading.plaintiffs must raise questions that the district court concludes,after a rigorous analysis,are susceptible to common resolution at a later stage.
clarifying the standard 
the proper standard of rule adjudication 
this review of supreme court dictates,as well as our own and other circuits treatment of the issue,leads us to recognize a number of constant holdings across circuits that we must incorporate into our clarification of the proper standard governing a district court in considering a rule motion for class certification.
to begin with,at the class certification stage,while eisen prohibits a court from making determinations on the merits that do not overlap with the rule inquiry,district courts must make determinations that each requirement of rule is actually met.this bedrock rule is consistent with the supreme court statements,other circuits decisions,and our precedent.while plaintiffs need not make more than allegations as to their substantive claims,whether the suit is appropriate for class resolution must be actually demonstrated,not just alleged,to the district court satisfaction.
in addition,in the cases such as ipo in which courts have recognized how eisen is sometimes misunderstood,those circuits have uniformly reserved discretion with the district court to avoid a inquiry at the certification stage despite the need to find the rule requirements met see,blades,at the closer any dispute at the class certification stage comes to the heart of the claim,the more cautious the court should be in ensuring that it must be resolved in order to determine the nature of the evidence the plaintiff would require.district courts must maintain the ability to cut off discovery to avoid either party bootstrapping a trial or summary judgment motion into the certification stage.nearly every circuit to consider the issue,including our own,has recognized the practical importance of the certification decision as leverage for settlement,yet rule gives neither party the right to turn the certification decision into a trial.
when reading recent class certification cases,one also notices the prevalence of securities fraud cases,and particularly the presumption,in the evolution of the rule standard.see,oscar private equity invs.allegiance telecom,cir ipo,at bowe polymedica in re polymedica.secs.litig,cir unger,at gariety,at west prudential sec,cir.
it is an interesting feature of the case law development that it has occurred largely in these cases,in which a plaintiff typically must show the six basic elements of a securities fraud action,dura,broudo,d,and the efficient market component of the causation element overlaps with the merits.we must,then,be aware that applying the same procedural rules,such as rule,can lead to different outcomes when the underlying legal and factual framework is different.see,hohider united parcel,cir describing how the pattern and practice evidentiary framework from title vii cases is not perfectly applicable in the context of the americans with disabilities act.
thus,in contrast to a securities class action based on a theory,in a pattern and practice discrimination case,a plaintiff will typically not come to court in the first place without anecdotal evidence.for practical purposes,assuming a plaintiff possesses anecdotal evidence,the plaintiff statistical evidence does not overlap with the merits,it largely is the merits.see watson fort worth bank trust,d int l of teamsters united states,d.this means that disputes over whose statistics are more persuasive are often not disputes about whether the plaintiffs raise common issues or questions,but are really arguments going to proof of the merits.see nagareda,class actions,supra,at nowhere is this disputed statistics problem more acute than in employment discrimination class actions centered on statistical analysis of an aggregate nature.of course,if one party argued that the other party statistics were unreliable or based on an unaccepted method,this may be an issue the district court would have to resolve to determine whether the potentially problematic statistics were even capable of raising a common question.
in fact,after ipo,but before his recent elevation to the second circuit,judge gerard lynch recognized this problem in a title vii gender discrimination case in which the plaintiffs were seeking to certify on the same grounds as those here.predictably faced with a dispute regarding whether the plaintiffs statistics demonstrated commonality,judge lynch addressed ipo application in a title vii,gender discrimination context 
the problem,the district court explained,was that i n deciding that the class certification order complied with in re ipo,it is important to note that disparate impact cases present unique difficulties in analyzing the commonality requirement of rule a.plaintiffs in disparate impact cases often rely on statistical evidence to prove the merits of their claim.hnot willis group holdings.the court continued,i n such a case,however,the same evidence must be considered to determine whether a plaintiff has satisfied the commonality requirement.id.at.
in resolving this problem and certifying the class,the district court noted,c ontrary to defendants assertions,in re ipo does not stand for the proposition that the court should,or is even authorized to,determine which of the parties expert reports is more persuasive.defendants ignore the fact that in re ipo specifically rejected this interpretation of rule.id.at.instead,judge lynch explained,in re ipo reiterated that experts disagreement on the a discriminatory impact can be shown is not a valid basis for denying class certification.id.alterations in original quoting ipo,at.thus,the court could only examine the expert reports as far as they bear on the rule determination.id.
judge lynch similarly clarified,with regard to the disparate treatment issue in the case before him,that plaintiffs and defendants disagree on whose statistical findings and observations are more credible,but this disagreement is relevant only to the merits of plaintiffs plaintiffs actually suffered disparate not to whether plaintiffs have asserted common questions of fact or law plaintiffs ultimate success at trial on the merits requires an answer to that question,specifically that defendants actually did discriminate against plaintiffs.id.at.by asking the court to decide which expert report is more credible,defendants are requesting that the court look beyond the rule requirements and decide the issue on the merits,a practice in re ipo specifically cautions against.id.at.
thus,in addition to demonstrating rule proper implementation in various legal contexts securities class actions versus title vii claims,hnot also illustrates a second feature of the certification cases that we must address.because the cases are typically decided under rule b predominance requirement,a related feature of the circuit court cases considering the proper standard a district court applies,when deciding whether to certify a class,is the difference between cases describing review of evidence under rule a and those under rule b we are unaware of any argument claiming that a different standard should apply in the two inquiries,and the cases generally treat the precedent as applying equally to both contexts.we do,however,note that the inquiry can not be divorced from the text of rule,which,of course,requires plaintiffs to make different showings under different parts of the rule.this distinction helps order the doctrine,keeping in mind the different requirements under rule a and b and how those requirements may play out in a district court certification decision.
this insight derives from the supreme court explanation of the predominance test under rule b.predominance,the court explained,tests whether proposed classes are sufficiently cohesive to warrant adjudication by representation,amchem prods,windsor,d,a standard far more demanding than the commonality requirement of rule a,id.at.thus,we would expect that cases in which the parties are contesting facts underlying the rule b determination may often require more determinations by the district court than those in which rule a is the primarily contested issue.rule a is about invoking common questions,see falcon,at,whereas rule b requires a district court to formulate some prediction as to how specific issues will play out in order to determine whether common or individual issues predominate in a given case,new motor vehicles,at internal quotation marks omitted.we thus should not be surprised that a district court will have to make more precise factual determinations under rule b than under rule a.this insight does not apply a procedural rule differently in two like contexts it applies the text of rule itself to the district court task.
while we find the case law across circuits more uniform than some courts have implied,see id.at,to the extent it is not,this result may be because of courts failure to recognize this key difference between a district court job under rule a and its job under rule b this conclusion is further supported when one notices that falcon primary inquiry was under rule a,at,whereas many of the circuit courts discussed above were concerned with rule b predominance test and,thus,required the district court to make more detailed determinations as to how the facts at issue would play they would the merits of the litigation.see,hydrogen peroxide,at rule b predominance new motor vehicles,at same ipo,at same in re polymedica.secs.litig,at same unger,at,same blades,at same gariety,at same szabo,at same.
though some courts have noted the difference between rule a and b in passing,see hydrogen peroxide,at we are not aware of any decisions detailing the difference,and some courts have failed to note the distinction at all.see,ipo,at we see no reason to doubt that what the supreme court said about rule a requirements applies with equal force to all rule requirements,including those set forth in rule b.we think a great deal of any disparity in different courts explication of the rule standard can be explained by this difference.the lesson for future district courts is that,in a given case,the text of rule a,as compared to rule b,may require them to determine more or different facts typically more under rule b to determine whether the plaintiffs have met their rule burden.
in short,these observations,which include the supreme court direction,precedent in this court,and treatment from other circuits,lead us to the following explanation of the proper standards governing a district court adjudication of a rule motion for class certification.first,when considering class certification under rule,district courts are not only at liberty to,but must,perform a rigorous analysis to ensure that the prerequisites of rule have been satisfied,and this analysis will often,though not always,require looking behind the pleadings to issues overlapping with the merits of the underlying claims.it is important to note that the district court is not bound by these determinations as the litigation progresses.second,district courts may not analyze any portion of the merits of a claim that do not overlap with the rule requirements.relatedly,a district court performs this analysis for the purpose of determining that each of the rule requirements has been satisfied.third,courts must keep in mind that different parts of rule require different inquiries.for example,what must be satisfied for the commonality inquiry under rule a is that plaintiffs establish common questions of law and fact,and answering those questions is the purpose of the merits inquiry,which can be addressed at trial and at summary judgment.fourth,district courts retain wide discretion in class certification decisions,including the ability to cut off discovery to avoid a on the merits at the certification stage.fifth,different types of cases will result in diverging frequencies with which the district court will properly invoke its discretion to abrogate discovery.as just one example,we would expect a district court to circumscribe discovery more often in a title vii case than in a securities class action resting on a theory,because the statistical disputes typical to title vii cases often encompass the basic merits inquiry and need not be proved to raise common questions and demonstrate the appropriateness of class resolution.plaintiffs pleading,on the other hand,may have to establish an efficient market to even raise common questions or show predominance.
the dissent significant proof standard 
in addition to setting out our own review,we feel compelled to discuss the dissent consideration of this issue.the supreme court decisions in falcon and eisen are the primary guides to our ruling in this case.the dissent,in suggesting that we are unfaithful to falcon,seeks to create a new class action requirement based on a hypothetical in one sentence of supreme court dicta conflates,or at least fails to distinguish,the posture of falcon and the present case ignores the weight of the many cases in other circuits arriving at the same standard we have described above and renders itself unpersuasive by critiquing the district court analysis as insufficiently rigorous.in doing so,the dissent is unfaithful to the actual distinctions the supreme court relied upon in falcon,and variously depicts falcon as instituting a significant proof burden or significant proof requirement that falcon did not create.dissent at.
we read falcon,as has nearly every court of appeals to consider the question,as creating the standard we describe above.but in discussing what it views as the analysis required by falcon,the dissent quotes a portion of a sentence of falcon dicta in footnote as standing for the requirement that plaintiffs can not prevail at the certification stage without showing s ignificant proof that an employer operated under a general policy of discrimination.id.at.however,the entire footnote sentence reads as follows significant proof that an employer operated under a general policy of discrimination conceivably could justify a class of both applicants and employees if the discrimination manifested itself in hiring and promotion practices in the same general fashion,such as through entirely subjective processes.falcon,u.at emphasis added 
falcon discussion of two distinct and which significant proof could prove sufficient to certify a single class,is an unusually high standard that plaintiffs here need not meet because they did not present the distinct legal theories of recovery that the falcon plaintiffs,both employees and applicants,had pursued together in one class.the question before the district court was not whether plaintiffs have definitively proven disparate treatment and a disparate impact rather,the question was whether the basis of plaintiffs discrimination claims was sufficient to support class certification.brown nucor,cir,cert.denied,wl.
contrary to the dissent falcon does not say that plaintiffs must show a common policy of proven discrimination at the class action stage,rather than just a common policy alleged to be discriminatory.at.of course,as we have already explained,named plaintiffs must do more than merely allege discriminatory practices against themselves.id.as we demonstrate below,plaintiffs here do so,making showings through their expert testimony and statistical evidence,which further distinguishes the certification decision here from that decision in falcon.in maintaining otherwise in its discussion,the dissent confuses merits decisions such as teamsters,at,and class action certification decisions it also ignores our previous statement examining falcon footnote in which we explained that w e understand footnote fifteen of falcon to present a demonstrative example rather than a limited exception to the overall skepticism toward broad discrimination class actions.staton,at.in other words,as we have previously described falcon,the supreme court does not generally ban all broad classes but rather precludes a class action that,on the basis of one form of discrimination against one or a handful of plaintiffs,seeks to adjudicate all forms of discrimination against all members of a group protected by title vii,or a similar statute.id.
the dissent also largely ignores supreme court guidance by failing to recognize that falcon addressed the claim that the allegations of an employee subject to discrimination in promotion decisions fairly encompassed the claims of allegedly subject to discrimination in a discrete hiring process.falcon,at.such a determination under rule is clearly distinct from an inquiry where,as here,a class consists entirely of individuals actually employed under the same corporate policies critically,in falcon,the individual plaintiff claim was based on promotion practices for his allegations and hiring practices for the putative class members,yet falcon complaint contained no factual allegations concerning petitioner hiring practices,id.at,despite the fact that the class members claims depended on pattern or practice in hiring,id.at.in contrast,where the individual plaintiffs seek to prove their own cases through pattern or practice methods,they are necessarily dependent on proving facts relevant to others of the same protected group subject to the same policy,class action or no class action.see watson,at see also nagareda,aggregate proof,supra,at the terms pattern and practice themselves imply an aggregate perspective.
finally,plaintiffs here are unlike the plaintiff in falcon,who failed to otherwise support his allegation that the company ha d a policy of discrimination except by claiming that he himself had been denied a promotion on discriminatory grounds.falcon,at.as we detail below,plaintiffs here have introduced significant proof of policies,and their effects on the certified class,and have introduced evidence of far more than the validity of their own claim s.id.even if the dissent were correct in creating a significant proof standard or burden,or requirement,which it is not,it would not apply to plaintiffs in this case.subjective decisionmaking processes are exactly what the plaintiffs allege here and what the supreme court hypothetical expressed concern with in falcon.id.at.in addition,it is not clear that such a standard,if it existed,need apply to of whom was or is an all because they are not situated as the falcon plaintiffs,who were both employees seeking promotion and job applicants pursuing a position and thus needed to show different facts and allege diverging legal theories.
again unlike in falcon,and as discussed in detail below,the district court here did not presume or fail to evaluate carefully the legitimacy of plaintiffs claims to be proper class representative s,id.at,but rather found rule satisfied only after undertaking the rigorous analysis the supreme court requires,see dukes,at.the specific recognition of falcon rigorous analysis requirement guided the district court analysis throughout its lengthy order,and the court made determinations that each of rule requirements were satisfied.id.at,applying falcon.the dissent attenuated claim that the district court abused its discretion by failing to require a specific presentation identifying the questions of law or fact that were common to the claims of respondent and of the members of the class he sought to represent,see falcon,at,is vitiated by the pages in which the district court exhaustively performed exactly that analysis,explicitly considering questions of law and fact that were common to the members of the class and the named representatives see dukes,at.in short,and as we will now explain,at the certification stage,it is difficult for us to envision a more rigorous analysis than the one the district court conducted.
iii.certification of this class 
unsurprisingly,the class in this case is broad and diverse,encompassing both salaried and hourly employees in a range of positions,who are or were employed at one or more of stores across the country.the district court found that the large class is united by a complex array of practices,which plaintiffs contend discriminate against women.
at the outset of considering the district court certification order in light of the standard,we note two facets of the district court review.
first,this case reached us after a significantly more searching review than cases in other circuit courts explaining the rule standard.in szabo,for example,the district court assumed that whatever the plaintiff allege d must be true,and it p roceed ed as if class certification under rule were governed by the same principles as evaluating the sufficiency of the complaint under rule b.at.in gariety,the case came to the fourth circuit after the district court had concluded that the fact that the plaintiffs have asserted that the keystone market was efficient is enough at the certification stage to find the market efficient.at emphasis added see also vallario vandehey,cir district court abused its discretion in thinking it was barred from any consideration of action merits ipo,at district court finding that only have the burden of proof at class make some showing.
in other words,previous circuit courts addressing similar issues have been faced with district courts making the same mistake that we described a small number of district courts in this circuit have made in citing blackie out of context refusing to consider any issue overlapping with the merits,and assuming the plaintiffs substantive allegations as true for the rule inquiry.as we demonstrate below,such review is entirely dissimilar from the district court review in this case.
second,we also note that resolving this case requires a close reading of the district court lengthy opinion to determine the standard the district court applied in deciding to certify the class.contrary to the claims of and the dissent,such a reading of the district court individual determinations on rule a shows that the district court actually weighed evidence and made findings sufficient under the standard we have described above.
in broadly discussing the standard of review,the district court stated the following 
a party seeking to certify a class must demonstrate that it has met all four requirements of federal rule of civil procedure a,and at least one of the requirements of rule b.rule a requires that all of the following four factors be met in short,the class must satisfy the requirements of numerosity,commonality,typicality,and adequacy 
the party seeking certification must provide facts sufficient to satisfy rule a and b requirements.in turn,the district court must conduct a rigorous analysis to determine that the prerequisites of rule have been met,d.if a court is not fully satisfied,certification should be refused see.advisory committee note to amends.
a lthough some inquiry into the substance of a case may be necessary to ascertain satisfaction of the commonality and typicality requirements of rule a,it is improper to advance a decision on the merits to the certification stage.moore hughes helicopters,cir citation omitted see also nelson united states steel,cir plaintiffs burden at class certification entails more than the simple assertion of commonality and typicality but less than a prima facie showing of liability citation omitted.
dukes,at some citations omitted last alteration in original emphasis added.unlike some other district courts,which have assumed facts in a complaint,the district court here spent significant effort explaining a nuanced standard that clearly comprehended the need to look well beyond the pleadings in the case.
most importantly,as we will now explain,the district court standard led to a review that complies with falcon and with our standards that a district court must follow when deciding whether to certify a class.
numerosity 
rule a requires that the class be so numerous that joinder of all members is impracticable.does not contest this point.
commonality 
rule a requires that there are questions of law or fact common to the class.commonality focuses on the relationship of common facts and legal issues among class members.see,conte newberg,supra,at.we noted in hanlon,at 
rule a has been construed permissively.all questions of fact and law need not be common to satisfy the rule.the existence of shared legal issues with divergent factual predicates is sufficient,as is a common core of salient facts coupled with disparate legal remedies within the class.
the commonality test is qualitative rather than quantitative one significant issue common to the class may be sufficient to warrant certification,see,savino computer credit,aff,cir see also conte newberg,supra,at,a standard that dovetails with our discussion above,requiring plaintiffs to show common questions or issues.
the district court found that plaintiffs had provided evidence sufficient to support their contention that significant factual and legal questions are common to all class members.after analyzing plaintiffs evidence,the district court stated 
plaintiffs have exceeded the permissive and minimal burden of establishing commonality by providing significant evidence of corporate practices and policies,which include a excessive subjectivity in personnel decisions,b gender stereotyping,and c maintenance of a strong corporate culture statistical evidence of gender disparities caused by discrimination and anecdotal evidence of gender bias.together,this evidence raises an inference that engages in discriminatory practices in compensation and promotion that affect all plaintiffs in a common manner.
dukes,at.discussing commonality,the district court alluded to the determinations rule requires in certifying a class.the court stated,rule a requires that common questions of law or fact exist among class members.id.at.recognizing this requirement of rule,the district court went on to make reasoned determinations that commonality was met,concluding that th e evidence more than satisfies plaintiffs burden to demonstrate commonality under rule a.id.at.the district court then detailed the four categories of commonality evidence to which we now turn.id.we conclude,as explained in more detail below,that it was within the district court discretion,and in line with falcon and the standard we have clarified today,to determine that the commonality prerequisite to class certification was satisfied.see.a 
evidence of a common policy of discrimination 
pursuant to falcon,at,plaintiffs presented four categories of commonality evidence that the district court subjected to a rigorous analysis facts supporting the existence of policies and practices that,in part through their subjectivity,provide a potential conduit for discrimination expert opinions supporting the existence of policies and practices that likely include a culture of gender stereotyping expert statistical evidence of gender disparities attributable to discrimination and anecdotal evidence from class members throughout the country of discriminatory attitudes held or tolerated by management.see dukes,at.contends this evidence is insufficient to suggest a common factual or legal question related to the existence of discrimination.
factual evidence 
as factual evidence,plaintiffs presented evidence of the following uniform personnel and management structure across stores headquarters extensive oversight of store operations,policies governing pay and promotion decisions,and a strong,centralized corporate culture and consistent disparities in every domestic region of the company.such evidence supports plaintiffs contention that operates a highly centralized company that promotes policies common to all stores and maintains a single system of oversight.does not challenge this evidence.
expert opinion 
plaintiffs presented evidence from william bielby,a sociologist,to interpret and explain the facts that suggest that has and promotes a strong corporate culture that may include gender stereotyping.bielby based his opinion on,among other things,managers deposition testimony organizational charts correspondence,memos,reports,and presentations relating to personnel policy and practice,diversity,and equal employment opportunity issues documents describing the culture and history of the company and a large body of social science research on the impact of organizational policy and practice on workplace bias.
bielby testified that he employed a social framework analysis to examine the distinctive features of policies and practices and evaluated them against what social science shows to be factors that create and sustain bias and those that minimize bias.in bielby opinion,social science research demonstrates that gender stereotypes are especially likely to influence personnel decisions when they are based on subjective factors,because substantial decisionmaker discretion tends to allow people to seek out and retain information and ignore or minimize information that defies stereotypes.id.at internal quotation marks omitted.bielby concluded that centralized coordination,reinforced by a strong organizational culture,sustains uniformity in personnel policy and practice there are significant deficiencies in equal employment policies and practices and personnel policies and practices make pay and promotion decisions vulnerable to gender bias.see id.at.
the district court reviewed plaintiffs and competing claims as to uniform culture and determined that the evidence indicates that pay and promotion decisions are largely subjective and made within a substantial range of discretion by store or district level managers,and that this is a common feature which provides a wide enough conduit for gender bias to potentially seep into the system.id.at.having evaluated this evidence in detail,the court determined that given the evidence regarding strong uniform culture and policies,the degree and impact of this practice is a significant question of fact common to the class as a whole.id.at.such a reasoned determination is what our standard for rule requires.
vigorously challenges bielby third conclusion as vague and imprecise because he concluded that is vulnerable to bias or gender stereotyping but failed to identify a specific discriminatory policy at.specifically,contends that bielby testimony does not meet the standards for expert testimony set forth in federal rule of evidence and daubert merrell dow pharmaceuticals,d,which held that a trial court must act as a gatekeeper in determining whether to admit or exclude expert evidence.
made an identical argument to the district court and the district court properly rejected it.a close reading of the district court order demonstrates its correct understanding of its role at the rule a certification make factual determinations regarding evidence as it relates to common questions of fact or law but not to decide which parties evidence is ultimately more persuasive as to liability.the court stated,bielby presents enough of a basis,both in his review of the scientific literature and on the facts of the case,to provide a foundation for his opinions.dukes,at.the court correctly explained that whether the jury was ultimately persuaded by those opinions was a question on the merits.for the class certification,however,bielby opinions,for which did not challenge the methodology,raised a question of corporate uniformity and gender stereotyping that is common to all class members.id.we can not say that considering bielby opinions in this method was an abuse of discretion.
this conclusion is furthered by the fact that did not and does not challenge bielby methodology or contend that his findings lack relevance because they do not relate to any issue in the case,daubert,at internal quotation marks omitted.challenges only whether certain inferences can be persuasively drawn from his data.but because daubert does not require a court to admit or exclude evidence based on its persuasiveness,but rather requires a court to admit or exclude evidence based on its scientific reliability and relevance,id.at relevance standard is a liberal one,under which evidence is relevant if it has any tendency to make the existence of any fact that is of consequence to the determination of the action more probable or less probable than it would be without the evidence quoting,testing bielby testimony for daubert reliability would not have addressed objections.it would have simply revealed what itself has admitted and courts have long accepted that properly analyzed social science data,like that offered by bielby,may support a plaintiff assertions that a claim is proper for class resolution.see price waterhouse hopkins,d considering similar evidence offered by expert social psychologist.
accordingly,contention that the district court was required to strike bielby testimony under the daubert test at the class certification stage,simply because the conclusion he reached seemed unpersuasive absent certain corroborating evidence,is misplaced see daubert,at the focus,of course,must be solely on principles and methodology,not on the conclusions that they generate.while a jury may ultimately agree with that,in the absence of a specific discriminatory policy promulgated by,it is not more likely than not,based solely on bielby analysis,that engaged in actual gender discrimination,that question must be left to the merits stage of the litigation and presumably will not have to be decided as there will be other evidence.at the class certification stage,it is enough that bielby presented scientifically reliable evidence tending to show that a common question of,does policy of decentralized,subjective employment decision making operate to discriminate against female employees exists with respect to all members of the class this he did and,thus,we find no error in the district court acceptance of bielby evidence to support a finding of commonality.
statistical evidence 
it is well established that plaintiffs may demonstrate commonality by presenting statistical evidence,which survives a rigorous analysis,sufficient to fairly raise a common question concerning whether there is discrimination.see falcon,at,caridad,at see also stastny bell,cir recognizing that statistical data showing comparable disparities experienced by protected employees may indicate a policy or practice that commonly affects the class members and raises a common question concerning whether the pattern or practice is discriminatory.
a careful reading of the district court treatment of the competing statistical evidence demonstrates that,in conducting its analysis,the district court followed the correct standard as explained in falcon and our earlier cases,and clarified today.
richard drogin,plaintiffs statistician,analyzed data at a regional level.he ran separate regression analyses for each of the containing stores he concluded that there are statistically significant disparities between men and women at in terms of compensation and promotions,that these disparities are widespread across regions,and that they can be explained only by gender discrimination.dukes,at.marc bendick,plaintiffs labor economics expert,conducted a benchmarking study comparing with twenty of its competitors,concluding promotes a lower percentage of women than its competitors see id.
challenges drogin findings and faults his decision to conduct his research on the regional level,rather than analyze the data however,the proper test of whether workforce statistics should be viewed at the macro regional or micro store or level depends largely on the similarity of the employment practices and the interchange of employees at the various facilities.see kirkland state dep t of corr,cir recognizing that the focus of analysis depends on the nature of a defendant employment practices barbara lindemann paul grossman,employment discrimination law,ed.
here,drogin explained that a analysis would not capture the effect of district,regional,and control over uniform compensation policies and procedures the dissemination of uniform compensation policies and procedures resulting from the frequent movement of store managers or strong corporate culture.dukes,at.
in conducting its rigorous analysis of these claims,the district court first its standard of review.its decision makes clear that the district court made determinations that plaintiffs statistics raised common questions of fact or law only after it rigorously analyzed them,probing significantly behind the pleadings and resolving facts necessary to make determinations on rule a.
discussing the proper standard for evaluating the statistics,the district court said it rejected a merits evaluation of the evidence but had to view the statistical evidence and testimony through the proper lens of the standards applicable to a class certification motion.dukes,at.though noting it would not decide the actual merits of the claims,the court did delve into the substance of the expert testimony to the extent necessary to determine if it wa s sufficiently probative of an inference of discrimination to create a common question as to the existence of a pattern and practice of gender discrimination at.id.this is the precise inquiry that cases such as ipo have required,and it clearly meets the standard we outline above,particularly given the depth of the district court review,the evidentiary posture of the case as a title vii pattern and practice case,and the underlying procedural standard where the district court here was reviewing evidence under rule a,to raise a common question,rather than,like the cases cites,rule b,to determine predominance.see hnot,at.
in addition to formulating a review that complied with falcon and our precedent,the district court,contrary to claims,did not improperly rely on cases the second circuit overruled in ipo.specifically,cites visa check and caridad as decisions ipo rejected,noting the district court supposed reliance on this reasoning renders its decision error.as an initial matter,the district court did not cite visa check at all.see dukes,passim.while it did cite to caridad,nothing about its citation to caridad was erroneous.
the district court cited caridad five times.two instances of this reliance can be immediately set aside as unproblematic because they relied on caridad holding that excessive subjectivity in corporate policies can contribute to a finding of commonality.dukes,at.ipo neither addressed nor overruled this holding in caridad,and it still remains controlling authority in the second circuit.hnot,at.a third citation to caridad supported the district court statement that,although some inquiry into the substance of a case may be necessary to ascertain satisfaction of the commonality and typicality requirements of rule a,it is improper to advance a decision on the merits to the class certification stage.dukes,at internal quotation marks omitted citing caridad,at.this statement is entirely consistent with falcon,our precedent,and our ruling today.the two other citations to caridad equally show that the district court did not adopt the some showing standard that the second circuit properly rejected.instead,the district court refused to consider the would not conclusively find whether had it analyzed the evidence to the extent,under rule a,that it had to determine whether there are questions of law or fact common to the class.a dukes,at 
critically,the district court did not shy away from issues overlapping with the merits rather it devoted fifteen pages of its opinion to probing the parties statistics.the district court merely refused to decide the underlying merits themselves and examined evidence only to the extent necessary to satisfy itself under rule a that plaintiffs raised common questions.in doing so,it joined dozens of other district courts in this circuit that have engaged the proper analysis,all using different wording,but all probing behind the pleadings to make determinations on the rule requirements.see,in re cooper.sec,bishop,llc,d,alexander jbc legal group,westways world travel,at.
turning to the factual assertions in plaintiffs evidence,the court made a preliminary determination,based on the following largely uncontested statistics 
w omen working in stores are paid less than men in every region,that pay disparities exist in most job categories,that the salary gap widens over time even for men and women hired into the same jobs at the same time,that women take longer to enter into management positions,and that the higher one looks in the organization the lower the percentage of women.
dukes,at.importantly,and as instructed by falcon,these factual determinations were arrived at after looking beyond the pleadings to plaintiffs expert deposition.id.
correctly noting that descriptive statistics do not address causation,the district court then analyzed not the pleadings,but plaintiffs and statistics,finding,in short,all of drogin regressions show that gender is a statistically significant variable in accounting for the salary differentials between female class members and male employees at stores.id.at.
the court specifically analyzed whether aggregation of statistics for regional units was proper or whether was correct to insist upon a evaluation.the district court first stated the relevant the proper test of whether workforce statistics should be viewed at the macro regional or micro store or level depends largely on the similarity of the employment practices,and the interchange of employees,at the various facilities.id.at citation omitted.it continued,drogin contends that it is proper to conduct the analysis on a regional level because the subjective in compensation and promotions takes place within parameters and guidelines that are highly uniform plaintiffs also have shown,as discussed above,that the primary salary,store managers,experience frequent relocation among the various stores.id.at.
on appeal,contends that the district court erred by not finding statistical evidence more persuasive than plaintiffs evidence because,according to,its analysis was conducted.however,contrary to characterization of its analysis,and the dissent concerns regarding statistical aggregation own research was not conducted at the individual store level.joan haworth,expert,did not conduct a analysis instead she reviewed data at the level by comparing departments to analyze the pay differential between male and female hourly employees moreover,our task here is to determine whether the district court abused its discretion in finding that,based on all the evidence presented,there existed common questions of fact sufficient to justify class certification.see gonzales free speech,cir armstrong,at.we are not to the relative strength or persuasiveness of the commonality evidence ourselves.thus,even if we were to find,based on an independent review of the record,that statistical evidence was more persuasive than plaintiffs which we do not,in any alone would not allow us to find that the district court improperly relied on drogin testimony as a valid component of its commonality analysis or that the district court erred in its ultimate conclusion that the commonality prerequisite was satisfied.that the jury might later find statistical evidence more persuasive does not detract from the district court determination,after extensive review,that drogin regional analysis raises common issues appropriate for class adjudication.
here,again,the district court followed the supreme court guidance to thoughtfully probe behind the pleadings,falcon,at,and did not abuse its discretion when it relied on drogin use and interpretation of statistical data as a valid component of its determination that plaintiffs raised common questions.it considered challenges to drogin statistics and made the specific determination that the court is not persuaded that drogin aggregated statistical analysis should be rejected because he did not choose to utilize the chow test,as had urged.dukes,at.in other words,for the purposes of class certification,the district court reasonably made the determination to credit plaintiffs statistics.
also claims the district court erred in determining that provided little or no proper legal or factual challenge to drogin analysis and that,contrary to contention,haworth store manager survey was stricken for failing to satisfy the standards of rules and of did not undermine or contradict drogin evidence.
in rejecting the inclusion of store manager surveys as a challenge to drogin statistics because they were not based on a scientifically valid reasoning or methodology,dukes ii,at discussing rules and,see daubert,at,the court noted that even if the evidence were included,t he survey would not provide sufficient additional weight to defendant challenge to drogin analysis to sway the court from its conclusion that his testimony supports an inference of discrimination,and thus the existence of substantial questions common to the class,dukes ii,at emphasis added.in so ruling,the district court went even further into the merits than necessary to make a reasoned,justifiable determination,after proper review under the correct standard,that plaintiffs claims were appropriate for class adjudication due to common questions.
thus,because drogin adequately explained,and the district court rigorously analyzed,why his statistical method best reflected the alleged discrimination,the court did not abuse its discretion when it credited drogin analysis of statistical evidence of common discrimination questions.nor did the district court abuse its discretion when it concluded that drogin analysis supported plaintiffs contention that there is a common core of facts flowing from corporate structure and policies that affects class members generally with regard to their discrimination claims.while plaintiffs and disagree on whose findings are more persuasive,the disagreement is not one of whether plaintiffs have asserted common questions of law or fact.falcon,at.the disagreement is the common question,and deciding which side has been more persuasive is an issue for the next phase of the litigation.requiring even more findings and further analysis from the district court would be to force a trial on the merits at the certification stage.
finally,and discussed further below,the district court review of statistics showing discrimination regarding promotions was also not an abuse of discretion.plaintiffs and defendant disagree over whether drogin analysis of internal promotion data was proper.specifically,both sides agreed that actual applicant flow data for promotions during the class period was limited and contained significant gaps.dukes,at.drogin statistics estimated the applicant flow by tabulating the incumbents in historical feeder jobs for each promotion.id.argued that the data,while limited,is nonetheless sufficient to justify an extrapolation for all job openings during the entire class period.id.
the district court,addressing this statistical dispute,found plaintiffs statistics sufficient to create an inference of discrimination.id.at.in doing so,the district court found drogin reasoning and methodology valid and applicable in the case.while the court noted in passing that drogin statistics were reasonable,the court also,and more appropriately,stated that it is well recognized that where actual applicant flow data is inadequate or unavailable,other measures of applicant but not limited to feeder pools are deemed acceptable so long as they are used in a reliable manner.id.at.in doing so the district court cited an evidence treatise,ninth circuit precedent,and a district court case that had accepted the same type of feeder pool methodology in a dispute of the very same.drogin and haworth.id.at citing hemmings tidyman,cir paetzold and willborn,the statistics of discrimination stender lucky stores.
thus,properly considering drogin statistics,the court made a determination on the applicant pool data.it found that defendant assertion that its approach is necessarily superior does not withstand scrutiny.rather,defendant arguments,which go to the weight of the evidence,the persuasiveness on the merits,merely highlight the presence of a significant issue affecting all class members which supports,rather than defeats,granting class certification.id.at.this determination was thus made after a rigorous analysis of the parties statistical claims.
in short,the district court stated the legal standard,analyzed plaintiffs and competing claims to the propriety of aggregating statistics on a regional level and addressing missing applicant flow data,noted plaintiffs have shown reasons to accept their statistics,dismissed statistical challenges,demonstrated these finding were supported by relevant ninth circuit precedent and an identical dispute involving the same two experts,rejected reliance on a district court case purportedly explaining why the statistical analysis was proper,and,finally,determined that at the class certification stage all of this analysis was sufficient to support drogin analysis and raise questions of law or fact common to the class.this searching analysis was solid,well founded and in no way an abuse of discretion.
anecdotal evidence 
circumstantial and anecdotal evidence of discrimination is commonly used in title vii pattern and practice cases to bolster statistical proof by bringing the cold numbers convincingly to life.teamsters,at see also rudebusch hughes,cir.contends that the district court erred by concluding that the anecdotal evidence,presented by plaintiffs in the form of sworn declarations,supported a finding of commonality maintains that the declarations depict a handful of widely divergent events that can not be deemed probative or representative of discrimination in pay or promotions.
in their declarations,the potential class members testified to being paid less than similarly situated men,being denied or delayed in receiving promotions in a disproportionate manner when compared with similarly situated men,working in an atmosphere with a strong corporate culture of discrimination,and being subjected to various individual sexist acts.the district court credited this evidence.
argues that declarations can not sufficiently represent a class of this size.however,we find no authority requiring or even suggesting that a plaintiff class submit a specific number of declarations for such evidence to have any value.moreover,the district court did not state that this anecdotal evidence provided sufficient proof to establish commonality by itself,but merely noted such evidence provides support for plaintiffs contention that commonality is present.see dukes,at this anecdotal evidence,in combination with the other evidence previously discussed,further supports an inference that policies and procedures have the effect of discriminating against plaintiffs in a common manner.because the combination of these declarations and plaintiffs other evidence,discussed below,raise an inference of common discriminatory experiences,the district court did not abuse its discretion when it considered plaintiffs anecdotal evidence 
finally,in arguing against certification based on affidavits,plaintiffs personal allegations,statistics,and expert testimony,the dissent intersperses references of falcon immediately with discussion of cooper federal reserve bank,d,claiming individual stories do not constitute significant proof that has adopted a general policy of discrimination or that such a policy prevails at.dissent at.this criticism,and particularly its temporary suspension of consideration of the statistical evidence,is indicative of the dissent repeated attempts to go beyond the supreme court concern with the need for more precise pleadings in class actions,falcon,at citing johnson,at,and the court command that sometimes it may be necessary for the court to probe behind the pleadings before coming to rest on the certification question,id.at,in an effort to reframe the question as one on whether plaintiffs can actually succeed on the merits.eisen,at explaining that the plaintiffs likelihood of success on the merits is not part of deciding whether certification is proper.
contrary to the dissent proposed standard,plaintiffs here need not establish a prima facie case on the merits.dissent at.class certification in cooper had already taken place and,in fact,the case had gone through a trial.at.the decision for the supreme court was whether the class loss at trial precluded a class member from maintaining his own,separate civil action subsequent to the loss.id.at.this is an entirely different posture than the present case presents,and the standard for winning a claim under mcdonnell douglas green,d,is,of course,different than that for certifying a class action.see cooper,at falcon,u.at.
subjective decision making 
as discussed above,the district court found substantial evidence suggesting common pay and promotion policies among many stores.see dukes,at.the court also reasoned that decision to permit its managers to utilize subjectivity in interpreting those policies offers additional support for a commonality finding.see id.relying on sperling,challenges the latter conclusion,contending that managers discretionary authority does not support a finding of commonality because d ecentralized,discretionary decisionmaking is not inherently discriminatory.
it is well established that subjective decision making is a ready mechanism for discrimination and that courts should scrutinize it carefully.sengupta,cir internal quotation marks omitted.is correct that discretionary decision making by itself is insufficient to meet plaintiffs burden.the district court recognized this,noting that managerial discretion is but one of several factors that supported a finding of commonality.see dukes,at and while the presence of excessive subjectivity,alone,does not necessarily create a common question of fact,where,as here,such subjectivity is part of a consistent corporate policy and supported by other evidence giving rise to an inference of discrimination,courts have not hesitated to find that commonality is satisfied.
is incorrect,however,that decentralized,subjective decision making can not contribute to a common question of fact regarding the existence of discrimination.see falcon,at.indeed,courts from around the country have found a llegations of similar discriminatory employment practices,such as the use of entirely subjective personnel processes that operate to discriminate,sufficient to satisfy the commonality and typicality requirements of rule a.shipes trinity,cir see also supra note and cases cited therein.
plaintiffs produced substantial evidence of centralized firmwide culture and policies,see dukes,at,thus providing a nexus between the subjective decision making and the considerable statistical evidence demonstrating a pattern of lower pay and fewer promotions for female employees.see id.at see also reid lockheed martin aeronautics,subjective decision making may give rise to an inference of discrimination where evidence shows a nexus between decision making and discrimination.therefore,for the reasons stated above,there was no abuse of discretion in determining that subjective decisionmaking policy provides support for plaintiffs contention that commonality exists among potential class members.
commonality conclusion 
the district court analysis of rule a complies with the standard the supreme court has set down and we have explained today for a district court adjudicating a motion for class certification.plaintiffs factual evidence,expert opinions,statistical evidence,and anecdotal evidence provide sufficient support to raise the common question whether female employees nationwide were subjected to a single set of corporate policies not merely a number of independent discriminatory acts that may have worked to unlawfully discriminate against them in violation of title vii.evidence of subjective policies suggests a common legal or factual question regarding whether policies or practices are discriminatory.many other courts have reached the same conclusion based on similar evidence.see,staton,at shipes,at cox am.cast iron pipe,cir segar smith.
typicality 
as an initial matter,plaintiffs contend that has waived a challenge to the district court typicality finding by failing to offer specific objections to the district court typicality determination.however,because refers,somewhat obliquely,to the typicality factor in its opening brief and because typicality and commonality are similar and tend to merge,see falcon,at we conclude that did not waive its opportunity to challenge the district court findings with regard to typicality.
thus,although did not raise a specific challenge,it nevertheless raised a general objection to the district court conclusion that plaintiffs evidence satisfies the typicality requirement.as discussed below,to satisfy the typicality,plaintiffs must demonstrate that their claims and their class representatives are sufficiently typical of the class.
plaintiffs claims are sufficiently typical 
rule a requires that the claims or defenses of the representative parties are typical of the claims or defenses of the class.a.we stated in hanlon that,u nder the rule permissive standards,representative claims are typical if they are reasonably coextensive with those of absent class members they need not be substantially identical.at see also staton,at stating that a class representative from each job category for each type of discrimination claim alleged is not necessary.
thus,we must consider whether the injury allegedly suffered by the named plaintiffs and the rest of the class resulted from the same allegedly discriminatory practice.see staton,at.even though individual employees in different stores with different managers may have received different levels of pay or may have been denied promotion or promoted at different rates,because the discrimination they claim to have suffered occurred through alleged common,excessively subjective decision making in a corporate culture of uniformity and gender district court did not abuse its discretion by finding that their claims are sufficiently typical to satisfy rule a.
plaintiffs representatives are sufficiently typical of the class 
typicality requires that the named plaintiffs be members of the class they represent.see falcon,at.there is no dispute that the class representatives are typical of the hourly class members,because almost all of the class representatives hold hourly positions.instead,contends that the class representatives are not typical of all female managers because only one of the class representatives holds a salaried management position,and she holds a somewhat position.
however,because all female employees faced the same alleged discrimination,the lack of a class representative for each management category does not undermine plaintiffs certification goal.see hartman duffey,an employee can challenge discrimination in different job categories where the primary practices used to discriminate in the different categories are themselves similar.while it may be prudent to have the class divided into represented by a named plaintiff from each of the differing job categories,it would not be necessary to the validity of the class certification to do so.paxton union bank,cir typicality is not defeated because of the varied promotional opportunities at issue,or the differing qualifications of the plaintiffs and class members.
in addition,because the range of managers in the proposed class is limited to managers working in stores and excludes those at regional or national offices,it is not an excessively diverse class a named plaintiff occupying a,salaried,management position is sufficient to satisfy the permissive typicality requirement.staton,at recognizing that,u nder the rule permissive standards,plaintiffs are not required to offer a class representative for each type of discrimination claim alleged quoting hanlon,at.
because plaintiffs claims and plaintiffs representatives are sufficiently typical of the class,the district court acted within its discretion when it found that plaintiffs satisfied the typicality prerequisite.
adequate representation 
rule a permits certification of a class action only if the representative parties will fairly and adequately protect the interests of the class.a.this factor requires that the proposed representative plaintiffs do not have conflicts of interest with the proposed class,and that plaintiffs are represented by qualified and competent counsel.see hanlon,at see also molski gleich,cir.
before the district court,argued that plaintiffs can not satisfy this factor because of a conflict of interest between female managers who are both plaintiff class members and agents of.relying on staton,the district court recognized that courts need not deny certification of an employment class simply because the class includes both supervisory and employees.see dukes,at see also staton,at.this decision was not an abuse of discretion.finally,because does not challenge the district court finding that plaintiffs class representatives and counsel are adequate,we need not analyze this factor.
commonality,typicality,and manageability of promotion claims 
the district court certified plaintiffs promotion claims for injunctive and declaratory relief and punitive damages,but concluded that manageability concerns required that any lost pay remedy on plaintiffs promotion claim would be limited to that subset of the class for whom objective applicant data exists.dukes,at.objects to the certification of plaintiffs promotion claims,even with this limitation,on commonality and manageability grounds.plaintiffs,on the other hand,object to the district court limitation of eligibility for back pay to positions for which objective applicant data exist.
title vii pattern and practice class actions frequently include both salary and promotion claims.see,bazemore friday,d per curiam cooper,at.as discussed above,the district court found that plaintiffs here have provided evidence sufficient to support their contention that corporate practices and excessive subjectivity in personnel decisions,gender stereotyping,and maintenance of a strong corporate both compensation and promotion of all plaintiffs in a common manner.dukes,at.although there may be some variation among individual promotion decisions,variation does not prevent class certification of common issues of fact.see hanlon,at rule a has been construed permissively.all questions of fact and law need not be common to satisfy the rule.given its findings regarding companywide promotion policies and minimum guidelines,see dukes,at,the district court did not abuse its discretion by concluding that there was a sufficient common factual basis among putative class members promotion claims to satisfy rule a.
we also affirm the district court conclusion that a back pay remedy for promotion claims would be manageable only with respect to those positions for which objective applicant data is available to document class member interest.dukes,at.extensive database containing information on each employee individually with respect to job history,seniority,job review ratings,and many other factors,see id.at,would enable a determination of each class member qualifications for promotion without the need for potentially unmanageable individualized hearings.the district court did not abuse its discretion by limiting eligibility for back pay,however,because allowing class members to demonstrate post hoc their previous interest in promotions might indeed be unmanageable.see id.at.
rule a conclusion 
based on the evidence before the district court,which it rigorously analyzed pursuant to falcon,at,and the standard herein described,the district court did not abuse its discretion when it found that the rule a elements were satisfied.
as mentioned earlier,plaintiffs moved to certify the class under rule b,which requires showing that the party opposing the class has acted or refused to act on grounds that apply generally to the class,so that final injunctive relief is appropriate respecting the class as a whole.b the district court agreed with plaintiffs.see dukes,at.argues the district court merely paid lip service to rule b and erred in certifying the class under rule b because claims for monetary relief predominate over claims for injunctive and declaratory relief.
rule b is not appropriate for all classes and does not extend to cases in which the appropriate final relief relates exclusively or predominantly to money damages.b advisory committee note to,see also zinser,at class certification under rule b is appropriate only where the primary relief sought is declaratory or injunctive.an interpretation of rule b that prevented any claim for monetary relief would render this advisory committee requirement redundant or irrelevant.
we first turn to the appropriate standard for determining when monetary relief predominates over declaratory and injunctive relief and therefore precludes certification of a rule b class.we have previously joined the second circuit in adopting a test that focuses on the plaintiffs subjective intent in bringing a lawsuit.see molski,at robinson commuter,cir.in contrast,several other circuits use the incidental damages standard that was first enunciated by the fifth circuit in allison citgo petroleum,cir.see,reeb ohio dep t of rehab,cir murray auslander,cir lemon int l union of operating eng rs local,cir.under the allison approach,monetary relief predominates over other forms of relief unless it is incidental to requested injunctive or declaratory relief.see allison,at.
we see no need to employ either approach,which are both,essentially,glosses on the text of the advisory committee note statement that rule b does not extend to cases in which the appropriate final relief relates exclusively or predominantly to money damages.defines predominant as having superior strength,influence,or authority prevailing.collegiate dictionary ed.to be certified under rule b,therefore,a class must seek only monetary damages that are not superior in strength,influence,or authority to injunctive and declaratory relief.
an analysis of a plaintiff subjective intent in bringing a suit,as required by the standard set forth in molski,is,at best,an incomplete method for answering this question.by eschewing consideration of the practical impact of a request for monetary relief on the litigation itself,the sole emphasis on the plaintiff intent ignores important indicators of the strength,influence,and authority of a request for specific monetary relief.in short,molski focus on subjective intent and its concomitant failure to consider the pragmatic impact of a request for monetary relief render it fatally flawed.
the molski approach is troubling for the additional reason that it requires courts to engage in a nebulous and imprecise inquiry into the plaintiffs intent in bringing a particular suit.only in those cases in which a request for injunctive relief is obviously a ruse will this inquiry provide a clear answer.more often than not,we suspect that the answer will be equivocal and,therefore,essentially an entirely discretionary one.
although the standard set forth in allison is an objective one that does consider the practical effect of a request for monetary damages,it suffers from a different deficiency.by requiring monetary relief to be no more than incidental to injunctive or declaratory relief,the allison approach is in direct conflict with the text of the advisory committee note,which forbids certification under rule b if monetary relief is the predominant form of relief.see at.predominant is not synonymous with more than incidental.as a result,the allison approach would preclude the certification of some rule b classes that the drafters of the rules intended to allow.
allison standard also usurps the district courts authority granted by rule to rigorously analyze the case,probe behind the pleadings if necessary,and exercise its own discretion within the framework of the rules in determining whether the action is to be so maintained.id.at dennis,dissenting see also robinson,at describing allison incidental damages test as a approach.such a limitation is in direct conflict with the federal rules intention that district courts be afforded discretion.the predominance test suggested by the advisory committee note,by contrast,is consistent with the wide discretion given to district courts in making the class certification decision and accomplishing title vii remedial objectives.
to the extent molski required the district court to inquire only into the intent of the plaintiffs and focus primarily on determining whether reasonable plaintiffs would bring suit to obtain injunctive or declaratory relief even in the absence of a possible monetary recovery,see molski,at,it is overruled.in light of the inadequacy of both the allison and molski approaches,we adopt instead the standard that rule b drafters straightforwardly indicated rule b certification is not appropriate where monetary relief is predominant over injunctive relief or declaratory relief.to determine whether monetary relief predominates,a district court should consider,on a basis,the objective effect of the relief sought on the litigation.see allison,at.factors such as whether the monetary relief sought determines the key procedures that will be used,whether it introduces new and significant legal and factual issues,whether it requires individualized hearings,and whether its size and measured by recovery per class particular due process and manageability concerns would all be relevant,though no single factor would be determinative.
under this standard,as discussed more fully below,the district court decision to include claims for back pay in a class certified under rule b was not an abuse of its discretion.on the other hand,the district court did abuse its discretion by failing to analyze whether certifying plaintiffs punitive damages claims under rule b caused monetary damages to predominate,notwithstanding its decision to require notice and an opportunity for plaintiffs to of the punitive damages claims.
evidence does not undermine plaintiffs claim that injunctive and declaratory relief predominate 
first asserts that the district court failed to even evaluate rule b requirement that the challenged conduct be generally applicable to the class.contention that its unrebutted statistics demonstrate that there is no evidence of pervasive discrimination that would justify injunctive relief and that,therefore,the challenged conduct does not affect all members,is simply not persuasive.as explained above,evidence was rebutted by plaintiffs to the extent that plaintiffs evidence and theories remain viable at this analysis stage.further,the issue before us is whether monetary relief predominates,not whether plaintiffs will ultimately prevail.
the large size of the class does not undermine plaintiffs claim that injunctive and declaratory relief predominate 
contends that monetary claims necessarily predominate because this case involves claims that may amount to billions of dollars.however,such a large amount is principally a function of size,and the predominance test turns on the primary goal and nature of the the theoretical or possible size of the total damages award.a comparison between the amount of monetary damages available for each plaintiff and the importance of injunctive and declaratory relief for each is far more relevant to establishing predominance than the total size of a potential monetary award for the class as a whole.as the district court stated,focusing on the potential size of a punitive damage award would have the perverse effect of making it more difficult to certify a class the more egregious the defendant conduct or the larger the defendant.such a result hardly squares with the remedial purposes of title vii.dukes,at.because has not shown that the size of the monetary request undermines plaintiffs claim that injunctive and declaratory relief predominate,we find that argument fails.
request for back pay does not undermine plaintiffs claim that injunctive and declaratory relief predominate 
asserts that plaintiffs request for back pay weighs against certification because it proves that claims for monetary relief predominate.the district court reasoned that back pay is recoverable as an equitable,remedy in employment class actions notwithstanding its monetary nature.dukes,at.contends that the district court erred by failing to recognize that back pay,whether equitable or not,is still a form of monetary relief.
argument is without merit.although the circuits have adopted different tests for determining when monetary relief predominates,every circuit to have addressed the issue has acknowledged that rule b does allow for some claims for monetary relief more to the point,it is equally well accepted,even by circuits that are generally restrictive in certifying classes seeking monetary damages under rule b,that a request for back pay in a title vii case is fully compatible with the certification of a rule b class.see,allison,at see also thorn,at cooper,at coleman,at.as the fifth circuit stated in allison,final injunctive relief was appropriate and the defendant liability for back pay was rooted in grounds applicable to all members of the defined class.under these circumstances the award of back pay,as one element of the equitable remedy,conflicts in no way with the limitations of rule b.at internal quotation marks omitted 
courts have provided two justifications for the conclusion that a request for back pay is consistent with certification under rule b.first,appellate courts have noted that,in the title vii context,awards of backpay do not predominate over the injunctive remedies available because the calculation of back pay generally involves relatively un complicated factual determinations and few individualized issues.thorn,at alterations in original quoting coleman,at.the second rationale is that back pay is an integral component of title vii make whole remedial scheme,see allison,at,a scheme to which the drafters of the federal rules of civil procedure clearly intended rule b to apply.b advisory committee note to,at stating that the principal category of cases certifiable under rule b are actions in the field where a party is charged with discriminating unlawfully against a class.
we find this reasoning persuasive and therefore join the consensus view that a request for back pay in a title vii case is fully consistent with the certification of a rule b class action accordingly,we hold that the district court did not abuse its discretion when it concluded,like many courts before it,that this discrimination class action was certifiable under rule b notwithstanding plaintiffs prayer for back pay relief.
monetary relief may predominate with respect to plaintiffs bifurcated punitive dam ages claims 
in determining whether appropriate final relief relates exclusively or predominantly to money damages.b,advisory committee note to,at,claims for punitive damages weigh against certification under rule b because punitive damages are,of course,neither injunctive nor declaratory relief.the view that punitive damages can never be awarded consistent with rule b,however,has not been adopted by this circuit on the other hand,this court also has not approved class certification under rule b involving the potential for substantial punitive damages.
to decide whether certification under rule b is appropriate,per the standard described in part ii,a district court must squarely face and resolve the question of whether the monetary damages sought by the plaintiff class predominate over the injunctive and declaratory relief.if so,then the court may either deny certification under rule b or bifurcate the proceedings by certifying a rule b class for equitable relief and a separate rule b class for damages.see molski,at citing jefferson ingersoll int l,cir 
here,the district court certified plaintiffs punitive damages claims as a separate class,but did so under rule b rather than rule b,exercising its discretion to impose additional requirements for notice and the opportunity to of this separate rule b class.see dukes,at n otice and the opportunity to can be provided in a b class action and shall be provided to the plaintiff class with respect to plaintiffs claim for punitive damages.as the district court noted,its discretion to require notice and the opportunity to in a rule b class action is well established.id.citing in re monumental life ins,at molski,at robinson,at jefferson,at 
notwithstanding its decision to require notice and an opportunity for,the district court abused its discretion by certifying the punitive damages claims under rule b without first undertaking an analysis of whether certification of the claim for punitive damages in addition to injunctive and declaratory relief as well as back pay rendered the final relief predominantly related to monetary damages.see.b,advisory committee note to,at.although notice and an opportunity for plaintiffs to of the punitive damages claims alleviated some of the concerns regarding cohesiveness and due process that substantial punitive damages claims potentially raise,requiring these procedures does not remove the district court obligation to determine whether each of the requirements of certification under either rule b or b is met.
on remand,the district court must determine whether certification under rule b of the punitive damages claims would cause monetary relief to predominate.as discussed above,the district court should not limit its inquiry to the former molski factors,but should also consider any other factors relevant to whether monetary relief predominates when determining if certification under rule b is appropriate we note at least four factors present in this case that are relevant to the question whether monetary relief predominates,but the district court need not limit its inquiry to these factors alone.
first,the inclusion of a punitive damages request means that the key issue in this case,liability,will be decided by a jury,rather than a judge.this significant procedural change weighs in favor of finding that monetary relief would predominate if the punitive damages claims are certified,although it is not dispositive 
second,plaintiffs request for punitive damages introduces a new and substantial factual issue.to recover punitive damages,plaintiffs must show not only that engaged in a pattern or practice of discrimination,but also that it did so with malice or with reckless indifference to the federally protected rights of plaintiffs.b.this additional factual question will likely require the plaintiffs to introduce significant evidence and legal argument that would not have otherwise been necessary the need for such extra evidence and argument weighs in favor of a finding that monetary relief predominates.
third,the size of a potential punitive damages award,measured on an individual basis,could be quite significant.title vii permits a punitive damage award of up to per employee.see id.b.such a large potential award raises due process and manageability concerns.although the district court decision to provide notice and to class members alleviates some of these concerns,the size of the potential award per class member in this case militates in favor of a finding that monetary relief predominates,triggering the need for other safeguards applicable when a class is certified under rule b,rather than rule b.
finally,we note that,unlike in other punitive and compensatory damages cases,this case does not require individualized punitive damages determinations.plaintiffs theory of liability is a theory that is based on a company policy that allegedly affects all class members in a similar way.see allison,at leaving open the possibility that a punitive damage class could be certified under b where the plaintiffs challenge broad policies and practices and contend that each plaintiff was affected by th o se polices and practices in the same way.while this factor counsels against a finding that punitive damages predominate,it also is not necessarily dispositive.
in sum,we hold that the district court abused its discretion when it certified a rule b class including punitive damages without first undertaking a comprehensive analysis of whether the inclusion of such damages in this case causes monetary relief to predominate.to allow for further pertinent,we remand the certification of the bifurcated punitive damages claims to the district court to consider whether certification is proper under rule b.we decline to prejudge the outcome of this determination because the question of whether monetary relief predominates should be answered by the district court in the first instance,consistent with the federal rules intention to vest district courts with significant discretion.
if the district court concludes that the punitive damage class in this action can not be certified under rule b,it should also consider whether class certification of the punitive damages claims is appropriate under rule b.we and a number of other courts of appeals have endorsed such hybrid certification of rule b and rule b classes in one action,particularly in civil rights cases that may involve significant monetary damages.see,molski,at jefferson,at eubanks,at.
under this hybrid approach,the highly cohesive rule b phase of the proceedings,including liability,can be adjudicated without the costly class notice and process required under rule b.in order to protect the due process interests of absent class members,however,notice and is required for the rule b punitive damages proceedings.see.c,advisory committee note to amends.if a rule b class is certified in conjunction with a b class,the c b notice requirements must be satisfied as to the b class.emphasis added eubanks,at hybrid certification effectively grant s b protections at the monetary relief stage.diaz hillsborough county hosp,explaining that in stage i,the court will resolve liability using rule b procedures and,if liability is established,adjudicate damages using opt out procedures in rule b.this procedure retains the benefits of rule b and rule b for all parties,and promotes both ease of administration and the underlying principles of rule.see williams local,sheet metal workers int l ass n,explaining that the liability issue will be litigated first and,if the plaintiffs are successful,notice will be given for the damages proceeding.
we do not express a view on whether the punitive damages claims in this case meet the rule b requirements or,if so,how the district court should manage the class proceedings in order to comply with seventh amendment principles.we believe,however,that this might be a case in which d ivided certification also is worth consideration.jefferson,at.
class certification may not be proper as to class members who were not employees as of the date plaintiffs complaint was filed 
final contention is that,because a substantial number of the putative class members no longer work for,thus,no longer have standing to seek injunctive or declaratory relief can not possibly predominate over monetary relief for purposes of certifying this class under rule b.
we agree with to this extent those putative class members who were no longer employees at the time plaintiffs complaint was filed do not have standing to pursue injunctive or declaratory relief.see walsh.dep t of human,cir recognizing that former employees lack standing to seek injunctive relief because they would not stand to benefit from an injunction requiring the policies to cease at their former place of work aclu of lomax,cir when evaluating whether the standing elements are present,we must look at the facts as they exist at the time the complaint was filed.quoting lujan defenders of wildlife,d.under these circumstances,it is difficult to say that monetary relief does not predominate with respect to claims by plaintiffs who lack standing to seek injunctive or declaratory relief.
however,this does not mean that former employees are ineligible to receive any form of relief.although women who were not employed by as of june,the date on which the complaint was filed,do not have standing to seek injunctive or declaratory relief,they may be eligible to receive back pay and punitive damages.the district court may,in its discretion,certify a separate rule b class of former employees for back pay and punitive damages.
putative class members who were still employees as of june,do have standing to seek the injunctive and declaratory relief requested in the complaint see lomax,at.we are satisfied that class certification under rule b was not an abuse of discretion,at least as to those plaintiffs claims,for the reasons explained in parts.
in summary,we affirm the district court certification of a rule b class insofar as the class consists of current employees as of the date the complaint was filed,with respect to claims for injunctive relief,declaratory relief,and back pay.on remand,the district court should analyze whether certification under rule b or rule b is appropriate for the punitive damages claims and whether an additional class or classes may be appropriate under rule b with respect to the claims of former employees.the court may,if appropriate,certify an additional class or classes under rule b.
iv.class action can proceed in a way that is both manageable and in accordance with due process 
the district court was cognizant of the large size of the class when it concluded that the class size was not unmanageable.see dukes,at.indeed,the district court acknowledged that,w hile courts possess wide discretion to flexibly respond to manageability issues that may arise during the course of a class action,this court must be confident that such issues will not be of such a magnitude as to defy its ability to oversee this case in a responsible and reasonable manner.id.citation omitted.after giv ing these matters considerable thought and deliberation,the district court concluded that,with one minor exception the size of the class would not present undue obstacles to managing this class action.id.
to demonstrate the manageability of the class action,the district court outlined a trial plan based,in large part,on how other courts have handled similarly large and complex class action suits,supported by a number of businessrelated amici contend that at least some aspects of this trial plan violate their due process rights,as well as section g of title vii the rules enabling act and the supreme court decision in teamsters,at 
at this stage,we express no opinion regarding objections to the district court tentative trial plan or that trial plan itself,but simply note that,because there are a range of may or may not include the district court proposed course of would allow this class action to proceed in a manner that is both manageable and in accordance with due process,manageability concerns present no bar to class certification here.
for example,in hilao estate of marcos,cir,the district court employed the following procedure to determine the amount of compensatory damages due the plaintiffs in a large class action 
in all,claims were received.the district court ruled of these claims to be facially invalid,leaving claims.from these,a list of claims was randomly selected by computer.this number of randomly selected claims was chosen on the basis of the testimony of james dannemiller,an expert on statistics,who testified that the examination of a random sample of claims would achieve a percent statistical probability that the same percentage determined to be valid among the examined claims would be applicable to the totality of claims filed.
the district court then appointed sol schreiber as a special master and a expert under rule of the federal rules of evidence.schreiber supervised the taking of depositions of the randomly selected claimants 
id.at subheading omitted.schreiber then reviewed the claim s,and h e recommended that claims of the in the sample be found not valid.id.at.schreiber then recommended the amount of damages to be awarded to the remaining claimants.id.at.
based on his recommendation that of the claims in the random sample be rejected as invalid,he recommended the application of a invalidity rate to the remaining claims.
he recommended that the award to the class be determined by multiplying the number of valid remaining claims by the average award recommended for the claims 
by adding the recommended awards schreiber arrived at a recommendation for a total compensatory damage award 
a jury trial on compensatory damages was then held hilao statistical expert testified that the selection of the random sample met the standards of inferential statistics,that the successful efforts to locate and obtain testimony from the claimants in the random sample were of the highest standards in his profession,that the procedures followed conformed to the standards of inferential statistics,and that the injuries of the claimants were representative of the class as a whole.testimony from the claimants and their witnesses was introduced.schreiber testified as to his recommendations,and his report was supplied to the jury.the jury was instructed that it could accept,modify or reject schreiber recommendations and that it could independently,on the basis of the evidence of the claimants,reach its own judgment as to the actual damages of those claimants and of the aggregate damages suffered by the class as a whole.
the jury deliberated for five days before reaching a verdict.contrary to the master recommendations,the jury found against only two of the claimants in the random sample.as to the sample claims,the jury generally adopted the master recommendations,although it did not follow his recommendations in instances.as to the claims of the remaining class members,the jury adopted the awards recommended by the master.the district court subsequently entered judgment for of the claimants in the sample in the amounts awarded by the jury,and for the remaining plaintiffs in the amounts awarded by the jury,to be divided pro rata.
id.at subheadings and footnotes omitted.
on appeal,the hilao court was presented with some of the same objections to its trial plan as presents here after a lengthy discussion,however,the hilao court rejected these challenges and approved of the trial plan,addressing the due process issue as follows 
while the district court methodology in determining valid claims is unorthodox,it can be justified by the extraordinarily unusual nature of this case.due process,unlike some legal rules,is not a technical conception with a fixed content unrelated to time,place and circumstances.cafeteria and restaurant workers union,local mcelroy,d.
the interest of the defendant that is affected is at best an interest in not paying damages for any invalid claims the statistical method used by the district court obviously presents a somewhat greater risk of error in comparison to an adversarial adjudication of each claim,since the former method requires a probabilistic prediction albeit an extremely accurate one of how many of the total claims are invalid hilao interest in the use of the statistical method,on the other hand,is enormous,since adversarial resolution of each class member claim would pose insurmountable practical hurdles.the ancillary interest of the judiciary in the procedure is obviously also substantial,since individual adversarial determinations of claim validity would clog the docket of the district court for years.under the balancing test set forth in mathews eldridge,d,and connecticut doehr,d,the procedure used by the district court did not violate due process.
hilao,at footnote and citations omitted.
because we see no reason why a similar procedure to that used in hilao could not be employed in this case we conclude that there exists at least one method of managing this large class action that,albeit somewhat imperfect,nonetheless protects the due process rights of all involved parties accordingly,we find no reason to find this class unsuited to class certification.
conclusion 
for the reasons set forth above,we hold that the district court acted within its broad discretion in concluding that it would be better to handle some parts of this case as a class action instead of clogging the federal courts with innumerable individual suits litigating the same issues repeatedly.the district court did not abuse its discretion in finding the requirements of rule satisfied with respect to those plaintiffs who were still employees on june,and with respect to claims for injunctive and declaratory relief and back pay.given the tentative nature of the district court trial plan,we decline to address due process and manageability challenges to that plan.we note,however,that the district court has the discretion to modify or decertify the class should it become unmanageable.although the size of this class action is large,mere size does not render a case unmanageable.
we deny plaintiffs,because the district court did not abuse its discretion when it found that back pay for promotions may be limited to those plaintiffs for whom proof of qualification and interest exists.finally,we must reiterate that our findings relate only to class action procedural questions we neither analyze nor reach the merits of plaintiffs allegations of gender discrimination.
affirmed in part remanded in part.each party to bear its own costs on appeal.
the majority and the dissent have written scholarly and complete explanations of their positions.what the length of their opinions may mask is the simplicity of the majority unremarkable holding 
current female employees may maintain a rule b class action against their employer,seeking injunctive and declaratory relief and back pay on behalf of all the current female employees,when they challenge as discriminatory the effects of their employer policies.
if the employer had female employees,i doubt that any of my colleagues would question the certification of such a class.certification does not become an abuse of discretion merely because the class has members.
i therefore concur fully in the majority opinion.
no court has ever certified a class like this one,until now.and with good reason.in this case,six women who have worked in thirteen of stores seek to represent every woman who has worked in those stores over the course of the last class estimated in to include more than million women.according to the plaintiffs theory,has a corporate policy of discrimination which it implements through the discretionary decisions of store managers,resulting in injury in violation of title vii of the civil rights act of.
but while the six plaintiffs allege they have suffered discrimination at the hands of a few individual store managers,they fail to present s ignificant proof of a discriminatory policy or practice of that would make it possible to conclude that million members of the proposed class suffered similar discrimination.see.of sw.falcon,d.without evidence of a discriminatory policy implemented by managers through their discretionary decisions,or other evidence of a discriminatory practice,there is nothing to bind these purported million claims together in a single action.see id.at.
then there is the problem of individual hearings.under title vii,has the right to raise affirmative defenses as to each class member claim.this means the court must allow up to million individual determinations of liability.on its face,a class action of this sort makes no sense.
in certifying the class despite these obstacles,the district court abused its discretion.in affirming most of the district court determinations,the majority compounds the error,and creates a precedent for class action suits that departs from the language and intent of rule of the federal rules of civil procedure,ignores supreme court mandates,and neglects the rights of defendants.i respectfully dissent.
a brief review of the facts highlights the obstacles to certifying this class.is the largest private employer in the world,dukes stores,dukes i,and the largest retail chain in the united states.at,when this suit was filed,employed over retail employees in hundreds of different jobs at roughly stores nationwide.
corporate structure is complex.the company divides its retail operation into seven divisions,six for and one for sam club those divisions are split into separate regions,each of which is overseen by a regional vice president.the regions are further divided into roughly individual districts,which are headed by district managers.each of regions consists of to stores,with employing anywhere from to people per store.
individual stores are run by store managers who are responsible for hiring and promoting the hourly employees in their respective stores.at each store,assistant managers report to store managers these management positions are salaried,and employees may be promoted to these positions after first working as,management trainees.retail employees work hourly in different departments and different job classifications these positions include cashiers,associates,team leads,and department managers.
gives its managers substantial discretion in both pay and promotion decisions.store managers make pay decisions for hourly employees,subject only to a general pay structure.id.at.store managers are allowed to depart from the minimum start rates,within a two dollar per hour range,without being constrained by objective criteria and with limited oversight.id.at.also allows store managers to increase pay for exceptional performance.id.at.district managers set the pay for salaried employees.they have discretion to set pay rates with little guidance and limited oversight.id.
managers likewise have substantial discretion in making promotion decisions.has corporate guidelines regarding entrance requirements for its management trainee program,but individual store managers may apply their own subjective criteria in selecting employees who will be invited to enter the program.id.at.decisions regarding advancement into the highest managerial positions assistant manager,and store manager are similarly based on subjective assessments beyond adherence to corporate minimum guidelines.id.discretion is further compounded by the fact that the company does not monitor the promotion decisions being made or otherwise systematically review the grounds on which candidates are selected for promotion.id.at.
this action was brought by six women on behalf of all women who were employed in any retail store position throughout.two of these six women still work at.of the other four,one was terminated and three left before the complaint was even filed in the aggregate,these six plaintiffs worked at ten stores in california,one store in texas,one store in oklahoma,and one store in missouri.three plaintiffs allege that they expressed interest in,or applied for,various promotions at the store in which they were then employed,but did not receive them.these three women allege that men were promoted instead.only one of these plaintiffs,christine kwapnoski,has held a management position.two plaintiffs allege that similarly situated men received higher pay.one plaintiff alleges that a lessqualified man received the same pay as she did.
together,these six women assert that they are adequate class representatives of a class comprising a ll women employed at any domestic retail store at any time since december,who have been or may be subjected to challenged pay and management track promotions policies and practices.id.at.the class includes every woman working in retail stores,which by definition encompasses salaried store managers who were responsible for the allegedly discriminatory hiring decisions assistant managers and who were also responsible for much of the alleged discriminatory treatment,and hourly workers whose positions range from personnel clerk to deli manager.at the time the suit was filed,the class was estimated to include million women 
before it can certify a class,a court must ensure that the proposed class meets the standards set forth in rule of the federal rules of civil procedure.rule is a procedural rule that permits courts to aggregate the legal claims of multiple parties when it is efficient and fair to do so it does not alter the substance of claims or the plaintiffs burden to prove their claims.see b.
we review the district court class certification decisions for abuse of discretion.staton boeing,cir.abuse of discretion occurs when the district court commits a legal error,or when it relies upon an improper factor,omits consideration of a factor entitled to substantial weight,or mulls the correct mix of factors but makes a clear error of judgment in assaying them.vinole countrywide home loans,cir citation and internal quotation marks omitted.
here,the district court abused its discretion in two ways.first,it failed to follow the supreme court direction to evaluate carefully the legitimacy of the named plaintiff plea that he is a proper class representative under rule a,falcon,at,and to ensure after a rigorous analysis that the prerequisites of rule a have been met,id.at.second,the district court erred in ignoring statutory right to raise defenses to liability for back pay and punitive damages under title vii,see g rules enabling act,b,and therefore abused its discretion in holding that the proposed class could be certified under rule b.i would reverse and remand this action to the district court to correct these errors,which i address below in turn.
in falcon,the supreme court held that when a small number of plaintiffs allege discrimination and attempt to certify a class,the district court must undertake a rigorous analysis to determine whether the rule a commonality and typicality factors exist falcon,at,see staton,at calling a proposed class of members throughout six facilities an ambitious claim for commonality that was therefore especially worthy of scrutiny.as falcon explained,the plaintiff own experience of discrimination does not allow the district court to infer that discriminatory treatment is typical of the employer employment practices.at see.motor freight,rodriguez,d.indeed,the court warned,if one allegation of specific discriminatory treatment were sufficient to support an attack,every title vii case would be a potential companywide class action.falcon,at.instead,to maintain a class action based on discrimination,the plaintiff must bridge the wide gap between the plaintiff own discriminatory treatment and the existence of a class that has suffered the same injury as the plaintiff as a result of a discriminatory policy.id.at.
this principle is simple common sense.a female employee in a store in california,for example,may have a valid claim that her supervisor discriminated against her when making decisions regarding promotion opportunities.but this individual claim would not by itself entitle the california employee to bring the alleged discrimination claims of female employees in a store in wyoming.absent evidence that the wyoming employees had been subject to the same sort of discrimination and could bring the same sort of claims,such a proposed class would clearly fail the rule a commonality and typicality requirements.a fortiori,a female employee in california could not represent a class of all female employees in absent similar proof to bridge the gap between her claim and the existence of discrimination.
the supreme court has identified two situations in which a plaintiff could potentially bridge this gap.the first is where a plaintiff alleges that an employer used a biased testing procedure to evaluate all members of the proposed class.id.at.this makes sense because if the employer used a biased testing procedure throughout the company,then every employee subject to the test would have a similar claim.
the court second example applies directly to this case a plaintiff conceivably could bring a title vii action if the plaintiff adduced s ignificant proof that an employer operated under a general policy of discrimination and the discriminatory policy was implemented through entirely subjective decision making processes in a manner that affected all members of the class.id.this example also makes sense.as the majority acknowledges,op.at,subjective decision making by itself is not a discriminatory practice.see watson fort worth bank trust,d it is true,to be sure,that an employer policy of leaving promotion decisions to the unchecked discretion of lower level supervisors should itself raise no inference of discriminatory conduct.but if an employer has a policy of discrimination against women,and the employer implements this policy through subjective decision making,then the plaintiff could reasonably claim that all female employees were subject to the same discriminatory employment practice.as in our prior example,if the female employee in the california store could offer proof of a policy of discrimination against women,she would be able to allege that female employees in stores throughout the country suffered a similar discriminatory injury as she did.
although falcon did not spell out what constitutes significant proof of the existence of a general policy of discrimination,it did make one thing clear evidence of discrete instances of discrimination are insufficient to sustain an inference of an employer general policy and do not rise to the level of significant proof.see at holding that evidence that the plaintiff was passed over for promotion when several less deserving whites were advanced may support a claim of individual discrimination,but would not necessarily justify a claim of discrimination.this is the standard that must be applied to the claims here.
the majority offers several reasons for concluding it is not bound by falcon significant proof requirement.first,the majority claims that this requirement has little weight because it was a hypothetical in clear dicta.op.at.this contention has no merit.we are bound by the supreme court instructions whether they are stated in the first sentence of an opinion or in the final footnote.falcon analysis of rule a is controlling here,given that it is the sole supreme court case addressing rule a in the title vii discrimination context and is directly on point in this case.moreover,the significant proof requirement is clearly a reasonable interpretation of rule a a plaintiff can not bring a discrimination class action unless there is sufficient evidence that the alleged discriminatory injury actually affected employees throughout the company.
second,the majority attempts to cabin falcon to its facts,asserting that the significant proof requirement applies only when the plaintiff is an employee of the company and other members of the purported class are job applicants.in such a case,the majority asserts,the plaintiff and the purported members of the class have distinct legal theories of recovery.op.at.the majority efforts to distinguish falcon on this ground are unpersuasive.falcon determination that the district court erred in certifying a class of existing employees and job applicants was based on the general principle that a plaintiff claims must fairly encompass those of the class to meet the rule a commonality and typicality requirements.see falcon,u.at.in elaborating further on this principle,the supreme court explained that plaintiffs who seek to bridge the gap between their claims and those of the class members by alleging a general companywide policy of discrimination must adduce significant proof that such a policy exists.id.at.the supreme court did not limit this principle to classes combining plaintiffs with hiring and promotion claims.
finally,the majority claims that falcon significant proof requirement conflates the class certification and merits phases of the litigation.op.at.this is incorrect.falcon does not require plaintiffs to prove the merits of their claim here,for example,plaintiffs need not establish a prima facie case of discrimination that can survive the employer rebuttal evidence,nor need they prove their claims for individual relief.see int l of teamsters united states,d.but falcon does require the plaintiffs to put forth some significant proof,evidence beyond allegations,that a general policy of discrimination exists.falcon,at.more important,as falcon states and as the majority acknowledges,courts at the class certification stage must probe behind the pleadings to examine evidence which goes to the requirements of rule,even if such evidence also relates to the underlying merits of the case.id.at.in this context,the degree of overlap between the merits determination and the determination that the class meets the rule requirements is largely irrelevant.id.rather,falcon principle that a handful of individual incidents of discrimination are insufficient for class certification is applicable both at the merits stage and the class certification stage.see cooper fed.reserve bank,d.if plaintiffs can not demonstrate that the proposed class was subject to a general policy of discrimination,then the class action is not an efficient mechanism for pursuing relief,and the district court may not certify the class.
we must consider plaintiffs motion for class certification under rule a in light of falcon requirements.in this case,the plaintiffs asked the district court to certify a class of million women based on i anecdotes ii statistical evidence and iii expert testimony in light of falcon,the district court responsibility to conduct a rigorous scrutiny of this evidence was clear.as explained below,the evidence does not come close to meeting the falcon requirements for demonstrating commonality and typicality.
on its face,anecdotes,or one anecdote for every class members,does not support plaintiffs claim that had a policy of discrimination.the affidavits describe the affiants experiences in,at most,of stores,meaning that the affidavits provide no information about working conditions in over stores.a single affidavit from a single store in michigan tells little about whether there is discrimination at each of the other stores in michigan,let alone the rest of the company.cooper,at see cooper,cir holding that evidence of discrimination in one part of a company does not necessarily give rise to an inference of discrimination in a different part of the company,overruled on other grounds by ash tyson foods,d per curiam.
nor are the affidavits geographically representative of as a whole.see cooper,at upholding the district court determination that,given the sheer size and geographically dispersed nature of the defendants workforce,the anecdotal as some of it may have inadequate to establish discrimination classwide.here,more than half of the women who submitted affidavits are concentrated in only six,california,florida,missouri,texas,and less than a third of stores are located.there are no more than one or two affidavits relating to operations in half the states,and states are not represented at all 
the supreme court has held that a court may find a policy of discrimination where plaintiffs have offered a substantial number of affidavits compared to the size of the class,along with sufficient statistical evidence teamsters,at.in teamsters,for example,anecdotes of discrimination out of a class of some employees one out of every eight class members were held probative of a pattern or practice of discrimination.see united states,cir,overruled by teamsters,d.these anecdotes were from employees spread throughout the company and represented seven of the company ten largest operations.see id.at.
on the other hand,the supreme court has concluded that a handful of discriminatory incidents is insufficient evidence of a policy of discrimination to justify certification of a class.falcon,at.a plaintiff individual experience of discriminatory treatment does not itself raise the inference that such treatment is typical of the employer practices.id.at see cooper,at a class plaintiff attempt to prove the existence of a companywide policy,or even a consistent practice within a given department,may fail even though discrimination against one or two individuals has been proved.
here,affidavits compared to million members of the class amount to nothing more than evidence of isolated or sporadic incidents of discrimination,cooper,at,which are insufficient to show a policy of discrimination.see falcon,at.the affiants claim discrimination in different forms,at the hands of different people,in different stores,in different parts of the country,at different times,and under a constellation of facts unique to each individual.whether or not these employees have actionable discrimination claims against the store and management where they worked,their individual stories do not constitute significant proof that has adopted a general policy of discrimination or that such a policy prevails in the remaining stores.in relying on such scanty anecdotal evidence to support class certification,the district court failed to probe behind the pleadings to determine whether the six plaintiffs actually did possess the same interest and suffer the same injury as the proposed class members.id.at.
the majority makes the same mistake.discarding objection that the district court abused its discretion in considering the affidavits to be an adequate basis for certifying the class,the majority states,we find no authority requiring or even suggesting that a plaintiff class submit a specific number of declarations for such evidence to have any value.op.at.this is a strawman argument.the supreme court has not specified a threshold number of affidavits that a plaintiff alleging discrimination must have in hand.but if the plaintiff affidavits do not raise the inference that the employer practices are motivated by a policy of gender discrimination pervading the employer company,they do not support class certification.falcon,at.here,the majority conclusion that one declaration for every women,amounting to a handful of declarations scattered among stores in fifty states,raise s an inference of common discriminatory experiences,op.at,does not pass even the test.
the plaintiffs statistical evidence is no better.plaintiffs relied most heavily on the statistical study produced by richard drogin,a retired professor of statistics from california state university,hayward.drogin conducted a regional analysis comparing the percentage of women promoted into management positions at with the percentage of women in the available pool of hourly workers,and concluded that women were underrepresented in management in almost every one of regions.drogin also compared the earnings of women to the earnings of men at and concluded that in each region,pays women less than men in comparable hourly positions.
objected to this evidence on the ground that data aggregated at the regional or national level did not demonstrate there was a general policy of discrimination throughout individual retail stores.the district court dismissed these objections.rejecting what it characterized as effort to engage the court in a merits evaluation of the expert opinions,the district court stated it would delve into the substance of the expert testimony only to the extent necessary to determine if it is sufficiently probative of an inference of discrimination to create a common question as to the existence of a pattern and practice of gender discrimination at.dukes i,at.applying this standard,the court held that drogin regional analysis was not lacking in probative value,was at least a reasonable means of conducting a statistical analysis,id.at,and therefore was sufficient to create an inference of discrimination for class certification purposes,id.at.
the district court superficial examination of drogin statistics constituted legal error.the plaintiffs class proposal hinged on its proof that had a general policy of discrimination absent convincing proof on that point,the plaintiffs could not bridge the gap between their discrimination claims and the purported claims of the class.accordingly,the district court was obliged to scrutinize plaintiffs evidence and make a reasoned determination as to whether it constituted significant proof that had a general policy of discrimination,and thus whether the requirements of rule a had been met.see falcon,at.
the district court expressly rejected this responsibility.instead of rigorously analyzing whether the plaintiffs evidence was significant proof of a general policy of discrimination,the district court made it burden to prove that drogin statistics were no longer probative or were fatally flawed.see dukes i,at see also id.at concluding that failed to persuade the court that drogin regional analysis should be rejected because it is lacking in probative value id.at concluding that has not discredited or nullified drogin results with respect to objection that drogin methodology failed to account for a variety of relevant factors.the majority affirms this error by simply labeling the district court analysis as rigorous and insisting without analysis that the district court adequately probed behind the pleadings.
had the district court properly analyzed the evidence,it could not have concluded that drogin statistics constituted significant proof of plaintiffs theory.information about disparities at the regional and national level does not establish the existence of disparities at individual stores,let alone raise the inference that a policy of discrimination is implemented by discretionary decisions at the store and district level.as statistical expert,joan haworth,explained,the statistical disparities at the regional level could be due to decisions made at only a small percentage of wal mart stores indeed,haworth concluded that,when data is considered at the store level,over percent of stores showed no statistical difference in the hourly pay rates between men and women associates with similar characteristics.although drogin argued that it was proper to conduct an analysis on a regional level because the subjective in compensation and promotions takes place within parameters and guidelines that are highly uniform,and within a strong corporate culture,dukes i,at,this argument makes little sense.among other things,this argument is contrary to the thrust of plaintiffs legal theory,namely,that the decisions of individual managers regarding pay and promotions are subjective and not subject to uniform parameters and guidelines.it is also contrary to the district court own determination that pay and promotion decisions are largely subjective and made within a substantial range of discretion by store or district level managers.id.at.more important,because statistical disparities may exist at the regional level even if the majority or all of the store managers made nondiscriminatory decisions at the store level,drogin data is not sufficiently probative of conditions at the store level to constitute significant proof of the existence of a class subjected to a policy of discrimination 
the majority disposes of objection that regional data is not indicative of a general discriminatory policy at individual stores by criticizing statistics,which aggregated data at the rather than the store level,an approach the district court had previously allowed.
dukes i,at.but the quality of the defendant statistics is not the issue here rather,it is the plaintiffs burden to produce significant proof of a policy of discrimination across that manifested itself in similar ways throughout the company.see falcon,at.plaintiffs statistics lack probative value even without opposing data.
finally,the district court committed legal error by failing to test the reliability of the expert opinion of william bielby,as required by federal rule of evidence and daubert merrell dow pharmaceuticals,d.in brief,bielby presented his theory that subjective decision making,such as that which occurs at stores,is susceptible to unconscious discriminatory impulses.moved to strike bielby testimony on the ground that his opinion was not reliable.according to,bielby failed to apply the same standards to his work in preparing his testimony that he applied to his work as a scientist.alleged,inter alia,that bielby had misrepresented aspects of the literature upon which he relied,made unsustainable extrapolations from that literature,failed to consider evidence that tended to undermine his theory,and failed to test his data.
instead of evaluating the reliability of bielby report in light of arguments,the district court denied motion on the ground that courts should not even apply the full daubert gatekeeper standard at the class certification stage.dukes ii,at.rather,the district court held that t he appropriate question at this stage of the litigation is not whether bielby can make a conclusive determination,but whether his opinion could add probative value to the inference of discrimination that plaintiffs allege.dukes i,at.concluding that the report was not so flawed that it lacks sufficient probative value to be considered in assessing commonality,the district court relied on bielby report in making its determination that plaintiffs met the rule a requirements.dukes ii,at.
in so ruling,the district court misunderstood daubert and the level of inquiry required at the class certification stage.the purpose of conducting a daubert inquiry is to ensure that proffered expert testimony is relevant and reliable.kumho tire carmichael,d.it is to make certain that an expert,whether basing testimony upon professional studies or personal experience,employs in the courtroom the same level of intellectual rigor that characterizes the practice of an expert in the relevant field.id.to this end,a court must make a preliminary assessment of whether the reasoning or methodology underlying the testimony is scientifically valid and of whether that reasoning or methodology properly can be applied to the facts in issue.daubert,at.courts are obliged to address allegations that an expert opinion is not supported by the data,and may reject opinion evidence that is connected to existing data only by the ipse dixit of the expert.joiner,d.
these principles are equally applicable in the class certification context.the district court must assess all of the relevant evidence admitted at the class certification stage and determine whether each rule requirement has been met,just as the judge would resolve a dispute about any other threshold prerequisite for continuing a lawsuit.in re initial pub.offerings sec,cir.like any other evidence,expert evidence introduced to establish a component of a rule requirement must be reliable it is not enough that the expert testimony is not fatally flawed.see also am.honda motor allen,slip op.at cir.april,holding that the court must conduct a daubert analysis on key expert testimony even at the class certification stage in re hydrogen peroxide antitrust,cir expert opinion with respect to class certification,like any matter relevant to a rule requirement,calls for rigorous analysis.a court can not reasonably certify a class based on evidence that is not based upon sufficient facts or data,the product of reliable principles and methods,and the product of reliable application of the methods to the facts.although a district court has considerable discretion under daubert,there is no basis for the district court conclusion that it can forego a reliability inquiry altogether.the district court abused its discretion in doing so 
the majority discussion of this claim misses the mark entirely.first,instead of engaging the question whether the district court properly tested the reliability of bielby testimony,the majority simply concludes that bielby presented scientifically reliable evidence.op.at.this not only assumes the answer to the very question at issue,but is wrong on its face the district court explicitly did not consider whether the evidence was scientifically reliable,holding instead that the evidence was not so flawed that it lacks sufficient probative value to be considered in assessing whether class certification was appropriate.dukes ii,at 
the majority focuses its discussion on what it characterizes as objection to the persuasiveness of bielby testimony.according to the majority,did not and does not challenge bielby methodology.op.at.in fact,never challenged the persuasiveness of bielby testimony,but rather challenged bielby methodology,a challenge that is proper under daubert.see daubert,at see also joiner,at.by missing this point,the majority erroneously approves the district court reliance on an arguably unreliable expert opinion.
when plaintiffs evidence is subjected to the rigorous inquiry required by falcon,it is inadequate to bridge the gap between the six plaintiffs claims of individual discrimination and a claim of discrimination.none of plaintiffs evidence is probative of discrimination.every piece of evidence merely purports to support another.while plaintiffs anecdotes do not show discrimination,plaintiffs argue they support the statistical evidence.the statistics are not probative of a policy of discrimination,but plaintiffs allege they may be attributable to such a policy when viewed in connection with uniform corporate policies.op.at.the uniform corporate policies are not themselves discriminatory but,according to plaintiffs,provide a potential conduit for discrimination.op.at.the expert opinions do not point to discrimination on a companywide basis,but merely support the existence of companywide policies and practices that likely include a culture of gender stereotyping.op.at emphasis added.and corporate policy of subjective decision making is not discriminatory in itself but,plaintiffs urge,may be evidence of discrimination in light of the statistical evidence and anecdotes.op.at.like the proverbial shell game,the plaintiffs circular presentation can not conceal the fact that they have failed to offer any significant proof of a policy of discrimination,no matter which shell is lifted.
by taking the district court determination at face value,the majority erroneously accepts a chain of weak inferences as sufficient to carry plaintiffs burden of adducing significant proof that operated under a general policy of discrimination that affected all members of the class.falcon,at.any reasonable scrutiny of the evidence in this case compels the conclusion that although the six plaintiffs here may have individualized claims of discrimination,they can not represent a class of million past and present employees.the district court abused its discretion in holding that the plaintiffs met the commonality and typicality requirements of rule a.
even assuming the district court was correct in concluding that the proposed class satisfied the rule a standard,the district court made two crucial errors when it certified the class under rule b.first,the district court failed to consider whether it could protect the parties substantive rights in the class action context.although the plaintiffs were bringing title vii claims,the district court erroneously concluded that it had no obligation to allow to raise the statutory defenses provided by title vii.this was an error a court must ensure that its certification of a class does not affect the substantive rights of either party.see rules enabling act,b ortiz fibreboard,d n o reading of the rule can ignore the act mandate that rules of procedure shall not abridge,enlarge or modify any substantive right.internal quotation marks omitted quoting amchem,windsor,d.this mistake led to a second legal error because the district court turned a blind eye to right to individual hearings,the district court failed to realize that the class did not fit the historical model of rule b,and therefore could not be certified under that section of the rule.
the parties substantive rights in this case are defined by title vii.the majority acknowledges that the legal and factual frameworks of different causes of action can impact the outcome of a court rule determination.op.at.yet the majority fails to address the specific legal and factual framework of title vii or consider how it impacts the certification of plaintiffs proposed class.it is therefore necessary to provide some background regarding the structure of claims and defenses under title vii before discussing the majority and district court error in certifying the proposed class under rule b.
under title vii,the plaintiff has the ultimate burden of establishing that the employer is engaged in an unlawful employment practice described in.if the plaintiff prevails in a title vii action,the court may enjoin the respondent from engaging in such unlawful employment practice,and order such affirmative action as may be appropriate,which may include,but is not limited to,reinstatement or hiring of employees,with or without back pay,or any other equitable relief as the court deems appropriate.g.in cases where the plaintiff alleges that the employer engaged in intentional discrimination,the plaintiff may also seek compensatory and punitive damages.a.punitive damages are available only if the plaintiff can show the employer acted with malice or with reckless indifference to the federally protected rights of an aggrieved individual.b,landgraf usi film.
title vii affords certain affirmative defenses.if the employer can prove that an adverse employment action against an individual employee was for any reason other than discrimination on account of race,color,religion,sex,or national origin or in violation of section a of this title,a court shall not order the hiring,reinstatement,or promotion of an individual as an employee,or the payment to him of any back pay.g a.even if the employee proves that the adverse employment action was motivated in part by a discriminatory motive,see m,a court can not award damages or back pay if the employer can prove that it would have taken the same action in the absence of the impermissible motivating factor,g b ii.see costa desert palace,cir explaining that in a mixed motive case,an employer may assert an affirmative defense to bar certain types of relief by showing the absence of but for causation,aff,d.if the employer is successful in proving an affirmative defense,title vii limits the court to granting declaratory or injunctive relief,as well as certain attorneys fees and costs.g b ii.
these defenses are available to a defendant regardless of whether the plaintiffs allege discrimination against a single individual or against a class.see b teamsters,at citing franks bowman trans.an employer can not be deprived of its statutory right to raise individualized defenses to claims for monetary relief merely because plaintiffs characterize their claim as a pattern or practice of discrimination and bring the suit on behalf of a class.instead,the supreme court has created a framework for litigating claims that provides employers the opportunity to put forth individual defenses.see teamsters,at 
the first phase of a title vii lawsuit focuses on practices.the party bringing the suit must first attempt to establish by a preponderance of the evidence that discrimination was the company standard operating procedure,the regular rather than the unusual practice.id.at.in this phase,the plaintiff need not show that each member of the class was a victim of the employer discriminatory policy.id.at.if the plaintiff establish es a prima facie case that such a policy existed,the burden shifts to the employer to show there was no such pattern of discrimination at a level.id.if the employer fails to rebut the inference of discrimination arising from the plaintiffs prima facie case,the district court may conclude that a violation has occurred and order prospective relief.id.at.
but if plaintiffs seek individual relief such as reinstatement or back pay,the district court must conduct additional proceedings in the second phase of the trial to determine the scope of individual relief.id.in this second phase,t he proof of the pattern or practice supports an inference that any particular employment decision,during the period in which the discriminatory policy was in force,was made in pursuit of that policy.id.at.therefore,individual class members may establish a prima facie case merely by showing that an individual unsuccessfully applied for a job and therefore was a potential victim of the proved discrimination.id.footnote omitted.the burden then shifts to the employer to raise its affirmative defenses and to demonstrate that the individual applicant was denied an employment opportunity for lawful reasons.id.teamsters acknowledged that the district court task of determining individual relief would not be a simple one,because the court will have to make a substantial number of individual determinations in deciding which of the minority employees were actual victims of the company discriminatory practices.id.at.
as should be clear,claims for monetary relief can not be resolved until this second phase.see,reeb ohio dep t of rehab,cir lemon int l union of operating eng rs,local,cir allison,at.this applies equally to punitive damages.because the supreme court has indicated that punitive damages must bear a reasonable relationship to compensatory damages,bmw of,gore,d internal quotation marks omitted,punitive damages must be determined after proof of liability to individual plaintiffs at the second stage of a pattern or practice case,not upon the mere finding of general liability to the class at the first stage,allison,at see also b an employer may avoid punitive damages by showing lack of requisite mens rea as to each aggrieved individual kolstad am.dental ass n,d holding that an employer may avoid punitive damages under if it has made efforts to prevent discrimination in the workplace caribbean forms,cir holding that an employer good faith efforts to implement an policy in the workplace is an affirmative defense to an award of punitive damages under.
in sum,a determination that an employer has engaged in a pattern or practice of discrimination in violation of title vii entitles the class to prospective relief and creates a presumption of liability for individual relief.the employer then has a statutory right,recognized by the supreme court,to prove that its actions against individual employees were not discriminatory.the rules enabling act prohibits a district court from depriving an employer of this right simply to facilitate the certification of a class action see b.
in this case,notwithstanding the requirements of title vii,the district court rejected arguments that it was entitled to raise a defense with respect to each class member claim for back pay and punitive damages.dukes i,at.the district court did not provide any reason for this decision,stating only that holding individual hearings for the number of women potentially entitled to backpay in this case is impractical on its face,and thus the traditional teamsters approach is not feasible here.id.at.
it seems obvious that the district court determination that it could not certify the class in compliance with teamsters compels the conclusion that it could not certify the class at all.nevertheless,the district court determined it could bypass supreme court precedent.relying on cases the court characterized as allowing back pay awards to be calculated on a basis,see dukes i,at,the district court held that once plaintiffs proved that engaged in a pattern or practice of discrimination,liability as to individual class members could be determined by means of a formula for employees denied promotions,id.at,or by analyzing personnel data to identify employees entitled to back pay,id.at.further,the district court rejected argument that punitive damages could not be awarded on a basis,holding that it could limit recovery of any punitive damages to those class members who actually recover an award of lost pay,as determined by a formula.id.at.
in adopting the approach described above,the district court deprived of its statutory right to raise its defenses and violated the mandate of the rules enabling act.if can prove that it took an adverse employment action with respect to a particular plaintiff for reasons,or that it would have taken the same action in the absence of the impermissible motivating factor,g a,b,it can not be held liable for back pay or punitive damages as to those individual class members.see teamsters,at.
the cases relied on by the district court,see dukes i,at,do not justify its refusal to provide individual hearings,but rather provide that defendants are entitled to raise statutory defenses to liability.see domingo,at see also mckenzie sawyer,abrogated on other grounds by berger iron workers reinforced rodmen,local,hameed int l ass of bridge,structural ornamental iron workers local union,cir if a black applicant was rejected for a nondiscriminatory reason,that applicant would not be a member of the class of potential discriminatees.the district court could not properly rely on cases that preceded teamsters,see,stewart motors,cir,nor those from other circuits that are contrary to teamsters,see,eeoc o g spring wire forms specialty,cir segar smith.
the district court crucial misunderstanding of title vii and teamsters led to a second mistake it failed to undertake a proper analysis of whether the proposed class should be certified under rule b or rule b.the majority makes the same error,with nary an acknowledgment that the supreme court has provided general guidelines for making this determination.see,e,ortiz,at amchem,at.again,to understand how the district court and majority went astray,it is first necessary to describe the basic analytical structure for categorizing classes under rule b.
rule b establishes three different types of classes.in certifying a proposed class,courts must determine whether a proposed class fits into the historical models on which rule b or were based,or is a more adventuresome class action,amchem,at,that must be certified under rule b.see ortiz,at.
courts considering whether to certify a class under rule b or must take the prudent course of staying close to the historical model and traditional paradigm as understood by the advisory committee in drafting the rule.ortiz,at.the advisory committee intended rule b classes to be limited fund actions,a type of action where multiple plaintiffs seek to divide a limited fund among claimants.id.at.rule b allows a court to certify a class action when the party opposing the class has acted or refused to act on grounds that apply generally to the class,so that final injunctive relief or corresponding declaratory relief is appropriate respecting the class as a whole.b.a review of the historical sources relied upon by ortiz reveals that the advisory committee based rule b on various actions in the field where a party is charged with discriminating unlawfully against a class,usually one whose members are incapable of specific enumeration.b advisory committee note.specifically,the committee cited,as the historical predicate of the rule b action,cases where plaintiffs endeavored to desegregate public accommodations through prospective declaratory and injunctive relief applicable to the class as a whole.notably,these historical actions sought the correction of a specific discriminatory policy affecting all members of the class in the same way.see,bailey patterson,cir.
none of the cases cited by the advisory committee included claims for monetary relief or individual relief of any kind.b advisory committee note 
the advisory committee notes explain that,t he subdivision does not extend to cases in which the appropriate final relief relates exclusively or predominantly to money damages.id.in other words,rule b was designed for classes seeking injunctive relief to remedy a common injury to the class as a whole,not for classes seeking individual damages,back pay,or other individual relief.
while rule b and are linked to historical models,rule b was designed for those cases in which treatment is not as clearly called for.amchem,at internal quotation marks omitted see also ortiz,at explaining that the advisory committee looked cautiously at the potential for creativity under rule b and and was not forward looking as it was in anticipating innovations under rule b.b advisory committee note.specifically,rule b provides for class actions that potentially allow plaintiffs to seek monetary relief on a basis.b advisory committee note benjamin kaplan,continuing work of the civil committee amendments of the federal rules of civil procedure i,harv.
because these more adventuresome class actions,amchem,at,raise due process concerns,the advisory committee imposed two safeguards on courts certifying such a class.first,a district court must find that the questions of law or fact common to class members predominate over any questions affecting only individual members.b.this inquiry ensures that deviation from the usual rule that litigation is conducted by and on behalf of the individual named parties only is justified.califano yamasaki,d.second,a district court must give prospective class members the opportunity to be excluded from the class,which is commonly known as the right to opt out.c b v.this option protects the interests of the individuals in pursuing their own litigations,which may be so strong here as to warrant denial of a class action altogether.fed.civ.pro.c advisory committee note.the option also ensures that the class is binding on those members of the class who choose not to opt out.eisen carlisle jacquelin,d.
this right to opt out of a class action,however,is exclusive to classes certified under rule b.on its face,rule does not provide absent class members the right to request exclusion in classes certified under rule b,and it is clear from the rule structure that the advisory committee did not intend for such a right to exist under rule b moreover,the supreme court has interpreted rule b as precluding opt outs.ticor title ins.brown,d.in ticor,the supreme court dismissed its grant of certiorari on the question whether binding absent class members to a settlement would violate their constitutional due process rights,where the district court certified the class under rules b a and b,and the absent members had not had the chance to opt out of the class.id.at.the court first noted that rule b permits opt outs,and rules b and b do not.id.at.from this,the court reasoned it could avoid the constitutional question raised in the petition for certiorari if it held that in actions seeking monetary damages,classes can be certified only under rule b,not rules b and b.id.the court concluded that this interpretation of rule is at least a substantial possibility.id 
in certifying this class under rule b,the district court failed to take the prudent course required by ortiz,at,and consider the history and structure of rule b.had the district court undertaken such a review,it would have been compelled to conclude that the proposed class does not fit the historical model for rule b classes,and can not be certified in that category.first,the proposed class raises an enormous number of individual questions.although the plaintiffs action is in civil rights,the plaintiffs do not ask merely for injunctive relief as in the cases cited by the advisory committee they also seek individualized relief in the form of back pay and punitive damages.as explained above,this may result in up to million individual questions about liability for individual relief.a class that raises so many individual questions also raises the concerns the advisory committee expressly considered in drafting rule b,and requires the court to ask whether the questions of law or fact common to class members predominate over any questions affecting only individual members.b.given the facts in this case,it is far from certain that the proposed class could be certified under the more flexible model provided by rule b,let alone meet the narrower historical model for rule b.
second,the class claims for monetary relief raise the very due process concerns considered by the advisory committee in drafting rule b.the district court acknowledged that due process required that absent class members in this case be given the right to opt out o
