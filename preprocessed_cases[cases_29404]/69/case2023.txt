in this appeal,we examine whether centre city development corporation ccdc a nonprofit corporation created by the city of san hold meetings with legal counsel for the redevelopment agency of the city of san diego the agency to assist the agency with its eminent domain litigation.seeking declaratory,injunctive and mandamus relief,plaintiff melvin shapiro alleges that defendant ccdc board of directors ccdc board must meet in open session with the agency legal counsel pursuant to the brown act,et shapiro argues that because ccdc is not a party to the agency eminent domain litigation,the ccdc board may not rely on section of the brown act,which permits the legislative body of a local agency to hold meetings with its legal counsel to discuss litigation to which it is a party.
the trial court ruled against shapiro,concluding that the ccdc acts on behalf of the agency with respect to the eminent domain litigation and thus may meet in closed session with the agency counsel under the rules applicable to the agency.
we disagree with the trial court interpretation of the brown act.we are required by case law to narrowly construe the brown act open meeting exceptions,and the text of section makes clear that the legislature intended to abrogate all privilege principles applicable to meetings required to be held in open session under the brown act,except as expressly permitted by section.finding no express authorization for the ccdc board to meet in closed session with legal counsel for the agency in the text of section,we conclude that such meetings are not permitted by the brown act.although defendants present legitimate policy arguments for allowing meetings when one local agency delegates certain tasks to another local agency,such arguments must be addressed to the legislature,not this court.accordingly,we reverse the trial court judgment denying the relief sought by shapiro and instruct the trial court to order declaratory and mandamus relief against the ccdc board practice of meeting in closed session with legal counsel for the agency regarding the agency eminent domain litigation.
factual and procedural backgroundahistory of the agency and ccdc 
the city of san diego the city created the agency in and designated the city council as the agency governing body in the city created the nonprofit ccdc to provide various redevelopment services to the agency the city is the sole member of the ccdc and appoints the ccdc board.
the redevelopment plan for the centre city redevelopment project redevelopment plan,which covers much of downtown san diego,was adopted by the city council in ccdc and the agency are parties to an operating agreement which states that ccdc will provide general management and other staff services for agency with respect to the redevelopment projects in the centre city area.those services include overall executive direction for the centre city redevelopment.the operating agreement makes clear that the ccdc is under the supervision of the agency,stating that i n the performance of its duties hereunder,ccdc shall be under the direction of agency,and shall abide by actions taken,directives given,and policies adopted with respect to the centre city redevelopment by agency.
the role of ccdc and the agency in eminent domain proceedings 
this appeal arises out of the agency and ccdc role in eminent domain proceedings.the community redevelopment law health,et.crl provides the statutory authority for the agency to exercise powers of eminent domain.the crl states that,for the purposes of redevelopment,a redevelopment agency may a cquire real property by eminent domain.health,subd.b,defining agency.accordingly,r edevelopment plans may provide for the agency to acquire by condemnation all or part of the real property in the project area.health.here,the redevelopment plan authorizes the agency to acquire property through eminent domain 
california eminent domain law code civ,et requires that the agency fulfill certain procedural requirements in exercising its eminent domain authority.before filing an eminent domain action,the city council,as the legislative body of the agency,must hold a public hearing to determine whether to adopt a resolution of necessity for acquisition of property by eminent domain.see code civ.after adopting a resolution of necessity,the agency must file a lawsuit to institute the eminent domain litigation.see code civ.the agency with the city council as its legislative body performs these tasks itself,and does not delegate them to ccdc.
although the agency holds the hearings to determine whether to adopt a resolution of necessity and files the eminent domain lawsuits in its name,it delegates other tasks relevant to land acquisition and eminent domain proceedings for the centre city redevelopment to ccdc.specifically relevant to eminent domain litigation,ccdc responsibilities under the operating agreement are to c oordinate the real estate acquisition process necessary to execute the centre city redevelopment,including obtaining approvals of acquisition prices,if required,from agency provided,however,that ccdc shall not conduct condemnation actions and c oordinate and utilize other services provided by consultants selected by and under separate contract with the city or agency,including legal opinions and documentation.
the ccdc is given an annual budget by the agency for the acquisition of real property on behalf of the agency.ccdc is responsible for obtaining an appraisal of each property and conducting negotiations with the property owners regarding compensation for loss of the condemned property.as trial of each eminent domain lawsuit approaches,ccdc,acting as the agency representative,will make a final good faith offer to the property owner.any settlement is subject to the ccdc board finding that the settlement is within the budget allocated by the agency for the acquisition of real property and is not a gift of public funds.ccdc estimates that percent of agency eminent domain lawsuits are resolved through settlement.
in connection with its role in approving the settlement of eminent domain litigation,the ccdc board confers with an outside law firm hired by the agency to litigate the eminent domain lawsuits.the publicly posted agendas announcing these meetings note that they will take place in closed session pursuant to section and indicate the specific eminent domain lawsuits that are to be discussed.after the meetings,the ccdc publishes minutes,which typically indicate that the ccdc board received a report from special counsel for the agency in closed session regarding the litigation,and on occasion,that the ccdc board has given direction regarding a potential settlement.
shapiro brown act claims against the agency and ccdc 
shapiro,who is a resident of san diego,filed a complaint for declaratory,injunctive and mandamus relief against the ccdc board and the city council acting as the governing body of the agency shapiro alleges that the ccdc board and the agency violate the open meeting requirements of the brown act when the ccdc board meets in closed session with legal counsel for the agency to discuss pending eminent domain litigation although section,subdivision a,contains an exception which permits a legislative body to meet with its legal counsel in closed session when it is a party to a litigation,shapiro contends that because ccdc is not a party to the eminent domain litigation,the ccdc board must meet with the agency legal counsel in open session 
shapiro filed a motion seeking a writ of mandate or a prohibitory injunction and declaratory relief.based on briefing,declarations and attached documents submitted by the parties,the trial court ruled against shapiro,holding plaintiff interpretation of this exception as narrowly limited to parties actually named in a lawsuit is not persuasive.here,ccdc plays an important role in the city redevelopment projects and the agency may delegate the evaluation of the eminent domain issues to ccdc for purposes of ensuring that the overall aspects of the redevelopment plan are consistently applied.
shapiro appeals,framing the central issue as follows does section,subdivision a prohibit ccdc from holding a closed session with the agency counsel on eminent domain suits when it is not named as a party in the litigation 
discussionastandard of review 
we apply a de novo standard of review where,as here,our task consists of applying a statute to underlying facts that are not in dispute.shapiro san diego city council th,d shapiro.to the extent that the trial court drew factual inferences,we defer to those inferences to the extent they are supported by substantial evidence in the record.id.at,d.
the brown act 
the brown act requires that,except as otherwise provided,a ll meetings of the legislative body of a local agency shall be open and public,and all persons shall be permitted to attend any meeting of the legislative body of a local agency,subd.a.the brown act was designed to facilitate public participation in local governmental decisions and to curb misuse of the democratic process by secret legislation.bell vista unified school dist.th,d.the statute expressly declares legislative intent that the actions of local agencies be taken openly and that their deliberations be conducted openly,and states that t he people do not give their public servants the right to decide what is good for the people to know and what is not good for them to know.
the parties do not dispute,and we agree,that both the san diego city council acting as the governing body for the agency and the ccdc board are legislative bodies of local agencies and are subject to the brown act.
at issue is section,which creates an exception to the brown act open meeting requirements for meetings with legal counsel regarding pending litigation.section allows a legislative body of a local agency to hold a closed session to confer with,or receive advice from,its legal counsel regarding pending litigation when discussion in open session concerning those matters would prejudice the position of the local agency in the litigation.as relevant here,section further defines the pending litigation exception as follows for purposes of this section,litigation shall be considered pending when l itigation,to which the local agency is a party,has been initiated formally.id.at subd.a.
central to the issues presented here,section establishes that the general rules of privilege are irrelevant in deciding whether meetings by the governing board of a local agency may be held in closed session.according to a provision added to section in the amendment for purposes of this chapter,all expressions of the privilege other than those provided in this section are hereby abrogated.this section is the exclusive expression of the privilege for purposes of conducting meetings pursuant to this chapter.stats,ch.thus,by statute,generally applicable principles of privilege can not provide the answer to the question before us.instead,we must look to the text of section.
the text of section does not expressly authorize ccdc to meet in closed session with legal counsel for the agency 
our analysis of section presents a question of statutory interpretation,and we approach this task mindful that t he function of the court in construing a statute is simply to ascertain and declare what is in terms or in substance contained therein,not to insert what has been omitted,or to omit what has been inserted ventura county deputy sheriffs board of retirement cal th,d.if the language is clear and unambiguous,the plain meaning of the statute governs,and that meaning must be applied according to its terms.day city of fontana cal th,d.if,however,the statutory terms are ambiguous,then we may resort to extrinsic sources,including the ostensible objects to be achieved and the legislative history.ibid.highly relevant to our interpretation here is the rule that s tatutory exceptions authorizing closed sessions of legislative bodies are construed narrowly and the brown act sunshine law is construed liberally in favor of openness in conducting public business.shapiro,supra,th at,d see also epstein hollywood entertainment dist.ii bus.improvement dist.th,d the brown act is a remedial statute that must be construed liberally so as to accomplish its purpose.
the plain language of section 
shapiro argues that the brown act pending litigation exception does not allow the ccdc board to meet in closed session with the agency legal counsel because the meetings are not held to discuss pending litigation as that term in defined in section.shapiro points out that pending litigation is defined by the statute as that to which the local agency is a party,subd.a,and ccdc is not and could not be a party to the eminent domain litigation.see code civ,health,subd.b.shapiro argues that the brown act therefore does not authorize the ccdc board to meet in closed session with the agency eminent domain counsel.ccdc and the agency disagree.they contend that because the ccdc board acts as an agent of the agency,it has the same right as the agency to discuss eminent domain litigation with counsel in closed session.
as an initial observation,we note that if general privilege rules applied,defendants focus on ccdc as an agent of the agency might have some dispositive relevance.the privilege treats communication between a lawyer and a client as confidential.evidence code section defines client as a person who,directly or though an authorized representative,consults a lawyer for the purpose of securing legal service or advice italics added.were we to apply this principle,ccdc might well be considered a client for the purposes of the privilege when,acting on behalf of the agency,it meets with the agency legal counsel to discuss the agency eminent domain litigation.under general privilege principles those conversations would be entitled to confidentiality,and ccdc would have a strong argument that it should be permitted to meet in closed session to preserve that confidentiality.
such analysis is not applicable here,however,because according to the clear terms of section,the general rules of privilege do not apply to determine whether a meeting with legal counsel may be held in closed session.instead,a legislative body of a local agency is permitted to hold meetings with counsel to discuss pending litigation only as permitted by the terms of section.our supreme court has explained,based on its review of the legislative history of the amendment,that the bill was intended to make it clear that closed sessions with counsel could only occur as provided in the brown act.roberts city of palmdale cal th,d,italics added.we have independently reviewed the legislative history of section and have found no indication that the legislature intended to permit the practice engaged in by ccdc.
thus,we look to the content of section to determine whether a meeting between the legislative body of one local agency and the legal counsel of another local agency falls within the narrow category of meetings permitted by section.doing so,we conclude that nowhere in the plain text of section is the practice authorized.as ccdc acknowledges,w hereas the brown act expressly authorizes closed sessions between the legislative body and its counsel regarding formally initiated litigation to which a local agency is a party,there is no similar express authorization to meet in closed session where,as here,the legislative body delegates to another entity as its agent is powers to negotiate for the acquisition of real property.
the attorney general opinions cited by the agency and ccdc are inapplicable 
although ccdc concedes that section does not expressly authorize its board to meet in closed session with the agency legal counsel,defendants nevertheless advocate that we imply a statutory authorization based on the analysis in three opinions of the attorney general.as we explain,the attorney general opinions do not lend support to defendants interpretation of section.
the opinion on which defendants place the most reliance was issued in by the attorney general,the opinion in the opinion,the attorney general concluded that an airport commission created by a county board of supervisors was permitted to hold meetings with county counsel about litigation in which the county board of supervi
