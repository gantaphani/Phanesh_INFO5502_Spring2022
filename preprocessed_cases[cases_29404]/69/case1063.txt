purdy brothers trucking,and its driver,david carey collectively purdy brothers,appeal from the district court denial of their motion for a new trial following a million verdict in favor of kaytina harrison for the wrongful death of her son,ryan.the case was tried to a jury on the issue of damages only.purdy brothers contends the district court abused its discretion by admitting an autopsy report,harrison counsel made prejudicial comments during closing arguments,and the district court erred in awarding prejudgment interest.we affirm.
when purdy brothers admitted liability on the first morning of trial following voir dire,the parties agreed to a stipulated set of facts for the district court to read to the jury.the stipulation serves equally well for our purposes in setting forth the factual background of this case,so we repeat it here 
this case is the result of a collision between an automobile and a on june,in columbia,missouri,in which plaintiff kaytina harrison son,ryan thompson,was killed.harrison has brought this claim against david carey and purdy brothers truckling sic company for her son wrongful death.
carey and purdy brothers have admitted they are liable for ryan thompson death.you will be asked to determine whether harrison is entitled to money damages for her son death in accordance with instructions that i will read to you later and,if so,how much.
so that you may have some understanding of the facts surrounding ryan thompson death and the wreck that caused it,i am going to give you some information that may aid you in your deliberations.
this wreck occurred at on friday,june.the day was clear and the road was dry at the time of the accident.ryan thompson was on his way home after spending the night with his father,rob thompson.ryan was lying down in the back seat of thompson chevrolet malibu.their car was stopped on the westbound ramp from at the highway connector.their car was struck from behind by a rig being driven by david carey in the course and scope of his employment with purdy brothers.ryan thompson died in the collision.
carey was traveling to columbia from louis.when he approached the exit on which the accident occurred,he was going approximately.the speed limit on at that location is 
the defendants admit that david carey was negligent in the operation of the purdy brothers truck in that he drove at an excessive speed for the conditions and that he caused or allowed the tractor trailer to collide with the car in which ryan thompson was a passenger,and that carey negligence caused ryan thompson death.
none of the parties involved in the wreck were on drugs or under the influence of alcohol at the time of the collision.
after the accident,kaytina harrison hired counsel to pursue a claim on her behalf.on august,her counsel wrote to purdy brother liability carrier,empire fire marine insurance company,offering to settle for.counsel sent the offer by certified mail to trigger missouri prejudgment interest statute,which allows for an award of prejudgment interest if a claimant has made a demand for payment or an offer of settlement of a claim,to the party,parties or their representatives and the amount of the judgment or order exceeds the demand for payment or offer of settlement when the offer is made in writing and sent by certified mail.emphasis added.under the terms of the policy,purdy brothers gave empire authority to investigate and settle any claim or suit as we empire consider appropriate.our duty to defend or settle ends when the liability coverage limit of insurance has been exhausted by payment of judgments or settlements.
when the parties were unable to settle,harrison brought suit and the case proceeded to trial.because purdy brothers admitted liability,the trial focused on ryan personality and activities.a total of seven witnesses took the little league coach,his second grade teacher,his best friend mother,both of his grandmothers and mother and testifying about ryan life and his relationship with his mother.
the district court excluded most evidence related to the accident,including all photos of ryan body,a video of the accident,testimony from witnesses who were on the scene immediately following the accident,and the fact that carey had pleaded guilty to felony manslaughter for causing the wreck.the district court also excluded all photos of the accident scene,with the exception of three which purdy brothers had stipulated were aerial photos showing the intersection,and a single photo showing the accident scene itself.the accident scene photo showed the crumpled and shell of the thompson vehicle,which caught fire as a result of the collision.the jury already knew about the fire because during voir dire,before purdy brothers admitted liability,the district court told them t here was a major accident.there was a fire and i guess i do need to say much more about it.
over purdy brothers objection,the district court also admitted a report of ryan autopsy.the report contained a brief description of the condition of the body 
the head hair is burned away.the irides are burned away.the nose,ears and mouth are burned away.the neck,chest,back and abdomen are unremarkable except for the thermal injuries to the back and chest.
there is significant thermal injury to the head and upper trunk,especially the back.there are open fractures of the skull and lacerations to the brain.there is skin slippage to the trunk and extremities due to the diesel fuel.
during closing argument,purdy brothers objected to three statements made by harrison counsel.because the district court had informed the jury during voir dire that the case would take all week to try,harrison counsel began his closing argument by explaining why it took just a day and a half 
we came here to spend a week with you and we told you that the beginning of the case,and you can see in all this stuff they brought along,we came for a week.and then gotfredson told you in opening statement,he said we come here today and said we are responsible for this tragedy,and that true.they did come monday and say,while you were out in the hall,well,yeah,we responsible.we caused the death of ryan thompson.and that good that they did that.but that does make the loss to kaytina harrison any less.the fact that the defendants in the case finally fessed up,that does make 
purdy brothers then objected,and the district court immediately sustained the objection.harrison counsel continued by explaining the context of his comments,with no objection from purdy brothers 
that does make kaytina loss any less.so,why do the defendants then confess liability at the eleventh hour i do know that.i do know that.but they did and so we here tuesday at noon and the case is going to you instead of thursday or friday,so i guess that part is good.
next,purdy brothers objected to a reference harrison counsel made to the speed at which carey drove his truck on the off ramp 
and,by the way,in richmond opening statement,he talks about something,well,never did carey think that going in a mile per hour zone would end up like this.but we all know that this wreck did happen on the interstate where the speed limit is.this wreck happened on the off ramp,at the stop sign.
purdy brothers objected on the grounds that he arguing evidence that not in the case.the district court overruled the objection.
finally,purdy brothers objected when harrison counsel argued the defendants had not been willing to do justice 
we need a fair and just closure for this tragedy,justice for the death of ryan thompson,the justice that is required by the court instruction in your your booklet that the judge gave you,you must award,not you can award if you want to,you must award plaintiff kaytina harrison such sum as you believe will fairly and justly compensate her for the loss of her son.that justice comes only from your verdict,from your decision,because these defendants have not been willing to do that.
purdy brothers requested a bench conference,and objected on the grounds counsel had referred to settlement discussions.the court sustained the objection,and told the jury 
i going to instruct you to disregard counsel last statement.what defendants were or were not willing to do before the start of the trial is really irrelevant to this stage.what is relevant at this proceeding is the stipulation and the evidence you received and anything concerning what anybody did or did not do that was presented in this courtroom,that was in the evidence in this case is irrelevant to the case and must not be considered by you.
harrison counsel ultimately suggested an award of million.purdy brothers suggested an award of to million.the jury returned a verdict of million.
both parties filed motions.harrison moved for prejudgment interest pursuant to.because the verdict exceeded her august,settlement offer to empire.purdy brothers opposed the motion,arguing empire was not its representative within the meaning of the statute.the district court disagreed,and awarded prejudgment interest.
purdy brothers moved for a new trial arguing the district court abused its discretion by admitting the autopsy report,and that the closing arguments of harrison counsel were improper and resulted in a miscarriage of justice.the district court denied the motion,noting in part the award of damages,although large,is not excessive in this case when considered against other cases of this nature and the circumstances.
we review the denial of a motion for a new trial for a clear abuse of discretion.duty proppants,cir.the key question is whether a new trial should have been granted to avoid a miscarriage of justice.belk city of eldon,cir quoting mcknight johnson controls,cir.an allegedly erroneous evidentiary ruling does not warrant a new trial unless the evidence was so prejudicial that a new trial would likely produce a different result.bevan honeywell,cir.similarly,when a new trial motion is based on improper closing arguments,a new trial should be granted only if the statements are plainly unwarranted and clearly injurious and cause prejudice to the opposing party and unfairly influence a jury verdict.alholm am.steamship,cir citations omitted.
purdy brothers contends admitting the autopsy report caused a miscarriage of justice because ryan condition was irrelevant to the issue of damages.see.limiting damages in a wrongful death action to the reasonable value of the services,consortium,companionship,comfort,instruction,guidance,counsel,training,and support of which those on whose behalf suit may be brought have been deprived by reason of such death.purdy brothers argues the reference to the condition of ryan body was prejudicial and inflamed the jury.
it appears the district court admitted the report to give the jury some background information about the accident.after purdy brothers conceded liability,the district court told counsel that does severely limit what becomes relevant at trial,but added i think the jury is entitled to some information concerning the circumstances of the action.i do think juries can make decisions as to loss of life in the abstract.we believe the district court was within its discretion to provide the jury a limited amount of background information regarding the circumstances of the accident.united states,cir allowing the admission of background information in a criminal case because it completes the story or explains the relationship of parties or the circumstances surrounding a particular event.but the two paragraphs in the autopsy report describing ryan condition were not relevant,even for background purposes.the condition of ryan body was not probative of any element of damage allowed by,and the jury did not need to know that fact to understand how the accident happened.although that portion of the autopsy report should have been redacted,the district court failure to do so did not result in a miscarriage of justice.
when the district court admitted the autopsy report,purdy brothers had already stipulated to the admission of one accident scene photo showing the charred vehicle.after having seen the photo,the jury would not have been at all surprised,shocked or inflamed by the information contained in the autopsy report.in addition,plaintiff counsel did not emphasize that information,and instead focused his case on his client relationship with ryan.furthermore,the district court specifically instructed the jury that it must not consider grief or bereavement suffered by reason of ryan death when awarding damages.we presume the jury obeyed this instruction.see loehr walton,cir ryan bd.of police comm rs,cir.the admission of the autopsy report did not result in a miscarriage of justice,and the district court did not abuse its discretion by denying the motion for a new trial on that ground.
purdy brothers also contends opposing counsel closing arguments were improper and unfairly influenced the jury verdict.harrison claims purdy brothers failed to preserve this issue for review,so we address that claim first.the record shows closing arguments finished right before lunch,and the district court submitted the case to the jury giving counsel a half an hour to go get something to eat,then come on back and we make a record on any matters that we need to make a record on.when the jury reached a verdict faster than expected,the district court took the verdict before giving the parties an opportunity to make a record on outstanding matters.purdy brothers then moved for a mistrial as soon as the district court allowed.harrison nevertheless argues purdy brothers waived the claim because the mistrial motion was untimely.we disagree for two reasons.
first,under the circumstances involved in this case,the motion for a mistrial was timely even though made after the verdict was announced.reeves teuscher,cir holding a motion for a directed verdict timely even though made after the jury verdict was announced,where district court interrupted defendants and told them to make motion after the verdict.second,purdy brothers entered timely objections to the closing arguments in any event,and therefore preserved the issue even if it had made no motion for a mistrial.a party need not object to an offensive argument and move for a mistrial in order to preserve the right to bring a motion for a new trial.see hofer mack trucks,cir addressing motion for new trial on merits where plaintiff objected to allegedly improper argument at trial but did not also bring a motion for mistrial griffin hilke,cir granting a motion for new trial based on improper closing arguments without indicating the objecting party also moved for a mistrial.
although the timely objections preserved this issue for our review,we conclude purdy brothers is not entitled to relief.as to the first comment the defendants in the case finally fessed up,the district court immediately sustained an objection.in addition,counsel comments following the objection show he was simply trying to explain why the case took a day and a half to try rather than a week,and purdy brothers did not object to the comments.
as to the second comment this wreck did happen on the interstate where the speed limit is.this wreck happened on the off ramp,at the stop sign,the district court properly overruled the objection.counsel statements were true,and based on the evidence.the wreck did not happen on the interstate,the speed limit on the interstate was,and the parties had stipulated the car was stopped on the westbound ramp.to the extent counsel statement implied the speed limit on the ramp was something less than mph,we find no prejudice because purdy brothers had stipulated that carey drove his truck at an excessive speed for the conditions.
as to the third comment these defendants have not been willing to do justice,the district court immediately gave a cautionary instruction to the jury to disregard the comment,and had previously advised the jury that arguments of counsel are not evidence.the district court cautionary instructions cured any prejudice that might have been caused by the comment.see billingsley city of omaha,cir.the district court did not abuse its discretion by denying the motion for a new trial because of improper closing arguments.
finally,purdy brothers claims the district court erred by awarding prejudgment interest.it contends empire was not its r
