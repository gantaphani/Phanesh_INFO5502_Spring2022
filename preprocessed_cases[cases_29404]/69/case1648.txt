nicon,seeks damages for unabsorbed home office overhead resulting from a delay period between award of a government contract and termination for convenience,during which the government never issued a notice to proceed and nicon was allegedly forced to remain on standby.on for summary judgment,the court of federal claims granted the government motion,holding that nicon could not recover damages for unabsorbed home office overhead under the eichleay formula because the formula could not be modified to fit a fact situation where the contractor has not yet begun to perform.nicon,united states.we vacate the summary judgment in favor of the government and remand for further proceedings to determine if nicon may recover unabsorbed overhead damages as part of its termination for convenience settlement by some other method of allocation.
nicon is a small contractor from tampa,florida.on march,the department of the army,mobile district corps of engineers,awarded nicon a million contract to repair dorm at macdill air force base in hillsborough county,florida.on april,a disappointed bidder filed a bid protest,which suspended action on the contract before any of the repair work was commenced.on april,the government notified nicon of the protest and instructed it to take no further actions as to the preparation and forwarding of submittals to the resident office.nicon responded immediately,informing the government that it would cease any further mobilization efforts associated with the project.
the bid protest was dismissed on july,but the government never directed nicon to proceed with the contract.on october,nicon wrote a letter to the government to complain about the delay in issuing the notice to proceed and apparently received no response.nicon wrote again to request permission to proceed on november,but the government still failed to issue a notice to proceed.after this second letter,nicon met with government representatives to discuss revised pricing for the contract.however,the government then terminated the contract for convenience on january.this termination occurred before the government ever issued a notice to proceed and before nicon secured payment and performance bonds for the contract.a period of days elapsed between the march,award of the contract to nicon and the july,dismissal of the bid protest,and another days for a total of days elapsed thereafter before the government termination of nicon contract for convenience on january.
after the termination,nicon submitted a termination settlement proposal to the government.in the proposal,it sought direct costs and associated overhead and profit,as well as unabsorbed home office overhead for the time period between award of the contract and termination.as an allocation method,nicon used a modified version of the eichleay formula to calculate its unabsorbed home office overhead damages.after negotiation,nicon was awarded in direct costs,related overhead,and profit.however,the contracting officer denied nicon claim for in unabsorbed home office overhead for the day alleged delay period.
nicon then filed suit in the court of federal claims to recover the unabsorbed overhead damages it had sought in its termination settlement proposal and which the contracting officer had denied.its complaint contained two counts count i was for delay damages,and count ii was for delay damages.upon for summary judgment as to count i,the court of federal claims granted summary judgment in favor of the government,concluding that nicon was seeking to apply an alternative to the accepted eichleay formula and that it could not modify the formula as nicon requested.the court of federal claims later granted nicon motion to dismiss count ii.

in the course of performance of any contract,a contractor incurs both direct and indirect costs.direct costs are those costs that are directly attributable to the performance of a specific contract and can be traced specifically to that contract.charles williams,white.indirect costs include such things as home office overhead,defined as costs that are expended for the benefit of the whole business,which by their nature can not be attributed or charged to any particular contract.altmayer johnson.generally,a contractor recovers these indirect costs by allocating a proportionate share to each of its contracts.williams,at.however,when the government causes a delay or suspension of performance,this decreases the stream of direct costs against which to assess a percentage rate for reimbursement,united states.in such a situation,a portion of the home office overhead is unabsorbed.
the eichleay formula is used to equitably determine allocation of unabsorbed overhead to allow fair compensation of a contractor for government delay.wickham contracting fischer.the formula,which was originally set forth by the armed services board of contract appeals in eichleay,cch,at july,determines a contractor damages for unabsorbed home office overhead using three steps

before using the eichleay formula to quantify an amount of damages,the contractor must meet certain strict prerequisites for the application of the formula.first there must have been a delay of uncertain duration.interstate gov t contractors,west.the contractor must also show that the delay extended the original time for performance or that,even though the contract was finished within the required time period,the contractor incurred additional costs because he had planned to finish earlier.dick,principi.finally,the contractor must have been on standby and unable to take on other work during the delay period.interstate,at.if the contractor makes out a prima facie case on the required prerequisites,then the burden of production shifts to the government to show either that it was not impractical for the contractor to obtain replacement work during the delay,or that the contractor inability to obtain or perform replacement work was caused by a factor other than the government delay.melka marine,united states.
the court of federal claims did not base its decision on the eligibility prerequisites,the facts of which the parties appear to dispute.the court of federal claims instead concluded that even if the prerequisites were met,it could still grant summary judgment based on the proper construction and use of the eichleay formula,which is a question of law.the court explained that even assuming nicon could show that it met the prerequisites for unabsorbed overhead established by the federal circuit,the formula that nicon proposes is not the eichleay formula,and thus concluded because nicon seeks unabsorbed overhead under a formula that is not recognized by the federal circuit,its claim must be rejected.
this case presents us with a unique factual situation.in the typical cases dealing with the application of the eichleay formula,performance of the contract does eventually occur or resume after the delay.here,however,the government simply terminated the contract after a lengthy delay,and the contractor was never permitted to perform any aspect of the contract.nicon recognizes that this is an unusual situation that does not fit neatly into the eichleay formula as it has been propounded and applied by this court.nicon admits that it has no actual contract billings or days of performance to use in the formula,but proposes that we must substitute constructive figures instead.it asserts that we should assume,for the purposes of fairly allocating overhead,that had nicon been permitted to commence the repair work on schedule it would have completed the project within the time required by the contract and it would have received the full amount of the contractual billings.
nicon argues that the court of federal claims applied the eichleay formula in an overly mechanistic fashion in reaching the conclusion that the formula can not be adapted to govern the facts of this case.the court of federal claims refused to substitute the original contract price for contract billings in the formula and refused to substitute the anticipated period of performance for days of performance.according to nicon,this effectively adds the requirement that performance has begun as an additional prerequisite to the formula.
we agree with the court of federal claims that constructive figures may not be substituted into the eichleay formula and that use of the formula is limited to situations in which contract performance has begun and has been suspended by the government,causing the performance to take longer than originally anticipated.the formula is not intended to simply compensate for any delay rather,eichleay damages are only available when the delay causes contract performance to require more time than originally anticipated.see williams,at see also dick,at focusing on the requirement that performance time be extended west all state boiler,stating that it is clear that a contractor is only injured with respect to indirect costs when the performance period of a contract is extended as a result of suspension and not because of the suspension per se.the focus in our precedent has been on the period of time by which performance was extended as the compensable injury in awarding eichleay damages.in a situation in which there is no performance,as in this case,there is no way to determine the length of time by which the government delay would have extended performance.damages are to be awarded for the period of time by which overall performance is extended,rather than the period of the suspension.all state boiler,at.
nicon wishes for us to assume that,although it never actually began to perform the contract,it would have taken the entire time period allowed for by the contract to finish,thereby making the extension equal to the amount of time the government waited between award and termination.it also wishes for us to assume that it would have been paid exactly the full contract price.this simply asks us to make too many assumptions and stretches the eichleay formula beyond the circumstances for which it was intended.use of the eichleay formula is an extraordinary remedy,and we have been very reluctant to make a drastic shift in the circumstances under which the eichleay formula has been available,at.
the court of federal claims was therefore correct in concluding that the eichleay formula is only applicable in situations in which contract performance has begun.however,that does not mean that a contractor,who is required to remain on standby because of a delay but is never allowed to begin performance,may not receive some of its unabsorbed home office overhead as part of its termination for convenience settlement by some other method of allocation.we have said a number of times in our cases that the eichleay formula is the only proper method of calculating unabsorbed home office overhead.no other formula may be used.wickham,at see also melka marine,at the eichleay formula is the only means approved in our case law for calculating recovery for unabsorbed home office overhead.mitchell constr.danzig.however,these statements must be read in light of the factual context in which they arose they were all made in cases in which contract performance had started and had been interrupted by government delay.they are not applicable to a situation in which the contract is terminated before the commencement of performance.
when contract performance has not begun,but all of the other strict requirements for entitlement to home office overhead are met,there is no bar to the award of home office overhead in a termination for convenience settlement,provided a reasonable method of allocation is available on the particular facts of the case.
a contractor may seek to recover damages for unabsorbed overhead as part of the termination for convenience settlement,and,if the contracting officer denies these damages,appeal the unsatisfactory settlement amount.james ellett constr.united states,explaining the process by which the contracting officer rejection of a termination settlement proposal can become an appealable claim.the burden is then on the contractor to show that it is actually entitled to a settlement amount in excess of that determined by the contracting officer.dynamics land,cch,at.although the burden is on the contractor to show entitlement to a larger settlement amount,it must be kept in mind that the overall purpose of a termination for convenience settlement is to fairly compensate the contractor and to make the contractor whole for the costs incurred in connection with the terminated work.freedom elevator,cch,at.settlement agreements are intended to compensate the contractor fairly,which is a matter of judgment and can not be measured exactly.a see also id.c cost and accounting data may provide guides,but are not rigid measures,for ascertaining fair compensation.codex united states,discussing the fairness policy embodied in the predecessor to.the regulations provide that the cost principles in part of the federal acquisition regulations far are to be used in asserting,negotiating,or determining costs relevant to termination settlements,but they are subject to the general fairness principles of section a.
although unabsorbed overhead is not specifically listed in the far termination for convenience of the government fixed price clause as one of the costs that will be paid under a settlement,it is also not excluded anywhere and could be asserted under the category of costs incurred in the performance of the work terminated,including initial cost and preparatory expense allocable thereto.g i emphasis added.furthermore,although unabsorbed overhead is not mentioned in as a cost peculiar to a termination situation,the costs listed there are to be used in conjunction with the other cost principles in subpart,none of which would appear to prevent,as a matter of law,the award of unabsorbed overhead damages in a termination for convenience settlement if they are properly allowable and allocable.unabsorbed overhead damages have been held to be allowable in the context of a termination for convenience settlement,see worsham constr,cch,at,and we see nothing in the regulations that would preclude the inclusion of unabsorbed overhead damages in the settlement if the factual situation is one in which a reasonable allocation method can be discerned.this is especially so in light of the far admonition that t he use of business judgment,as distinguished from strict accounting principles,is the heart of a settlement.a.the far also provides that i n appropriate cases,costs may be estimated,differences compromised,and doubtful questions settled by agreement.id.c.in construing these regulatory guidelines,it is axiomatic that one must strike a balance between the need for technical compliance with regulatory requirements and the need for basic fairness.spectrum leasing servs,cch,at.
one possible method a contractor in nicon situation may use to obtain unabsorbed overhead damages as part of its termination for convenience settlement is an equitable adjustment under the contract suspension of work clause.the suspension clause provides for adjustments when 
performance of all or any part of the work is,for an unreasonable period of time,suspended,delayed,or interrupted by an act of the contracting officer in the administration of the contract,or by the contracting officer failure to act within the time specified in this contract or within a reasonable time if not specified 
even if there is no date set in the contract by which a notice to proceed must issue,there is an implied obligation on the part of the government to issue the notice to proceed within a reasonable time.ross eng g united states.therefore,damages fo
