background 
wright medical technology,designs,manufactures and markets orthopedic implant devices.murali jasty,an orthopedic surgeon associated with massachusetts general hospital,was one of a group of surgeons nationwide whom wright engaged to act as consultants and to help wright develop and commercialize a new artificial knee system,the advance knee.in march wright entered into a written contract with jasty.under the contract,wright agreed to compensate jasty for providing a variety of services in support of the development of the advance knee.
jasty responsibilities,as set forth in the first paragraph of the contract,were to act as a designer,product spokesperson and consultant.he agreed to provide wright with services and expertise including but not limited to 
a current clinical design or other experience with total knee systems b time away from his practice necessary to participate in clinical consultant meetings technical meetings c time necessary to review and papers and publications d time necessary to develop product educational information e r eview ing clinical data and mak ing oral presentations to peer groups,regulatory agencies and the general public as required and f p rovid ing,at wright request,regular written activity reports.
compensation was to take three different forms a flat payment,for the period november,through november,of per year royalty payments for ten years based on sales of the advance knee and specified payments on the date of and subsequent anniversaries of wright initial public offering ipo,should wright become a publicly traded company.the annual payment for the period november to november was expressly designated as payment in return for the above services,that is,those set out in the first paragraph.the contract further specified with respect to that annual payment,payment of this sum is to compensate you for spending time away from your practice to provide such services and consultations to wright during that period as well as to compensate you for your design input and the rights to commercialize your rights to inventions currently under patent.after november,all payments for services under this agreement shall be pursuant to paragraph.and paragraph.if applicable.paragraphs.and.provide for the royalty and ipo payments.the contract also provided for an offset should royalties based on sales be payable prior to november,the annual payments would be reduced by the amount of the royalty payments.
under the royalty provision,jasty would be entitled to royalties w hen a component of the products results from these collaborative efforts for which you have contributed significant design input.royalties were to be paid quarterly for ten years,based on a specified percentage of net sales.this provision contains no language about jasty services or any other conditions,other than the requirement that jasty must have contributed significant design input.
the ipo compensation provision establishes cash payments if wright were to become a public company.the first payment of would be made at the time of the ipo.later payments of each were to be made on the first two anniversaries of the ipo date,with another payment of to be made on the third anniversary.the ipo payments were to be triggered only if jasty was continuing to perform consulting services to wright under this agreement at the time of payment,unless such nonperformance is due to death or disability.
under the contract termination provision,termination for cause may be by either party on thirty days written notice and after an opportunity to cure.the contract could also be terminated for cause without written notice and opportunity to cure for failure to comply with paragraph,the contract exclusivity provision.that provision prohibited jasty from working on competitor products.additionally,the contract contained an termination provision for jasty on november,jasty would become free to terminate the contract.
it is undisputed that jasty contributed to the development of the advance knee and was eligible for royalties he began receiving royalty payments under the contract in the second quarter of.wright also made all of the required annual payments to jasty between november and november.
the first sign of trouble in the consulting relationship appeared in october.wright and ceo tom patton traveled to boston to meet with jasty to discuss jasty work.patton testified in his deposition that he informed jasty of wright dissatisfaction with his performance and that his contract would be terminated if he did not conform his performance to expected standards.
contemporaneously,patton sent jasty a letter purporting to summarize the meeting.in the letter,patton stated,i am glad we had the opportunity to meet last week and discuss your ongoing role with our business.the letter also mentioned patton intention to reduce our discussions to writing.
the letter continued o promotional,marketing and scientific services from you are critical to the success of the advance knee,have always been contemplated by our agreement,and provide the basis for continued payments under our contract.the letter stated that patton and jasty agreed that it was important for jasty to do the following use the advance knee in the majority of your knee cases,host surgeons for surgical demonstrations,develop published studies from your lab and make yourself more readily available to speak.in the letter,patton also expressed the view that jasty work in developing and promoting a competing product was unacceptable.
the letter contained no threat of termination.it did not state that wright considered jasty in breach of the contract,nor did it mention a time frame or an opportunity for jasty to cure.the letter did advise jasty that wright personnel would contact him regarding specific projects.
almost three years later,in september,wright terminated jasty contract via a letter from wright senior vice president,glen coleman.that letter stated,t his situation was brought to your attention during a meeting with tom patton in october.since that time,improvement has not been made we believe it is appropriate to end the current consulting agreement.the letter contained a settlement offer of royalty payments through the end of.in a march letter,wright retracted the settlement offer and stated that royalty payments had ceased as of the end of.
at this point,wright had been paying royalties to jasty under the contract since.in addition,wright became a public corporation in july,and jasty received pursuant to the ipo provision in the contract.as of the end of,jasty had received annual payments of for the years between,the payment at the time of the july ipo,and royalty payments based on sales of the product from through the last quarter of.
procedural history.
jasty filed suit against wright in massachusetts state court.in his june amended complaint,he claimed that wright breached the contract and violated the massachusetts and tennessee consumer protection statutes.laws ch.and ann.wright timely removed the case to federal court and counterclaimed on three issues breach of contract breach of the implied covenant of good faith and fair dealing and the state consumer protection statutes.
the parties each sought summary judgment.a magistrate judge recommended that partial summary judgment be granted to jasty on his breach of contract claim,as well as summary judgment on his opposition to wright three counterclaims.as to wright for summary judgment on all of jasty claims,the magistrate judge recommended awarding summary judgment to wright on jasty consumer protection claims and the other claims not on appeal.
wright objected to the magistrate judge report,as permitted by b.as part of the objection,wright included a number of exhibits,many of which had not been before the magistrate judge.the district judge adopted the magistrate judge report in its entirety,while striking the portion of wright objection that relied on the new evidence.
following the summary judgment rulings,a separate jury trial was held on damages,and jasty was awarded approximately million in damages.as requested by wright,however,the district court determined that tennessee law on prejudgment interest would apply,rather than massachusetts law.
on appeal,wright challenges both the district court resolution of the breach of contract claim and the district court failure to consider the new evidence submitted by wright.jasty from the district court denial of his consumer protection claims.jasty also challenges the district court decision not to compel a wright expert to testify,as well as the district court choice of law determination regarding the appropriate prejudgment interest rate.
ii.wright appeal.
we review the district court decision not to consider evidence on summary judgment for an abuse of discretion.see desrosiers hartford life acc,cir.that is to say,we will not set aside a decision by the district court without a definite and firm conviction that the court below committed a clear error of judgment in the conclusion it reached upon a weighing of the relevant factors.hoffman applicators sales,cir.
wright argues that the district court abused its discretion in striking the evidence when it ruled on wright objection to the magistrate judge report.wright had objected to the magistrate judge finding that wright did not provide sufficient notice to jasty that it considered jasty in breach.
wright first says that the district court erred in misapprehending its ability to consider newly submitted evidence.under b,a district court reviewing a magistrate judge report and recommendation has discretion whether to receive further evidence.
a judge of the court shall make a de novo determination of those portions of the report or specified proposed findings or recommendations to which objection is made.a judge of the court may accept,reject,or modify,in whole or in part,the findings or recommendations made by the magistrate judge.the judge may also receive further evidence or recommit the matter to the magistrate judge with instructions.
b emphasis added.wright points to the district court statement in ruling to strike the evidence in the absence of special circumstances,review of a magistrate judge report and recommendation should be limited to the record considered by the magistrate judge special circumstances do not exist here.while this statement may not be a verbatim recitation of section b,it suffices to show that the court understood the it was not required to receive further evidence but rather possessed discretion in the matter.
the magistrate judge report concluded that there is no evidence that wright ever communicated its continuing dissatisfaction to jasty after october emphasis added.in support of its contention that the district court thus should have considered additional evidence of jasty ongoing failure to perform,wright has massaged the language of the magistrate judge observation,arguing that wright was not under an obligation to continually notify jasty that he was not performing under his contract.wright is correct on this point,strictly speaking,but its argument misses the mark.the magistrate judge had determined,not that wright needed to repeatedly provide notice,but rather that the october letter by itself did not provide the required notice and that wright did not later advise jasty of its continuing dissatisfaction.the magistrate judge did not intimate that wright had a duty to continually complain to jasty.moreover,the issue was notice,and evidence about whether jasty sufficiently performed under his contract after october was not probative on that issue we conclude that the district court did not abuse its discretion in declining to consider the new evidence.
wright initially filed a brief in this court that relied on but did not identify the excluded evidence.jasty requested sanctions.first circuit local rule authorizes sanctions for vexatious litigation,where a party or attorney files a motion,brief,or other document that is frivolous or interposed for an improper purpose,such as to harass or cause unnecessary delay,or unreasonably or vexatiously increases litigation costs.wright decision to incorporate the stricken evidence into its briefs without identification as such was inappropriate,but we do not conclude that it was vexatious.see cruz savage,cir in context of,vexatious behavior understood as conduct displaying a serious and studied disregard for the orderly process of justice internal quotation marks and citation omitted.
breach of contract 
our review of the district court rulings on summary judgment is de novo,onebeacon am.ins.travelers indem,cir,keeping in mind that summary judgment is appropriate where no genuine issue of material fact exists and the movant is entitled to judgment as a matter of law.c 
wright challenges the grant of summary judgment to jasty on the breach of contract claim.wright argues that summary judgment is inappropriate because the contract is ambiguous as to whether jasty had an obligation under the contract to provide services to wright after november,wright provided the required written notice of its intent to terminate the contract through the meeting and letter of october and wright had not waived its ability to argue that jasty had breached the contract by continuing to pay jasty through.
wright first argues that the contract is ambiguous as to whether jasty was obligated to provide services after november,and thus the breach claim should not have been resolved on summary judgment.a contract is ambiguous if an agreement terms are inconsistent on their face or where the phraseology can support reasonable differences of opinion as to the meaning of the words employed and obligations undertaken.nicolaci anapol,cir citing lohnes level communications,cir internal quotation marks omitted applying massachusetts law.the meaning of terms in an ambiguous contract is often considered a fact question reserved for a jury.nadherny roseland property,cir.here,the district court found the contract unambiguous and concluded that jasty was not required to provide services to wright under the contract after november,in order to receive royalty payments.
wright points to the agreement paragraph.in support of its argument that the contract is ambiguous.this paragraph provides that after cessation of the annual payments on november,all payments for services shall be pursuant to paragraph.and paragraph.if applicable.one reading of this language is that the contract requires jasty provision of services after november in order for him to continue to be eligible for any payments royalties under paragraph.and ipo payments under.another reading,however,is that,should jasty provide services after november,he would not be compensated through annual payments which would have ceased but only through continued royalty payments,and,if wright went public,the ipo payments.that paragraph,standing alone,could be subject to multiple interpretations is not the last word,however,as we do not interpret individual contract provisions in isolation.mcadams mutual life ins.massmutual,cir.
when the terms of the contract are read together,they are unambiguous in providing that jasty services were not required after november.see nadherny,at terms must be construed together as part of a coherent whole.paragraph.hinges ten years of royalty payments on the fulfillment of one condition the development of an advance knee component for which jasty has had significant design input.this is in contrast to paragraph,which conditions ipo payments on both the occurrence of an ipo and jasty contemporaneous provision of consulting services.
wright urges that paragraph.adds another condition to royalty payments after november further services.if that were so,paragraph.likewise conditions ipo payments on further services.but that interpretation would render superfluous the explicit language in paragraph.conditioning ipo payments on jasty providing consulting services.c onstructions that render contract terms meaningless should be avoided.summit packaging,kenyon kenyon,cir.where services are required in exchange for compensation,the contract explicitly provides for them.we are convinced that royalty payments were not conditioned on jasty provision of services after november wright thus breached the contract by halting royalty payments at the end of.
even if we were to assume arguendo that continued services were required in order for jasty to be eligible for royalty payments,wright faces a second,ultimately insurmountable,hurdle on the question of notice.wright argues that it provided the requisite notice of its intent to terminate the contract,in response to jasty alleged breach,through the meeting and letter of october.
generally,notice must be clear,definite,explicit,and unambiguous.seaboard sur.town of greenfield,cir citing d notice.under massachusetts law,notice must state with reasonable certainty the essential facts required by law or by contract.id.at here,paragraph permits contract termination for cause upon written notice and opportunity to cure.the october letter was insufficient under the written notice and opportunity to cure requirement.
the october letter does not contain the words breach,terminate,notice,or any reference to a period.rather,the letter is,discussing specific future responsibilities that jasty will undertake,and stating that patton,and wright,look ed forward to being able to continue this relationship for a long time.while the letter did mention that wright considered certain conduct of jasty unacceptable and believed it to be frustrating the very purpose of our contract,these comments do not convey wright intent to terminate,nor do they provide a opportunity for jasty to required by paragraph.we agree with the magistrate judge and the district court in concluding that wright breached the contract by discontinuing jasty royalty payments,and that even if wright had not been in breach it did not provide the required notice of its intent to terminate 
consumer protection claims.
jasty challenges the district court decision to grant summary judgment to wright on the consumer protection claims.laws ch.and ann.jasty alleges that there is a factual dispute about whether wright engaged in unfair and deceptive practices,as the consumer protection statutes forbid 
chapter requires a showing of conduct that falls within the penumbra of some,statutory,or other established concept of unfairness is immoral,unethical,oppressive,or unscrupulous and causes substantial injury to consumers or other businesspersons.serpa mcwane,cir citing pmp associates,globe newspaper,internal quotation marks omitted.
jasty makes three distinct allegations of unfair conduct by wright,the most significant of which is his contention that wright sought to induce him to engage in unethical and illegal kickback activities.the other two allegations concern whether wright breached the implied covenant of good faith and fair dealing and whether wright engaged in economic coercion.
the kickback allegation is rooted in patton statement in the october letter that he accept s jasty commitment to use the advance knee in the majority of your knee cases,of or so.jasty argues that wright used the october letter to tie his compensation to his use of wright products.
jasty provided documents in support of his claim that wright pressured him to engage in kickback activities.he submitted an affidavit from an expert in medical ethics,stating 
compensation from a medical device manufacturer to a physician that is contingent upon the physician using a medical device manufacturer products a certain number of times,or a substantial amount of time,or at a volume that the medical device manufacturer,in its discretion,determines is sufficient,is unethical.
emphasis added.jasty also submitted a publication of special fraud alerts from the department of health and human services office of the inspector general,addressing the federal law.that statute provides 
w hoever knowingly and willfully offers or pays any remuneration in cash or in kind to any person to induce such person to purchase,order or arrange for or recommend purchasing or ordering any good,or item for which payment may be made in whole or in part under a federal health care program shall be guilty of a felony.
b.the inspector general publication clarifies that a payment may be considered improper if given to a patient,provider or supplier for recommending or requesting a change from one product to another.in short,compensating someone in order to induce them to buy or use medical products is prohibited,as is receiving such compensation.id.a.
thus,jasty asks us to consider both professional ethical standards and federal law in evaluating whether wright engaged in unfair conduct.we can not ignore,however,jasty own conduct in light of those same standards.in evaluating a claim,courts must evaluate the equities between the parties a plaintiff conduct,his knowledge,and what he reasonably should have known may be factors in determining whether an act or practice is unfair.swanson bankers life.jasty is bound by the same ethical standards and the same federal law,and he entered into this arrangement and accepted both the flat payment and royalty payments until.there is no evidence on the record that jasty complained of the terms or refused to comply.in view of jasty own conduct in the matter,no reasonable factfinder could conclude that wright violated jasty rights under the consumer protection acts through the alleged kickback activity 
we also find insufficient support in the record for jasty remaining two consumer protection claims.the contention that wright breached the implied covenant of good faith and fair dealing by terminating jasty contract in september fails because withholding payment based on a genuine dispute about what a contract requires does not violate chapter.duclersaint fed.mortgage ass n.similarly unavailing is jasty argument that wright engaged in economic coercion by trying to pressure him to accept less money than he deserved,in the course of terminating the contract.wright conduct between september and march may be viewed as pressuring jasty to walk away from the contract however,a party that simply withholds funds but does not engage in any other coercive action is not liable under chapter.see boston pilots motor vessel midnight gambler and east coast excursions,cir defendant repeated offerings of settlements of less than plaintiff view of amount due under contract treads close to the line between a business tactic and an unfair subterfuge,but held not a violation.
compelled testimony.
jasty disputes the district court decision not to allow him to compel wright damages expert to testify.at the damages trial,wright declined to call its expert elliot roth,who had been deposed and designated as a witness expected to testify.jasty sought to call roth as a witness.
a district court ruling as to whether to compel a witness to testify is reviewable for an abuse of discretion.see gomez rivera rodriguez,cir.specifically,a trial court has discretion to decide whether to require a witness to testify for an opposing party.see feliciano rullan,cir see also peterson willie,cir once a witness has been designated as expected to testify at trial,there may be situations when the witness should be permitted to testify for the opposing party this decision is committed to the sound discretion of the district court.in response to jasty attempt to introduce the deposition of the expert into the record,the court stated,compelling the opposing party expert to testify does happen because it does happen an expert is not just like every other witness and can not be sort of conscripted by an opponent.
