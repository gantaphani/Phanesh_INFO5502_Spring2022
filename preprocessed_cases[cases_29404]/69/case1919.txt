code of civil procedure section hereafter section empowers a party to assert a peremptory challenge to a judge upon the filing of an affidavit by the party attorney.subdivision a of section provides in pertinent part the fact that a judge,court commissioner,or referee has presided at or acted in connection with a pretrial conference or other hearing,proceeding,or motion prior to trial and not involving a determination of contested fact issues relating to the merits shall not preclude the later making of the motion provided for herein at the time and in the manner hereinbefore provided.italics added.
the question presented in this case is whether a ruling under civil code section,subdivision c hereafter section c that a plaintiff has demonstrated a substantial probability that he or she will prevail on a claim for punitive damages is a determination of contested fact issues relating to the merits under section,subdivision a.we conclude that it is not such a determination.
factual and procedural background 
jane guardado,a minor,hereafter referred to as the petitioner,lived with her mother and stepfather,rena and abraham islam,in an apartment building located in los angeles.the building was owned by mariposa gardens,a limited partnership mariposa.shapell webb,llc,which was established in,appears to be mariposa general partner.
in october,petitioner sued mariposa for personal injuries resulting from the behavior of the apartment building manager.petitioner named shapell webb in lieu of a doe defendant in december.
in june,petitioner moved for an order authorizing her to conduct pretrial punitive damages discovery under section c.section c bars discovery regarding punitive damages unless the court enters an order permitting such discovery.on july,judge soussan bruguera granted petitioner motion,finding there was a substantial probability petitioner would prevail on her claim for punitive damages.
on july,real party in interest max webb hereafter webb,whom petitioner had named as an individual in lieu of a doe defendant on may,filed a peremptory challenge to judge bruguera pursuant to section.webb peremptory challenge was his first appearance in the action.section,subdivision a provides that a party who has not appeared in an action at the time the case is assigned to a particular judge must assert a challenge under section within days of his or her first appearance.thus,webb challenge was timely.
petitioner opposed the challenge and requested a hearing.she argued the challenge was precluded because it was filed after judge bruguera had made her ruling on the section c motion to conduct pretrial punitive damages discovery.petitioner characterized this ruling as a determination of contested fact issues relating to the merits.see,subd.a.petitioner alternatively argued the challenge was barred because mariposa had earlier lost its right to file a peremptory challenge by not filing one within the allotted time,and webb,an alleged partner of mariposa,was not entitled now to file a separate peremptory challenge on his own behalf.
webb replied to petitioner opposition,contending that a ruling under section c is a discovery ruling and not a determination of a contested fact issue relating to the merits.he also submitted a declaration stating he was not and had never been a partner of mariposa.
judge bruguera conducted a hearing on the section challenge on july.on the day of the hearing,petitioner filed an additional opposition and declaration,changing her theory and now contending webb was a partner of mariposa,not directly but because he was allegedly a partner in a general partnership called shapell webb,which was apparently a partner of mariposa at the time of the alleged tort in.
after conducting the hearing and considering oral argument,judge bruguera indicated she never intended the substantial probability determination under section c to be a determination relating to the merits.she also concluded petitioner argument that webb was not a separate party from mariposa was unavailing and specifically found webb peremptory challenge to be timely and proper.she thus accepted the challenge and transferred the case to another judge.
petitioner filed a petition for writ of mandate arguing judge bruguera erred in accepting the peremptory challenge.we summarily denied the petition because we concluded webb peremptory challenge was timely and not otherwise precluded.the supreme court granted petitioner petition for review and transferred the case back to us with directions that we issue an order to show cause and a decision on the merits.after receiving further briefing and hearing oral argument,we again conclude webb peremptory challenge was timely and proper,and therefore deny petitioner writ petition 
discussion 
a determination under section c is not a determination of contested fact issues relating to the merits 
we first outline the procedure set forth in section c.
a plaintiff seeking pretrial discovery of the profits gained by the defendant by virtue of the latter wrongful conduct and discovery of the financial condition of the defendant must file a motion supported by appropriate affidavits.c.if the court deems a hearing necessary,the court may at any time enter an order permitting the discovery otherwise prohibited by this subdivision if the court finds,on the basis of the supporting and opposing affidavits presented,that the plaintiff has established that there is a substantial probability that the plaintiff will prevail on the claim pursuant to section.ibid.
importantly,the foregoing is immediately followed by the following provision in section c such order shall not be considered to be a determination on the merits of the claim or any defense thereto and shall not be given in evidence or referred to at the trial.we will refer to this sentence as the no merit provision of section c 
the first question is whether the no merit provision of section c is identical to or different from the phrase a determination of contested fact issues relating to the merits that is found in section.we will refer to this sometimes as the parallel provision of section.
we conclude that the no merit provision of section c is broader in application than the parallel provision found in section and includes the scenario envisaged by the parallel provision.both provisions refer to a determination on the merits,but the parallel provision is limited to factual determinations.
merits can not mean different things in these two sections both sections mean to describe by this word the same thing or event,albeit from different perspectives.in section c,the judge decision that there is a probability of success should not affect the actual decision on the merits.in section,the intent is to ensure that a challenge is made before the judge acts on the merits of the case.that is,under both section c and section,the decision rendered is separated from the merits of the case.
we have taken into account that the no merit provision of section c refers to a determination on the merits while the parallel provision refers to a determination relating to the merits.there may be a theoretical distinction between on the merits and relating to the merits.whatever that distinction is,it makes no difference since the central idea in both settings is that the decisions made under these two provisions do not implicate,touch upon,or involve the merits of the controversy.
we conclude that the word merits means one and the same thing in both sections c and.
the second question is whether we are bound by the text of section c when deciding whether a finding under section c that the plaintiff has established that there is a substantial probability that the plaintiff will prevail on the punitive damage claim is,under,section,a determination of contested fact issues relating to the merits.in other words,does the legislative determination that a decision under section c is not on the merits require us to find that a decision under section c is not on the merits for the purposes of section 
we conclude that while,as a court,we have the power to construe the two uses of merits differently,neither the plain
