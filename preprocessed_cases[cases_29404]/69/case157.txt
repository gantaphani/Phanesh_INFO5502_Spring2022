this appeal challenges a jury verdict against an auto dealer for violations of the motor vehicle information and cost savings act,supp.the odometer act and puerto rico general tort statute,laws ann.article.the defendant,autocentro toyota autocentro,asks us to vacate the jury verdict in favor of the two plaintiffs wife and husband when they bought the car in question and enter a judgment in its favor.in the alternative,autocentro seeks either a new trial or an adjustment of the damages awarded by the jury.
these claims for relief might have more force if defendant had protected itself with the required motions and objections at trial.for the most part,though,it did not.however,we do find that the damages award to plaintiff margarita rivera castillo rivera is not supported by the record.therefore,we must vacate rivera damages award and remand to the district court for a determination of the appropriate award on remittitur or for a new trial if rivera declines to accept the remitted amount.we leave the award to carlos ravelo guerrero ravelo undisturbed on appeal.
the plaintiffs purchased a toyota tercel from autocentro in october for or,when the cost of financing was considered.apparently,the defendant disclosed to plaintiffs that the car had been previously titled,though not to whom.however,autocentro also represented to plaintiffs that the car had never been used.indeed,when plaintiffs purchased the car,the odometer registered less than ten miles.
according to plaintiffs,the car developed various rattles and mechanical problems soon after they purchased it.suspicious that their newly purchased car might not be so new,plaintiffs investigated the car title history.that investigation revealed that the tercel was imported by the distributor toyota de puerto rico,then consigned,delivered,sold to autocentro toyota,the defendant,who then sold the car to cabrera car rental eventually,cabrera car rental sold the car back to autocentro.having determined that the prior owner was a car rental agency,plaintiffs suspicions were heightened,and they retained a master mechanic to inspect the car.the mechanic concluded that the car odometer might have been altered.
plaintiffs filed suit in federal court,alleging violations of both article of the law of puerto rico,which states in pertinent part that a person who by an act or omission causes damage to another through fault or negligence shall be obliged to repair the damage so done,laws ann.and the federal odometer act,which states inter alia that a person may not disconnect,reset,alter,or have disconnected,reset,or altered,an odometer of a motor vehicle intending to change the mileage registered by the odometer.in considering the odometer act,originally passed in,congress found that although seventeen states at the time had enacted legislation to prohibit altering odometers,
states without such legislation have found this practice on the increase,especially when a neighboring state has an odometer law.odometers are turned back in states without odometer laws and then cars are marketed at inflated values in states with such laws.thus,state odometer laws are easily circumvented and people in a state with such a law suffer because of this practice.
reprinted in.on this background,congress found that federal action on the issue was desirable and passed the odometer act to establish a national policy against odometer tampering and prevent consumers from being victimized by such abuses.id.
after plaintiffs filed their odometer act and article claims in federal court,and motion practice and discovery were completed,the case was tried before a jury for three days.according to the testimony of plaintiffs witness kenneth cabrera,president and owner of the eponymous car rental concern,the car sat on the lot unrented for approximately two and a half months,and it was driven only once to be filled up with gasoline.because demand for rental cars was low,cabrera resold the car to autocentro,returning physical custody of the car in.in an apparent surprise to all the parties,cabrera also testified that the publicly registered invoice from his company to autocentro was forged in december,two months after plaintiffs bought the car,though it was not clear whether autocentro,toyota credit de puerto rico,or some other entity was responsible for the forgery.in any event,cabrera did not dispute that he resold the car to autocentro,returned possession of the car to autocentro in,and was paid the agreed upon price.
for approximately three months,from until plaintiffs purchased the car in october,autocentro had the tercel in its possession.while it was not uncommon for some cars to remain on the sale lot for that period of time or even longer,the evidence indicated that toyota tercels were among the most popular and cars in puerto fact,the car on defendant lot.therefore,it was somewhat unusual,or,in the eyes of plaintiffs,highly suspect,that an available tercel would remain unsold and unused for that length of time.
plaintiffs also offered the testimony of a master mechanic,josé maldonado,regarding the alleged odometer tampering.the parties disagree as to the precise nature of maldonado testimony and his antecedent knowledge of the car repair history prior to his inspection.although he could not say that the odometer definitely had been altered,maldonado did testify that it was his opinion that the car had been sold with an altered odometer,based on the condition of the nuts and bolts in the transmission and odometer area,the car having been purchased with less than ten miles on the odometer,the car appearing to have a lot more mileage on it than was registered on the odometer at the time of the inspection,and his understanding that the area of the car around the transmission and odometer had not previously been repaired.
finally,plaintiffs called an expert witness to testify regarding plaintiffs economic losses caused by the problems with the car.according to the expert witness,who based his conclusions on information provided by ravelo,the damages were as follows for repairs that would not have been incurred if the car was new that plaintiffs paid in excess of the actual value of the car in taxi fares ravelo incurred because of the unavailability of the car in lost income because ravelo,a freelance court interpreter who charged per hour,lost working hours due to this case and a related administrative complaint and in simple interest at.
other than to elicit testimony that the expert based his calculations on numbers provided by plaintiffs,autocentro did not counter the expert testimony regarding damages.also,defendant did not introduce a mechanic of its own to testify that the odometer had not been altered.autocentro put on two witnesses who were employed by autocentro during the relevant time period richard lee san,the finance manager who sold plaintiffs the car,and josé roberto ramirez suriel,the general manager.lee testified about the details surrounding plaintiffs purchase of the car,including detailed testimony about the documents that were part of the transaction.additionally,he testified that he informed plaintiffs that the car previously had been registered to a company,which he did not identify to plaintiffs,and that the company had not used the car and had been compelled to sell it again.ramirez testified about the business relationship between cabrera car rental and autocentro,the history of their dealings related to the plaintiffs tercel,and the inspection procedures autocentro uses upon receipt of a car into inventory.ramirez also testified that autocentro did not alter the odometer of the car.
after the close of evidence,the jury returned a unanimous verdict for plaintiffs under the odometer act and article.the jury awarded rivera and ravelo each in damages according to the jury verdict form,the jury found that autocentro intentionally defrauded plaintiffs regarding the reading of the odometer in the toyota tercel.as a result,the district court trebled the award pursuant to a,which provides that a person that violates this act,with intent to defraud,is liable for times the actual damages or,whichever is greater.after the district court entered judgment for plaintiffs,the defendant filed a motion for judgment as a matter of law and a motion for new trial or remittitur,both of which were denied.defendant now appeals from the jury verdict,the award of damages,and the district court denial of defendant motions for relief.
autocentro advances three claims of error on appeal.first,it argues that the district court erred in declining to grant defendant motion for judgment as a matter of law,pursuant to federal rule of civil procedure.second,autocentro claims that the district court instructions to the jury regarding damages were flawed.third,defendant urges that the district court erred in failing to grant its motion for a new trial or remittitur under federal rule of civil procedure.as we shall explain,only the latter claim is meritorious,and only then with respect to the award to plaintiff rivera.
motion for judgment as a matter of law 
defendant argues that evidence submitted at trial was insufficient to allow a reasonable jury to conclude that autocentro violated the odometer act when it sold plaintiffs the car in question.even in the best of circumstances,the standards for granting a motion for judgment as a matter of law are stringent.courts may only grant a judgment contravening a jury determination when the evidence points so strongly and overwhelmingly in favor of the moving party that no reasonable jury could have returned a verdict adverse to that party.keisling for progress,cir.in making that determination,courts must consider the evidence and its attendant inferences in the light most favorable to the party.id.at.however,we do not even reach the application of this stringent standard here because defendant failed to preserve the sufficiency of the evidence issue for appeal.
federal rule of civil procedure provides that m otions for judgment as a matter of law may be made at any time before submission of the case to the jury.a.this case was submitted to the jury on february,judgment was entered on february,and autocentro moved for judgment as a matter of law for the first time on march.simply put,defendant failure to move for judgment as a matter of law at the close of evidence procedurally defaults this claim on appeal.see,keisling,at holding that even when a defendant moves under rule at the close of plaintiff autocentro did not even do that i f a defendant wishes to renew a motion for judgment as a matter of law at the stage,with a view to having denial of that motion considered by the court of appeals,the defendant is required to have moved for judgment as a matter of law at the close of all the evidence.as we observed in keisling r equiring the motion to be made at the close of all the evidence gives the opposing party an opportunity to respond to any evidentiary deficiencies noted by the motion by seeking to reopen the evidence prior to submission of the case to the jury.id.at.a party failure to move under rule at the close of all evidence can not be taken lightly jusino zayas,cir.we have consistently held that we will not consider claims of insufficient evidence unless the district court was presented with a motion for judgment as a matter of law at the close of all the evidence.keisling,at see also jusino,at collecting cases dating from.
defendant suggests no reason that our well settled rule should not apply in this case,and we see none in the record.accordingly,we leave undisturbed the district court denial of autocentro motion for judgment as a matter of law.
jury instructions 
autocentro alleges that the district court instructions to the jury regarding damages were erroneous.defendant again suffers a wound on appeal because,in addition to failing to submit proposed instructions at the district court invitation as provided for in rule a,it failed to object to the jury instructions at trial.federal rule of civil procedure provides that a party who objects to an instruction or the failure to give an instruction must do so on the record,stating distinctly the matter objected to and the grounds of the objection.c.the failure to object to the jury instructions at the time,and in the manner,designated by rule is treated as a procedural default moore murphy,cir.silence after instructions ordinarily constitutes a forfeiture of any objections muñiz rovira,cir.again,as with the need to preserve an issue under rule,we have consistently held that the strictures of rule must be followed without deviation.smith.inst.of,cir.
when a party fails to object to the jury instructions below,as autocentro failed to do here,we review the claim on appeal only for plain error.muñiz,at.the well established plain error standard requires autocentro to show an error was committed the error was plain obvious and clear under current law the error was prejudicial affected substantial rights and review is needed to prevent a miscarriage of justice.smith kmart,cir.we have also formulated the fourth prong as requiring a showing that the error seriously impaired the fairness,integrity,or public reputation of judicial proceedings.muñiz,at citing united states duarte,cir see also kmart,at explaining that to merit reversal under plain error review,the error must have resulted in a miscarriage of justice or seriously affected the fairness,integrity or public reputation of the judicial proceedings internal quotations and citations omitted scarfo cabletron,cir noting that.has been rigorously enforced in this circuit,and its clear language will be overlooked only in exceptional cases or under peculiar circumstances to prevent a clear miscarriage of justice,where the error seriously affected the fairness,integrity or public reputation of judicial proceedings internal quotations and citations omitted.we have commented before that p lain error is a rare species in civil litigation,encompassing only those errors that reach the pinnacle of fault kmart,at internal quotations and citations omitted.
here,the district court instructed the jury that 
plaintiffs are suing for actual damages,on account of certain alleged representations made by defendant to plaintiffs any damages that you may award in this case,or any other case,must be based upon evidence in the case and on your dispassionate analysis of the extent of any injuries sustained by plaintiff as a result of the defendant wrong,if any.you are not permitted to award damages on the basis of passion,prejudice,or improper sympathy for or against any of the parties in this case 
in determining any damages recoverable by the plaintiffs,you can consider the following items any emotional pain and mental anguish,if proven any economic damages,if proven.damages may be reasonable,as i said before.they have to be based solely upon the evidence and can not be rendered as punishment.they can not be speculative.they can only be assessed to compensate for actually sustained losses and nothing else.
in its brief,autocentro claims that this instruction was in error because 
t he jury was never given the definition of actual damages or of the calculation of damages as provided by the odometer act.because of the fact that the jury was never instructed on the definition of actual damages and on the fact that only actual damages would be trebled as required by law,autocentro moves the court to not treble the award,since clearly the jury intended ravelo and rivera to receive compensatory damages,and under the federal odometer act these are not trebled.
defendant apparently is unaware that the definitions of actual damages,which are trebled under the odometer act,and compensatory damages,which it claims the jury intended to award,are synonymous.black law dictionary ed defining actual damages and noting that they are a lso termed compensatory damages.to the extent that defendant relies on this misapprehended distinction to support its claim of error,the claim is baseless.
autocentro further claims that we should consider that not informing the jury that the award would be triplicated poses a due process problem,since autocentro was not afforded the constitutional guarantees as to the portion of the award corresponding to the triplication.leaving aside that defendant offers this broad assertion with no supporting legal citation,we find this claim wholly unpersuasive for another reason when discussing the district court proposed verdict form,defense counsel specifically stated that he did not think the issue of treble damages should be addressed to the jury.since the defendant requested that the availability of treble damages not be addressed to the jury,and the district court honored that request,the defendant can not argue on appeal that the district court approach constitutes reversible error.
more troubling is defendant claim that under the odometer act,the measure of actual damages should be limited to the difference in the amount paid by plaintiffs and the amount the car was actually worth given its true condition,along with repair costs that plaintiffs would not have incurred had the car true mileage matched that shown on the odometer.defendant cites scattered district court cases to support this theory of limited damages,and this approach has some intuitive appeal.unfortunately,the term actual damages is not defined in the statute,nor could we find any relevant legislative history clarifying the point.however,as one district court observed the method of calculating damages favored by the courts is to utilize the difference between the fair market value of the car with the actual mileage thereon,and the amount paid for the automobile by the purchaser,plus any other damages that the purchaser may have incurred.williams toyota of jefferson,collecting cases.we found only one case that addressed the availability of lost wages,and there the district court excluded testimony which the plaintiff offered at trial to establish the value of lost wages,on the grounds that such damages are too remote to be recoverable under the odometer act.jones fenton ford.another court has held that in the absence of a statutory definition of actual damages,it seems reasonable to give it the meaning commonly applied to fraud cases.duval midwest auto city,aff,cir.in turn,the restatement second of torts explains that in fraud cases,
t he recipient of a fraudulent misrepresentation is entitled to recover as damages in an action of deceit against the maker the pecuniary loss to him of which the misrepresentation is a legal cause,including a the difference between the value of what he has received in the transaction and its purchase price or other value given for it and b pecuniary loss suffered otherwise as a consequence of the recipient reliance upon the misrepresentation.
this last the definitions of damages derived from fraud result in the availability of pecuniary damages,presumably including lost wages if a proper showing of causation could be made,but likely exclude recovery for such nonpecuniary damages as emotional pain and mental anguish.see steven gaynor,annotation,fraud actions right to recover for mental or emotional distress,damages in an action for fraud are generally limited to actual pecuniary loss however,this rule is not without exceptions.collecting and analyzing cases.
we acknowledge,then,that in a case where the issue was properly raised,a substantial argument could be made that violations of the odometer act should be treated as a species of fraud,and the actual damages recoverable should be limited to pecuniary damages,which might include lost wages.however,as we have emphasized,defendant procedural lapses with respect to the jury instructions require us to apply plain error review.even if the inclusion of emotional pain and mental anguish in the jury instructions on damages constituted error an issue we do not decide,the error would not be plain because of the absence of a statutory definition of actual damages,the lack of legislative history,and the inconclusive nature of the available precedents.
moreover,the district court instructions did not result in a miscarriage of justice or affect the fairness,integrity,or public reputation of the proceedings below.defendant did not propose jury instructions.it did not object to the instructions given by the district court.it did not afford the district court a timely opportunity to rule on the issues it now raises on appeal.its one the issue of treble damages not be addressed to the honored.under the circumstances,we think our words from over a decade ago apply with force in the present case 
the plain error standard is near its zenith in the rule milieu it strains credulity well past the breaking point to argue that the defendants plight can fit within so exclusive a classification.
moreover,to employ the plain error exception in this situation would sow the seeds for a mischievous harvest and would be fundamentally unfair to both the plaintiff and the district court.rules serve a valuable purpose.without them,the judicial system would be in shambles.it follows that,in the ordinary case,parties flout rules at their peril.
toscano chandris,cir.so it is here.we find no plain error in the district court instructions that would entitle autocentro to relief from the jury verdict on appeal.
motion for a new trial or remittitur 
finally,autocentro claims that the district court erred in declining to grant its motion for new trial or remittitur under federal rule of civil procedure.rule provides in relevant part that a new trial may be granted in an action in which there has been a trial by jury,for any of the reasons for which new trials have heretofore been granted in actions at law in the courts of the united states.a.we have stated that a district court may exercise its discretion to grant a rule motion if the verdict is against the weight of the evidence,that the damages are excessive,or that,for other reasons,the trial was not fair to the party moving and may raise questions of law arising out of alleged substantial errors in admission or rejection of evidence or instructions to the jury.cigna fire underwriters macdonald johnson,cir quoting montgomery ward duncan.district courts may set aside a jury verdict and order a new trial only if the verdict is so clearly against the weight of the evidence as to amount to a manifest miscarriage of justice.federico order of saint benedict in rhode island,cir.
we review denials of motions for a new trial or remittitur for abuse of discretion by the district court.see,trull volkswagen of america,cir.on appeal,we will find that a district court abused its discretion only if the jury verdict exceeds any rational appraisal or estimate of the damages that could be based on the evidence before the jury milone moceri family,cir quoting segal gilbert color,cir.
the damages award to ravelo 
as to the awarded to ravelo,defendant argument is unpersuasive.plaintiffs introduced an expert witness who testified that ravelo economic damages were approximately.ravelo also testified regarding the extent of damages he incurred.defendant introduced no rebuttal witnesses regarding the extent of plaintiffs damages.to be sure,ravelo evidence was not overwhelming.in entering judgment for the plaintiffs,the district court observed that while the jury verdict may contradict the bench assessment of the evidence,viewing the facts in the light most favorable to plaintiffs allows for a liberal jury interpretation of the matters at issue.as the district court rightly observed,courts are not entitled to substitute their view of the evidence for the verdict reached by the jury.only when the verdict is a manifest miscarriage of justice,federico,at,or the damages awarded are grossly excessive,inordinate,shocking to the conscience of the court,or so high that it would be a denial of justice to permit it to stand,will courts intervene to upset a jury verdict and award.segal,at internal quotations and citations omitted.
although we might characterize the award to ravelo as generous,it is grounded in evidence adduced at trial and does not shock the conscience of the court.therefore,we can not conclude that the district court abused its discretion by refusing to disturb the jury verdict to ravelo either by ordering a new trial or granting a remittitur of the damages.
the damages award to rivera 
the damages award to rivera presents a
