background 
in romo ford motor th,d,we were presented with an appeal from the judgment in a personal injury and wrongful death case arising from a rollover accident.that opinion contains a more detailed statement of the facts and procedural history of the case for present purposes,we summarize the facts only briefly.
the romo family was riding in their ford bronco when it rolled over as plaintiff juan ramon romo was trying to avoid a car that had swerved in front of him.ramon,salustia,and ramiro romo were killed in the accident when the steel portion of the bronco roof collapsed and the fiberglass portion shattered.juan,evangelina,and maria romo were injured.
b.the trial 
in a products liability action brought by the surviving romos individually and on behalf of the estates of the deceased family members,the jury awarded compensatory damages from ford motor company ford after adjustments by the trial court of nearly million.in addition,the jury awarded the romos punitive damages from ford in the amount of million.ford did not move for bifurcation of the punitive damages portion as a result,there was a unified trial and the jury returned a single verdict on all issues.after the trial court granted ford motion for new trial of the punitive damages issues based on jury misconduct,both sides appealed.
c.the first appeal 
ford raised numerous issues concerning both the compensatory damages aspect and the punitive damages aspect of the case.we concluded all of ford contentions were without merit.the romos appealed from the order granting a new trial on punitive damages.we determined that the record rebutted any presumption of prejudicial juror misconduct and that the new trial motion was granted in error.the net result of the appeal was that the judgment was reinstated and affirmed.
after the california supreme court denied ford petition for review on all issues,ford filed a petition for certiorari in the united states supreme court.on may,the court granted the petition,vacated the judgment,and remanded the case to us for further consideration in light of state farm.ford motor romo.
ii.discussion 
our effort to comply with the instructions from the united states supreme court has required us to reexamine the purpose and nature of punitive damages and to revisit certain pivotal california appellate cases,chief among them grimshaw ford motor d.grimshaw.we attempt to report the results of this reexamination in as summary a fashion as the subject permits and not to write a treatise on the subject of punitive damages.
a.the statute f or the sake of example and by way of punish ment 
civil code section,subdivision a,provides in an action for the breach of an obligation not arising from contract,where it is proven by clear and convincing evidence that the defendant has been guilty of oppression,fraud,or malice,the plaintiff,in addition to the actual damages,may recover damages for the sake of example and by way of punishing the defendant.civil code section,subdivision a,with certain restrictions,permits introduction of evidence in a punitive damages case of t he profits the defendant has gained by virtue of the wrongful course of conduct of the nature and type shown by the evidence and of the financial condition of the defendant.
punishment and deterrence 
the purpose of punitive damages is to punish wrongdoers and thereby deter the commission of wrongful acts.neal farmers ins.exchange cal d,fn.of course,there are degrees of punishment and deterrence.one way to deter parking meter violations would be forfeiture of the cars of parking offenders.the law does not do that,but the law does seek to deter drug traffickers through forfeiture of cars used to transport drugs.see health,et even in the case of parking meter violations,however,it can not be disputed that the purpose of the relatively small monetary fine is to punish wrongdoers and thereby deter the commission of wrongful acts,to borrow the phrase from neal farmers ins.exchange,supra,cal d at page,footnote.
in the case of punitive damages,the degree of punishment and deterrence that can be exacted under state law is subject to limits arising from the due process clause of the fourteenth amendment.state farm,supra,at.at.in reconsidering the present case in light of state farm,we believe the inquiry profitably and initially may focus on two questions first,what is sought to be punished and deterred and,second,how is that action to be punished and deterred while at first glance the answer to these questions seems straightforward,malicious conduct,money,consideration of california punitive damages precedent in light of the restrictions articulated in state farm seems to us to require a more nuanced consideration of those answers.
what is to be deterred punishment of private wrongs 
there is a fundamental difference between parking fines and drug forfeitures,on the one hand,and punitive damages,on the other.in the former case,the exactions arise from public is,wrongs against society.in the case of punitive damages,the exaction arises from a private wrong if there is no wrong resulting in compensable injury to this plaintiff,there can be no exaction of punitive damages.see,jackson johnson th,d.by contrast,in the case of public wrongs,the law seeks to enforce compliance with norms of conduct through the infliction of punishment regardless of the existence of an identifiable victim in a particular case no one needs to be waiting for the parking space in order to justify the issuance of a parking ticket.
moreover,in the case of private wrongs,our common law tradition does not seek to punish and deter ordinary private wrongs normally,the sole purpose of a damages award in tort is to compensate a wrongfully injured party for injury to person or property.see prosser keeton on torts ed,hereafter prosser keeton see also.if,for example,a driver negligently causes a collision in which one person in the other car is severely injured and another in the same car is uninjured,the negligent driver is required to pay damages only to the party who has suffered loss.the driver is not punished for his or her lack of due care through an award to the uninjured person.in other words,the system of compensatory damages is concerned merely with the allocation of losses arising out of human activities prosser keeton,by requiring the person in fault to pay compensation for detriment suffered by another.
for more than two centuries,common law courts have recognized that certain wrongful acts constitute an affront to honor and dignity,and that this affront is not a loss that the common law normally compensates with a damages award.prosser keeton,supra.perhaps in recognition that offenses to honor were particularly likely to result in extrajudicial retribution if not sufficiently compensated within the judicial system,common law courts permitted an award of exemplary or punitive damages in certain cases of outrageous behavior without any pretext that the award was compensating the victim for some otherwise compensable loss.see generally colby,beyond the multiple punishment problem punitive damages as punishment for individual,private wrongs,hereafter private wrongs.such damages are given to the plaintiff over and above the full compensation for the injuries,for the purpose of punishing the defendant,of teaching the defendant not to do it again,and of deterring others from following the defendant example.prosser keeton,supra.even though the resulting award sought to punish the defendant rather than to compensate the plaintiff,cases recognized that the punishment was for the particular affront to the plaintiff,not a broader sanction for an affront to society at large.private wrongs,supra,at.consequently,from an early date it was required that the punitive damages award bear some reasonable relationship to the individual injury and the compensatory damages awarded in the action,at.
what is to be deterred punishment of wrongs 
the idea of awarding punitive damages based purely on a conception of torts as private wrongs lost favor in the era of products liability litigation.in cases of consumer goods or practices of large insurers,outrageous or malicious wrongdoing was no longer simply an affront to the dignity of a single victim.instead,the affront was to all affected by the goods or services or,given the reach of the misconduct,the affront was viewed as one to society as a whole.in this view,because the wrong was directed beyond the immediate plaintiff,punitive damages awards needed to be based on the overall scope of the wrong in order to punish and deter the mass torts.see private wrongs,supra.at describing such punitive damages as total harm damages see also mallor robers,punitive damages toward a principled approach hastings.as the issue became less the inadequacy of common law measures of damages as a satisfactory substitute for and more a question of preventing outrageous wrongdoing,it was thought that,in order to be effective,punitive damages had to render the overall conduct unprofitable or prohibitively costly.id.at see cummings medical occupational medical th,d.
the issue was presented to the court of appeal in grimshaw,supra,d,the products liability action involving the ford pinto.there,ford argued,as phrased by the court,that the legislature was thinking in terms of traditional intentional torts,such as,libel,slander,assault and battery,malicious prosecution,trespass,and could not have intended civil code section to be applied to a products liability case arising out of a design defect in a mass produced automobile because neither strict products liability nor mass produced automobiles were known when the law was enacted in.id.at.the court rejected this narrow view of the purpose of the punitive damages statute.the court stated to paraphrase li yellow cab cal d,the applicable rules of construction permit if not require that civil code section be interpreted so as to give dynamic expression to the fundamental precepts which it summarizes.id.at.governmental safety standards and the criminal law have failed to provide adequate consumer protection against the manufacture and distribution of defective products.citations.punitive damages thus remain as the most effective remedy for consumer protection against defectively designed mass produced articles.ibid.thus,the goal of punitive damages came to be seen largely as actual deterrence of a broad course of conduct through sanctions imposed in individual litigation.
how to punish and deter california broad view 
in addition to its broad view of the goal of punitive damages,the grimshaw court also adopted the broad view of the measure of punitive damages unlike malicious conduct directed toward a single specific individual,ford tortious conduct endangered the lives of thousands of pinto purchasers.weighed against the factor of reprehensibility,the punitive damage award was not excessive.grimshaw,supra,d at.further,the grimshaw court stated an award which is so small that it can be simply written off as a part of the cost of doing business would have no deterrent effect.an award which affects the company pricing of its product and thereby affects its competitive advantage would serve as a deterrent.id.at.in grimshaw itself there was no issue of the maximum amount of punitive damages that could be awarded the punitive damage award by the trial court was times the compensatory damages.d at.
in keeping with familiar rules of stare decisis,we applied the broad standards for punitive damages established by california case law in our original opinion in this case.to be sure,such standards were subject to limitations or guideposts established in bmw of north america,gore,d.but,as evidenced in our original opinion,we applied these guideposts in light of the broad purposes and broad measure of punitive damages,in which courts undertook to actually deter a practice or course of conduct by depriving the wrongdoer of profit from the course of conduct or making such conduct so expensive it put the wrongdoer at a competitive disadvantage.see grimshaw,supra,d at.punishment and deterrence in this view is far along a scale that might be viewed as increasing from mere admonition toward direct incapacitation.
punishment and deterrence in state farm the narrow view reasserted 
state farm,in our view,impliedly disapproved this broad view of the goal and measure of punitive damages.instead,as a matter of due process under the federal constitution,the court adopted the more limited,historically based view of punitive damages.see private wrongs,supra.at although this law review article preceded state farm by a month,much of its approach to the issues is quite prescient.in doing so,the court in state farm went beyond the guideposts established in gore and articulated a constitutional due process limitation on both the goal and the measure of punitive damages.further,the result is a punitive damages analysis that focuses primarily on what defendant did to the present plaintiff,rather than the defendant wealth or general incorrigibility.see state farm,supra,at.at.
what is to be punished,revisited 
thus,the state farm court first limited the goal that the states are permitted to reach through punitive damages due process does not permit courts,in the calculation of punitive damages,to adjudicate the merits of other parties hypothetical claims against a defendant under the guise of the reprehensibility analysis state farm,supra,at.at.punishment on the basis that harm is minor to the individual but massive in the aggregate creates the possibility of multiple punitive damages awards for the same conduct for in the usual case nonparties are not bound by the judgment some other plaintiff obtains.ibid.while states enjoy considerable discretion in deducing when punitive damages are warranted,each award must comport with the principles set forth in gore.here the argument that state farm will be punished in only the rare case,coupled with reference to its assets had little to do with the actual harm sustained by the campbells.id.at.at.as we read state farm,then,the legitimate state goal that punitive damages may seek to achieve is the condemnation of such conduct as has resulted in outrage and humiliation to the plaintiffs before the court ibid.it is not a permissible goal to punish a defendant for everything else it may have done wrong 
how to punish and deter,revisited 
in addition to limiting the goal to be reached through punitive damages,the court rejection of the broad view of punitive established in california by must result in a reconsideration of the standard of constitutional excessiveness by which punitive damages are constrained.as we demonstrated in our prior opinion in this case,the broad view of punitive damages fully supported the million punitive damages award in the present case.that massive award,however,was justified only as a means to actually punish and deter an entire course of conduct that harmed not only plaintiffs but,potentially,untold others.in state farm,the court made it clear that the permissible punishment is for the harm inflicted on the present plaintiffs.a defendant should be punished for the conduct that harmed the plaintiff,not for being an unsavory individual or business.state farm,supra,at.at see also id.at.at.deterrence,in this view,arises as a natural result of imposing damages over and above traditional compensatory damages,not from the imposition of sanctions in an individual case that are actually disabling to the defendant 
the issue for the state farm court,by contrast with the grimshaw view for example,is not whether a particular punitive damages award is sufficient actually and in fact to dissuade the course of conduct but,instead,whether such award punishes and deters to an extent found sufficient historically.state farm,supra,at.at.accordingly,the court used as a guide to the proper level of punishment and deterrence the long legislative history,dating back over years and going forward to today,providing for sanctions of double,treble,or quadruple damages to deter and punish.ibid.the court found that these multipliers demonstrate what should be obvious multipliers are more likely to comport with due process,while still achieving the state goals of deterrence and retribution ibid.when considered in light of products liability actions against large corporate defendants for which multipliers may simply be a cost of doing business see grimshaw,supra,d at,the court conclusion is far from obvious.however,in the light of the historical goal and measure of punitive damages,the obviousness appears,to a certain extent 
which single digit sufficiently punishes and deters 
although the need to limit most punitive damages awards to a multiplier was obvious to the supreme court,there was not a particular single digit that appeared appropriate in all cases,according to the court.state farm,supra,at.at.by restating the guidelines articulated in gore,the state farm opinion recognized that even within the limited punitive and deterrent functions of punitive damages,there are malicious and outrageous acts that deserve a harsher sanction than other acts,even though the latter are also malicious or outrageous.the state farm opinion did,it seems to us,explain the gore factors in a way that was not apparent in gore itself.we will discuss state farm amplification of the three gore factors before we turn to the application of the factors in the present case.
the court reiterated that reprehensibility of the defendant conduct is the most important consideration in determining the reasonableness of a punitive damages award.state farm,supra,at.at.as discussed above,however,the court newly emphasized that the conduct directed toward the plaintiff was the focus of this inquiry.conduct that is widespread or has other victims can enhance reprehensibility in somewhat the same manner recidivism enhances the seriousness of criminal conduct.unlike criminal recidivism,however,in which prior dissimilar conduct can transform a relatively minor current felony into a crime punishable by life in prison see,subds.b i,in the context of civil actions courts must ensure the conduct in question replicates the prior transgressions.state farm,supra,at.at.further,as previously discussed,in the case of widespread malicious conduct that causes relatively minor individualized injury,the basic level of reprehensibility is not increased through repetition.due process does not permit courts,in the calculation of punitive damages,to adjudicate the merits of other parties hypothetical claims against a defendant under the guise of the reprehensibility analysis.ibid.
in its treatment of the second gore factor,the reasonable relationship requirement,the state farm court gave this additional guidance while a higher multiplier might be appropriate where noneconomic harm is difficult to detect or to value under traditional compensatory damages standards,the converse is also true when compensatory damages are substantial,then a lesser ratio,perhaps only equal to compensatory damages,can reach the outermost limit of the due process guarantee.state farm,supra,at.at.further,the court instructed that we must look at the nature of the compensatory damages award,with the result that a lower multiplier will be appropriate if the compensatory damages award for the particular tort already compensates for the outrage and humiliation that punitive damages are primarily intended to condemn.id.at.at.
state farm treatment of the third gore factor fundamentally altered that factor,it appears to us.gore had implied that greater punitive damages would be reasonable if the state imposed severe civil and criminal penalties for similar conduct.see gore,supra,at.in state farm,by contrast,the court discounted the fact that malicious conduct might fit within the definition of serious criminal conduct as defined by state law punitive damages are not a substitute for the criminal process,and the remote possibility of a criminal sanction does not automatically sustain a punitive damages award.state farm,supra,at.at.the existence of a criminal penalty fits better within the reprehensibility guidepost as having bearing on the seriousness with which a state views the wrongful action.ibid.logically,this bearing extends to giving the tortfeasor notice of the seriousness of the offensive conduct.however,g reat care must be taken to avoid use of the civil process to assess criminal penalties.ibid.
c.the jury instructions in this case in light of state farm 
now that we have set forth our understanding of state farm,we come to the task of applying that opinion as part of our independent review of the punitive damages award.cooper industries,leatherman tool group,d.
first,we conclude state farm constitutionalization of the historical,punitive damages doctrines as part of federal due process means that the jury was fundamentally misinstructed concerning the amount of punitive damages it could award in the present case in particular,under baji,the jury in this case was instructed that,in addition to other factors,it should consider in arriving at an award of punitive damages t he amount of punitive damages which will have a deterrent effect on the defendant in the light of defendant financial condition.as we have discussed above,this view of actual deterrence,while clearly supported by california law under grimshaw,fails to restrict the jury to punishment and deterrence based solely on the harm to the plaintiffs,as apparently required by federal due process.see state farm,supra,at.at.
other portions of the instruction required that the jury find malice in the conduct on which you base your finding of liability.this requirement established a threshold for the imposition of punitive damages,but it did not restrict the amount of the award.accordingly,plaintiffs counsel argued that the award should be large enough to force ford to recall all remaining broncos still on the road and crush them to dust.counsel argued that billion was the appropriate award,based on the profit ford made on all broncos,factored to reflect ford use of that money over the next years.finally,counsel requested billion so that the resulting publicity would reach all remaining owners of this model bronco so they would know how dangerous the vehicle was.these considerations are impermissible under state farm and plaintiffs argument served to magnify the impact of the misinstruction.
while the underlying facts supporting a punitive damages award are for the jury to decide,the amount of punitive damages must be independently reviewed on appeal.cooper industries,leatherman tool group,supra,at.in conducting such review,we remove any prejudice accruing to the defendant as a result of misinstruction concerning the amount of such award we do so by modifying the judgment to reflect a level of punitive damages below which we believe no properly instructed jury was reasonably likely to go.people watson cal d.accordingly,our reduction of the award satisfies the due process interests of defendant.
while we determine that punitive damages in the reduced amount are not constitutionally excessive,we also note that our review of the factors informing the punitive damages award undoubtedly results in an award somewhere near the top of the permissible range,subject to certain anomalies particular to the present case.see fns.and accompanying text,post.our resolution of this case,permitting plaintiffs to consent to a reduction of damages to a level below which a properly instructed jury would not likely go,satisfies the due process and appellate rights of the plaintiffs.
constitutional excessiveness in light of state farm 
as we concluded in our original opinion in this case,the independent review to which a defendant is constitutionally entitled goes solely to the issue of excessiveness of the punitive damages award see also diamond woodworks,argonaut ins,supra,th at,d factual issues are resolved under traditional standards of substantial evidence review see id.at,d and our previous conclusions concerning the jury findings in this case were unaffected by state farm 
reprehensibility 
substantial evidence supports the jury implicit conclusion that ford acted with malicious conduct under aggravated circumstances such a set of facts propels this situation toward the higher end of the reprehensibility scale.see romo,supra,th at,d.as stated in our original opinion,not only did ford willfully and consciously ignore the dangers to human life inherent in the bronco as designed,resulting in the deaths of three persons ibid,it also ignored its own internal safety standards,created a false appearance of the presence of an integral,and declined to test the strength of the roof before placing it in production.ibid.the same conduct see state farm,supra,at.at see fn,ante,at that resulted in the death of three of plaintiffs family members also put at risk all who drove or rode in this model bronco.
defendant conduct was highly reprehensible under gore based on the following defendant caused a high degree of physical harm,including deathly harm,to the victims of the instant accident the nonaccidental,malicious conduct in placing the defective model ford bronco with consumers,including these victims,while not intentionally causing the present deaths and injuries,reflected,in a nonisolated manner,a reckless disregard of consumers safety and lives and the victims were financially vulnerable relative to defendant financial resources.
while we do not preclude the possibility that other conduct,such as intentionally causing death or serious physical injury,might be more reprehensible,the present conduct was extremely reprehensible for conduct occurring in a products liability context.the reprehensibility factor see gore,supra,at.weighs heavily in favor of substantial punitive damages.
the relationship between compensatory and punitive damages 
because of the nature of the causes of action in the present case and the jury peculiar allocation of compensatory damages,application of the second gore factor see state farm,supra,at.at is rather complex.nevertheless,it is possible on the present record to reach certain conclusions about the relationship between compensatory damages and a reasonable award of punitive damages.the following detailed exposition of the compensatory damages award provides the foundation.
a.the plaintiffs as individuals,heirs,and personal representative 
the plaintiffs in this case sought damages in three different capacities.as administrator of the estates of his deceased family members,juan romo sought damages pursuant to code of civil procedure section hereafter section for loss or damage that the decedent sustained or incurred before death,including any penalties or punitive or exemplary damages that the decedent would have been entitled to recover had the decedent lived,and not including damages for pain,suffering,or disfigurement.next,as individuals suffering personal injury,all three plaintiffs sought economic and noneconomic damages arising from their own physical and emotional injuries in the accident.finally,as heirs of the deceased persons,the three plaintiffs sought wrongful death damages pursuant to code of civil procedure section,which permits an award of such damages that,under all the circumstances of the case,may be just,but not including damages recoverable under section.
b.the instructions concerning plaintiffs differing capacities 
the jury instructions were not totally clear about the three different capacities the jury was instructed with the series of instructions,baji through,concerning compensation of each plaintiff for all loss or harm,provided that you find it was or will be suffered by the plaintiff and was caused by the defendant conduct.baji,as given.the instruction was not modified to distinguish between the individual plaintiffs and juan ramon romo as a representative plaintiff,nor to reflect that the estates were plaintiffs for purposes of the section actions.
next,the jury was instructed with baji,concerning damages to the three individual plaintiffs as the heirs of ramon,salustia,and ramiro romo,deceased.this instruction informed the jury that you may consider the financial support,if any,which each of said heirs would have received from the deceased except for such death,and the right to receive support,if any,which each of said heirs has lost by reason of such death.you also may consider the costs of obtaining substitute domestic services.this is economic damage.the jury was instructed that it could not consider pain and suffering of a decedent.
finally,the jury was instructed it must award an amount that will compensate for whatever reasonable expense was paid out or incurred for funeral services in memory of a decedent and for burial of the bodies this is economic damage.in the written version of the instructions,this portion is included at the end of baji and one would infer that the award would compensate the heirs for the funeral expenses.
absent from the instructions was any specific reference to the damages to be awarded to the estates of the deceased persons or to juan ramon romo as administrator of those estates.
c.the confused categorization of damages in the verdict 
the verdict form,after questions concerning liability issues,included the following directions concerning the amount of damages w hat do you find to be the total amount of damages,including economic and damages,if any,suffered by the plaintiffs and caused by either the defective ford bronco or the negligence of the defendant ford motor company answer as to each plaintiff as designated below.the form continued as set out below.numbers have been inserted to reflect the jury entries before modification by the court the numbers in italics reflect the awards as modified by the court to reflect the comparative negligence adjustments and the judgment notwithstanding the verdict reductions.
in addition,the jury found that defendant had committed malice in the conduct upon which the jury base d its finding of liability.the jury filled in the following sentence,as indicated we assess exemplary and punitive damages against ford motor company as follows amount.
the jury allocated percent of fault to defendant,percent to the driver who swerved in front of the romos,and percent to juan ramon romo.the court reduced certain of the damages awarded in accordance with this allocation of fault.
d.the motions 
defendant moved for a new trial or judgment notwithstanding the verdict on the basis,among others,that the award to the estates of ramon and salustia romo was not supported by the evidence,in light of the limitations on these damages under section the trial court conditionally granted the new trial motion,permitting plaintiffs to avoid a new trial by accepting a reduction of compensatory damages to for each estate.plaintiffs accepted the reduction.
analysis of the verdict 
the verdict and the court modification of it obviously reflect some confusion on the part of the jury concerning the categorization of the award of damages to plaintiffs in their different capacities.for present purposes,however,we can glean with sufficient clarity what the jury intended to do,and can use that result to determine the constitutional limits of the punitive damages award.
first,the award made by the jury for economic damages to the estates should have been entered as economic damages to all heirs on the wrongful death lines of the verdict form.those figures most likely reflect the loss of financial support and the value of lost household services through the birthday of the youngest of the romo survivors,maria.the jury was specifically instructed to award damages for loss of financial support and value of household services as economic damages none of the other economic damages entries is large enough to constitute an award consistent with the evidence,yet proof of such loss was clear.the figures entered for economic damages on the wrongful death lines in the verdict as rendered most likely reflect funeral and burial expenses.
second,the large awards for noneconomic damages awarded to the surviving children likely contained some component for loss of love,companionship,comfort,affection,society,solace or moral support as a result of the death of their parents and brother,when the award of noneconomic damages is compared to the figures suggested for this particular loss by plaintiffs counsel in argument to the jury.this component of damages was properly awarded to the children in their capacity as heirs,as the jury was instructed in baji.the jury apparently awarded it separately to each individual plaintiff,instead of awarding a lump sum on the line for noneconomic damages for all heirs it awarded zero on that line.it is,of course,impossible to determine the exact segment of the children noneconomic damages award attributable to their emotional distress claims,their pain and suffering claims,and their heirship claims,not only because the verdict form does not break out those segments,but also because the segments are not distinct in definition and logic they address overlapping elements of loss.
third,the larger award of noneconomic damages to juan,who was most seriously injured,seems to indicate that the premodification million noneconomic damages award to maria and evangelina arose largely from their loss of family members,rather than for physical pain and suffering.in turn,this indicates a substantial portion of juan initial award up to million is likely based on loss of his family members,rather than his physical pain and suffering.
f.the reasonable relationship factor 
these conclusions concerning the jury compensatory damages award obviously are not precise enough to support reformation of the verdict through grant of judgment notwithstanding the verdict,or otherwise.nor is the matter of reformation of the compensatory award breakdown before us.nevertheless,our conclusions provide a framework in which we can consider the issue of constitutional excessiveness of the punitive damages award for purposes of both permitting plaintiffs to avoid a retrial and protecting the due process rights of defendant.
there are two points to be made based on these conclusions,one of major importance and one of lesser importance.first,no one would deny that a decedent has lost something valuable when he or she loses life.yet there was no award whatsoever in the original no possibility of such an award under the the outrage to the deceased family members themselves,occasioned by their loss of the opportunity for the personal satisfactions,large and small,that make life worth living 
such loss to the decedent is not a proper subject of compensatory damages for the estate or the heirs.plaintiffs as individuals and as heirs of the deceased family members were adequately compensated for their losses,as such losses are recognized by statute and in our common law tradition.the decedents were could not compensated for the loss of their lives.
compensation,however,is not the issue.punitive damages are not intended to compensate instead they are intended to punish and make an example of the defendant as a result of defendant malicious conduct,subd.a.in this context of malicious conduct,as opposed to ordinary negligence actions,public policy and legitimate interests of the state in the protection of its people require a mechanism to punish and deter conduct that kills people.it would be unacceptable public policy to establish a system in which it is less expensive for a defendant malicious conduct to kill rather than injure a victim.grimshaw,supra,d at.thus,the state has an extremely strong interest in being able to impose sufficiently high punitive damages in wrongful death actions to deter a cheaper to kill them mindset,while still maintaining limits on wrongful death compensation in cases of ordinary negligence.we do not perceive that due process considerations of proportionality between compensatory and punitive damages require a state to establish a system that inadequately punishes and deters malicious conduct that,with reasonable foreseeability,may cause death we hold that death actions present an example of the type of extraordinary case contemplated by state farm see state farm,supra,at.at in which a multiplier does not necessarily form an appropriate limitation upon a punitive damages award.
this is not to say that all standards are thrown out in cases brought by personal representatives of the estates of deceased victims.even among instances of malicious conduct that causes death,some of such conduct will be more or less reprehensible than other instances.we conclude,however,that the proportionality factor has less weight in the context of malicious conduct causing death.given the unique nature of the compensatory damages arising under section,the proportionality inquiry must focus,in any event,on the relationship of punitive damages to the harm to the deceased victim,not merely to compensatory damages awarded.see romo ford motor,supra,th at,d.
further,the legal standard for the award of compensatory damages in section actions ensures that there is no punitive component in the compensatory damages award in such actions as a result there is no danger of duplicative damages in a punitive damages award under section,as there was in the context of the emotional distress compensatory award in state farm.see state farm,supra,at.at.finally,in the rather unique circumstances of the present case,because ramiro romo estate was awarded no compensatory damages,defendant is not punished in any way whatsoever for depriving ramiro of his life.thus,as a result of this cumulative undercompensation,a higher ratio between compensatory and punitive damages may be justified with respect to juan ramon romo as administrator of the estates of his mother and father.ibid.
by contrast,in the case of the individual plaintiffs personal injury claims,a large portion of the compensatory damages award was for noneconomic damages.because some component of this award,particularly as related to plaintiffs emotional distress claims,likely involved considerations similar to the punitive damages award,a somewhat lesser multiplier is appropriate as to those damages.see state farm,supra,at.at.
the second,less important point arising from our review of the jury verdict is that loss of financial support and the value of household services were legitimate items of compensable economic loss for the heirs,and because of the jury mistake in placing that award on the wrong line,the compensatory damages award for the plaintiffs was about less than the jury most likely intended.this undercompensation of actual loss supports a higher ratio between the compensatory damages and punitive damages on plaintiffs individual and heirship claims.state farm,supra,at.at.
comparable civil and criminal punishments 
we turn to the third gore factor,disparity between criminal and civil penalties for similar conduct and the size of the award in the present case.state farm,supra,at.at.willful and conscious disregard of danger resulting in loss of life can constitute involuntary manslaughter.romo,supra,th at,d.by the same token,the failure of prosecutors to seek criminal convictions in cases of the present sort does not permit an enhancement of the punitive damages award in a civil case.state farm,supra,at.at.we conclude the third gore factor requires neither a higher nor lower ratio between the compensatory and punitive damages award.
conclusion the point at which the state legitimate objectives are satisfied 
our independent review in this case convinces us that the extreme reprehensibility of defendant actions and the undercompensation of plaintiffs individual losses outweigh the punitive element already contained to some extent in the individual compensatory damages awards.as a result,we consider that a punitive damages award of triple the compensatory award to the individual plaintiffs would be constitutionally reasonable.an award of three times the compensatory d
