ivax pharmaceuticals,ivax and cipla,cipla appeal from the order of the united states district court for the district of delaware entering judgment upholding the validity of united states reissue patent the patent in favor of forest laboratories,forest laboratories holding,and lundbeck collectively forest and enjoining ivax and cipla from infringing the patent.we affirm the district court entry of judgment on validity and its entry of an injunction as to both ivax and cipla,but we modify the injunction to apply only to escitalopram oxalate.
background 
ivax filed abbreviated new drug application the anda at the food and drug administration,pursuant to j j of the federal food,drug,and cosmetic act,for approval to market generic tablets containing,or milligrams of escitalopram oxalate eo.the anda certified,pursuant to j a vii iv,that the claims of the patent are invalid not infringed by the manufacture,use,or sale of the products for which approval was sought.cipla is the intended supplier of eo for ivax and contributed information for the filing of the anda.forest filed suit on september,alleging that ivax filing of the anda infringed the patent under e a ivax filed its answer on october,denying infringement and counterclaiming for invalidity of the patent.forest later amended its complaint to add cipla as a defendant on may.
the patent issued on august,and relates,inter alia,to a substantially pure enantiomer of citalopram also referred to as escitalopram and nontoxic acid additional salts thereof.stereoisomers are compounds that contain the same constituent atoms and the same bonding between those atoms but have different spatial arrangements.enantiomers are stereoisomers that are nonsuperimposable mirror images of one another.enantiomers accordingly exhibit different optical activity the enantiomer that rotates a plane of polarized light in the clockwise direction is the enantiomer the enantiomer that rotates a plane of polarized light in the counterclockwise direction is the enantiomer.enantiomers may also be designated as the and the according to a different criterion relating to the location of the chiral centers.in the case of citalopram,the enantiomer is also the.a mixture of equal amounts of two enantiomers is called a racemic mixture or a racemate,and separating the two enantiomers from a racemate is referred to as resolving the compound.forest also owned the now expired patent on the racemic form of citalopram and patent that claims a method for making racemic citalopram using an intermediate racemic.
eo,which is the oxalate salt form of escitalopram,is one of the compounds encompassed by the claims of the patent.it is an antidepressant by virtue of being a selective serotonin reuptake inhibitor and is the active ingredient in forest lexapro branded drug.forest has alleged that ivax and cipla infringed claims,and of the patent by filing the anda.independent claim of the patent reads as follows 
a compound selected from substantially pure fluorophenyl and acid addition salts thereof.
patent.dependent claim recites a method of preparing the compound of claim by cyclizing an intermediate diol.
the parties stipulated to a specific claim construction for the primary disputed term in the patent,and,based on that agreement,the parties further stipulated that the proposed products included in the anda infringe claims,and of the patent and that the proposed process for making those products infringes claim.thus,the district court was only required to reach a determination with respect to the counterclaims,including those asserting that the claims are invalid for anticipation and obviousness,and that they were improperly broadened through reissue.
after a bench trial,the district court issued its decision on july,concluding that ivax and cipla had failed to prove that the patent is invalid as anticipated.specifically,the court found that an article by donald smith smith entitled the stereoselectivity of serotonin uptake in brain tissue and blood platelets the topography of the serotonin uptake area smith reference did not anticipate claim of the patent because it did not disclose substantially pure escitalopram as claimed in claim and it did not enable a person having ordinary skill in the art to obtain that compound.the court found that chiral high performance liquid chromatography hplc was a relatively new and unpredictable technique at the time of the invention and that smith had worked with the founder of the field of chiral hplc to separate the enantiomers of citalopram near the time of the invention,but had failed in his efforts.the court also found that a team of chemists at lundbeck had unsuccessfully attempted to use chiral hplc to resolve citalopram for two years and that danishefsky,forest medicinal chemistry expert,had unsuccessfully tried to resolve compounds with hplc in the.the court also found that an inventor of the patent,bogeso,had conducted numerous experiments attempting to resolve racemic citalopram through the method of diasteriomeric salt formation,but had also failed.finally,the court found that bogeso only attempted to resolve citalopram using a diol intermediate,as recited in claim of the patent,as a last resort and that others of skill in the art would have similarly hesitated because there was a real possibility that the resolved intermediate would during the attempt to convert it from the diol intermediate enantiomer to the desired citalopram enantiomer.thus,the court found that attempting to separate the enantiomers of citalopram based on the knowledge of one of ordinary skill in the art would have required undue experimentation and that the smith reference was therefore not enabled.
next,the district court concluded that ivax and cipla had failed to prove by clear and convincing evidence that any of the asserted claims of the patent were obvious.the court found that one of ordinary skill in the art at the time of the invention would generally have been motivated to develop new compounds rather than undertake the difficult and unpredictable task of resolving a known racemate.the court further found that a person of ordinary skill attempting to resolve racemic citalopram would have had no reasonable expectation of success for reasons similar to those discussed with respect to enablement of the smith reference.with respect to the method of claim of the patent,the court found that none of the articles relied upon by ivax and cipla described the particular types of reactions claimed,a mosher ester serving as a leaving group for a ring closure of a diol intermediate,an enantioconserving ring closure of a diol containing a tertiary amine to form a tetrahydrofuran,or an enantioconserving cyclization reaction of the type needed to convert a tertiary amine like any enantiomerically pure diol intermediate into substantially pure citalopram.the court also found that secondary considerations of commercial success,unexpected results,and copying by others supported the validity of the claims.
in addition,the district court found that claim of the patent was not invalid for impermissible broadening during reissue.during the reissue proceeding that resulted in the patent,claim was corrected to claim a method of converting a diol intermediate to citalopram,rather than using a diol intermediate as shown in the original patent claim.the court found that,given the specific description of the process in the specification,this change amounted to correction of a typographical error.in other words,the court found that the mistake would have been clear to one of ordinary skill in the art reviewing the patent,and therefore that it did not constitute a change in scope from the original claim.
the court entered judgment in accordance with its opinion on november,and at the same time enjoined both ivax and cipla from commercially making,using,offering to sell or selling within the united states,or importing into the united states any products that infringe the patent,including the escitalopram oxalate products referred to in the abbreviated new drug application until such time as the patent expires.ivax and cipla timely appealed.we have jurisdiction pursuant to a.
discussion 
anticipation 
on appeal,ivax and cipla argue that the smith reference clearly anticipates claim of the patent because it discusses and analyzes the efficacy of various drug enantiomers and predicts that one citalopram enantiomer will be more potent as a serotonin reuptake inhibitor than the other.ivax and cipla further argue that one of ordinary skill in the art would have known at the time of the invention to use diasteriomeric salt formation to resolve citalopram.specifically,a person of skill in the art would have used the method described in the wilen reference to resolve the racemic intermediate diol into its enantiomers and the method in the jacobus reference williamson ether synthesis to convert the diol enantiomer by cyclizing the ether ring to citalopram.ivax and cipla add that bogeso ability to resolve citalopram on his first try after starting with the diol intermediate is further compelling evidence that only routine experimentation was required to separate the enantiomers.
in response,forest argues that the smith reference does not disclose substantially pure citalopram.forest also argues that the testimony of the experts and the repeated failures of bogeso and others to resolve citalopram into its enantiomers support the district court determination that the smith reference was not enabled for citalopram.forest also states that the court was correct to conclude that a person of ordinary skill would have viewed the difficulty in resolving the diol intermediate rather than citalopram itself as significant and a deterrent.in addition,forest argues that even if a person of skill in the art were to consider using the diol,the wilen and jacobus references do not involve compounds with structures similar enough to the citalopram diol intermediate so that a person of ordinary skill would rely upon them to predict the results of a reaction with that compound.more specifically,forest argues that neither reference discloses a cyclizing reaction involving a compound,like the citalopram diol,that has a resident tertiary amine or a benzylic alcohol.
anticipation is a question of fact that we review for clear error following a bench trial.amgen hoechst marion roussel.under the clear error standard,the court findings will not be overturned in the absence of a definite and firm conviction that a mistake has been made.impax,aventis pharm,quotation omitted.whether a prior art reference is enabling is a question of law based upon underlying factual findings.id.at quoting.mining chemque.
we agree with forest that the district court factual findings relating to enablement of the smith reference are not clearly erroneous,and,based upon those findings,we find no error in the district court conclusion that the smith reference is not enabled with respect to citalopram.the smith reference is a pharmacology paper,not a chemical paper.it describes the effects of various enantiomers of particular drugs not including citalopram on the uptake of serotonin in brain tissue platelets.it mentions racemic citalopram also of interest and shows its structure,but predicts,incorrectly,that the the enantiomer for citalopram,not the one claimed in the patent should be far more potent as a serotonin reuptake inhibitor.because a racemate does encompass its two enantiomers,it in effect does state that there is a enantiomer of citalopram,but it does not tell how to obtain it.a reference that is not enabling is not anticipating.elan,mayo found.for med.educ.research.the smith reference,as a pharmacology paper,thus does not enable the preparation of the enantiomer of citalopram.
ivax and cipla acknowledge that the smith reference itself does not teach one of ordinary skill how to make citalopram,but their arguments that it is enabled by other references are largely a recounting of the testimony favorable to their theory of the case without explanation as to why we should have a definite and firm conviction that mistakes were made by the district court in its.in other words,they do not inform us why the district court was not entitled to rely on the evidence favorable to forest or demonstrate that the evidence favorable to them heavily outweighed the evidence favorable to forest.such evidence includes the failures of various scientists to resolve citalopram as recited above.given ivax and cipla failure to disturb the detailed and thorough factual findings underlying the district court decision,we see no error in the finding that the smith reference does not enable one of ordinary skill to make citalopram and hence that the smith reference does not anticipate claims to citalopram.
ii.obviousness 
ivax and cipla argue that citalopram was obvious in light of racemic citalopram and descriptions of techniques available to separate enantiomers from their racemates.further,they argue that the general expectation in the art that one enantiomer would be more potent than the other provided reason for a person of ordinary skill in the art to isolate the enantiomers.for reasons similar to those discussed with respect to their argument that the smith reference was enabled,ivax and cipla contend that a person of ordinary skill in the art would have had a reasonable expectation that one could separate the enantiomers of citalopram.ivax and cipla also argue that lexapro commercial success was due to aggressive marketing rather than any alleged superiority of the drug to alternatives and that it did not possess unexpectedly superior properties.ivax and cipla also argue that claims,and represent only obvious variations on claim with no elements that are not standard in medicinal chemistry and that claim represents the obvious way of resolving citalopram in light of the teaching of the wilen and jacobus references.
in response,forest argues that any prima facie obviousness based on racemic citalopram was rebutted by the evidence demonstrating the difficulty of separating the enantiomers and the unexpected properties of citalopram.forest argues that it was unexpected that all of the therapeutic benefit of citalopram would reside in the enantiomer,resulting in escitalopram having twice the potency of racemic citalopram.forest also argues that the district court was entitled to credit evidence that a person of ordinary skill in the art would not easily have turned to the diol intermediate to attempt resolution of racemic citalopram both because of the uncertainty involved and because wilen and jacobus describe compounds less complex than those necessary here to resolve the diol intermediate and then convert the diol enantiomer to escitalopram.
obviousness is a question of law,reviewed de novo,based upon underlying factual questions which are reviewed for clear error following a bench trial.leapfrog,quoting alza mylan.
we agree with forest that the district court key factual findings underlying its conclusions on obviousness are not clearly erroneous,and,based upon those findings,we find no error in the court conclusion that the asserted claims of the patent are not invalid for obviousness.as with their arguments on anticipation,ivax and cipla mainly emphasize the evidence that is favorable to their desired outcome without addressing the evidence favorable to forest.the latter includes the failure of the inventors and others to resolve citalopram without undue experimentation and the testimony of forest experts.the district court applied the graham factors to conduct a thorough analysis of the evidence,and we find no clear error on facts and no error of law.see graham john deere,d.these findings fully support the conclusion that the claimed subject matter would not have been obvious to one of ordinary skill in the art.
iii.broadening reissue 
ivax and cipla argue that claim of the patent is invalid because it represents a broadening of original claim.they argue that the change in the optical rotation sign of the diol intermediate in claim during reissue was clearly a broadening of the claim because the claim now covers a process beginning with a different enantiomer.ivax and cipla also argue that a typographical error may nonetheless be broadening and th
