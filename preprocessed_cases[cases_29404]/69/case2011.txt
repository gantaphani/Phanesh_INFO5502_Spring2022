a municipality maintained a program to manage the size of a feral peafowl population that inhabited parklands and canyon property owned by the municipality.residents who opposed the presence of peafowl in the municipality sought to enjoin the peafowl management program,which permitted a minimum peafowl population,on the ground that the program violated restrictions in deeds by which the municipality obtained title to the parkland and canyon property.the trial court granted the relief and enjoined the municipality from allowing peafowl to use the parklands and canyons.
we conclude that because the peafowl which inhabit the parklands and canyons are feral rather than domesticated creatures,they are not instrumentalities of the municipality.as a result,the peafowl management program does not violate the deed restrictions under which title to the parklands and canyons was taken.
factual and procedural background 
this dispute concerns the presence of peafowl in the city of palos verdes estates.peafowl are not indigenous to the americas.decades ago,a mayor of the city brought six or eight peafowl to his home located in the espinosa circle area and maintained them in a pen behind his home.after the mayor death,his family released the peafowl into the wild in.since that time,the proliferation of feral peafowl has precipitated serious differences of opinion among property owners in the city.some residents view the peafowl as a nuisance without parallel,while others view them as a desirable part of the city distinctive rural heritage.
in response to complaints from residents,the city developed a plan to trap and remove some of the feral peafowl.fearing the peafowl would be decimated under the plan,the friends of the peacocks sued the city.in the wake of that lawsuit,the city in early adopted a peafowl management program,following which the friends of the peacocks dismissed their lawsuit.
under the peafowl management program,the city conducts a periodic census of the peafowl population in two parkland circle and malaga inhabited by the peafowl.the program requires that the city maintain a minimum flock of birds in each of the two areas.peafowl in excess of that number may be trapped and relocated outside the city.after the peafowl are trapped,the city keeps them in a holding pen until they can be relocated.under the program,the city conducted major trapping programs in,and,and trapped at least peafowl in.
after the city trapping program,residents complaints concerning the peafowl continued,and one peafowl antagonist removed four or five additional birds on her own.according to the city manager,several peafowl had been poisoned and killed the city was getting perilously close to the minimum number of birds and peafowl lovers were threatening to import peafowl to maintain the minimum number.as a consequence,on july,the city council unanimously enacted an ordinance making it a misdemeanor for anyone,other than a city employee,to trap or transport peafowl in the city.
in april,mary butler and other peafowl opponents collectively,butler filed this lawsuit against the city and various city officials,including the mayor,several council members,the city manager and the police chief.butler complaint alleged causes of action for inverse condemnation,public and private nuisance,trespass,negligence,intentional infliction of emotional distress,and declaratory and injunctive relief.among other things,butler alleged the ordinance prohibiting the trapping of peafowl was invalid.butler further alleged the city conduct in allowing a feral peafowl population to proliferate on and over city owned lots made up of parkland,canyons and other inaccessible areas in the espinosa circle and malaga cove areas violated protective restrictions in the deeds by which the city obtained title to its lands.specifically,the city was alleged to have violated this deed restriction 
no cattle,hogs,or other animals,rabbits or poultry,may be kept in any part of said property unless written permission be obtained from the homes association,which permission shall be granted and shall be revocable at the pleasure of said association,under uniform regulations.art.v.
the city demurred to butler complaint.the trial court commissioner bruce mitchell,hearing the matter by stipulation sustained the demurrer,without leave to amend,as to the causes of action for inverse condemnation,nuisance,trespass,negligence and emotional distress.in its ruling,the court found no legal basis existed for those causes of action because feral peafowl are not instrumentalities of the city.however,the city demurrer to the causes of action for declaratory and injunctive relief was overruled.because the matter was no longer an inverse condemnation case,it was transferred to an appropriate civil trial department judge jane johnson for further proceedings 
a bench trial was conducted on butler cause of action seeking an injunction against the city based on its violation of the deed restrictions on the use of land,namely,the prohibition against keeping other animals on its property without approval of the homes association the trial court found that the deed restrictions were applicable to the city,and that 
the city did not request permission from the homes association to keep peafowl on its property.
the peafowl are not wild animals,but rather domesticated animals living in a feral state,therefore,subject to control,possession and ownership.on this point,the court considered and weighed testimony from two experts,and found the testimony of butler expert,francine bradley,more credible.the court observed 
finally,and important to the classification of the peafowl as a domesticated animal,bradley testified that once an animal has been domesticated,neither it nor any of its offspring can ever be considered wild again.this fact contradicted defendant expert,homrighausen,who stated that once a domesticated animal returned to a wild state it became wild once again and forevermore.
the deed restriction reflects a desire to prohibit livestock or animals.peafowl,the court found,
are game birds,and fall into the larger category of livestock,that is,animals kept or maintained by an owner for any variety of purposes,but most often kept for ornamental purposes,and are within the category of or other animals.
the court further observed that the peafowl were present on city property solely for aesthetic reasons an ornamental purpose,and a s such,the peafowl are a prohibited animal contemplated by the deed restrictions.
the city is keeping peafowl on its property.this finding was based upon bradley testimony that two means were available to keep domesticated fowl.one means is to control their movements or keep them in a confined state.the other means is by ranging them.the court summarized the ranging means of keep ing a flock of domesticated fowl as including 
counting the size of the flock,trapping members of the flock,culling or removing specific members of the flock,monitoring the health of the flock by random testing,the flock,allowing the flock to derive nutrition from whatever source it can find,providing a suitable environment for the flock to reproduce,providing areas or places to roost,and removing any interference with the numbers or control of the flock.
the court found that the city is engaged in all of the foregoing means of ranging,and further had enacted an ordinance preventing citizens from interfering with the ranging peafowl.consequently,the city was keeping peafowl on its property in violation of the deed restrictions.
the trial court thereupon permanently restrained and enjoined the city from,among other things,allowing peafowl to use or property to nest,lay eggs,roost,feed,remain or wander about that property for any other purpose,and allowing or permitting the peafowl to wander freely and unrestrained upon and over any or property,including but not limited to parks,parklands,canyons or other public areas 
the trial court entered a minute order stating its ruling on may.two weeks later,the board of directors of the palos verdes homes association adopted resolution.the resolution stated that
