background 
plaintiff appellee,koninklijke philips electronics philips sued the defendants,alleging that they had infringed philips registered trademark and had knowingly offered counterfeited philips goods for sale in the united states.on january,the district court issued an amended temporary restraining and seizure order that was immediately served on the defendants at the consumer electronics show in las vegas,nevada.the following day,because defendants principal place of business and warehouse was in california,philips sought and was granted a temporary restraining and seizure order by the united states district court for the central district of california.that order was served at defendants california warehouse,where the marshals service found and confiscated counterfeit products bearing the philips trademark.
on march,the district court issued a preliminary injunction that principally enjoined defendants from dealing in any product that infringed philips trademarks.the district court also ordered defendants to file a report setting forth their inventory of counterfeit philips products by april,and a report describing in detail their compliance with the preliminary injunction by may.before these reports were due,on april,the district court issued another seizure order,which resulted in the confiscation of additional counterfeit philips products at locations controlled by the defendants.
by february of,it became clear to the district court that the defendants had no intention of complying with its orders.the district court noted that there was abundant evidence of the defendants and active violations of both the tro and preliminary injunction.in fact,the defendants had failed to file any reports,required or otherwise,showing that they had complied in any way with the district court orders.this failure continued even after the plaintiff moved for sanctions on october.at the sanctions hearing,the district court granted plaintiff motion for civil contempt sanctions,holding the defendants jointly and severally liable to the plaintiff for in attorney fees in seizure and storage costs in lost royalties and per day until the reports were filed.in addition,the court ordered defendants to post a million bond.
the defendants now appeal the district court imposition of sanctions.the plaintiff contends that such an interlocutory appeal is impermissible and that we lack jurisdiction to hear it.

civil criminal contempt orders 
the rule is settled in this court that except in connection with an appeal from a final judgment or decree,a party to a suit may not review upon appeal an order fining or imprisoning him for the commission of a civil contempt.fox capital.see also bingman ward,cir it is clear that we do not have jurisdiction to hear interlocutory appeals from civil contempt orders entered against parties to litigation.this court do es have jurisdiction,however,to hear appeals from criminal contempt orders because they are appealable when entered.bingman,at internal quotation marks and citation omitted.
thus,to ascertain its jurisdiction,a court of appeals must decide whether the order before it i s one for civil contempt or one for criminal contempt.id.as we have noted,the distinction between the two forms of contempt lies in the intended effect of the punishment imposed.the purpose of civil contempt is coercive or compensatory,whereas the purpose of criminal contempt is punitive.united states armstrong,cir see also plastiras idell in re sequoia auto brokers,cir.
although this explanation of the dichotomy between civil and criminal contempt is helpful,it is not quite complete.bingman,at.often it is necessary to explore other aspects of the contempt order to determine its character.for example,the supreme court has found it useful to ascertain to whom the fine is payable,suggesting that a fine is remedial when it is paid to the complainant,and punitive when it is paid to the court.hicks ex rel.feiock feiock,d see also bingman,at.also instructive is whether the fine imposed is conditional in nature.in this regard,the supreme court has stated that a n unconditional penalty is criminal in nature because it is solely and exclusively punitive in character a conditional penalty,by contrast,is civil because it is specifically designed to compel the doing of some act.hicks,at.internal quotation marks and citation omitted.
taking all of these considerations into account,the supreme court has stated that 
a contempt fine accordingly is considered civil and remedial if it either coerce s the defendant into compliance with the court order,or compensate s the complainant for losses sustained.where a fine is not compensatory,it is civil only if the contemnor is offered an opportunity to purge.

c.the instant contempt order 
the contempt order here is plainly civil under the above test.the attorney fees,lost royalties,and storage costs were assessed in order to compensate the plaintiff for losses sustained.furthermore,the per diem fine was not to be assessed until fourteen days after the entry of the order,and the defendants could avoid the fine by complying with the terms of the injunction.because the per diem fine allowed the defendants the opportunity to purge the contempt before payment became due,it was a civil sanction.we also note that the district court was cognizant of the distinction between the two types of contempts.although the district court warned the defendants that it may desire to impose criminal sanctions next time,it limited itself this time to civil sanctions.appellant excerpts of at emphasis added.
moreover,the defendants make no argument that the contempt order was not civil.their sole argument is that a civil contempt order is reviewable when it provides for payment of the sanction on a date certain without providing the contemnor the opportunity to purge.the orders pertaining to attorney fees,seizure and storage costs,and lost royalties fall into this category.supreme court precedent,however,makes clear that contempt orders that are compensatory are not reviewable on interlocutory appeal if a contempt order compensate s the complainant for losses sustained,it is considered civil,and may only be reviewed upon final appeal.bingman,at alteration in original.the defendants attempt to glean their purported date certain exception to the general rule of from certain cases that,while permitting immediate appeals,do not announce the rule defendants urge upon this court.each case is unique to its circumstances and all are inapposite.
defendants authorities 
defendants argue that our opinion in hoffman ex rel.nlrb beer drivers salesmen local union,cir,supports their contention that civil contempt orders that provide for payment of a sanction on a date certain,without providing the contemnor the opportunity to purge the contempt,are revieweable on interlocutory appeal.hoffman,however,merely applies the supreme court test in bagwell and is no help to defendants.in hoffman,there was no dispute that the contempt order was not compensatory and hence criminal.indeed,there is no indication from the opinion that the fines imposed possessed a compensatory character.thus,the hoffman court proceeded directly to the only controversy presented by the facts whether the two contempt orders at issue in the case offered the contemnor the op
