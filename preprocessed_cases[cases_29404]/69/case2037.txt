in the unpublished portion of this opinion,we reject kapla asserted errors with regard to the causes of action for medical malpractice and violation of the cmia,but conclude the judgment is unsupported with regard to the cause of action for invasion of privacy.in the published portion of the opinion,we conclude the trial court erred in the manner in which it applied code of civil procedure section,civil code section proposition,and civil code section the medical injury compensation reform act,or micra to the calculation of recoverable damages.
factual and procedural background 
on october,francies filed a complaint against kapla alleging that kapla had disclosed his hiv status to his employer without his consent,resulting in francies termination from his employment and causing him to suffer severe physical,mental and emotional distress.the complaint,as amended in january,asserts liability under causes of action for medical malpractice,for constitutional,intentional and negligent invasion of privacy and for a violation of the cmia.both parties waived their right to a jury trial and the case was tried to the court.the following evidence was presented at trial.
francies was diagnosed as hiv positive shortly after kapla became his primary care physician in.in,francies began working as the general manager of the savoy brasserie restaurant in san francisco.by the summer of,francies was having difficulties at work with his supervisor and with other employees.his supervisor was intruding into his personal life.he had been accused of harassment by two employees and of drug and alcohol use at work by another employee.he was having trouble completing a budget projection that was due on october.as a result of the pressure in his personal and professional life,francies became so anxious that he developed insomnia and a rash.
on october,rather than reporting to work to submit the budget projection,he went to see kapla.he told kapla that he was too anxious to work,and kapla agreed.kapla requested that his assistant,janet blair,fax a note to the restaurant certifying that francies was temporarily disabled and would be out of work for one month.francies completed the workers compensation forms necessary to obtain benefits for the month and kapla filled out the required form entitled doctor first report of occupational injury or illness first report or report.kapla checked a box indicating francies was suffering from an additional condition that might impede or delay his recovery,and added the notation that patient is managing hiv disease.francies was unaware that his hiv status was included in the report.
on november,blair faxed a number of workers compensation forms,including the first report,to the restaurant.the parties offered different explanations as to why blair faxed the report to francies employer,rather than to its insurer as she should have done.blair testified that although she did not remember francies asking her to fax the report to his employer,he must have done so because in the ordinary course of business she would not have done so unless asked.francies expressly denied asking her to fax the report to his employer.kapla testified that although he continued to treat francies for two months after the disclosure and knew that francies was upset that his employer had learned of his hiv status,kapla did not know that the report had been faxed to the restaurant until after francies filed this lawsuit.
the day after the restaurant received the report,francies supervisor and the restaurant owner agreed that francies hiv disease could pose a pr nightmare and that francies would have to be discharged.on december,francies was notified by mail that he had been replaced as general manager and would thereafter be considered an employee on unpaid leave without benefits.
francies filed a wrongful termination action against the restaurant,which he eventually settled for.he also recovered in workers compensation benefits.
after a bench trial in the present action,the court issued a statement of decision finding in favor of francies on his causes of action for medical malpractice,constitutional invasion of privacy and violation of the cmia the trial court rejected kapla defenses of judicial estoppel and litigation privilege.it found that francies had not consented to the disclosure of his hiv status to his employer and that the disclosure constituted medical malpractice,an invasion of privacy and the unlawful disclosure of medical information.the court found that francies had suffered in economic damages and in noneconomic damages.after reducing the damages to reflect an allocation of fault,prior recoveries,and the limitation imposed by micra,in a manner explained more fully below,recoverable damages were reduced to.francies was also awarded in attorney fees under the cmia following the entry of judgment both francies and kapla filed timely notices of appeal and

liability issues 
ii.issues regarding recoverable damages 
francies appeals from the trial court award of in economic damages and in noneconomic damages.the award was calculated as follows.the trial court initially determined that francies had suffered in economic damages and in noneconomic damages.these findings are not disputed.the economic damages were reduced by percent of,or,to reflect the portion of the recoveries from francies employer in the wrongful termination action and from the workers compensation proceedings attributable to economic damages.percent was derived as the ratio of the economic damages to the total award after reducing noneconomic damages to the cap imposed by micra.the noneconomic damages were reduced to under micra and again reduced by to reflect the trial court allocation of of responsibility for francies damages to francies employer.francies challenges the reduction of both the economic and noneconomic damages.
francies initial argument regarding the inapplicability of the micra cap to the cause of action for invasion of privacy is moot,as we have concluded that the judgment on that cause of action must be reversed kapla points out correctly that francies did not raise his other arguments concerning the calculation of recoverable damages in the trial court.francies acknowledges this failure but nonetheless requests this court to review the asserted errors because the new arguments involve pure questions of law that turn on undisputed facts.we agree that francies additional contentions assert purely legal errors that are readily correctable on appeal,and the issues have been addressed on their merits in the briefs of both parties.accordingly,we exercise our discretion to consider these arguments despite the failure to have raised them below.people smith cal th,d.
francies asserts the trial court erred in the calculation of recoverable economic damages.pursuant to code of civil procedure section,the trial court deducted percent of the francies recovered in the prior proceedings from the award of economic damages the court calculated the percentage based on what it found to be the ratio between francies economic damages and the total award.greathouse amcord,th,d espinoza machonga th,d.however,in determining this ratio,the court first reduced the amount of noneconomic damages from to the maximum recovery permitted by micra.francies contends the trial court should have calculated the ratio before,rather than after,applying the micra cap
