in this action for damages brought under,edward reese alleged that officers of the dade county,georgia,sheriff department used excessive force in arresting him,in violation of his rights under the fourth amendment.he also alleged that their supervisor failed adequately to train and supervise them and that he was deprived of medical treatment in violation of the fourteenth amendment.the district court granted the defendants summary judgment on alternative grounds no constitutional violations occurred,and assuming that violations occurred,the defendants were entitled to qualified immunity from suit because the relevant case law did not clearly establish that the conduct of the defendants infringed reese rights under the fourth and fourteenth amendments.reese now appeals the denial of his excessive force claims.he also challenges the district court denial of his motion for leave to amend his complaint and the court disallowance of the affidavit of his expert witness.
edward reese is the owner and caretaker of an apartment complex in trenton,dade county,georgia.on the evening of september,the dade county sheriff department dispatcher called a deputy sheriff,joseph geddie deputy geddie,to respond to a domestic violence call at reese apartment complex.the dispatcher informed deputy geddie that the parents of the woman involved in the reported violence were also on their way.deputy geddie arrived at the apartment complex first and was directed to the apartment occupied by amanda craig higdon.she was there with her boyfriend,who claimed that she had assaulted him.higdon was cooperative,and within five or so minutes,deputy geddie was able to arrest,handcuff,and place her in the back of his patrol car he then returned to higdon apartment to interview the boyfriend.joshua herbert,another deputy sheriff,arrived soon after and entered the apartment to assist deputy geddie.about six minutes later,higdon parents,mac craig and his wife,arrived at the apartment and confronted deputy geddie about their daughter.deputy geddie told the craigs to leave the building and instructed herbert to stay outside with them to ensure that no one else entered the apartment.
georgia state trooper jason geddie trooper geddie also responded to the domestic violence call as a courtesy to local law enforcement when he arrived at the apartment complex,he observed herbert standing outside the building.trooper geddie judged that the situation was under control and returned to his vehicle.soon thereafter,another deputy sheriff,danny ellis,arrived and parked his vehicle next to trooper geddie.trooper geddie immediately informed ellis that everything was under control.as they were conversing,trooper geddie observed reese drive into the apartment complex parking lot and park his truck on the opposite side of ellis patrol car.reese sat in his truck for a few minutes and then exited his vehicle and approached herbert.
it is at this point that the parties accounts of what took place diverge.because a central issue in this appeal is the proper version of the facts to be credited for purposes of our review of the summary judgment in this case,we provide a description of both reese and the defendants versions.we begin with reese version of the facts.
according to reese,he was working in his office across the street from the apartment complex when he noticed that four law enforcement vehicles had parked in front of the complex.two of the vehicles were in the parking lot,and two were blocking the street in front of the complex.reese also saw some people standing together outside the complex,whom he later learned were herbert,the craigs,and his wife,carol reese.reese drove over to the apartment complex,sat in his vehicle for a few minutes,then walked up to herbert,who was talking to the craigs.reese waited next to his wife for a few more minutes to get herbert attention and then asked herbert who was in charge.according to the affidavits of mac craig and carol reese,reese did not seem angry or agitated at the time,but herbert responded to him in a very belligerent and hateful tone that the dade county sheriff department was in charge.
what happened next is not in dispute.reese asked herbert which officer was in charge,to which herbert replied that deputy geddie was in charge but was occupied.reese then inquired whether it was necessary for all of the vehicles to remain at the scene,since higdon was in custody and the other tenants could not get to their apartments.herbert replied that it was necessary for the vehicles to remain and told reese to leave or he would be going to jail.reese responded that herbert did understand,that reese was the owner of the apartment complex.
at this point,according to reese,he turned to walk toward trooper geddie vehicle.as he turned,herbert grabbed him by the left arm,threw him against the apartment building in a choke hold,and struck him.herbert began shouting at him to stop resisting.reese,carol reese,mac craig,and amanda higdon attest that reese was not fighting back.herbert then threw reese to the ground,where reese lay face down with his left arm behind his back and his right arm under his body.herbert called for assistance,and the other defendants appeared en masse.because his face was in the mulch,reese was unable to see who subsequently did what.mac craig and carol reese observed ellis place his knees on reese back,and then all four of the defendants piled on top of reese,continued twisting his left arm behind his back,and commenced kicking and punching him and yelling stop resisting.at some point,reese left arm was handcuffed.reese could not extract his right arm from beneath him because the defendants were on top of him.reese repeatedly yelled that he was not resisting,that they were breaking his arm,and that they were going to cause him to have a heart attack.
neither of the videotapes from deputy geddie or herbert patrol cars depict reese physical encounter with the officers.however,the videotapes audio reveals the following exchange between herbert and reese 
herbert joe unintelligible wrong with you old man huh huh 
reese what the hell are you doing 
herbert roll over stop resisting stop resisting 
reese resisting 
male voices roll over stop resisting and roll over roll him over 
reese you make me have a heart attack,you son of a bitch,unintelligible 
male voice roll him over.
reese i did 
male voice hook him up.stop resisting 
reese i ai resisting 
male voice unintelligible.give me hand 
reese i ai resisting 
male voice gim me your hand 
reese you broke my arm,you rotten son of a bitch 
male voice gim me your hand 
reese you guys are unintelligible 
male voices roll it over.roll it over.
reese stop unintelligible.you make me have a heart attack 
male voices roll it over.unintelligible.stop resisting 
reese i not resisting you breaking my arm i not resisting i not resisting 
male voices yes you are.let this arm back.let this arm come back.there you go.
reese i not resisting you broke my arm you broke my left arm unintelligible.my left arm,you broke it 
deputy geddie then lifted reese head up by the hair and sprayed reese in the face with pepper spray at very close range.reese right arm was then handcuffed as well.reese can subsequently be heard protesting on the herbert videotape i did have no fight.he jumped on me,i never said a word.the videotape audio reveals that a short time later,mac craig complained to deputy geddie about herbert behavior,explaining that reese just said i do see where you need all these patrol cars on my property,and the shit out of him,for no reason.
the defendants version is markedly different.herbert claims that he was standing outside with the craigs when a visibly angry reese walked up to him.at his deposition,herbert claimed that the following transpired 
reese came walking up,why are all these police cars doing here.we had a domestic call out here,everything is okay,you can go ahead and leave.i not leaving,i the landlord,and i want to know who is in charge.sir,corporal geddie is in charge,he inside.some of the other people that were there,they started to talk about some damage inside.at that point i told everybody they could all,i said,listen,everybody,all need to go ahead and leave.and then the third and final time ed reese told me he was not leaving because he was the landlord i said he was under arrest,and i grabbed his arm.
as ellis was about to leave the scene,he saw herbert attempting to grab reese arm and reese pulling his arm away.ellis exited his vehicle and approached the pair,intending to assist.herbert testified at his deposition 
i grabbed his arm,and he pulled away from me.he said,do put your hands on me,and his hand went in a fist and pulled away at the same time once he did that i stepped in again with the grabbing to arrest him,and it ensued into a wrestling type match.he was resisting,i was trying to arrest him,we were struggling.both of us crashed up against the window wall area of the apartment.
deputy geddie heard a big thud on the brick wall of the apartment building and heard herbert yelling his name for assistance.deputy geddie opened the front door of the apartment building and saw herbert and reese struggling together and then falling to the ground.reese and herbert fell forward,knocking ellis over in the process.at this point the testimony of the deputies is somewhat at variance.ellis testified that he fell on top of herbert,who was on top of reese,who lay on the ground with either one or both arms beneath him.herbert claims that he was not on top of reese but was on his knees behind him.ellis scrambled to his feet and attempted to take hold of reese left arm,pulling off reese watch in the process.reese jerked his arm back.ellis took hold of reese left arm with both hands and then felt the left arm go sort of soft,just a muscular feeling.sensing something was wrong,ellis stopped pulling the arm back.
trooper geddie claims that he heard reese loudly to the effect of i kill you bastards and refusing herbert repeated requests for him to get off his hand or hands so that he could be handcuffed.believing that herbert needed his assistance,trooper geddie positioned himself near reese head and applied a,soft hands pressure point technique to reese neck to subdue him.trooper geddie stopped applying the maneuver when he realized that it was having no effect.apart from that maneuver,trooper geddie claims he had no other physical contact with reese.
deputy geddie then sprayed reese in the face with one burst of pepper spray,which enabled herbert to handcuff reese herbert retrieved reese watch as well as reese glasses,which had been knocked off during the struggle.about eight minutes later,reese was transported to the dade county jail in herbert patrol car,and about half an hour after that he was taken to erlanger hospital for treatment reese was subsequently charged with misdemeanor obstruction pursuant to a he stood trial in the dade county superior court,and the jury found him not guilty.
on september,reese filed this law suit against herbert,deputy geddie,ellis,and trooper in the united states district court for the northern district of georgia,seeking damages against them in both their official and individual capacities under for using excessive force in violation of the fourth and fourteenth amendments he also asserted a number of claims under georgia state law.on november,reese filed an amended complaint that deleted his state law claims and his claims against the officers in their official capacities.
in their answers to reese amended complaint,the defendants denied liability and asserted as an affirmative defense that they were entitled to qualified immunity from suit.on march,herbert,deputy geddie,and ellis jointly moved the court for summary judgment trooper geddie moved for summary judgment four days later.on april,reese filed a response in opposition to the defendants motions and an accompanying brief.attached to the brief were the affidavits of mac craig,amanda higdon,carol reese,and vandiver keller,an expert in law enforcement policies and procedures.also on april,reese moved the court for leave to file a second amended complaint containing an additional claim against herbert for unlawful arrest the defendants objected to reese motion for leave to amend and moved the court to strike keller affidavit as untimely under federal rule of civil procedure a and local rule c.they also moved the court to strike the affidavits of mac craig,amanda higdon,and carol reese on the ground that they constituted shams.
on july,the district court entered an order denying reese motion for leave to amend granting the defendants motion to strike keller affidavit denying their motion to strike the affidavits of mac craig,amanda higdon,and carol reese and granting the defendants motions for summary judgment on the ground of qualified immunity.reese herbert,wl,at.july.reese now appeals,challenging the court adverse rulings.
the first two issues reese raises question the district court denial of his motion for leave to file a second amended complaint and its disallowance of keller affidavit.we address these issues in turn 
reese contends that the district court abused its discretion in denying his motion for leave to file a second amended complaint,which would have added a false arrest claim against herbert.as we have frequently observed,though leave to amend is freely given when justice so requires,it is not an automatic right.a faser sears,roebuck,cir.a district court may,in the exercise of its inherent power to manage the conduct of litigation before it deny such leave where there is substantial ground for doing so,such as undue delay,bad faith or dilatory motive on the part of the movant,repeated failure to cure deficiencies by amendments previously allowed,undue prejudice to the opposing party by virtue of allowance of the amendment,and futility of amendment.id.at quoting foman davis,d.
the record contains ample reasons supporting the district court ruling.the motion for leave to amend accompanied reese response to the defendants motions for summary judgment and was filed nearly seven weeks after the close of discovery.because the period for discovery had expired,granting the motion would have caused the defendants undue prejudice,as they would not have been able to conduct further discovery with respect to the claim the proposed amendment asserted.see lowe home,olin,cir i t is not an abuse of discretion for a district court to deny a motion for leave to amend following the close of discovery,past the deadline for amendments and past the deadline for filing dispositive motions.at bottom,the district court regarded reese motion merely as an attempt to defeat the pending summary judgment motions.reese,wl,at.see also lowe home,at it is not an abuse of discretion for a district court to deny a motion for leave to amend a complaint when such motion is designed to avoid an impending adverse summary judgment.
reese contends that his delay in moving for leave to amend was justified because the need for the second amended complaint became obvious only after a thorough review of the criminal trial transcript,the depositions of the parties,and consultation with plaintiff expert after he had the opportunity to review all of the referenced transcripts.we find this reason plainly insufficient.in layfield bill heard chevrolet,we affirmed the denial of leave to amend where the plaintiff sought to raise an issue for the first time after the defendant had moved for summary judgment,noting that all of the facts relevant to the proposed amendment were known to the appellant at the time she filed her original complaint,cir per curiam similarly,in the case at hand,the evidence upon which reese was basing his false arrest claim against herbert was essentially known to reese at the time he filed both his original and first amended complaints.the additional utility he may have gained from reviewing the transcripts of the defendants depositions and his criminal trial and consulting his expert did not justify the delay in seeking leave to amend.we do not lightly regard the duty of an attorney to prepare a case properly and to give the issues full consideration before preparing pleadings.id given the circumstances before it,the district court was well within its discretion in denying reese motion for leave to amend 
reese claims that the district court abused its discretion in striking keller affidavit from the record.reese submitted his rule initial disclosures on november,stating that there were no known experts at the time other than medical experts,and stating that he would supplement his response as soon as he retains additional experts.reese formally retained keller on december.on february,twelve days before the close of discovery,reese verbally informed the defendants that he had retained keller.no expert report was provided at that time.it was not until april,nearly seven weeks after the expiration of the discovery period,that reese submitted an affidavit from keller as part of his brief in opposition to the defendants summary judgment motions.
we find no abuse of discretion in the district court decision to exclude keller affidavit.the court based its decision on reese failure to disclose keller identity earlier in the discovery period.rule does not prescribe a specific deadline applicable here because a trial date had not been set,but the expert disclosure rule is intended to provide opposing parties reasonable opportunity to prepare for effective cross examination and perhaps arrange for expert testimony from other witnesses.sherrod lingle,cir quoting.a advisory committee note.in accordance with this purpose,the district court local rule provides that 
any party who desires to use the testimony of an expert witness shall designate the witness sufficiently early in the discovery period to permit the opposing party the opportunity to depose the expert and,if desired,to name its own expert witness sufficiently in advance of the close of discovery so that a similar discovery deposition of the second expert might also be conducted prior to the close of discovery.
any party who does not comply with the provisions of the foregoing paragraph shall not be permitted to offer the testimony of the party expert,unless expressly authorized by court order based upon a showing that the failure to comply was justified.
as a threshold matter,the february,revelation of keller name was not enough to discharge reese obligation under the federal and local rules.disclosure of expert testimony within the meaning of the federal rule contemplates not only the identification of the expert,but also the provision of a written report containing a complete statement of all opinions and the basis and reasons therefor.a b.furthermore,the local rules required disclosure that was sufficiently early in the discovery period so as to permit the defendants to depose keller,and possibly to name a rebuttal expert sufficiently in advance of the close of discovery so that the expert could also be deposed during the discovery period.lr c,ndga.rule,however,provides that the depositions of such experts shall not be conducted until after the report is provided.b a.the disclosure of keller affidavit almost seven weeks after the close of discovery foreclosed the defendants opportunity to depose keller and to obtain an expert of their own.
as it read at the time,rule c provides that a party that without substantial justification fails to disclose information required by rule a or e is not,unless such failure is harmless,permitted to use as evidence at a trial,at a hearing,or on a motion any witness or information not so disclosed.c.reese proffered excuse for the delay is that keller could not have rendered a proper written report without first reviewing the parties depositions,which were taken on january,and the transcripts from reese criminal trial.reese claims that he did not receive the trial transcript until january and the deposition transcripts until february he also points out that he submitted keller affidavit on the day it was completed.the district court found this excuse unsatisfactory for the reason that it merely addresses why his expert was not able to produce his affidavit earlier in the discovery process,and provides no reason for the untimely identification of keller name.
in addition to this,we disagree with reese characterization of the necessity of the trial and deposition transcripts to keller written report.the outcome of the criminal trial,for example,was not critical to keller opinion.keller could have rendered a report based upon the presentation made in the criminal trial or based upon factual assumptions furnished to him by reese.if those assumptions subsequently turned out to be erroneous,keller could have supplemented the report at a later time.moreover,at a minimum,reese could have filed a motion to extend the discovery period so as to permit a proper disclosure.he offered no excuse for failing to do so.because the expert witness discovery rules are designed to allow both sides in a case to prepare their cases adequately and to prevent surprise,compliance with the requirements of rule is not merely aspirational.cooper,cir,overruled on other grounds by ash tyson foods,d citing sherrod,at.here,the failure to comply with rule a was both unjustified and harmful to the defendants thus,the district court clearly acted within its discretion by excluding the keller affidavit 
reese claims that the district court violated federal rule of civil procedure because the court applied local rule b in a manner that is inconsistent with federal rule of civil procedure by permitting summary judgment to be entered without giving appropriate weight to all the evidence in the record.he maintains that rule,if properly applied,precluded the court from granting the defendants summary judgment.we now address these claims of error 
reese primary argument with respect to the district court application of local rule is that it contravenes the standard for summary judgment set forth in federal rule of civil procedure the pertinent requirement of local rule is that the respondent to a summary judgment motion must file a response to the movant statement of undisputed facts which sets forth,as to each numbered undisputed fact that the respondent is contesting,specific citations to evidence including page or paragraph number that support the respondent version of the facts.in the absence of such specific citations to evidence,the court will deem each of the movant facts as admitted.lr b a,ndga.
here,it is undisputed that reese did not include specific citations to evidence in his response to the statement of undisputed facts submitted by herbert,deputy geddie,and ellis it is further undisputed that reese failed to file any response at all to trooper geddie statement of undisputed facts.nonetheless,reese contends that by deeming the defendants statements of undisputed facts to be admitted,the district court improperly discounted or ignored evidence in the record that it should have fully considered in ruling on the defendants the affidavits of carol reese,mac craig,and amanda higdon.
we begin our analysis by examining the local rule.authorized by a local rules generally reflect the courts traditional authority to manage their own affairs so as to achieve the orderly and expeditious disposition of cases.see roche,sperling,d internal quotation marks omitted.specifically,local rule protects judicial resources by mak ing the parties organize the evidence rather than leaving the burden upon the district judge.laboy,cir referring to analogous local rule see also libel adventure lands of america,cir courts have neither the duty nor the time to investigate the record in search of an unidentified genuine issue of material fact to support a claim or defense.the rule also streamlines the resolution of summary judgment motions by focus ing the district court attention on what is,and what is not,genuinely controverted.dep t of homeland,cir.
the deeming order authorized by local rule is considered to be 
both a sanction for the parties and a balm for the district court the parties are given an incentive to conform to the rule provided they wish to have their version of the facts considered,and the district court is in any case relieved of the obligation to ferret through the record.
cmi capital mkt,llc.lexis,at cir.in upholding the exercise of courts discretion to apply deeming orders,our sister circuits have repeatedly stressed the vital function of rules such as local rule,reinforcing stern admonitions with rather colorful imagery.see,caban hernandez philip morris usa,cir given the vital purpose that such rules serve,litigants ignore them at their peril.smith lamz,cir j udges are not like pigs,hunting for truffles buried in briefs.internal quotation marks omitted.we hold the rule in similarly high esteem.
the proper course in applying local rule at the summary judgment stage is for a district court to disregard or ignore evidence relied on by the not cited in its response to the movant statement of undisputed yields facts contrary to those listed in the movant statement.that is,because the party has failed to comply with local rule only permissible way for it to establish a genuine issue of material fact at that court has before it the functional analog of an unopposed motion for summary judgment.application of the deeming order does not,however,automatically entitle the movant to summary judgment.this is so because under rule,the moving party 
always bears the initial responsibility of informing the district court of the basis for its motion,and identifying those portions of the pleadings,depositions,answers to interrogatories,and admissions on file,together with the affidavits,if any,which it believes demonstrates the absence of a genuine issue of material fact.
celotex catrett,d quoting.c emphasis added.the movant therefore continues to shoulder the initial burden of production in demonstrating the absence of any genuine issue of material fact,and the court must satisfy itself that the burden has been satisfactorily discharged.that is,the movant is not absolve d of the burden of showing that it is entitled to judgment as a matter of law,and a local rule statement is not itself a vehicle for making factual assertions that are otherwise unsupported in the record.holtz rockefeller,cir see also,at noting that the movant uncontested facts and other evidentiary facts of record must still show that the party is entitled to summary judgment internal quotation mark omitted,at noting that the deeming order merely means that the district court can accept the moving party allegedly uncontested facts as true,but whether or not this justifies summary judgment for the moving party depends upon the legal and factual configuration that results.
our decision in united states v.one piece of real property located at sw avenue,miami,florida,cir,is instructive.in that case,we held in the context of an unopposed motion for summary judgment that the district court can not base the entry of summary judgment on the mere fact that the motion was unopposed,but,rather,must consider the merits of the motion.id.at.in describing those portions of the record that a court must review,we explained that 
t he district court need not sua sponte review all of the evidentiary materials on file at the time the motion is granted,but must ensure that the motion itself is supported by evidentiary materials.at the least,the district court must review all of the evidentiary materials submitted in support of the motion for summary judgment.
id.at citation omitted similarly,after deeming the movant statement of undisputed facts to be admitted pursuant to local rule,the district court must then review the movant citations to the record to determine if there is,indeed,no genuine issue of material fact.see id.at.thus applied,local rule is not in conflict with rule 
in the instant case,however,there are two passages in the district court dispositive order which give significant cause for concern.the first passage indicates that 
the court examined the affidavits of mac craig and carol reese.in their affidavits,craig and reese state that all four of the law enforcement officers punched and kicked the plaintiff while all four of the officers were on top of him.however,on this point the court gave the affidavits of craig and reese little weight because the plaintiff did not properly dispute the statement of undisputed material facts submitted by the dade county defendants and trooper geddie.
reese,wl,at emphasis added.
the second passage concerns the defendants objections to the affidavits of mac craig,amanda higdon,and carol reese.defendants argued that these affidavits should be disregarded because these individuals submitted inconsistent testimony at the plaintiff criminal trial.id.at reese maintained that these individuals prior testimony to the extent that it is inconsistent goes to the weight of the evidence,rather than its admissibility.id.the court agree d with the plaintiff.therefore,the court examined and used these affidavits.however,to the extent that these affidavits contradicted the sworn testimony given at reese criminal trial,the court disregarded the affidavit testimony.id.emphasis added.
what these passages clearly indicate is that the district court did not hew to the evidentiary line drawn by local rule by focusing solely on the defendants record citations and disregarding the materials submitted by reese that were contrary to the defendants statement of undisputed facts.put another way,the court essentially overlooked reese noncompliance with local rule it had broad discretion to treated the craig,higdon,and reese affidavits as evidence of sufficient probative value to cross the threshold of admissibility.by opting not to deem the defendants statement of undisputed facts as admitted,however,the court implicitly chose to base its decision on all of the evidentiary materials in the record on summary judgment.see tipton bergrohr,cir in opposing summary judgment,the nonmoving party may avail itself of all facts and justifiable inferences in the record taken as a whole.tippens celotex,cir the district court shall consider all evidence in the record when reviewing a motion for summary,depositions,interrogatories,affidavits,can only grant summary judgment if everything in the record demonstrates that no genuine issue of material fact exists.internal quotation marks omitted holtz,at holding that while a court is not required to consider what the parties fail to point out in their local rule statements,it may in its discretion opt to conduct an assiduous review of the record even where one of the parties has failed to file such a statement internal quotation marks and citations omitted.
the district court error compounds itself at this point,for having found that the three affidavits were admissible,it was not for the district court to discount or disregard them at the summary judgment stage based on its assessment of the quality of the evidence see anderson liberty lobby,d credibility determinations,the weighing of the evidence,and the drawing of legitimate inferences from the facts are jury functions,not those of a judge,whether he is ruling on a motion for summary judgment or for a directed verdict.the evidence of the nonmovant is to be believed,and all justifiable inferences are to be drawn in his favor.lane celotex,cir the district court must not resolve factual disputes by weighing conflicting evidence,since it is the province of the jury to assess the probative value of the evidence.citation omitted.yet this is precisely what the district court appears to have done by giving little weight to the affidavits of mac craig and carol reese to the extent that they state that all four of the law enforcement officers punched and kicked the plaintiff while all four of the officers were on top of him,and by disregard ing the affidavit testimony of mac craig,amanda higdon,and carol reese to the extent that such testimony was in the court view contradicted by their prior testimony at reese criminal trial.such credibility determinations are for the jury.
in sum,the district court erred by failing to review the full record on summary judgment and by failing to construe the facts and make all reasonable inferences and credibility choices in favor of the party.that is,e ven though the facts,as accepted at the summary judgment stage of the proceedings,may not be the actual facts of the case,our analysis for purposes of summary judgment must begin with a description of the facts in the light most favorable to the plaintiff.davis williams,cir internal quotation marks and citations omitted.we proceed to that analysis.
defendants are entitled to qualified immunity if their conduct does not violate clearly established statutory or constitutional rights of which a reasonable person would have known.harlow fitzgerald,d.q ualified immunity applies unless application of the standard would inevitably lead every reasonable officer in defendants position to conclude the force was unlawful.post city of fort lauderdale,cir.
the facts in this case,viewed in the light most favorable to reese,do not support the grant of qualified immunity for the defendants.because it is undisputed that they were engaged in discretionary functions,see holloman ex rel.holloman harland,cir defining the inquiry as considering whether the official engaged in acts of a type that fell within the employee job responsibilities,the burden shifted to reese to demonstrate that the defendants violated his federal constitutional or statutory rights,and that those rights were clearly established at the time they acted.lee ferraro,cir vinyard wilson,cir.
the first question we must decide is whether reese version of the facts demonstrates the use of excessive force in violation of the fourth amendment.not only does the right to make an arrest or investigatory stop necessarily carr y with it the right to use some degree of physical coercion or threat thereof to effect it,graham connor,d,but we also recognize that the typical arrest involves some force and injury.rodriguez farrell,cir.however,while the use of force below a de minimis threshold ordinarily will not be actionable,see vinyard,at collecting cases,even de minimis force will violate the fourth amendment if the officer is not entitled to arrest or detain the suspect.zivojinovich barner,wl,at.lexis,at cir,per curiam.where probable cause or arguable probable cause to arrest existed,the question is not what underlying intent or motivation the officers harbored,beshers harrison,cir,but whether the officers actions were objectively reasonable in light of the facts and circumstances they faced at the time,including the severity of the crime at issue,whether the suspect pose d an immediate threat to the safety of the officers or others,and whether he was actively resisting arrest or attempting to evade arrest by flight.graham,at.at.
we begin our inquiry,therefore,with the question of whether herbert had probable cause or arguable probable cause to arrest reese.see lee,at.under georgia law,e xcept as otherwise provided in b a person who knowingly and willfully obstructs or hinders any law enforcement officer in the lawful discharge of his official duties is guilty of a misdemeanor.a.under reese version of the facts,we conclude that no reasonable officer could have believed that probable cause existed to arrest reese for violation of a.ten minutes had elapsed since the alleged aggressor in the domestic violence dispute had been handcuffed and placed in deputy geddie patrol car.herbert was standing outside the building to prevent others from entering the apartment where deputy geddie was interviewing the alleged victim.after approaching herbert,reese patiently waited for a few minutes before making his request that the law enforcement vehicles be moved.he then requested to speak with the officer in charge.throughout this exchange,reese maintained a calm voice and demeanor.reese did not impede or hinder herbert in the performance of his police duties.see skop city of atlanta,cir.though reese may have refused to obey herbert order to leave the scene by attempting to approach trooper geddie,arrest for obstruction can not be predicated upon such a refusal to obey a command to clear the general area entirely beyond the zone of police operation,which,in the circumstances described,was clearly an overly broad and unreasonable demand that exceed ed reasonable law enforcement procedure and needs.see woodward gray,see also id.at to obstruct,resist,or oppose for purpose of obstructing an officer implies forcible resistance and does not mean the refusal to merely obey the police officer command to move so that the police could perform their duties unimpeded.for speech to rise to the level of obstruction,it must be reasonably interpreted to be a threat of violence to the officer,which would amount to obstruction or hindrance.citations omitted davis,at applying florida law and holding that n either an owner simple inquiry as to why officers are present on his property nor a person attempt to bring a dangerous situation to the officer attention can be construed as obstruction of justice or disorderly conduct.nor can a citizen be precluded by the threat of arrest from asking to speak to an officer supervisor or from asking for an officer badge number.those inquiries likewise do not constitute obstruction of justice or disorderly conduct.
in the absence of probable cause,herbert was not justified in using any force against reese.yet as reese turned to walk toward trooper geddie vehicle,herbert grabbed his arm,slung him against a wall in a choke hold,struck him,and then threw him to the ground.from the perspective of reasonable officers in the defendants positions,including those who claimed they did not see or hear how reese was arrested,the force that was subsequently used against reese was also unreasonable.while reese lay face down on the ground,all four defendants piled on top of him and began kicking and beating him.one or more of the defendants continued twisting his arm behind his back despite his repeated screams that they were breaking his arm.davis,at.trooper geddie then applied a pressure point technique on his neck after reese left arm had been handcuffed,deputy geddie then reese in the face.at no point was reese fighting back or attempting to escape indeed,he was charged with nonviolently resisting arrest.see king reap,wl,at.lexis,at cir,unpublished.
the graham factors,as applied to reese version of the facts,weigh decisively in reese favor.the crime of misdemeanor obstruction is a crime of minor severity for which less force is generally appropriate.see vinyard,at.in view of the fact that reese was lying face down on the ground,was not suspected of having committed a serious crime,did not pose an immediate threat of harm to anyone,and was not actively resisting or evading arrest,the defendants use of force was a wholly disproportionate response to the situation.see id.at courts have consistently concluded that using pepper spray is excessive force in cases where the crime is a minor infraction,the arrestee surrenders,is secured,and is not acting violently,and there is no threat to the officers or anyone else.
it is beyond question that the law was clearly established so as to give the defendants fair warning that their actions in such circumstances violated reese fourth amendment rights.no particularized,preexisting case law was needed to inform them that an officer is not entitled to qualified immunity where his conduct goes so far beyond the hazy border between excessive and acceptable force that he knows that he is violating the constitution.priester city of riviera beach,cir internal quotation marks omitted see also vinyard,at collecting cases reese version of the facts demonstrates a beating that falls within the core of what the fourth amendment prohibits a severe beating of a restrained,suspect.king,wl,at.lexis,at.accordingly,defendants are not entitled to summary judgment on the ground of qualified immunity.
for the foregoing reasons,we affirm the denial of reese motion for leave to filed a second amended complaint and the disallowance of the keller affidavit,but reverse the summary judgment granted to the defendants on the basis of qualified immunity.

there is a discrepancy between the time stamps in the patrol car videotapes of deputy geddie and deputy joshua herbert.deputy geddie patrol car was parked facing higdon apartment,and the camera picked up some of geddie movements there.his car videotape indicates that he was already inside higdon apartment at and that higdon was placed in his patrol car at around herbert patrol car videotape does not capture these events,but extrapolating from the time stamp of later incidents,geddie arrived at higdon apartment at,and he placed her in his patrol car at.the actual time that these events occurred is of little significance what matters is that the incident that gave rise to this law suit appears to have occurred about minutes after deputy geddie first arrived on the scene.

reese maintains that he was never told that he was under arrest before herbert tried to grab his arm.as recorded on herbert patrol car videotape,the first time that herbert recounted the incident to the other officers at the scene,he stated he comes over here complaining.you all need to be here,so many cars need to be out here i said yes sir.so that went on.and he started again with it.who your supervisor i said there a corporal inside.i appreciate your unintelligible,you can leave now.he said i ai leavin or something.and he goes like this.did you see herbert is transporting reese to the dade county jail,the following exchange occured reese i do know why you attacked why because you pulled away from me,pulled away from you you put your hands on me.i did take reese,i told you to leave.herbert you should have never pulled away from me,you should never have attacked me.unintelligible settle this in reese,i was escorting you away from the yes,you broke my arm,for no reason.

the fourth amendment is applicable to the state and local governments under the due process clause of the fourteenth amendment.mapp ohio,d.in addition to asserting an excessive force claim under the fourth amendment,reese asserts an excessive force claim under the substantive component of the due process clause.because all claims that law enforcement officers have used excessive or the course of an arrest,investigatory stop,or other seizure of a free citizen should be analyzed under the fourth amendment and its reasonableness standard,rather than a substantive due process approach,graham connor,d,we analyze reese excessive force claim in the context of the fourth amendment only.see also garrett county,cir quoting gutierrez city of san antonio,cir,for the proposition that fourteenth amendment analysis does not begin until after the incidents of arrest are completed,after the plaintiff has been released from the arresting officer custody,and after the plaintiff has been in detention awaiting trial for a significant period of time internal quotation marks omitted.
