factual and procedural background 
we state the unchallenged facts as found by the trial court in its statement of decision.
in,joseph toscano,who was employed as the general manager of a fields pianos fields store in santa ana,was very unhappy with his job and decided to find other employment.toscano contacted michael greene,the president of san greene,because he had heard that greene was considering buying fields riverside store.during the course of several conversations in june and july of,michael greene offered toscano a sales management position with greene to start on september.on august,toscano resigned from fields in reliance on michael greene promise of employment.in,however,greene withdrew the employment offer.toscano later found lesser paying jobs the first at a piano store in mission viejo and then at another piano store in utah.
toscano sued greene for breach of contract,breach of the implied covenant of good faith and fair dealing,promissory estoppel and interference with prospective economic advantage.only his claim for promissory estoppel survived summary adjudication,and the matter proceeded to a bench trial 
before trial,greene moved in limine to prevent introduction of evidence or testimony on any claimed expectancy damages.it maintained such damages were not recoverable under a theory of promissory estoppel that because the court had already ruled that toscano was promised only employment with greene in connection with its motion for summary adjudication,toscano was limited to reliance damages consisting of one month lost salary from fields for the month of august.toscano opposed the motion,arguing his reliance damages included lost earnings and benefits after september,based upon what he would have continued to earn had he remained working at fields,and not relied upon greene music promise of employment.the parties filed supplemental trial briefs on the damages issue.
the trial court denied greene motion.it ultimately ruled in toscano favor,awarding him in damages.in its statement of decision,the court ruled toscano was limited to reliance damages,but that those damages included lost wages that the employee would have earned from the job that he quit in reliance on the employer promise,or from a job he declined in reliance upon the promise.based on the testimony of toscano accountant expert,roberta spoon,the court concluded toscano total past and future economic loss was.spoon had testified toscano past lost wages were the difference between toscano actual earnings and what he would have earned at fields from august,to june.she calculated toscano future lost earnings and present value of the difference between what he would have earned at fields and what he would earn in his new job until his retirement in be.
in its statement of decision,the court found w hile the evidence indicates that toscano had changed jobs several times in the past,and that he was looking for an opportunity to leave fields pianos,there is no evidence that indicates he would have left fields for a job which pays substantially less than he was earning there.thus,even if one assumes that toscano would have left fields pianos at some time in the future,one must also assume that he would do so only for a job which paid him as much,or more,than he would earn at fields pianos after all,that is exactly what happened in this case.in light of this evidence,the court finds that the sum of reasonably reflects the total economic harm that toscano has suffered and will continue to suffer as a result of his reliance on greene music promise of employment.
greene moved for a new trial.it argued the damage award was excessive because it included nonrecoverable expectancy damages and was speculative.toscano maintained the award of lost wages from fields were lost opportunity costs,a form of reliance damages.the court denied greene motion.this appeal followed.

the parties agree that the determination of whether toscano is entitled to a particular measure of damages is a question of law subject to de novo review.see wilson los angeles metropolitan transp.authority cal th,d,hurtado superior court cal d,rose medtronics,d.the amount of damages,on the other hand,is a fact question committed to the discretion of the trial judge on a motion for new trial an award of damages will not be disturbed if it is supported by substantial evidence.see westphal stores,th,d miller san diego gas electric d.the evidence is insufficient to support a damage award only when no reasonable interpretation of the record supports the figure.san diego metropolitan transit development bd.cushman th,d.
ii.promissory estoppel damages may include an employee definite,nonspeculative loss of future wages from prior employment 
no california case has squarely addressed the damages question presented whether a plaintiff who resigns from employment in reliance on an unfulfilled promise of other employment may recover,under a promissory estoppel theory,reliance damages based on wages lost from his or her prior employment.relying on several out of state authorities,greene contends reliance damages do not include lost future earnings,because future earnings represent expectancy damages that are not recoverable under promissory estoppel,and an employee can not prove entitlement to such earnings because there is no guarantee of future employment in an setting.greene maintains the only lost income recoverable in this case is toscano wages lost between the time he left his former job and the time the new promised job would have begun.
toscano concedes the weight of authority prevents an employee in his circumstances from recovering future lost wages from the prospective employer that induced him to resign his employment he asserts,however,the law permits the employee to recover what he would have earned in the future from his former employer as a component of reliance damages.greene maintains this measure of recovery is consistent with the equitable nature of promissory estoppel and with the trend in promissory estoppel cases permitting lost opportunity costs incurred in reliance on the defendant promise.
as we explain,we hold a plaintiff lost future wages from the former employer are recoverable under a promissory estoppel theory as long as they are not speculative or remote,and are supported by substantial evidence.
in california,under the doctrine of promissory estoppel,a promise which the promisor should reasonably expect to induce action or forbearance on the part of the promisee or a third person and which does induce such action or forbearance is binding if injustice can be avoided only by enforcement of the promise.the remedy granted for breach may be limited as justice requires.citations.promissory estoppel is a doctrine which employs equitable principles to satisfy the requirement that consideration must be given in exchange for the promise sought to be enforced.wilson los angeles county metropolitan transportation authority,supra,cal th at,d,see rest d contracts,subd.c k engineering contractors amber steel cal d,c the elements of promissory estoppel are a clear promise,reliance,substantial detriment,and damages m
