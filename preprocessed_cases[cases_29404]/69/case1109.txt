this case is one of many arising from claims that the federal government,with the assistance of major telecommunications companies,engaged in widespread warrantless eavesdropping in the united states following the september,attacks.at issue in this appeal is whether carolyn jewel and other residential telephone customers collectively jewel have standing to bring their statutory and constitutional claims against the government for what they describe as a communications dragnet of ordinary american citizens.
in light of detailed allegations and claims of harm linking jewel to the intercepted telephone,internet and electronic communications,we conclude that jewel claims are not abstract,generalized grievances and instead meet the constitutional standing requirement of concrete injury.nor do prudential considerations bar this action.although there has been considerable debate and legislative activity surrounding the surveillance program,the claims do not raise a political question nor are they inappropriate for judicial resolution.finally,we do not impose,as suggested by the government,a heightened standing requirement simply because the case involves government officials in the national security context.we reverse the district court dismissal on standing grounds and remand for further proceedings.we leave for the district court to consider in the first instance the government alternative argument that jewel claims are foreclosed by the state secrets privilege.
background 
jewel filed this putative class action on behalf of herself and a class of similarly situated persons ordinary americans who are current or former subscribers to at t telephone internet services.at this stage,our inquiry focuses on jewel and the allegations as they pertain to her.stearns ticketmaster,cir.jewel sued federal government agencies and government officers in their official and personal capacities.she did not name any telecommunications companies as defendants jewel alleged that the c ommunications of plaintiffs and class members have been and continue to be illegally acquired by defendants using surveillance devices attached to at t network.she claimed that these actions violated the first and fourth amendments,the constitutional doctrine of separation of powers,and a variety of statutes the foreign intelligence surveillance act fisa,et,the electronic communications privacy act ecpa,et,the stored communications act sca,et,and the administrative procedure act apa,et.the complaint requested both equitable and monetary relief.
according to the complaint,on october,president bush and other government defendants issued a secret presidential order that authorized warrantless surveillance within the united states.jewel asserted that she was specifically affected because at t,in collaboration with the national security agency nsa,diverted all of her internet traffic into secure rooms in at t facilities across the country,including at t folsom street facility in san francisco,and information of interest was transmitted from the equipment in the secure rooms to the nsa based on rules programmed by the nsa.jewel complaint focused on at t,its san francisco facility,and the secure rooms.
jewel further alleged that the governmental defendants operated a dragnet collection of communications records by continuously solicit ing and obtain ing the disclosure of all information in at t major databases of stored telephone and internet records.these records concern communications to which plaintiffs and class members were a party.for example,jewel claims that,
u sing a shadow network of surveillance devices,defendants have acquired and continue to acquire the content of a significant portion of phone calls,emails,instant messages,text messages,web communications and other communications,both international and domestic,of practically every american who uses the phone system or the internet,including plaintiffs and class members,in an unprecedented suspicionless general search through the nation communications network.
the complaint goes on to allege that defendants were directly involved in the schemes,which were directly performed,aided,abetted,counseled,commanded,induced,or procured,by defendants.
ii.the district court decision 
the government defendants moved to dismiss and alternatively sought summary judgment as to all claims.they argued that the court lacked jurisdiction over jewel statutory claims because the government did not waive its sovereign immunity.the government sought summary judgment on the remaining claims because information necessary to litigate plaintiffs claims is properly subject to and excluded from use in the case by the state secrets privilege and related statutory privileges.although not argued by the government or briefed by the parties,the district court granted the motion to dismiss because jewel lacked standing to bring her claims the district court dismissed the claims with prejudice and without leave to amend 
the district court carefully reviewed the complicated procedural history,both of the mdl wiretapping cases generally and the motions at issue in this case specifically.the district court held that jewel failed to make out prima facie allegations necessary to establish that she was an aggrieved person under the fisa.the court acknowledged that jewel complaint included specific allegations that the nsa used at t folsom street facility,but found that the complaint contains no other allegations specifically linking any of the plaintiffs to the alleged surveillance activities,and therefore held that jewel lacked standing.we disagree.
the central issue on appeal is whether jewel has standing to sue the government defendants,a question of law that we review de novo.bernhardt cnty.of los angeles,cir.because the district court sua sponte dismissed the complaint on its face,we review standing as if raised in a motion to dismiss.when reviewing motions to dismiss,the court must accept all factual allegations of the complaint as true and draw all reasonable inferences in favor of the nonmoving party.id.internal quotation marks and citation omitted.general factual allegations of injury resulting from the defendant conduct may suffice,as we presum e that general allegations embrace those specific facts that are necessary to support the claim.lujan wildlife fed.wildlife fed,d.because this appeal arises from dismissal under federal rule of civil procedure b,jewel allegations are accepted as true 
principles of standing 
standing doctrine is well established article iii gives the federal courts jurisdiction over only cases and controversies.whitmore arkansas,d.the lujan defenders of wildlife lujan restates the three requirements that must be met for article iii standing an injury in fact that is fairly traceable to the challenged conduct and has some likelihood of redressability,d.here,the district court determined that this action was in essence a citizen sui t seeking to employ judicial remedies to punish and bring to heel government officials,and that neither group of class representatives has alleged an injury that is sufficiently particular to those plaintiffs or to a distinct group.the district court decision was based entirely on the first prong of lujan.although that requirement is the focus of our analysis,our de novo review also considers the other two prongs.
t he standing question in this case is whether the constitutional or statutory provision on which the claim rests properly can be understood as granting persons in the plaintiff position a right to judicial relief.warth seldin,d.the answer here is yes.
ii.jewel has constitutional standing to sue 
jewel alleged concrete and particularized injury 
to satisfy the injury in fact requirement,jewel must assert a grievance that is both concrete and particularized.lujan,at citations omitted.we consider each of these requirements in turn,and conclude that jewel has satisfied them both.
as to jewel statutory claims,the supreme court instructs that a concrete injury required by art.iii may exist solely by virtue of statutes creating legal rights,the invasion of which creates standing.lujan,at internal quotation marks,citation,and alteration omitted.jewel asserts claims under three surveillance statutes the ecpa,fisa and sca and adds an umbrella claim under the apa.
both the ecpa and the fisa prohibit electronic interception of communications absent compliance with statutory procedures.the sca likewise prohibits the government from obtaining certain communication records.each statute explicitly creates a private right of action for claims of illegal surveillance.see the ecpa provides a cause of action to any person whose communication is intercepted,disclosed,or intentionally used k the fisa provides that a n aggrieved person who has been subjected to an electronic surveillance or about whom information obtained by electronic surveillance of such person has been disclosed or used in violation of section of this title shall have a cause of action against any person who committed such violation a the sca provides that any provider of electronic communication service,subscriber,or other person aggrieved by any violation of this chapter may maintain a civil action if the violation was done knowingly or intentionally.
in a similar vein,with respect to her constitutional claim,jewel alleges a concrete claim of invasion of a personal constitutional right the first amendment right of association and the fourth amendment right to be free from unreasonable searches and seizures.just last term,the supreme court confirmed an individual right to challenge the legality of executive branch conduct on grounds,jewel third constitutional claim i ndividuals sustain discrete,justiciable injury from actions that transgress limitations.principles are intended,in part,to protect each branch of government from incursion by the others.yet the dynamic between and among the branches is not the only object of the constitution concern.the structural principles secured by the separation of powers protect the individual as well.bond.at.
satisfied that jewel sufficiently alleged concrete injury,we turn now to the more difficult question,whether the rights asserted are sufficiently particularized.the breadth of jewel allegations calls into question whether she has a particularized grievance or instead one that is held in common by all members of the public,schlesinger reservists comm.to stop the war,and thus necessarily an abstract interest shared by all citizens.the critical question is whether she has alleged such a personal stake in the outcome of the controversy as to warrant invocation of jurisdiction.summers earth island,d internal quotation marks omitted.
the supreme court observed in federal election commission akins that,w hether styled as a constitutional or prudential limit on standing,the court has sometimes determined that where large numbers of americans suffer alike,the political process,rather than the judicial process,may provide the more appropriate remedy for a widely shared grievance,d.but the fact that a harm is widely shared does not necessarily render it a generalized grievance.in akins,the court gave context to the notion of a generalized grievance,explaining that petitioners lack standing in cases where the harm at issue is not only widely shared,but is also of an abstract and indefinite nature for example,harm to the common concern for obedience of law.u.at quoting singer sons union pac.see also lujan,at we have consistently held that a plaintiff raising only a generally available grievance about government claiming only harm to his and every citizen interest in proper application of the constitution and laws does not state an article iii case or controversy.the court in akins continued o ften the fact that an interest is abstract and the fact that it is widely shared go hand in hand.but their association is not invariable,and where a harm is concrete,though widely shared,the court has found injury in fact.at.as examples of widely shared but concrete injuries the court listed a widespread mass tort or where large numbers of voters suffer interference with voting rights conferred by law.id.indeed,it does not matter how many persons have been injured by the challenged action so long as the party bringing suit show s that the action injures him in a concrete and personal way.massachusetts epa,d quoting lujan,at kennedy,concurring in part and concurring in the judgment.
we recently considered the prerequisites for a sufficiently concrete and specific injury in newdow lefevre,an establishment clause challenge to the inscription in god we trust on coins and currency.cir,cert.denied,d.we held that newdow met the standing requirement.the fact that his encounters with the motto are common to all americans does not defeat his standing,because newdow has alleged a concrete,particularized,and personal injury resulting from his frequent,unwelcome contact with the motto.id.at.this case illustrates that even though the experience at the root of newdow complaint was shared by virtually every american,this widespread impact was not dispositive of standing because his grievance was nonetheless concrete and particular.
following the rationale of akins and newdow,we conclude that jewel alleged a sufficiently concrete and particularized injury.jewel allegations are highly specific and lay out concrete harms arising from the warrantless searches.jewel described these actions as a dragnet and alleged that t his network of surveillance configurations the technical means used to receive the diverted communications indiscriminately acquired domestic communications as well as international and foreign communications.specifically,jewel alleged that t hrough this network of surveillance configurations other means,defendants have acquired and continue to acquire the contents of domestic and international wire electronic communications sent received by plaintiffs and class members.in addition to capturing internet traffic,defendants and at t acquire all or most domestic and international phone calls to or from at t long distance customers,including both the content of those calls and dialing,routing,addressing signaling information pertaining to those calls.
the complaint also described in detail the particular electronic communications equipment used switch and worldnet internet room at the particular at t facility folsom street,san francisco where jewel personal and private communications were allegedly intercepted in a secret room known as the secure room.accepting jewel allegations as true,she has pled more than the minimum general factual allegations required to survive dismissal.bernhardt,at.the court need not pass upon abstract,intellectual problems,but can adjudicate concrete,living contests between adversaries.akins,at internal quotation marks and alteration omitted.akins establishes that,where the injury is sufficiently concrete and specific,that it is widely shared does not deprive congress of constitutional power to authorize its vindication in the federal courts.at.
significantly,jewel alleged with particularity that her communications were part of the dragnet.the complaint focused on at t and was not a scattershot incorporation of all major telecommunications companies or a blanket policy challenge.jewel complaint also honed in on at t folsom street facility,through which all of jewel communications allegedly passed and were captured.
our decision is consistent with the approach in other circuits.the second circuit recently determined,after conducting a detailed analysis,that plaintiffs in a similar suit had standing to challenge provisions of the fisa.amnesty int l united states clapper,cir.amnesty international involved a facial challenge to of the fisa in which the plaintiffs alleged injuries were fear that the government will intercept their sensitive international communications and the costs associated with efforts to avoid such anticipated injuries.id.at.jewel has much stronger allegations of concrete and particularized injury than did the plaintiffs in amnesty international.whereas they anticipated or projected future government conduct,jewel complaint alleges past incidents of actual government interception of her electronic communications,a claim we ac
