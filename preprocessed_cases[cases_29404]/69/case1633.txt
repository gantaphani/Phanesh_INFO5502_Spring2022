gse lining technology,gse appeals from the decision of the district court denying its motion for judgment as a matter of law jmol that two of,patents relating to landfill liner technology were invalid,gse lining,wl,order.gse also appeals from the denial of its motion for a new trial on damages.id.because we agree with the district court claim construction with respect to patents and because there is sufficient evidence to support the jury verdict,we affirm the denial of jmol of invalidity for both patents.however,because the district court erred in permitting to claim the lost profits of a related corporation,in its damages calculations,we reverse the district court denial of gse motion for a new trial on damages and remand for the district court to redetermine whether has incurred lost profits.
background 
owns united states patents,directed to a textured landfill liner,and,covering a method for making such a liner.both patents have an effective filing date of april,and both issued in.the patents disclose a liner that comprises a smooth inner layer bonded to textured outer layers.the texture in the outer layers is created by a blowing agent that erupts during the extrusion process,producing a surface useful for gripping sloped dirt surfaces.the inner layer protrudes from the outer textured layers,and,when welded to the smooth portion of an adjoining sheet,it forms a strong seal to create an effective barrier for landfill use.
the process employs a circular die to shape thermoplastic material into a long,hollow tube,and concentric channels in the die produce plastic sheets having multiple layers.the extruded material is then cut into rectangular sheets.claims that its innovation went against the traditional understanding about the process used to create liners.it asserts that before its invention,the prevailing belief in the industry was that balanced thermoplastic flow and uniform velocity within a die were critical parameters for normal production.in contrast,invention called for blocking certain channels in the die that normally produced the outer layers,so that the liner would have a smooth layer without the textured portions.claimed that a skilled artisan would not have intentionally obstructed a channel in a die for fear of damaging the equipment and incurring significant expense in repair and lost production time.
in july,sued serrot international,serrot,alleging infringement of the and patents.serrot moved for summary judgment of invalidity,arguing that patents were invalid as anticipated.it argued that gloucester engineering manufactured for another company,gundle lining system,a die the gundle die that was capable of performing the method claimed in the patent.that machine,serrot claimed,was sold in and thus is anticipatory prior art under the b bar.serrot also asserted that the and patent claims were anticipated or,in the alternative,were rendered obvious by another existing liner product,friction seal,made by a cast process,not a process.the district court rejected serrot theories of invalidity,and it denied serrot motion for summary judgment,serrot int l,wl,claim construction order.
serrot thereafter conceded infringement,and the case proceeded to trial before a jury on serrot invalidity defenses,willfulness,and damages.in december,the jury returned a verdict in favor of,concluding that the patents were not invalid and finding that serrot had willfully infringed the patents,serrot int l,slip op.at,wl,jury verdict.the jury awarded damages of million in lost profits and a reasonable royalty of million.id.at.
following the jury verdict,gse filed a motion for jmol,arguing that the patents were invalid for anticipation and obviousness.it also moved for jmol or,alternatively,a new trial on damages,asserting that the jury award was against the great weight of the evidence.the district court denied gse motions for jmol of invalidity,but it did conclude that the jury reasonable royalty award was unreasonable to the extent that the amount was greater than the maximum reasonable royalty damages award that was supported by the trial evidence.the court conditioned the denial of gse motion for a new trial on acceptance of a remittitur of of the reasonable royalty award.order,slip op.at.
accepted the remittitur,and gse now appeals from the denials of its motion for jmol of invalidity and its motion for a new trial on damages.gse does not appeal from the willfulness decision,nor is infringement at issue in this appeal.we have jurisdiction pursuant to a.

the denial of a motion for a new trial is an issue not unique to patent law thus,we apply the law of the regional circuit in which the district court this case,the fifth circuit.see wms gaming int l game.in the fifth circuit,t he decision to grant or deny a motion for a new trial will be disturbed only for abuse of discretion or misapprehension of the law.woodfield bowman,cir citing mitchell lone star ammunition,cir.the fifth circuit affirms the denial of a motion for new trial unless,on appeal,the party that was the movant in district court makes a clear showing of an absolute absence of evidence to support the jury verdict,thus indicating that the trial court had abused its discretion in refusing to find the jury verdict contrary to the great weight of the evidence.whitehead food max of,cir.
a.the patent 
on appeal,gse argues as it did in the district court that method patent was anticipated by the sale of the gundle die.gse maintains that,because the die was capable of performing the process that later claimed,the sale of the die was a b bar.it claims that the district court relied on and misinterpreted in re kollar,as holding that a sale of a method does not constitute a sale within the meaning of b until the method has been put into commercial practice.gse argues that our decision in minton national ass of securities dealers,holds otherwise,so that even though the gundle die may not have been used to carry out the claimed process before the critical date of patent,its sale still represents a statutory bar to the patentability of the process.additionally,it contends that the jury could not have reasonably concluded that the choker slides in the gundle die were not the same as the plugs in the claims of the patent.
responds that the district court was correct to deny gse motion for jmol because the process later claimed in the patent was not ready for patenting when the gundle die was sold in.that defect,it argues,prevents the sale from becoming a bar to patentability.asserts that our decision in kollar is inapposite and that gse has generally failed to show that the jury charge regarding the sale of the gundle die was either erroneous or prejudicial.also,argues that the jury could have found a material difference between the choker slides and the claimed plugs and that such a finding was supported by substantial credible evidence.
we agree with that the district court properly denied gse motion for jmol.our analysis begins with the relevant statute,b,which provides in relevant part that a person shall be entitled to a patent unless the invention was on sale in this country,more than one year prior to the date of the application for patent in the united states whether an invention is on sale within the meaning of b is a question of law based on underlying factual findings.kollar,at.because a patent is presumed to be valid,and that presumption can be overcome only by clear and convincing evidence of facts to the con
