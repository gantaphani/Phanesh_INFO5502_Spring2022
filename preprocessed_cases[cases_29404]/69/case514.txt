on july,winson cox applied for a job as an electrician with aneco,a contractor.cox was a paid,union organizer for the international brotherhood of electrical workers,local union number the union,and he sought employment with aneco to help organize aneco workers.this process,where union organizers seek to become employees of a company targeted by the union,is known as salting.typically,union salts only work for an employer as long as there is a prospect of success at organizing its workers,and they are trained to leave an employer by striking rather than resigning,so as to preserve their rights to reinstatement.
cox disclosed his motives during his job interview,and aneco refused to hire him.id.five years later,on february,the national labor relations board the board held that aneco refusal to hire cox violated sections a and a of the national labor relations act nlra.the board ordered that cox be made whole for any loss of earnings and other benefits he may have suffered from the date he applied for employment to the date respondent makes him a valid offer of employment.aneco,nlrb,wl.
in response to the board ruling,aneco offered cox employment on april.cox accepted the offer and worked for aneco for about five weeks,leaving during an unfair labor practice strike called by a local from tampa.cox never made an offer to return to work for aneco nor did he request reinstatement.
paid union organizers who seek employment with other companies are protected by the national labor relations act.see nlrb town country electric,d.aneco conceded that its refusal to hire cox in was an unfair labor practice,however,aneco and the general counsel were unable to agree on the appropriate amount of backpay owed to cox.the general counsel sought backpay in the amount of,for ten of the nineteen quarters between july,the date aneco unlawfully refused to hire cox and april,the date aneco hired cox.aneco opposed this,arguing that cox did not conduct a reasonable search for interim employment during those ten quarters and,hence,did not fulfill his duty to mitigate his income loss.in the alternative,aneco contended that the period of cox backpay award should be far shorter than the ten quarters sought by the board because it is wrong to assume that cox,had he been hired by aneco in july of,would have continued working at aneco through april.aneco argued that cox,as a union salt,would have left aneco when his employment there no longer served the union organizational interests hence,cox would not have worked ten quarters for aneco and should not be awarded in backpay.
after a compliance hearing,the administrative law judge rejected aneco argument that cox failed to mitigate his income loss.however,the alj refused to award cox the full in backpay sought by the general counsel,and instead awarded cox five weeks of back pay in the amount of.noting that cox,as a union salt,would have spent no more time working for aneco than necessary to organize its employees or conclude that such organizing would not be practical,the alj concluded that,had aneco hired cox in july of,he would have only worked five weeks for aneco.in so concluding,the alj relied on the fact that cox,when finally hired by aneco in april of,worked only for five weeks before leaving.
the board reversed the alj finding that cox would have only worked five weeks for aneco had he been hired in,stating that aneco failed to present specific evidence on this issue.relying on the principle that t he board resolves uncertainties or ambiguities against the,the board ordered that aneco pay cox the full in backpay sought by the general counsel.citations omitted.the board also found,as did the alj,that cox fulfilled his duty to mitigate.
aneco petitions this court for review,and the board for enforcement of its order.for the reasons that follow,we grant enforcement in part,deny enforcement in part,and remand.
title,c authorizes the board to award backpay in response to an unfair labor practice.however,a backpay order may only serve as a compensatory,remedy,not a punitive sanction or deterrent.see nlrb pepsi cola bottling of fayetteville,cir.a backpay order is a means to restore the situation as nearly as possible,to that which would have obtained but for the illegal discrimination.coronet foods,national labor relations board,cir quoting phelps dodge nlrb.
aneco raises two challenges to the board award of backpay,and we address each for abuse of discretion.see coronet foods,at cir.
aneco first argues that cox did not conduct a reasonable job search between july,and april,and,therefore,failed to mitigate his income loss.after aneco refused cox employment in,cox did not embark on the type of thorough job search one would expect from one who is unemployed.there were several reasons for this failure,all related to cox role as a union salt.first,cox already had a job with the union,which dampened his financial incentives to obtain additional employment.moreover,because cox purpose in seeking a second job was to organize the workers of that company on behalf of the union,cox only applied to companies where there was a realistic chance to organize their workers.the union forbade cox from applying to work for companies that were already unionized,including all companies that hired through the union hiring hall.in addition,cox could not work for small companies with too few employees to be of organizing interest to the union,nor large companies with so many employees that organizing them would be difficult.given these restrictions,cox visited a total of only companies during the ten quarters for which the board awarded backpay.
finally,in addition to the narrow scope of his job search,cox further hurt his chances of finding employment by bringing other electricians with him when he applied for a job,some of whom were better qualified than he,apparently,cox brought his friends along to serve as potential witnesses at an unfair labor practice hearing,and also to increase the number of union organizers working for the company.
not surprisingly,although he maintained his employment with the union,cox never found another job to salt until aneco offered him employment in.
despite the limited nature of cox job search,the board held that cox fulfilled his duty to mitigate his income loss.according to the board,an employer seeking to prove a failure to mitigate by a union salt must show that the union policies unreasonably limited the discriminatee job search.rejecting the notion that the mere existence of any union restrictions was per se unreasonable,the board held that aneco failed to show that any specific restrictions on cox job search imposed by the union were unreasonable.
employees who lose their jobs as a result of an unfair labor practice must mitigate their damages by making a reasonable effort to obtain interim employment,and the burden of proving a failure to mitigate rests on the employer.coronet foods,at.if cox had been unemployed,rather than a union salt,during the time of his job search,we would hold without hesitation that he failed to make a reasonable effort to obtain interim employment.for the typical person seeking work,it can not be considered a reasonable effort to eliminate all and employers from one job search,and we doubt it can be considered a reasonable effort to apply for a job with a group of friends,absent a clear understanding from the potential employer that a bloc of workers is needed.
cox,however,was not an unemployed person looking for a job he was a employee of the union and his purpose in seeking further employment was to advance the union organizational interests.thus,the crucial issue is whether cox status as a paid union organizer permitted the board to find that his job search represented a reasonable effort,even though such a search could not be deemed reasonable if undertaken by an ordinary,unemployed discriminatee.given the deference owed to the board in determining backpay remedies,we conclude that it was permissible for the board,in determining whether cox undertook reasonable efforts to obtain interim employment,to take into account the duties he owed to his union employer.previous board decisions have held that limits on job searches designed to accommodate a discharged worker responsibilities to another employer are reasonable,see acme bus,nlrb,wl holding that discriminatee fulfilled his duty to mitigate even though he limited his search to jobs with starting times after am,to accommodate his job as a nursing assistant american pacific concrete pipe general truck drivers union,nlrb,wl holding that discriminatee was not required to accept a job that would require him to abandon active duty service in the air force reserve,and we see no reason to question the propriety of those decisions.
we do not hold,however,that the board may find that any restrictions on an interim job search caused by a discriminatee duties to another employer are reasonable per se.compare tualatin electric,nlrb,stating that the board may limit the duty to mitigate so as not to require a salt to accept employment that would subject him to union discipline or require him to abandon full union membership.we could not,for example,uphold a finding of mitigation if the limits on a discriminatee job search,ostensibly caused by his duties to another employer,were not reasonably related to that employment.in this case,however,we find that the board could,without abusing its discretion,find that cox limited interim job search was reasonable given his duties as a union salt.while applying for jobs in groups did hurt cox chances of obtaining employment,aneco is unable to show that such was unreasonable given the union need for multiple salts on a job site.in addition,while only employers in ten quarters does not seem like a lot to visit,aneco has failed to show that cox neglected other employers who were also fertile targets for union organizing.
we conclude that the board did not abuse its discretion in rejecting aneco argument that cox failed to mitigate his damages.
aneco next contests the board decision to award cox backpay for ten quarters,rather than for five weeks,challenging the board presumption that,had aneco hired him on july,cox would have remained on the job through april.aneco argues that cox would have quit working for aneco when it no longer served the union interests for cox to stay,and that this would have occurred long before april.
the board held that aneco,as a wrongdoing employer,bears the burden of proving that cox would not have remained at the job which he was unlawfully denied.aneco failed to carry its burden,according to the board,because aneco did not present any specific evidence that cox would not have worked five years for aneco,and that any uncertainties as to this must be resolved against the,aneco.
given the evidence presented in this case,we conclude that the board abused its discretion in calculating the backpay period on the assumption that,had he been hired in,cox would have worked for aneco for five years.aneco did present specific evidence to show that this assumption was indefensible.first,cox was not an ordinary employee,but a union salt whose sole purpose in seeking employment with aneco was to organize its workers.accordingly,it was undisputed that cox would have left his job at aneco when it no longer served the union organizational interests.while cox duties to the union allowed us to uphold the board finding that cox mitigated his damages by conducting a reasonable job search,his duties to the union undermine the board assumption that cox would have stayed on the job for five years.
second,cox actually worked for aneco in after the board ordered him reinstated,and he worked for only five weeks before leaving during an unfair labor practice strike.although the board correctly noted that this does not prove that cox would have invariably departed from aneco in five weeks had he been hired in,it is still strong evidence that cox stint at aneco would have been far less than five years,and strongly suggests the board award of backpay serves a punitive rather than compensatory function.
finally,there are no examples in the record of a union salt ever remaining on the payroll of another company for five years.harry brown,the union business manager,testified that some organizing campaigns against companies other than aneco lasted several years,and also testified that the union might have desired to keep cox on aneco payroll for five years if it was productive.but there is no testimony that a union salt was employed at a single company for a period as part of these campaigns,nor is there any indication that cox would have stayed at aneco for five years given the circumstances at aneco in 
we acknowledge,as did the alj,that any calculation of how long cox would have worked if aneco had hired him on july,is somewhat speculative.however,a backpay order must restore the situation as nearly as possible,to that which would have obtained but for the illegal discrimination.coronet foods,at.in light of cox role as a union salt,as well as the fact that cox only worked five weeks for aneco when hired in,we can not enforce the board award of backpay premised on the assumption that cox would have worked five years for aneco had he been hired in july of.to do so in the face of this evidence would provide a windfall to cox and would exceed the board authority to award only remedies,and not punitive sanctions.see pepsi cola bottling,at.unlike nlrb ferguson,cir,where there was an absence of record evidence as to how long the unlawfully discharged union salt would have remained with the employer,there is ample evidence in the record to suggest that cox would not have worked five years for aneco.the board contrary holding in the face of this evidence is an abuse of discretion,and can not be enforced.
on remand,based upon the record in the case,we would expect the appropriate,remedy for cox to be somewhere around the five weeks of backpay awarded by the alj.however,there may be circumstances,unforeseen to us,that would justify an award slightly beyond that amount.the board responsibility on remand is to fashion a compensatory remedy that will restore cox,as nearly as possible,to the circumstances that he would have enjoyed but for aneco illegal discrimination.
conclusion 
we enforce the board finding that cox mitigated his income loss,but decline to enforce the board award of backpay.the case is remanded to the board to fashion a remedy that will restore cox,as nearly as possible,to the circumstances that he would have enjoyed but for aneco illegal discrimination.
it is so ordered.
i concur in the court holding that the board properly considered cox duties to the union in determining whether his job search was reasonable.i respectfully dissent from the court holding regarding the length of the back pay period.the majority superficially recognizes that the employer bears the burden of showing that the employee would have left earlier.the majority application of this standard,however,shifts the burden to the employee.
ordinarily,the back pay period runs from the date of the wrongful act to the date of reinstatement.see,nlrb waco insulation,cir finding that back pay was limited to the period between the unlawful discharge and the reinstatement.once the amount of back pay due has been established,the burden shifts to the wrongful employer to demonstrate why the award should be decreased.lundy packing,at.our case law establishes,in effect,a rebuttable presumption that an employee will receive back pay for the entire period between the date of the unlawful act and the date the act is corrected,unless the employer produces sufficient evidence to rebut the presumption.see tualatin,at upholding the board application of this presumption bales nlrb,cir finding that the board clearly understood the legal standard that tolling back pay requires the employer to show by a preponderance of the evidence that employment would not have lasted the entire period.
aneco evidentiary burden was to prove by a preponderance of the evidence that cox would have quit at an earlier time.the board acknowledged that as a salt,cox could have left his job with aneco prior to april.emphasis in original.the board noted,however,that both cox and the union business manager t
