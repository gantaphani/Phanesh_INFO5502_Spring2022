penal code section,subdivision c states that a person who petitions for a change of plea or to set aside a verdict under section may be required to pay the actual cost of services rendered by the county at a rate determined by the county board of supervisors.the statute requires the court to determine the petitioner ability to pay and gives the court discretion to order reimbursement of all or part of the cost for services.petitioners joseph lewis and donald mitchell moore petitioned this court for a writ of mandate,challenging a fee imposed by the superior court clerk to file a petition for relief under section.
we conclude that penal code section,subdivision c authorizes the imposition of a fee only after the superior court determines that the petitioner has the ability to pay without undue hardship and exercises its discretion to order payment,and therefore the superior court clerk can not impose the fee at the time of filing.we also conclude that the court may require payment of all or part of a fee predetermined by the board of supervisors and need not determine the actual cost of services rendered for each petition,and that no oral hearing is required to determine each petitioner ability to pay.

contentions 
lewis and moore contend penal code section,subdivision c gives the court discretion to assess costs and does not authorize the court clerk to impose a mandatory filing fee the court can assess only the actual costs incurred by the county in connection with a petition,which must be determined at a hearing,and can not assess a predetermined fee and the court can assess costs only after conducting an oral hearing to determine the petitioner ability to pay the costs without undue hardship.
the superior court,superior court clerk,and the people refute these contentions.they also contend the petitioner may apply for a waiver of court fees under california rules of court,rule upon filing the petition if the petitioner can not pay the fee without undue hardship.
