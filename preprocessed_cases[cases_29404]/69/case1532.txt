background 
this is the third appeal we have heard in this nearly decade old hatch waxman dispute regarding clopidogrel bisulfate tablets,sold by sanofi under the brand name plavix.in the first appeal,we affirmed the district court grant of a preliminary injunction.sanofi synthelabo apotex,plavix i.in the second appeal,we affirmed the district court judgment that the is not invalid,infringed,and not unenforceable.sanofi synthelabo apotex,f d plavix ii.the facts most relevant to this appeal are set forth as follows.
on november,apotex,through its agent,apotex,filed an abbreviated new drug application anda with the united states food and drug administration fda seeking approval for the sale of generic clopidogrel bisulfate tablets prior to the expiration of patent the patent.plavix i,at.the submission included a paragraph iv certification pursuant to j a vii iv asserting that the patent is invalid.id.at.in response to the submission,sanofi filed suit on march,alleging that the filing of the anda constituted an act of infringement under e.id.although apotex admitted that its proposed generic product would infringe claim of the patent,apotex counterclaimed seeking a declaration that the patent is invalid and unenforceable.id.sanofi filing of the suit within days of receiving notice of apotex paragraph iv certification triggered a stay of fda approval for the anda pursuant to j b iii.id.
the stay expired on may,and on january,the fda gave apotex final approval to sell its generic product.id.prior to the fda approval,the parties initiated settlement negotiations that culminated in a tentative agreement on march,the march agreement.id.in the march agreement,sanofi granted apotex a future license under the patent,which would allow apotex to begin sale of its generic product several months before the patent expired.sanofi also expressly agreed,inter alia,that during the pendency of the license it would not launch an authorized generic.id.
an authorized generic is a generic drug sold by the company who markets the brand name drug or a third party licensee.see mylan,food drug,cir.authorized generics,like other generics,are sold at a reduced price compared to the brand name drug.under the provisions of the hatch waxman act in effect at the time apotex filed its anda,apotex was entitled to a day period of exclusivity during which the fda would not approve other generic clopidogrel bisulfate products once apotex received approval from the fda.j b iv.however,the branded company may still market an authorized generic during this day exclusivity period.mylan,at.the sale of an authorized generic benefits patients through lower prices and the branded company,but harms the generic by introducing generic competition.id.
although bristol myers squibb company bms is not a party to this litigation,it is an owner of plaintiff bristol myers squibb sanofi pharmaceuticals holding partnership.as a result of orders entered in a previous litigation involving bms,the march agreement was subject to approval by the federal trade commission ftc and a consortium of state attorneys general.the ftc objected to multiple provisions of the march agreement,including the provision preventing sanofi from launching an authorized generic during the period of apotex license.in view of these objections,sanofi withdrew the agreement from administrative review and the parties reinstituted settlement negotiations.
on may,the parties executed a second settlement agreement the terms of which are partially at issue in this appeal the may agreement.unlike the march agreement,sanofi did not expressly agree in the may agreement not to launch an authorized generic during the pendency of apotex license.the bms executive negotiating the settlement on behalf of sanofi,however,orally promised apotex that sanofi would not launch an authorized generic during this time period.on may,bms presented the may agreement to the ftc for approval,but failed to disclose the existence of the oral agreement regarding an authorized generic.on june,apotex disclosed the oral agreement to the ftc.in light of apotex disclosure,the ftc requested a written certification from bms to confirm that bms had made no oral promise not to launch an authorized generic during the pendency of apotex license.the bms executive submitted the certification as requested without disclosing the oral promise.on july,the state attorneys general informed the parties that they would not approve the may agreement,but promised to reconsider pending an investigation into the existence of the oral agreement between the parties.
on july,apotex declared a regulatory denial pursuant to its rights under the may agreement,which provided that i f regulatory review has not been completed by july,either party has the right to declare that there has been a regulatory denial and the litigations will be resumed.on august,apotex launched its generic clopidogrel bisulfate product.sanofi moved for a preliminary injunction,which the district court granted on august,sanofi synthelabo.apotex,d,and which we affirmed in plavix in the few weeks that apotex marketed its generic product it had in net sales.
the district court held a bench trial regarding liability between january and february,and on june,issued an opinion holding that the patent was both not invalid and not unenforceable.sanofi synthelabo apotex,d.infringement was not an issue at the trial apotex previously admitted that it infringed under e because its generic product would infringe claim of the patent.additionally,sanofi never amended its pleadings to specifically allege infringement under a b after apotex began selling its generic product.the district court bifurcated the issue of damages,which was scheduled for future proceedings pursuant to e c.id.at.on december,we affirmed the district court decision in plavix ii.
during the pendency of the liability trial and appeal,the government pursued charges against bms in relation to its failure to disclose the oral agreement and its later false certification to the ftc.on may,after the liability trial had ended,but before the district court entered its decision,bms pleaded guilty to making false statements to the ftc in violation of.on march,the ftc brought a civil action against bms,resulting in a consent judgment wherein bms admitted it was in violation of its obligations to truthfully disclose all provisions of the may agreement.bms agreed to pay a civil penalty of.
on may,during the damages stage of the litigation,apotex sought leave to file a supplemental answer,affirmative defenses,and counterclaims.in the supplemental answer,apotex alleged that the patent was unenforceable for patent misuse due to bms failure to disclose the oral agreement to the ftc and its later false certification to the ftc.apotex also added a counterclaim for breach of contract,alleging that bms breached its duty to use reasonable efforts to secure regulatory approval of the may agreement.
the district court denied apotex motion on september.regarding the patent misuse claim,the district court determined that the claim was an unnecessary and inappropriate diversion from the action,that would expand,complicate and prolong discovery in the action and prolong its ultimate resolution.id.at.the district court also determined that given our recent en banc decision in princo international trade commission,en banc,bms actions likely did not constitute patent misuse.id.at.the district court similarly denied the motion to add the breach of contract counterclaim.in doing so,the district court determined that apotex could file the breach of contract suit separately and that granting the motion would both delay disposition of this litigation and prejudice sanofi by requiring it to address an additional area of discovery.id.at.
the may agreement set sanofi actual damages as of apotex net sales.on december,sanofi moved for summary judgment on the issue of damages.on october,the district court granted sanofi motion for summary judgment and ordered apotex to pay in damages of apotex net sales and an additional in prejudgment interest.in awarding prejudgment interest,the district court rejected apotex arguments that the may agreement precluded such an award.sanofi aventis,d at.the district court also rejected apotex arguments that prejudgment interest was not available as a remedy pursuant to e c.id.the district court further held that apotex and apotex were jointly and severally liable for the damages.id.at.apotex appeals and we have jurisdiction pursuant to a.
discussion 
on appeal,apotex argues that the district court erred by granting sanofi prejudgment interest in addition to the damages specified in the may agreement awarding the interest at the prime rate holding apotex jointly and severally liable for sanofi damages and denying apotex motion for leave to file a supplemental answer,affirmative defenses,and counterclaims pleading patent misuse and breach of contract.
prejudgment interest 
we review a district court grant of prejudgment interest for an abuse of discretion.electro scientific indus.scanning.a district court abuses its discretion when its decision is based on clearly erroneous findings of fact,is based on erroneous interpretations of the law,or is clearly unreasonable,arbitrary or fanciful.cybor fas,en banc.
the parties dispute whether paragraph ii of the may agreement limits sanofi recovery of damages.paragraph states that if regulatory denial occurs the litigation between the parties will resume and 
if the litigation results in a judgment that the patent is not invalid or unenforceable,sanofi agrees that its actual damages for any past infringement by apotex,up to the date on which apotex is enjoined,will be of apotex net sales of clopidogrel products sanofi further agrees that it will not seek increased damages under.
emphasis added.
the district court held that paragraph ii did not bar the award of prejudgment interest.sanofi aventis,d at.the district court reasoned that for acts of infringement under e courts may award damages or other monetary relief pursuant to e c after there has been a commercial importation or sale of the generic drug.id.the district court determined that such damages are defined by,under which d amages and interest are distinct categories of recovery.id.at.because the may agreement only explicitly limits damages the district court determined that it did not prevent an additional award of interest on those damages pursuant to.id.at.the district court concluded that i n the absence of any agreement to the contrary,the general rule awarding interest on damages in patent infringement actions remains unaltered.id.at.
apotex contends that the district court abused its discretion by awarding prejudgment interest in addition to the amount of actual damages specified in the may agreement.apotex argues that the may agreement,when read as a whole,shows that sanofi contractually limited its full recovery to of apotex net sales.apotex contends when the parties contemplated a separate interest payment the may agreement expressly provided for it.apotex points to paragraph of the agreement,which defines the amount sanofi will reimburse apotex for apotex investment in inventory 
sanofi will reimburse apotex for apotex stock of clopidogrel bisulfate bulk and finished goods for a price not to exceed million,which apotex represents and warrants is its actual,fully loaded cost for that inventory,as evidenced by documents apotex will provide.that sum will be payable within days after regulatory clearance with interest from the date of execution of this agreement at an annual interest rate of,compounded monthly.
emphasis added.
sanofi argues that the district court did not abuse its discretion by awarding prejudgment interest.sanofi contends that because the agreement is silent regarding prejudgment interest,the district court correctly applied the general rule that prejudgment interest should ordinarily be awarded.motors devex.
sanofi argues that it is inconsequential that interest is expressly included in paragraph of the may agreement,but not in paragraph.sanofi contends that absent the contractual language,apotex would have no statutory right to the interest in connection with reimbursements for inventory specified in paragraph.in contrast,sanofi contends that under it has a statutory right to prejudgment interest that it did not need to preserve in the settlement agreement.
because the interpretation of a settlement agreement is not an issue unique to patent law,we apply the law of the appropriate regional circuit.novamedix,ndm acquisition.the second circuit reviews the district court interpretation of a settlement agreement de novo.hatalmud spellings,cir.
the parties appear to agree that new york contract law governs the interpretation of the may agreement.see appellants br.citing new york contract law appellees br.citing new york contract law.under new york law a court may interpret a contract as a matter of law without resorting to extrinsic evidence if the contract is straightforward and unambiguous.postlewaite.mcgraw hill,cir.even where a contractual term is ambiguous,if the intention of the parties is clear from the four corners of the agreement,interpretation of the contract is a matter of law,and the court may appropriately rule on summary judgment.see id.
the parties dispute hinges on whether paragraph ii of the may agreement allows for the imposition of prejudgment interest in addition to actual damages,or whether the actual damages award is the full measure of sanofi damages.after reviewing the may agreement,we conclude that the parties intended that the phrase actual damages include all damages necessary to compensate sanofi for apotex infringement.because prejudgment interest is a form of compensatory damages,the district court erred by awarding additional prejudgment interest pursuant to.
courts have long held that prejudgment interest is a form of compensatory relief.no matter what area of law is considered,prejudgment interest,when awarded,is part of a successful plaintiff complete compensation.transmatic,gulton,see also oiness.walgreen,prejudgment interest has no punitive,but only compensatory,purposes.interest compensates the patent owner for the use of its money between the date of injury and the date of judgment.the supreme court explained the policy behind awarding prejudgment interest under the patent laws 
an award of interest from the time that the royalty payments would have been received merely serves to make the patent owner whole,since his damages consist not only of the value of the royalty payments but also of the forgone use of the money between the time of infringement and the date of judgment.
motors,at emphasis added.
the may agreement supports this interpretation of actual damages.by allowing sanofi actual damages but expressly excluding increased damages under the patent act,paragraph ii indicates that the parties intended to account for all potential damages at issue 
sanofi agrees that its actual damages for any past infringement by apotex,up to the date on which apotex is enjoined,will be of apotex net sales sanofi further agrees that it will not seek increased damages under.
increased damages under are not compensatory in nature but punitive.see,sensonic,aerosonic.thus,the natural reading of paragraph ii is that sanofi was entitled to collect of apotex net sales as its actual damages compensatory damages,but could not collect any increased damages punitive damages.as the supreme court decision in general motors makes clear,the patentee damages consist not only of traditional valuations of patent damages such as a reasonable royalty or the patentee lost profits,but also prejudgment interest.
moreover,in a separate section of the agreement,paragraph,the parties expressly stated that prejudgment interest should be awarded and the agreement specifically set forth how to calculate such interest.that sum will be payable with interest from the date of execution of this agreement at an annual interest rate of,compounded monthly.we conclude that the may agreement,taken as a whole,indicates that when the parties agreed upon the amount of actual damages they intended this to be the compensatory damages necessary to compensate sanofi for apotex infringement.we interpret the words actual damages in this contract to be the full measure of all compensatory damages including prejudgment interest.
indeed,to construe actual damages not to already include prejudgment interest would lead to a result counter to the general purpose of the agreement.postlewaite,at contracts must be read as a whole,and if possible,courts must interpret them to effect the general purpose of the contract.by agreeing to a simple formula to quantify sanofi actual damages in paragraph ii,the parties avoided litigating a potentially complex issue.such certainty is beneficial to both parties.apotex benefited by knowing the exact amount of its potential liability.sanofi benefited because it could fix damages without having to resort to further litigation,including complex and potentially lengthy discovery.these benefits disappear,however,if prejudgment interest is not included in actual damages since as demonstrated here the parties must engage in further litigation over an additional large liability.
sanofi argues that the district court correctly concluded that it did not need to preserve the right to prejudgment interest,because there is a statutory right to interest under.both parties also make numerous arguments regarding whether the award of prejudgment interest is appropriate in a e infringement action based on their interpretation of the term damages in u.e c and.while interesting,these arguments neither illuminate nor resolve the issue before us the meaning of actual damages in the may agreement.the agreed upon actual damages are a creature of contract and not of the patent act.by entering into the may agreement,the parties decided that the agreement itself not e c or would govern the appropriate measure of damages from apotex infringement.
as the district court correctly noted,i n the absence of any agreement to the contrary,the general rule awarding interest on damages in patent infringement actions remains unaltered.sanofi aventis,d at.such an agreement exists here.to the extent the parties intended actual damages to mean only a reasonable royalty they would have expressly chosen such language as they did in regard to increased damages.sanofi further agrees that it will not seek increased damages under.by failing to do so,the parties manifested a clear intent to have the settlement agreement define the full scope of sanofi potential recovery 
the law strongly favors the settlement of all litigation,including patent disputes.see,hemstreet spiegel.by agreeing to a formula to calculate sanofi actual damages in the may agreement,sanofi gave up any right to supplement its recovery with additional prejudgment interest.because the district court erred in its interpretation of the may agreement,we reverse the district court award of interest pursuant to 
apotex liability 
after apotex engaged in the commercial sale of its generic product,sanofi never amended its complaint to allege either direct infringement under a or induced infringement under b.instead,sanofi only alleged that apotex infringed pursuant to e the infringement provision of the hatch waxman act.infringement under e is a hypothetical case that asks the factfinder to determine whether the drug that will be sold upon approval of the anda will infringe the asserted patent.in re brimonidine patent.section e sets out the only remedies which may be granted by a court for an act of infringement under e.relevant here,the statute sets forth that damages are only available in specific instances,namely 
d amages or other monetary relief may be awarded against an infringer only if there has been commercial manufacture,use,offer to sell,or sale within the united states or importation into the united states of an approved drug 
apotex does not argue that apotex is not an infringer under e.however,during the damages phase of the lawsuit,apotex argued for the first time that apotex is not liable for damages,because it never engaged in the commercial manufacture,use,offer to sell,or sale within the united states or importation into the united states of an approved drug,as required by e c.instead,apotex argued that apotex alone imported the drug and made all commercial sales in the united states.although apotex conceded that it manufactured the drug in canada,apotex nevertheless argues that sanofi failed to present any evidence showing that apotex actions took place in the united states.as a result,apotex claims that it can not be held liable for infringement under e c.
the district court determined that the may agreement governed the damages at issue,and that both apotex and apotex were parties to the agreement.sanofi aventis,d at.the district court also noted that apotex waited until the damages phase of the trial,after the trial on liability already concluded,to draw a distinction for these purposes between apotex and apotex,and to assert for the first time a defense to apotex liability for damages.id.at.
we agree with the district court that the may agreement governs liability in this case and need not address apotex statutory arguments.as discussed above,the clear purpose of paragraph ii of the may agreement was to define sanofi compensatory damages from apotex infringement.the may agreement broadly defines apotex to include apotex and apotex,collectively and individually,and including any entity now or hereafter owned or controlled by any of them.barry sherman,the chairman and ceo of apotex,signed the agreement on behalf of both apotex and apotex.additionally,in the parties stipulated statement of facts in the joint pre trial order,apotex admitted that the acts of apotex with respect to the subject matter of this action were done at the direction of,with the authorization of and with the cooperation,participation and assistance of apotex.thus,the only logical reading of the may agreement is that both apotex and apotex agreed to be jointly and severally liable for sanofi actual damages.therefore,we affirm the district court determination that apotex is jointly and severally liable for sanofi damages.
apotex supplemental answer 
although a court should freely give leave to amend when justice so requires.a,in the second circuit it is within the sound discretion of the district court to grant or deny leave to amend.green mattingly,cir.the second circuit reviews the denial of a motion to amend the pleadings for an abuse of discretion.id.a district court abuses its discretion if it bases its ruling on an erroneous view of the law or a clearly erroneous assessment of the evidence.id.a district court should grant leave to amend i n the absence of any apparent or declared reason such as undue delay,bad faith or dilatory motive on the part of the movant,repeated failure to cure deficiencies by amendments previously allowed,undue prejudice to the opposing party by virtue of allowance of the amendment,or futility of amendment see foman davis,see also mccarthy dun broadstreet,cir a district court has discretion to deny leave for good reason,including futility,bad faith,undue delay,or undue prejudice to the opposing party.to the extent the district court bases the denial of leave to amend upon a legal interpretation,the second circuit reviews the denial de novo.spiegel schulmann,cir.
