we consider here the ability of a copyright holder to dedicate certain work to free public use and yet enforce an open source copyright license to control the future distribution and modification of that work.appellant robert jacobsen jacobsen appeals from an order denying a motion for preliminary injunction.jacobsen katzer,jsw,wl.jacobsen holds a copyright to computer programming code.he makes that code available for public download from a website without a financial fee pursuant to the artistic license,an open source or public license.appellees matthew katzer and kamind associates,collectively develop commercial software products for the model train industry and hobbyists.jacobsen accused of copying certain materials from jacobsen website and incorporating them into one of software packages without following the terms of the artistic license.jacobsen brought an action for copyright infringement and moved for a preliminary injunction.
the district court held that the open source artistic license created an intentionally broad nonexclusive license which was unlimited in scope and thus did not create liability for copyright infringement.the district court reasoned 
the plaintiff claimed that by modifying the software the defendant had exceeded the scope of the license and therefore infringed the copyright.here,however,the jmri project license provides that a user may copy the files verbatim or may otherwise modify the material in any way,including as part of a larger,possibly commercial software distribution.the license explicitly gives the users of the material,any member of the public,the right to use and distribute the material in a customary fashion,plus the right to make reasonable accommodations.the scope of the nonexclusive license is,therefore,intentionally broad.the condition that the user insert a prominent notice of attribution does not limit the scope of the license.rather,defendants alleged violation of the conditions of the license may have constituted a breach of the nonexclusive license,but does not create liability for copyright infringement where it would not otherwise exist.

on this basis,the district court denied the motion for a preliminary injunction.we vacate and remand.
jacobsen manages an open source software group called java model railroad interface jmri.through the collective work of many participants,jmri created a computer programming application called decoderpro,which allows model railroad enthusiasts to use their computers to program the decoder chips that control model trains.decoderpro files are available for download and use by the public free of charge from an open source incubator website called sourceforge jacobsen maintains the jmri site on sourceforge.the downloadable files contain copyright notices and refer the user to a copying file,which clearly sets forth the terms of the artistic license.

jacobsen moved for a preliminary injunction,arguing that the violation of the terms of the artistic license constituted copyright infringement and that,under ninth circuit law,irreparable harm could be presumed in a copyright infringement case.the district court reviewed the artistic license and determined that defendants alleged violation of the conditions of the license may have constituted a breach of the nonexclusive license,but does not create liability for copyright infringement where it would not otherwise exist.id.at.the district court found that jacobsen had a cause of action only for breach of contract,rather than an action for copyright infringement based on a breach of the conditions of the artistic license.because a breach of contract creates no presumption of irreparable harm,the district court denied the motion for a preliminary injunction.
jacobsen appeals the finding that he does not have a cause of action for copyright infringement.although an appeal concerning copyright law and not patent law is rare in our circuit,here we indeed possess appellate jurisdiction.in the district court,jacobsen operative complaint against included not only his claim for copyright infringement,but also claims seeking a declaratory judgment that a patent issued to katzer is not infringed by jacobsen and is invalid.therefore the complaint arose in part under the patent laws.see a golan pingel,explaining that i n the context of a complaint seeking a declaration of noninfringement,the action threatened by the declaratory defendant would be an action for patent infringement,and s uch an action clearly arises under the patent laws.thus the district court jurisdiction was based,at least in part,on a as it relates to the patent laws,and we have appellate jurisdiction under c.see a the district courts shall have original jurisdiction of any civil action arising under any act of congress relating to patents,plant variety protection,copyrights and trademarks.id.at a the federal circuit shall have exclusive jurisdiction of an appeal from a final decision of a district court of the united states if the jurisdiction of that court was based,in whole or in part,on section of this title and the case is not a case involving a claim arising under any act of congress relating to copyrights,exclusive rights in mask works,or trademarks and no other claims under section a.id.at c federal circuit shall have jurisdiction over appeals from interlocutory orders of the district courts refusing injunctions in any case over which the court would have jurisdiction of an appeal under section.
this court looks to the interpretive law of the regional circuit for issues not exclusively assigned to the federal circuit.hutchins zoll med.under ninth circuit law,an order granting or denying a preliminary injunction will be reversed only if the district court relied on an erroneous legal premise or abused its discretion.wright rushen,cir.a district court order denying a preliminary injunction is reversible for factual error only when the district court rests its conclusions on clearly erroneous findings of fact.sports form,united press int l,cir.
in determining whether to issue a preliminary injunction,the ninth circuit requires demonstration of a combination of probability of success on the merits and the possibility of irreparable harm or serious questions going to the merits where the balance of hardships tips sharply in the moving party favor.perfect,cir dep t of parks recreation bazaar del mundo,cir.in cases involving copyright claims,where a copyright holder has shown likelihood of success on the merits of a copyright infringement claim,the ninth circuit has held that irreparable harm is presumed.lgs architects,concordia homes of,cir.but see mgm studios,grokster,d,noting that the longstanding rule that irreparable harm can be a presumed after a showing of likelihood of success for purposes of a copyright preliminary injunction motion may itself have to be reevaluated in light of ebay mercexchange,d.thus,for a preliminary injunction to issue,jacobsen must either show a likelihood of success on the merits of his copyright infringement claim from which irreparable harm is presumed or a fair chance of success on the merits and a clear disparity in the relative hardships that tips sharply in his favor.
public licenses,often referred to as open source licenses,are used by artists,authors,educators,software developers,and scientists who wish to create collaborative projects and to dedicate certain works to the public.several types of public licenses have been designed to provide creators of copyrighted materials a means to protect and control their copyrights.creative commons,one of the amici curiae,provides free copyright licenses to allow parties to dedicate their works to the public or to license certain uses of their works while keeping some rights reserved.
open source licensing has become a widely used method of creative collaboration that serves to advance the arts and sciences in a manner and at a pace that few could have imagined just a few decades ago.for example,the massachusetts institute of technology mit uses a creative commons public license for an opencourseware project that licenses all mit courses.other public licenses support the operating system,the perl programming language,the apache web server programs,the firefox web browser,and a collaborative encyclopedia called wikipedia.creative commons notes that,by some estimates,there are close to works licensed under various creative commons licenses.the wikimedia foundation,another of the amici curiae,estimates that the wikipedia website has more than active contributors working on some articles in more than languages.
open source software projects invite computer programmers from around the world to view software code and make changes and improvements to it.through such collaboration,software programs can often be written and debugged faster and at lower cost than if the copyright holder were required to do all of the work independently.in exchange and in consideration for this collaborative work,the copyright holder permits users to copy,modify and distribute the software code subject to conditions that serve to protect downstream users and to keep the code accessible by requiring that users copy and restate the license and attribution information,a copyright holder can ensure that recipients of the redistributed computer code know the identity of the owner as well as the scope of the license granted by the original owner.the artistic license in this case also requires that changes to the computer code be tracked so that downstream users know what part of the computer code is the original code created by the copyright holder and what part has been newly added or altered by another collaborator.
traditionally,copyright owners sold their copyrighted material in exchange for money.the lack of money changing hands in open source licensing should not be presumed to mean that there is no economic consideration,however.there are substantial benefits,including economic benefits,to the creation and distribution of copyrighted works under public licenses that range far beyond traditional license royalties.for example,program creators may generate market share for their programs by providing certain components free of charge.similarly,a programmer or company may increase its national or international reputation by incubating open source projects.improvement to a product can come rapidly and free of charge from an expert not even known to the copyright holder.the eleventh circuit has recognized the economic motives inherent in public licenses,even where profit is not immediate.see planetary motion,techsplosion,cir program creator derived value from the distribution under a public license because he was able to improve his software based on suggestions sent by it is logical that as the software improved,more used his software,thereby increasing the programmer recognition in his profession and the likelihood that the software would be improved even further.
the parties do not dispute that jacobsen is the holder of a copyright for certain materials distributed through his website also admits that portions of the decoderpro software were copied,modified,and distributed as part of the decoder commander software.accordingly,jacobsen has made out a prima facie case of copyright infringement.argues that they can not be liable for copyright infringement because they had a license to use the material.thus,the court must evaluate whether the use by was outside the scope of the license.see lgs architects,at.the copyrighted materials in this case are downloadable by any user and are labeled to include a copyright notification and a copying file that includes the text of the artistic license.the artistic license grants users the right to copy,modify,and distribute the software 
provided that the user insert a prominent notice in each changed file stating how and when the user changed that file,and provided that the user do at least one of the following 
a place the user modifications in the public domain or otherwise make them freely available,such as by posting said modifications to usenet or an equivalent medium,or placing the modifications on a major archive site such as,or by allowing the copyright holder to include the user modifications in the standard version of the package.
b use the modified package only within the user corporation or organization.
c rename any executables so the names do not conflict with the standard executables,which must also be provided,and provide a separate manual page for each nonstandard executable that clearly documents how it differs from the standard version,or 
d make other distribution arrangements with the copyright holder.
the heart of the argument on appeal concerns whether the terms of the artistic license are conditions of,or merely covenants to,the copyright license.generally,a copyright owner who grants a nonexclusive license to use his copyrighted material waives his right to sue the licensee for copyright infringement and can sue only for breach of contract.sun microsystems,microsoft,cir graham james,cir.if,however,a license is limited in scope and the licensee acts outside the scope,the licensor can bring an action for copyright infringement.see,payday,cir nimmer on copyright,a.
thus,if the terms of the artistic license allegedly violated are both covenants and conditions,they may serve to limit the scope of the license and are governed by copyright law.if they are merely covenants,by contrast,they are governed by contract law.see graham,at whether breach of license is actionable as copyright infringement or breach of contract turns on whether provision breached is condition of the license,or mere covenant sun microsystems,at following graham independent covenant does not limit scope of copyright license.the district court did not expressly state whether the limitations in the artistic license are independent covenants or,rather,conditions to the scope its analysis,however,clearly treated the license limitations as contractual covenants rather than conditions of the copyright license 
jacobsen argues that the terms of the artistic license define the scope of the license and that any use outside of these restrictions is copyright infringement.argues that these terms do not limit the scope of the license and are merely covenants providing contractual terms for the use of the materials,and that his violation of them is neither compensable in damages nor subject to injunctive relief.argument is premised upon the assumption that jacobsen copyright gave him no economic rights because he made his computer code available to the public at no charge.from this assumption,argues that copyright law does not recognize a cause of action for rights,relying on gilliam abc,cir american copyright law,as presently written,does not recognize moral rights or provide a cause of action for their violation,since the law seeks to vindicate the economic,rather than the personal rights of authors.the district court based its opinion on the breadth of the artistic license terms,to which we now turn.
the artistic license states on its face that the document creates conditions the intent of this document is to state the conditions under which a package may be copied.emphasis added.the artistic license also uses the traditional
