in this suit for personal injury based on allegations of medical malpractice,plaintiff joe deocampo plaintiff appeals from an amended judgment.defendants richard ahn,and melvin belafsky,ahn,belafsky,collectively defendants have from the same amended judgment 
the judgment was amended to include the court decisions on certain matters,and it is these that are the subject of this appeal.they relate to the proper calculation of the credit due to nonsettling defendants for a plaintiff prior settlement with the settling defendants,the payment of the plaintiff attorney fees entirely out of the portion of the judgment,the scope and extent of a plaintiff right to prejudgment interest on the periodized portion of a judgment relating to future losses,the proper analysis of a multiple plaintiffs statutory offer to compromise and the effectiveness of such offer when it is conditioned upon the accuracy of a defendant discovery representations regarding insurance coverage,the impact of a settlement with some defendants on the calculation of prejudgment interest against the nonsettling defendants,and the trial court discretionary authority over the manner in which the damages for a plaintiff future losses are periodized.
our resolution of these issues requires only an amendment to the judgment.we therefore will amend the judgment and,as so amended,affirm it.
background of the case 
in october,plaintiff filed this medical malpractice suit,alleging that the medical treatment he received after he sustained a heart attack was negligent,and such negligence caused him to become a paraplegic.the paralyzing injury occurred in july.estela deocampo,plaintiff wife,also sued,alleging damages for loss of consortium.ahn and joseph medical center were named and served as defendants.
in april,plaintiff and his wife plaintiffs,served defendant ahn with a code of civil procedure section offer to compromise the offer was not accepted 
in june of,plaintiff and his wife entered into a million settlement with joseph medical center,the hospital where he was being treated when he sustained his paralyzing injuries.that same month the trial court determined the settlement was made in good faith.the settlement did not specifically apportion the million between plaintiff past and future damages,nor between his economic and noneconomic damages.nor was the settlement apportioned between plaintiff claims and those of his wife.
by an unpublished opinion filed on february,this court reversed a judgment that had been entered in favor of ahn after a jury concluded that while his treatment of plaintiff had fallen below the standard of care,such treatment was not a cause of any injury to plaintiff.our review of the evidence convinced us that the jury finding of no causation was not supported by substantial evidence,and therefore could not stand the evidence had established,to a reasonable medical probability,that had ahn treatment of plaintiff not fallen below the standard of care,plaintiff would have obtained a better result.thus,we returned the case for a new trial on the limited issue of the damages to be paid by defendants 
following remand,and in response to a motion filed by defendants concerning civil code section provisions precluding joint liability among defendants for a plaintiff noneconomic damages in personal injury,wrongful death and property damages cases,plaintiff and his wife stated that if such motion were granted,they would waive their pursuit of noneconomic damages.despite their opposition,the motion was granted,and,on august,plaintiff wife dismissed her portion of this suit,which had sought only noneconomic damages.thereafter,plaintiff did not pursue any claim for noneconomic damages from defendants 
upon retrial,the jury returned a special verdict on september,on the issues of past and future expenses,including medical expenses,and past and future lost wages.a judgment on the special verdict was signed and filed on october,
the parties then made a series of motions.the motions relevant to this appeal were ahn motion to determine the validity of the section offer to compromise which plaintiffs had made to him in april defendants motion for a a section setoff for plaintiff pretrial settlement with joseph medical center and b section periodic payments of the jury award plaintiff motion to fix prejudgment interest pursuant to civil code section and plaintiff motion for section periodic payments of the jury award.
the trial court ruled with respect to these motions as follows plaintiff section offer of compromise on april,was valid and it was not accepted by ahn therefore,plaintiff was entitled to prejudgment interest from that date as provided in civil code section the defendants were granted a setoff for the amount of plaintiff settlement with joseph medical center million and such settlement was set off first against plaintiff past economic damages and then against the prejudgment interest due to plaintiff the total amount of prejudgment interest was determined to be this amount was calculated by determining the present value of the entire judgment,computing interest at from april,the date of the section offer,to june,the date of the settlement with joseph medical center,and adding that number to the interest due on the judgment less the settlement amount,for the period from june,until october,the portion of the judgment that reflected plaintiff future economic damages would be periodized pursuant to section the future medical damages found by the jury were to be paid in equal monthly installments for a total period of months the period of plaintiff life expectancy and the future lost earnings found by the jury were to be paid in equal monthly installments over a total period of months the estimated remaining work life of a old man 
on january,the trial court filed an amended judgment to reflect the changes made by its nunc pro tunc order of december,thereafter,the parties filed their respective appeals from this amended judgment,by which they challenge the rulings reflected in the order of december,that were incorporated in the amended judgment 
issues raised by this appeal 
plaintiff appeal 
plaintiff challenges the way in which the trial court utilized the million settlement that plaintiff and his wife entered into with joseph medical center.the court used the entirety of such settlement as an offset against the combined dollar amount of the jury award for plaintiff past medical and other expenses million,the jury award for plaintiff past loss of earnings,and a portion of the of prejudgment interest that had accrued under civil code section.plaintiff contends the court should have apportioned the settlement according to the ratio of past and future economic damages determined by the jury,but instead it wip ed out his recovery for past damages.
plaintiff also contends the court should have ordered that a portion of his attorney fees and costs come from his future damages award rather than from the remainder of the prejudgment interest to which the court found he is entitled.additionally,plaintiff asserts the court erred when it ruled that the prejudgment interest would stop accruing prior to defendants satisfaction of the judgment.
defendants 
ahn contends plaintiff section offer to him to compromise is unenforceable for purposes of awarding prejudgment interest to plaintiff.ahn also argues that the court erred in its calculation of the prejudgment interest.calculation errors are also alleged by defendants with respect to the court determination of periodic payments for plaintiff future damages.
discussion 
plaintiff appeal 
a.the trial court properly used the million settlement to offset damages owed by defendants 
the record establishes that plaintiff received a settlement of million dollars from joseph medical center,and when the trial court credited that amount to the damages the jury awarded to plaintiff,it credited the bulk of the settlement to plaintiff past lost wages and past medical and other expenses,which together totaled,and it credited the remainder to the in prejudgment interest.as noted,plaintiff argues that this allocation completely wiped out his entire recovery for past damages.
to understand plaintiff argument it is first necessary to review the relevant law applicable to periodic payments in medical malpractice cases.in suits against providers of health care services,section requires a court to order that the future damages of the plaintiff be paid by periodic payments rather than in one lump sum payment,if the award equals or exceeds,and if one of the parties requests such periodic payments 
the jury is required to designate the portion of its verdict that is attributable to the plaintiff future damages.the trial court uses its discretion to determine the amount,frequency and duration of the periodic payments when it constructs a payment schedule.the gross amount of future damages is used to make the payment schedule,not the present value of the future damages.holt regents of university of california th,d.
section is intended to enable courts to provide for the needs of injured plaintiffs and their dependents for the length of time such monetary compensation is necessary.the goal is to prevent early dissipation of an award,and ensure that when the plaintiff incurs losses or expenses in the future,the money awarded to him will be there.while a precise match between future needs and the periodic payments is not necessary,there must be evidence to support the payment schedule developed by the court.
section also addresses plaintiffs who die prematurely after entry of a judgment providing for such periodic payments.section prevents such a plaintiff survivors from receiving the periodic payments that the plaintiff would have received for his or her future care if he or she had not died prematurely,thus preventing the survivors from receiving a windfall of such money which would no longer be needed for the plaintiff care.holt regents of university of california,supra,th at,d.section does not place such a blanket restriction,however,on the periodic payments for the future lost wages awarded to the plaintiff.
plaintiff asserts the court should have apportioned the joseph medical center settlement money according to the ratio of past and future economic damages awarded by the jury,and had the court done so,defendants offset credit against past economic damages and prejudgment interest would have been rather than million,and the risk of plaintiff premature death would not fall on his survivors,who,under the present offset plan,will have no recovery for plaintiff past economic damages if he dies prior to the point where the periodic payments ordered by the trial court match the amount of plaintiff past economic damages.plaintiff contends that in the event of his premature death,all periodic payments ordered pursuant to section will terminate and his family will be left with nothing.
we reject this analysis.first,the settlement money from joseph medical center was more than sufficient to both pay plaintiff past medical and other expenses determined by the jury to have been incurred by him,and to make up for his past lost wages.the award for past damages was not subject to periodizing.moreover,using the settlement for the expenses and lost wages incurred by plaintiff between his paralyzing injury and the time the amended judgment was entered furthers the legislature intent that section periodic payments be devoted to the plaintiff future damages.a procedure that provides for the periodic payment of future damages will further the fundamental goal of matching losses with compensation by helping to ensure that money paid to an injured plaintiff will in fact be available when the plaintiff incurs the anticipated expenses or loses in the future.american bank trust community hospital cal d,italics added.
in sum,the million settlement which plaintiff entered into in june,and which was approved by the court that same month,was available for his expenses and lost wages between the date of his injury in july,and the date of the amended judgment,january.indeed,in his opening brief,plaintiff states that at the time of his settlement with joseph medical center,nearly all of his damages were future damages.by the time of the amended judgment,a portion of those damages constituted the very past damages that the trial court offset with the settlement money.
the cases upon which plaintiff relies do not support his position.in one case,the court rejected constitutional challenges to the validity of section,addressing equal protection,due process,right to a jury trial,and void for vagueness arguments.american bank trust community hospital,supra,cal d.in another case,the court rejected the section periodic payment schedule the trial court had devised,but not because the trial court did not apply a damages ratio to a settlement.holt regents of university of california,supra,th,d.two of the cases have nothing to do with personal injury law.one concerns a hospital claim to a welfare exemption from paying county property taxes rideout hospital foundation,county of yuba th,d,and the other addresses the question whether a party has a right to challenge,by appeal,a trial court good faith settlement determination,when such party petition for writ of mandate respecting that good faith settlement determination had already been summarily denied.maryland casualty andreini th,d.the other cases cited by plaintiff address the apportionment,between a settling defendant and a nonsettling defendant,of liability for economic and noneconomic damages pursuant to civil code section prohibition against joint and several liability for noneconomic damages.espinoza machonga th,d hackett john crane,th,d.it is the very existence of this prohibition that requires courts to determine what portion of a settlement represents a plaintiff economic damages and what portion represents his noneconomic damages.we are aware of no similar statutory requirement that settlements be apportioned between a plaintiff past and future damages.
finally,while section prevents a plaintiff survivors from receiving windfall periodic payments for the plaintiff care after the plaintiff has died,there is no such restriction on a plaintiff dependents receiving payments for lost wages.section provides that money damages awarded for loss of future earnings shall not be reduced or payments terminated by reason of the death of the judgment creditor,but shall be paid to persons to whom the judgment creditor owed a duty of support,as provided by law,immediately prior to his death.
the setoff allocation of the joseph medical center settlement money by the trial court was entirely proper.
b.the court provision for attorney fees was proper 
we also reject plaintiff contention that the trial court should have used a portion of the periodic payments of future damages to pay plaintiff attorney fees.the case upon which plaintiff relies does not support his position.in nguyen los angeles county medical center th,d,plaintiff attorneys made a pretrial request that plaintiff noneconomic damages and her accrued medical expenses be paid to her in a lump sum cash payment,and her future damages be paid in the form of periodic payments under section.after the judgment was entered,the attorneys realized that the lump sum payment would either not cover their fees,or would cover them but such use of the payment would not be in the plaintiff best interest.however,amendment of the judgment was no longer possible.the nguyen court recognized that leaving the attorneys to receive their fees in payments from each of the future period payments was less than satisfactory indeed,the plaintiff might die prematurely and not receive enough periodic payments to enable the attorneys to receive all of their fees.
here,the january,amended judgment provided for an immediate payment from defendant ahn of the remaining prejudgment interest due from him,plus an immediate payment from ahn and belafsky of a the november and december periodic payments totaling,b costs in the amount of,and c the january periodic payment of,for a grand total immediate payment of.this was more than sufficient to pay the fees and costs that plaintiff states in his opening brief were due his attorneys,namely.payment of these fees and costs with the money immediately payable to plaintiff by ahn and belafsky is in keeping with the nguyen court observation that when a plaintiff damage award is divided between an immediately payable cash payment and periodic payments of future damages,a s a general rule,the preferable approach is to satisfy the attorney fees immediately out of the cash payment.this is not only the general practice in the community,it makes the most sense as a matter of legislative intent and public policy.the plaintiff attorney has done what he or she was retained to do once the judgment has been entered.the case is over the fee is earned.nguyen los angeles county medical center,supra,th at,d.the nguyen court stated that if the lump sum payment is sufficient to pay the fees and costs,it is unnecessary to allocate any portions of the periodic payments to such fees and costs.id.at,fn,d.the trial court refusal to do so was thus not error.
c.the trial court correctly declined to award prejudgment interest past the date of the judgment 
by its amended judgment,the court awarded plaintiff prejudgment interest in the amount of.that interest was awarded from the date of plaintiff offer to ahn to compromise april,up to the date of the judgment that was entered,after we remanded this case for a determination of plaintiff damages october.
the amended judgment specifically states that the trial court decline d to award prejudgment interest on the unpaid future damages portion of the judgment.plaintiff challenges this ruling.he contends the court was required to award prejudgment interest until the entire judgment is satisfied.he relies on the following italicized language in civil code section the judgment shall bear interest at the legal rate of percent per annum and interest shall accrue until the satisfaction of judgment.italics added.plaintiff is technically correct he is entitled to interest on the judgment until it is satisfied.hess ford motor,supra,cal th at,d.however,this is a pointless argument as it has no real application in this case.plaintiff overlooks that he has already been awarded and has been paid the full amount of prejudgment interest authorized by civil code section.the trial court calculated the prejudgment interest based upon the entire judgment,except that the future damages were reduced to present value.that amount,was awarded and has already been paid.this was the proper way to calculate the prejudgment interest on a judgment involving the periodized payment of damages for future losses.see holt regents of university of california,supra,th at,d.
however,general principles relating to post judgment interest applicable to all judgments control the amount of any interest to which plaintiff may ultimately be entitled.the only part of the judgment not yet paid relates to future damages and they are to be paid pursuant to section.
pursuant to section,periodic payments,the future damages portion of the jury award are not immediately payable under the amended judgment except for the payments that were due in the two months before the amended judgment was signed and filed,and the periodic payment due the month the amended judgment was signed and filed.therefore,interest will only accrue on each individual periodic payment as that payment becomes due.schiernbeck haight th,d.the purpose of section payments is to provide compensation for losses that are to occur in the future.citation.a plaintiff suffers no detriment if the future damages portion of the award is not paid when judgment is entered because the injury for which the payment is intended to compensate has not yet occurred.by definition,therefore,a periodic payment due on some future date is not unpaid until that date.interest is only awardable to compensate for a delay in payment and compensation for future needs involves no such delay.citation.id.at,d.if each periodic payment is made by defendants in a timely manner,there will be no more interest paid by defendants.
thus,the trial court determination that no additional prejudgment interest was required was correct.
defendants appeal 
plaintiff offer to compromise under section justified the award of prejudgment interest 
the purpose of an offer to compromise is to encourage settlements prior to trial.the offer made by plaintiff and his wife states in relevant part that they,pursuant to section,offered to accept judgment for the combined stated limits of all your insurance policies,of any kind,both primary and excess,known or unknown,which in any way provided coverage for the case,or the sum of,whichever is greater.if at any time it is discovered that you have move sic insurance than previously disclosed,plaintiffs reserve,at their option,the right to vacate this offer or judgment should judgment be entered pursuant to said offer.this offer to compromise was made in april.
defendant ahn articulates a variety of arguments as to why the section offer to compromise should not have been used by the trial court as the basis for awarding plaintiff prejudgment interest on the judgment against ahn.none of them,however,has any merit.
section,subdivision d begins if an offer made by a plaintiff is not accepted italics added.ahn contends plaintiffs offer to compromise is invalid because it was made jointly by two plaintiffs.ahn argues that when an offer is made by only one plaintiff,then the defendant knows the sum of money being demanded by the plaintiff,and this facilitates a court determination whether that plaintiff obtained a more favorable judgment.whatever the general merits of that argument plaintiff wife could only have recovered a maximum of on her cause of action.thus,the bulk of plaintiffs section offer was obviously meant for plaintiff himself.moreover,the trial court could not have been confused about whether plaintiff obtained a more favorable judgment than that for which he offered to settle.since the jury did not award plaintiff wife any damages,it is clear that the damages the jury did award are far greater than the amount requested in the section offer,less the maximum that plaintiff wife could have recovered.
we also reject ahn assertion that plaintiffs offer was illusory and would not have settled the case.italics added.ahn is attempting to interject ambiguity and confusion where there is none.there is no evidence that plaintiffs wanted to settle the case with their offer.quite the opposite.it is clear to this court that plaintiffs wanted to settle with ahn.ahn own court papers show that not all of the eventual defendants were even parties to the case at the time plaintiffs section offer was made,and that at least one of the other defendants had his own liability insurance to which plaintiffs could make a claim.
ahn court papers state that ahn answered the complaint on december,plaintiff served him with interrogatories on march,ahn indicated in his answers to the interrogatories that he had only million in liability insurance for plaintiffs claim ahn was deposed on april,the day after plaintiff received ahn answers to the interrogatories at ahn deposition,plaintiff learned that ahn was employed by defendant belafsky at the time of plaintiff paralyzing injury on april,plaintiff served ahn with the section offer to compromise,and at that time,belafsky had not yet been made a defendant in the case on april,belafsky was added to the case as a doe defendant ahn himself had a liability policy from norcal mutual insurance company for million that would apply to plaintiffs malpractice claims and belafsky was insured by norcal mutual insurance company against his own liability for ahn professional negligence,however,ahn was not insured under belafsky norcal policy.these facts do not support a theory that plaintiffs sought to settle the whole case with their offer to compromise,certainly not when they had just learned of another potentially liable person to be added as a defendant,the defendant belafsky.the offer states plaintiffs were willing to settle with ahn for the greater of million or the combined coverage of ahn policies.
nor are we troubled by the provision in the offer to compromise that would allow plaintiffs,at their option,to vacate their offer,or a resulting section judgment.the provision simply sought to hold ahn to his discovery representation that he only had million in insurance coverage for plaintiffs claims.certainly litigants have a right to condition an offer to compromise on the accuracy of the information supplied by the offeree in discovery.
next,ahn argues that plaintiffs offer was premature.he contends that the case was complex,belafsky had not yet been named as a doe defendant when the offer was made,only two depositions had been taken,the parties did not have sufficient opportunity to determine their potential liability,and thus there was no reasonable expectation that the offer to compromise would be accepted.we do not agree.
ahn was plaintiff neurologist at joseph medical center.he cites no evidence that he did not have access to plaintiff hospital records after he was served,and did not know the extent and value of plaintiff injuries at the time plaintiffs made their offer to compromise.his acceptance or rejection of the offer was not due until a full five months after he answered the complaint.moreover,he was given the section notice of plaintiff intention to file this suit given the horrific extent of plaintiff injuries,ahn certainly had enough time to determine whether it would be worth his while to let plaintiff have his policy limits rather than gamble with his chances at trial.that belafsky was later brought into the case is not relevant certainly,we are not informed how ahn liability could be impacted by belafsky status as a party to the case.
ahn next assertion is that plaintiff should not receive prejudgment interest because plaintiff rejected a million settlement offer made by ahn and belafsky after we issued our opinion in the previous appeal,and that rejection was made even though plaintiff was previously willing to settle for only million.we do not find that a subsequent offer by defendants is relevant.what is relevant is that plaintiffs were willing to let ahn out of the case for his policy limit but ahn rejected the offer and was later found liable for many times plaintiff offer.ahn reliance on wilson stores,th,d is misplaced.there,the plaintiff section offer to compromise for was rejected.some months later,the plaintiff made a second offer to compromise,this time for,which also was rejected.judgment was entered on a jury verdict in the amount of.the court determined the second offer to compromise was the operative one and denied plaintiff request for prejudgment interest.here,plaintiff second offer to compromise was smaller than his first,and defendants offer to compromise was not larger than the jury award.
nor do we agree with ahn contention that plaintiff offer to compromise was vague as to the amount plaintiff requested.the amount was greater of million or the combined limits of ahn policies that would provide ahn with coverage for plaintiff claims.it was a basic policy limit offer.moreover,the actual total of such insurance coverage,if it differed from the stated million figure,was a fact peculiarly within ahn knowledge.
we likewise reject the notion that the offer did not conform to the requirements of section because it did not offer ahn the option of periodizing the judgment prior to its entry.periodic payments of future damages under section are obtained when the party desiring them makes a request of the trial court.plaintiff offer to compromise did not preclude such a request by ahn.
we reject ahn contention that during the period of the parties motions that form the basis of their respective appeals,plaintiff argued that the judgment as a whole,including the prejudgment interest,should be awarded against both ahn and belafsky,and this shows that plaintiffs offer to compromise was invalid.ahn cites no record references to support his assertion of what plaintiff argued.moreover,even if such an argument were made by plaintiff,it would not retroactively invalidate his offer to compromise,which was clearly directed solely to ahn.
nor do we find merit in ahn contention that plaintiff judgment on the special verdict was not more favorable to plaintiff than his section offer to compromise.ahn contends that plaintiff wife dismissal of her suit prevented her from obtaining a more favorable judgment from ahn than what she offered to settle with him for,and therefore,plaintiff is precluded from receiving prejudgment interest because the joint offer to compromise was not exceeded by the judgment.italics added.this argument fails because the judgment against ahn does not belong to plaintiff wife,it belongs to plaintiff.therefore,the fact that the wife dismissed her suit without a recovery against ahn is simply not relevant.the question is still whether plaintiff obtained a judgment against ahn that is more favorable to plaintiff than his offer to ahn for compromise.
clearly plaintiff did obtain such a judgment.the present cash value of plaintiff future damages expenses and lost wages,totaling taken together with plaintiff past damages past expenses and lost wages,totaling,totals.when that figure is offset by the million settlement obtained from joseph medical center,the present cash value of the judgment awarded is reduced to.given that the section offer to compromise included the wife offer to compromise,it is clear that plaintiff portion of the offer was something less than million a figure far less than.
citing no authority whatsoever,ahn argues that it is the cost of an annuity to fund the judgment that must be used to determine whether plaintiff obtained a more favorable judgment than his section offer.ahn asserts the trial court erred when it used the jury determination of the present value of the periodic payments to determine whether a more favorable judgment was obtained.although the cost of an annuity provides one measure of the present value of periodic payments,it is not the only measure.hrimnak watkins th,d.
b.the trial court calculation of the prejudgment interest properly gave consideration to the impact of the joseph medical center settlement 
when the trial court calculated the prejudgment interest,it split its calculations into two steps.the purpose of having two calculations was to allow for the fact that plaintiffs settlement with joseph medical center occurred during the period between their offer to compromise with ahn and the entry of the judgment.
following the mandate of civil code section,the court began its calculation of percent interest by using the date of plaintiffs offer,april,as a starting date.the amount of money to which this rate of interest was applied was,which is the sum of the jury calculations of plaintiff past medical expenses and lost wages,and the present value of his future medical expenses and lost wages.this interest was calculated to the date of the payment of the joseph medical center settlement june,and amounted to.
next,the court calculated interest from june,the day after the settlement with joseph medical center,until october,the date of the judgment entered on the jury verdict.the amount of money to which the statutory rate of interest was applied differed from the court first calculation.this time,the court applied the rate of interest to,which is the original amount of the jury discounted compensatory damage award,less the million settlement.this produced interest in the amount of.together,the two amounts of prejudgment interest totaled.that was the amount awarded.
on appeal,ahn contends the court erred in its prejudgment interest calculation because it used the jury verdict in step one as the principal to which the interest rate was applied,and then used the judgment,the verdict less the settlement,in step two as the principal to which it applied the interest rate.ahn asserts this method is invalid because civil code section specifically states that the judgment shall bear interest at the legal rate of percent per annum italics added,and a judgment is rendered after the trial court offsets a jury award by the amount of a settlement.
ahn relies on section,which states that a judgment is the final determination of the rights of the parties in an action or proceeding.he also cites hrimnak watkins,supra,th at,d,where the court stated that civil code section does not authorize interest on the verdict but only on the judgment.however,hrimnak is distinguishable on its facts.hrimnak addressed the need to reduce a jury verdict because of civil code section statutory cap on noneconomic damages.the jury had awarded the plaintiff in noneconomic damages,and the statutory cap for such damages is.the reduction came in the context of determining whether the judgment was greater than a section offer to compromise.
the hrimnak court literal reading of the word judgment in civil code section made sense in that case given the statutory requirement that the verdict be reduced.the issue before us is different.here it does not make sense to literally apply civil code section.rather,it was proper for the trial court to engage in its process in determining prejudgment interest.splitting the calculation furthered the purpose of section to compensate plaintiff for the loss of use,during the prejudgment period,of the damages to which he was entitled due to ahn having negligently treated him.the trial court recognized that during the period of time between plaintiff injury and the date of the judgment against ahn,plaintiff was deprived of more compensatory damages prior to the settlement with joseph medical center than he was after that settlement.after the settlement,he was deprived of million less in damages than he was prior to the settlement.therefore,the section interest penalty was reasonably less after the settlement than before.
in newby vroman th,d,the court utilized the same formula as used here.the newby court applied that formula when it calculated the amount of interest due a plaintiff under civil code section,which states in an action for the breach of an obligation not arising from contract,interest may be given,in the discretion of the jury.the court rejected the notion that interest should be calculated only on the amount of a jury award that remains after the amounts paid by settling tortfeasors are deducted from such award.the court reasoned that awarding interest in that manner would mean that a plaintiff would not be fully compensated for his loss,and plaintiffs would be less likely to settle.we find that the newby reasoning is applicable to interest awarded under civil code section,especially in light of the supreme court observation that a purpose of prejudgment interest in general,is to provide just compensation to the injured party for loss of use of the award during the prejudgment period.lakin watkins associated industries,supra,cal th at,d,italics added.the fact that newby involved prejudgment interest under civil code section rather than civil code section is not relevant.
we do,however,agree that the judgment should not have included an award of civil code section prejudgment interest on the section prejudgment interest.see fn,ante since a purpose of prejudgment interest is to make the plaintiff whole as of the date of the injury lakin watkins associated industries,supra,cal th at,d,a plaintiff does not need both civil code section prejudgment interest and civil code section prejudgment interest to accomplish that purpose.moreover,this is not a case to which civil code section even applies.plaintiff claim was never based on a claim for payment of a sum certain.
defendants have not demonstrated error in the determination of the periodic payments 
both plaintiff and defendants requested section periodic payments of the future expenses and lost wages awarded by the jury to plaintiff.the amended judgment provided for payments for expenses in the years which is plaintiff projected life expectancy,and payments for lost wages in the years up through what would have been his projected retirement age had he not been injured.
defendants challenge the fact that the trial court ordered equal periodic payments,both for the years in which plaintiff will receive compensation for future expenses and future wages,and also for the later years,when he will receive only compensation for future expenses.defendants assert the payments should be larger as the years progress because one of plaintiff witnesses testified that inflation would play a part in determining plaintiff future economic needs.
actually,defendants make many references in their brief to multiple unnamed witnesses,but they confine actual record citations to the testimony of the person whom they assert supports their position regarding the effect of future inflation on plaintiff economic needs and lost economist whom plaintiff called to testify on his behalf.defendants also cite to schedules filled with rows and columns of numbers,and to their own proposed plans for periodic payments.defendants explanation of these items is that they proportionately matched some life care plan presented by plaintiff to the jury.defendants assert the trial court should have adopted one of the periodic payments plans that they provided to the court.they contend the trial court equal payment plan deprived them of the time value of money.by captur ing all of the inflationary impact and spread ing it equally over all years.italics added.in other words,they argue,this disproportionately assigned inflated dollars to the early years of plaintiff periodic award.they assert that t his was contrary to what the jury assumed,although they do not explain how they know what the jury assumed.they argue that plaintiff will be overcompensated in the early years and under compensated in later years.
we apply an abuse of discretion standard to our review of the trial court plan for periodic payments of future economic damages.salgado county of los angeles cal th,d.here,defendants have not demonstrated abuse of discretion.judgments are presumed to be correct,and reversible error must be affirmatively shown by persons challenging them.walling kimball cal d.
in structuring a schedule under section,a trial court is guided by the evidence of future damages introduced at trial.citations.hrimnak watkins,supra,th at,d.the trial court december,minute order states that the court considered the evidence relating to plaintiff future medical needs and future loss of earnings when it made its periodic payment plan.the court noted that the jury rejected a considerable portion of plaintiff claimed future medical expenses,and the court stated that when it considered the life care plan offered by plaintiff expert and the testimony of all of the parties medical experts,it found it appropriate to order equal payments for plaintiff future medical expenses.
at the hearing on the motions for section payments,the trial court addressed defendants concerns that the court was planning on ordering equal payments for plaintiff future expenses.as it did in its minute order,the court observed that the jurors had rejected significant portions of the future medical expenses that were claimed by the plaintiff,but the court said it did know what portion that was.it could have been the escalations that were factored into it and the interest assumptions.it could have been the future medical expenses.the court stated its belief that making equal payments was probably the safest way to ensure that if there are early surgeries at several hundred thousand dollars,plaintiff has enough money and in the event there are expenses at the other end,he will still have enough money.
in addressing the issue of the equality of the payments for plaintiff future lost wages,the court stated its belief that there was no conflict in the testimony of the parties respective economists about those damages,and while perhaps the court could refigure the periodic payments to include an inflation factor,it is a relatively nominal amount to make a big issue out of.the court observed it would be a difference over the years of future lost wages payments of plus or minus to 
we have been presented with nothing that compels us to send this case back for a recomputation of the periodic payments.the trial court reasoning for both the future expenses and the future lost wages is reasonable.fashioning periodic payments is not an exact science.in holt regents of un
