the defendants appeal from a judgment of the united states district court for the southern district of new york william pauley iii,judge denying their motion for judgment as a matter of law and their motion for a new trial following a jury verdict partially in favor of the plaintiff on his claims regarding the misuse of a research training grant brought on behalf of the government pursuant to the false claims act,et,and awarding principally in treble actual damages.we conclude that where the government has provided funds for a specified good or service only to have defendant substitute a good or service,a court may,upon a proper finding of false claims act liability,calculate damages to be the full amount of the grant payments made by the government after the material false statements were made there was sufficient evidence from which a reasonable jury could determine that the false statements at issue were material to the government funding decision and the district court did not abuse its discretion in excluding evidence of inaction on the part of the national institutes of health in response to the plaintiff complaint regarding the fellowship program in which he had been enrolled.
background 
in,appellants cornell university medical college cornell and wilfred van gorp,a professor of psychiatry at cornell,applied for funding from the ruth kirschstein national research service award institutional research training grant program,also known as the grant program,of the national institutes of health nih.the program funds pre and training programs in biomedical,behavioral,and clinical research.grants are meant to help ensure that a diverse and highly trained workforce is available to assume leadership roles related to the nation biomedical and behavioral research agenda.nih guide,nih national research service award institutional research training grants,at may,united states ex rel.feldman van gorp,joint appendix cir,nih guide.positions funded through grants may not be used for study leading to degrees,except when those studies are a part of a formal combined research degree program,such as the id.at.instead,funded programs must train their fellows with the primary objective of developing or extending their research skills and knowledge in preparation for a research career.id.
institutions applying for grants undergo a review process.it begins with a review of the proposal by a initial research group irg,also called a peer review committee.irg members are independent experts in scientific fields related to that of the grant application under review they are not nih employees.each member scores applications based on his or her view of its scientific or technical merit guided by specified criteria,including,among other factors the program director and faculty training records,as determined by the success of former trainees the objective,design,and direction of the program the caliber of the faculty the institutional training environment,including the commitment of the institution to training and the resources available to trainees and the institution proposed plans for recruiting and selecting trainees.the scores are then averaged to arrive at an irg priority score.testimony of robert bornstein at,july,bornstein testimony.this score is included with the irg members written comments in a summary statement,which is transmitted to the nih.
the second tier of review is performed by the advisory council of the appropriate constituent organization of the nih,in this case the national institute of mental health nimh.the advisory council ranks the applications by priority score,and establishes a pay line at the point in the list of applications where there is no more funding available only the applications above the pay line are recommended to the director of the funding institute as potential grant recipients.the role of the advisory council is not to the scientific review of the irg.rather,the council reviews the applications to ensure that they further the goals and interests of the awarding institute.thus,the irg review and the resulting score are keys to nih funding.id.at.
once an application has placed above the pay line,the advisory council makes recommendations based on the scientific merit of the proposal,as judged by the irg,and the relevance of the proposal to the awarding institute programs and priorities.funding is typically approved by the nih for one year,and recipient institutions are eligible for up to four years of additional funding.
in order to renew a grant,the recipient institution in this case cornell must submit an annual renewal application and a progress report detailing the status of its project.in contrast with initial grant applications,renewal applications are reviewed solely by the nih on a noncompetitive basis.the nih considers the progress made under the grant and the grant budget.by regulation,the annual progress report must contain a comparison of actual accomplishments with the goals and objectives established for the period,and must specify r easons why established goals were not met,if indeed they were not.d.
recipient institutions must also immediately notify nih of developments that have a significant impact on the research program,including problems,delays,or adverse conditions which materially impair the ability to meet the objectives of the award.id.f.this notification must also include a statement of the action taken or contemplated,and any assistance needed to resolve the situation.see also draft oig compliance program guidance for recipients of phs research awards,prompt voluntary reporting will demonstrate the institution good faith and willingness to work with governmental authorities to correct and remedy the problem.in addition,reporting such conduct may be considered a mitigating factor by the responsible law enforcement or regulatory office.
cornell initial grant application at issue here sought funding for a fellowship program entitled neuropsychology of fellowship.van gorp grant application at,april,grant application.the application explained that the fellowship would train as many as six fellows at a time in child and adult clinical and research neuropsychology with a strong emphasis upon research training with.id.at.the training program would,according to the application,build on the cornell faculty extensive research into the neuropsychology of,which included projects examining distress levels in hiv aids patients during the course of their illness,the relationship between the neuropsychology of and patients abilities to function at work or in school,and the possibility of using neuropsychological testing to predict whether aids patients will suffer from dementia.the application further explained that van gorp would serve as the program director,and that he had a long history of successful research,training and mentoring of students in hiv related work.id.at.
the page grant application outlined the fellowship curriculum in detail.fellows would be required to take several formal,core didactic courses,and a number of elective courses.id.at.in the first year of the fellowship,fellows would enroll in five core courses,some of which have been designed specifically for the hiv neuropsychology fellowship.these core courses would be supplemented by a large number of courses,lectures,neuroscience educational programs,as well as other seminars in a variety of areas.id.the curriculum for the second year,which included four core courses,would allow fellows to develop more independent research skills and devote more time to their hiv research.id.the fellows progress under the grant would be monitored monthly by a formal training committee comprised of several faculty members,as o ngoing evaluation of the curriculum,trainees and faculty is an integral part of the training program.id.at.
the cornell grant application identified a list of fourteen faculty members who would serve as key personnel,which the nih defined as individuals who contribute to the scientific development or execution of the project in a substantive way.nih grant application instructions at,june.the application described in detail some of these research projects.it also asserted,our faculty has a solid track record in quality and productive research in issues,including research in research sic.grant application at.and the application identified additional institutions which would serve as clinical resources,including cornell university,memorial sloan kettering cancer center,vincent hospital,and gay men health crisis center.
in describing the fellowship program commitment to research training,the grant application explained that the majority of the fellows clinical work will be with persons with hiv infection.grant application at.fellows would devote an average of of their time to research and an average of of their time to clinical work with persons with and other neuropsychiatric disorders.id.
the irg gave cornell grant application a high priority score,and the nih subsequently approved funding for two fellows for the fiscal year beginning september,with the possibility of additional funding for up to four additional years.cornell submitted renewal applications in each of the following four years,from fiscal year july,through june,to fiscal year july,through june,all of which the nih approved.in the accompanying annual progress reports,cornell and van gorp indicated that there had been no material alterations to the program as described in the original grant application.
in the renewal application for the second renewal year the third year overall,for example,cornell and van gorp wrote that a ll core and supporting faculty listed in our original application are continuing there have been no alterations in the courses or training program from that listed in the original application,except for the addition of two specified courses progress report at,january.the renewal application also explained that the program had been relocated from cornell white plains campus to its new york city manhattan campus in order to provide fellows with immediate access to subjects and patients who have.id.the renewal applications for the fourth and fifth year stated that t he core structure of our training program has remained the same as in years past and to that described in our initial application.progress report at,january,progress report at,january.the nih approved each of these renewal applications.
in september,at about the time the first began,daniel feldman,the plaintiff was selected by cornell to participate in the fellowship program.he left the program in december,before the completion of his fellowship.other fellows who participated in the program included elizabeth ryan,clifford smith,kimberly walton louis,and evan drake.at trial,feldman presented evidence that the actual fellowship deviated in many ways from that described in the grant application,and that cornell and van gorp failed to inform nih of these deviations.
testimony presented at trial indicated that some of the faculty members identified as key personnel in the initial application did not in fact contribute in any substantive way to the fellowship program.van gorp acknowledged that the contributions to the program of two of these faculty members,tatsuyki kakuma and michael giordano,were considerably limited,if not entirely eliminated,by the fact that the two doctors were not in physical proximity to the fellows during the grant period.many fellows,according to their testimony,had little or no interaction with the remaining key personnel,and were unaware that these faculty members were or were supposed to be available as resources.in addition,according to this testimony,fellows were largely unaware of research opportunities at medical centers other than cornell.
there was also testimony in the district court to the effect that cornell and van gorp failed to notify nih that the curriculum outlined in the initial grant application was never implemented.several core courses identified in the application were not regularly conducted for fellows,and fellows were not informed that these courses were a required component of the program.moreover,according to this testimony,fellows were never evaluated or supervised by the training committee referred to in the grant application.
feldman also presented evidence that the research and clinical training described in the initial grant application differed significantly from the actual training received.nih rules provide that fellows in a program must devote their time to the proposed research training and must confine clinical duties to those that are an integral part of the research training experience.nih guide at,training grant announcement at,june.and,in accordance with these requirements,the grant application stated that the majority of the fellows clinical work will be with persons with hiv infection.grant application at.further,in explaining the training program relocation from white plains to manhattan,the renewal application explained that f ellows would be housed within a large,setting with immediate access to subjects and patients who have.progress report at.
but,as the plaintiff summarizes the trial testimony,out of the clinical cases that the fellows saw during their fellowship,only three involved patients pl.br.at.several fellows testified that much of the research that they performed under the grant program had no relation to hiv or aids at all.for example,clifford smith testified that the research projects he worked on under the grant were primarily related to epilepsy and aging,and did not involve an hiv population.out of the eight research projects that evan drake worked on during his fellowship,he said,only one focused specifically on hiv.feldman similarly told the court that he worked on only one project during his time as a fellow.
in july,after he had left the program,feldman submitted a letter to the nih complaining about the program focus on clinical work rather than research,and the fellows limited access to patients.in march,he submitted another letter to the nih,again complaining that the fellowship program deviated from its description in the initial grant application.in response,the nih asked cornell to conduct an investigation of the complaint,which cornell completed in june.cornell then sent feldman a letter informing him that the investigation uncovered no wrongdoing.
on october,feldman filed a qui tam complaint pursuant to the false claims act fca,et alleging that cornell and van gorp made false claims to the united states in the grant application and in the four renewal applications.feldman alleged that statements made in these applications were false because the fellowship curriculum,resources,faculty members,and training differed significantly from that described in the application,and in the subsequent renewal applications representing that no changes had been made to the program.the complaint was unsealed in april,after the united states declined to intervene in this action.see cook county united states ex rel.chandler,d the relator must inform the department of justice of her intentions and keep the pleadings under seal for days while the government decides whether to intervene and do its own litigating.citing b c.
on january,after discovery had been completed,cornell and van gorp moved for summary judgment.on december,the district court denied the motion,concluding that there were genuine issues of material fact as to whether the defendants made false statements in both the initial grant application and the renewal applications,and whether those statements were material to the funding decisions.united states ex rel.feldman van gorp feldman i,d.the district court also concluded that the plaintiff need not establish actual damages to the government as an element of an fca claim because that statute provision of civil penalties for false and fraudulent claims allowed courts to find a violation even in the absence of proof of damages to the united states.id.at.the court did not address,however,whether feldman recovery would be limited to statutory damages.
on december,the defendants moved for reconsideration of the summary judgment decision,arguing that the district court had erred in failing to address the issue of whether feldman should be limited to statutory penalties because he had not presented sufficient evidence of actual damages to the united states.on may,the district court denied the motion,explaining that although the damages to the united states could not be calculated in the same way they would be in a standard action because no tangible benefit had been received,the plaintiff would not be limited to statutory damages.united states ex rel.feldman van gorp feldman ii,civ,wl,at,dist.lexis,at may.the court said that the benefit of the bargain to the government is providing funds to recipients who best fit its specified criteria and that this benefit is lost when funds are diverted to less eligible recipients.id.at,dist.lexis,at.therefore,if the concludes that the government would not have awarded the grant absent the false claims,it may properly conclude that the measure of damages is the total amount the government paid,dist.lexis,at.
before trial,feldman submitted a motion in limine to exclude evidence including that of nih inaction towards cornell and van gorp in response to feldman complaints about the fellowship program.on july,the district court granted feldman motion to exclude that evidence.the court concluded that the evidence of nih inaction was irrelevant and therefore inadmissible under rule because no discovery was conducted concerning the standards nih used to determine the existence of misconduct and whether those standards are at all similar to the elements of an fca claim.united states ex rel.feldman van gorp feldman iii,civ,wl,at,dist.lexis,at july.moreover,the court concluded,even if marginally relevant,the evidence would have been excluded pursuant to rule because of the possibility that it would confuse or mislead the jury id.
the case was tried to a jury for eight days in july,resulting in a partial verdict for feldman.the jury found the defendants not liable for false statements in the grant application and the first renewal application,but found liability based on the renewal applications for the third,fourth and fifth years of the grant,the second,third and fourth renewal years.on august,the district court awarded actual damages in treble the amount nih paid for the last three renewal years of the grant the trebling being provided for in the fca,a totaling.the judgment also included statutory penalties of,for a total of.the district court also awarded to the plaintiff in attorney fees,in costs,and in expenses.
on august,the defendants filed a motion for judgment as a matter of law under rule b,or in the alternative,for a new trial pursuant to rule.the defendants argued that there was insufficient evidence from which the jury could properly have concluded that the false statements at issue were material to the nih decisions to renew the grant,and that the court should grant judgment as a matter of law,or that such a conclusion was against the weight of the evidence and warranted a new trial.the defendants also argued that the district court erred in determining as a matter of law that damages were equal to the entire grant amounts for the years in which liability was found rather than submitting that question to the jury.
the district court denied this motion on december.united states ex rel.feldman van gorp feldman iv,civ,wl,at,dist.lexis,at.the court concluded that feldman had presented sufficient evidence for the jury to conclude that the false statements were material to the nih funding decisions,noting that nih guidelines and instructions on the renewal applications unambiguously stated that it should be notified of any changes made to the grant program.id.at,dist.lexis,at.the district court also relied on its opinion in feldman iii to deny the motion for a jury trial on damages.id.at,dist.lexis,at.

discussion 
the defendants contend that the district court erred in its methodology for determining damages and in determining the amount of those damages,as a matter of law the jury did not have sufficient evidence from which to conclude that the false statements at issue were material to the funding decision and the district court erred in excluding evidence of nih inaction in response to feldman complaint.
the false claims act prohibits a person from knowingly present ing,or caus ing to be presented,to an officer or employee of the united states government,a false or fraudulent claim for payment or approval.a a.liability under the act also requires a showing of materiality under the act as currently in force,the term material means having a natural tendency to influence,or be capable of influencing,the payment or receipt of money or property.id.b see also neder united states,d in general,a false statement is material if it has a natural tendency to influence,or is capable of influencing,the decision of the decisionmaking body to which it was addressed.brackets in original internal quotation marks omitted criminal fraud case.
the fca provides for damages equal to times the amount of damages which the government sustains because of the act of that person,in addition to a civil penalty.a.the act does not specify how damages are to be calculated,but the supreme court has recognized that the purpose of damages,even as multiplied,under the act is to make the government completely whole for money taken from it by fraud.united states ex.rel.marcus hess,superseded by statute as recognized by united states ex rel.kirk schindler elevator,cir we think the chief purpose of the statutes here predecessors of the current false claims act,providing for double rather than treble damages was to provide for restitution to the government of money taken from it by fraud,and that the device of double damages plus a specific sum was chosen to make sure that the government would be made completely whole.because the district court here determined that damages could be established as a matter of law,we review that conclusion de novo.see bessemer trust,branin,cir stating that where the district court has determined damages,we review its application of legal principles de novo and its factual findings for clear error.
the question of how damages should be measured in an fca case where contracts entered into between the government and the defendants did not produce a tangible benefit to the government,united states ex.rel.longhi united states,cir,is one of first impression in this court.the defendants argue both that the district court erred in concluding that application of the standard calculation as a methodology for determining damages was inappropriate in this case,and that it erred in deciding the amount of damages as a matter of law based on the jury verdict,rather than allowing the jury to assess the amount of damages due.
proper measure of damages 
in most fca cases,damages are measured as they would be in a case using a calculation in which a determination is made of the difference between the value that the government received and the amount that it paid.see united states foster wheeler,cir collecting cases terwilliger terwilliger,cir s o far as possible,new york contract law attempts to secure to the injured party the benefit of his bargain,subject to the limitations that the injury whether it be losses suffered or gains prevented was foreseeable,and that the amount of damages claimed be measurable with a reasonable degree of certainty and,of course,adequately proven.internal quotation marks omitted.this method of calculation is employed,for example,when the government has paid for goods or services that return a tangible benefit to the government.
there are generally two ways of determining damages in such cases.first,if the goods or services have an ascertainable market value,then damages are measured according to the difference between the market value of the product the government received and retained and the market value that the product would have had if it had been of the specified quality.united states science application int l,quoting united states bornstein,d alterations omitted.if the goods or services market value is not ascertainable,then the determines the amount of damages by calculating the difference between the amount the government actually paid minus the value of the goods or services the government received or used,as judged by the.id.
the defendants contend that a calculation was appropriate in this case,and that the district court erred by awarding the government the full amount of the grant for the years for which the violations were found rather than the difference between the value of the training promised and that actually delivered.the plaintiff argues,to the contrary,that a different measure of damages is appropriate in cases such as this,where the defendant fraudulently sought payments for participating in programs designed to benefit rather than the government itself and the government received nothing of tangible value from the defendant.see also longhi,at w here there is no tangible benefit to the government and the intangible benefit is impossible to calculate,it is appropriate to value damages in the amount the government actually paid to the defendants.this approach rests on the notion that the government receives nothing of measurable value when the to whom the benefits of a governmental grant flow uses the grant for activities other than those for which funding was approved.in other words,when a successfully uses a false claim regarding how a grant will be used in order to obtain the grant,the government has entirely lost its opportunity to award the grant money to a recipient who would have used the money as the government intended.
the plaintiff and the united states,as amicus curiae,argue that this is such a case the government received no tangible benefit from the and others may have,but not the government.the grant represented an attempt to,but did not thereby,promote child and adult clinical and research neuropsychology with a strong emphasis upon research training with.grant application at.the plaintiff argues that the government is therefore entitled to damages equal to the full amount of grants awarded to the defendants based on their false statements.
we conclude that the measure of damages advocated by the plaintiff and the united states is correct.
although we have not addressed this question,several of our sister circuits have done so in decisions that support the conclusion we now reach.see science application,at.longhi,at cir.united states rogan,cir the government offers a subsidy with conditions.when the conditions are not satisfied,nothing is due.united states mackby,cir had mackby been truthful,the government would have known that he was entitled to nothing 
the defendants point out,however,that other courts have applied the calculation in cases they assert are similar to this one.they argue that because t he ultimate beneficiary of all government grants or contracts is the public regardless of who receives the direct benefit,the flow of benefits to a should not be determinative of the damages measure.defs.reply br.at.
in support of this theory,the defendants cite united states hibbs,cir.there,the third circuit applied a calculation in an fca case involving the defendants fraudulent statements to the federal housing administration regarding the condition of various residential properties.relying on these representations,the agency insured mortgages on several properties,and the agency was required to pay these mortgages when the purchasers defaulted.id.at.
the government argued that its damages were the total amount of the mortgage debt it had assumed,insisting that had the defendant not furnished the false certification,it would not have insured the mortgage s and therefore would not have been called upon to make any payment.id.at.
the third circuit rejected this argument.
the government actual damage was the decrease in worth of the security that was certified as being available,measured by the difference in value between the houses as falsely represented,and as they actually were.since the government was given security which was less than what it was represented to be,the damages are essentially similar to those sustained when a defective article is purchased in a fraudulent transaction.in those instances,decisional law sets the damages as the difference in cost between that contracted for and that received.
similarly,in coleman hernandez,d,a case involving the housing choice voucher program or section,under which the government provides housing subsidies to qualifying individuals,the district court declined to award the plaintiff the full amount that the government paid to subsidize her rent,even though her landlord had allegedly made false statements to the government by overcharging the plaintiff for rent.id.at.the coleman court acknowledged that in other fca cases,courts had awarded damages equal to the full amount of the government payment.id.at.but the court decided that in the case before it,the awardable damages were equal to the difference between the market rent,and the amount that the landlord charged the government including the additional,improper payments it had received,the amount of the overcharge.id.at.the government was then made whole,receiving the full benefit of its bargain trebled by statute.
the defendants also look to medicaid and medicare fca cases for support.they contend that adopting the plaintiff theory of damages,all such cases would result in damages equal to the full amount the government paid in reimbursements to physicians because the direct benefit always goes to patients.defs.reply br.at.
this is not,however,the methodology generally employed by courts evaluating fca claims based on medicaid or medicare fraud.in united states ex.rel.tyson amerigroup illinois,d,the court awarded damages based on the difference between the amount of medicare payments that the defendant should have received,and the amount that it had actually charged the government.id.at.similarly,in united states ex.rel.doe degregorio,d,the court also held that damages were the the amount of money the government paid out by reason of the false claims over and above what it would have paid out if the claims had not been false.id.at.
in short,in each of the cases cited by the defendants,the government paid for a contracted service with a tangible benefit whether it be medical care,security on mortgages,or subsidized housing but paid too much.the government in these cases got what it bargained for,but it did not get all that it bargained for.thus,courts treated the difference between what the government bargained for and what it actually received as the measure of damages.here,by contrast,the government bargained for something qualitatively,but not quantifiably,different from what it received.
this approach comports with the one we discussed in making a sentencing calculation of loss in united states canova,rejecting argument that abbreviated medical tests performed by the defendant were as clinically sound as full tests required by medicare so that the government sustained no loss.there,we explained that it was not a court task to a victim judgment as to the necessity of specifications demanded and paid for.see id.whether the testing time on a pacemaker,the number of rivets on an airplane wing,or the coats of paint on a refurbished building is a matter of necessity or whim,the fact remains that the victim has been induced to pay for something that it wanted and was promised but did not get,thereby incurring some measure of pecuniary loss.to be sure,canova recognized that a victim loss in a substitute goods or services case does not necessarily equal the full contract price paid.id.at.but this was not because a defendant had the right to an offset for the value of the substituted good or service.rather,the proper focus of any loss calculation was on the reasonably foreseeable costs of making substitute transactions and handling or disposing of the product delivered or retrofitting the product so that it can be used for its intended purpose,plus the reasonably foreseeable cost of rectifying the actual or potential disruption to the victim operations caused by the product substitution.id.quoting,cmt c.canova emphasized that a court calculating loss can not simply rewrit e the parties contract to excise specifications paid for but not received and,thereby,conclud e that the victim sustained no or a reduced loss.id.
canova reasoning supports the challenged loss calculation.as a result of the fraudulent renewals,the government was paying for a program that was not at all as specified.by contrast to the medicare cases cited by defendants,the government did not receive less than it bargained for it did not get the neuropsychology with a strong emphasis upon research training with program it bargained for at all.further,nothing in the record indicates that it could now secure such a program at any lesser cost.we therefore conclude that the appropriate measure of damages in this case is the full amount the government paid based on materially false statements.
fraudulent inducement 
the defendants acknowledge that courts have applied the plaintiff theory of damages in cases including mackby,rogan,and longhi,but argue that those cases are distinguishable from this one because the defendants in each of those cases obtained funds through fraudulent that any such theory would fail here because no liability was found with respect to the grant application.in a fraudulent inducement case,it is the false statements that allow the defendant to obtain the funding in the first place.defs.reply br.at.
according to the defendants,because a defendant in a fraudulent inducement case would not be eligible for any funding received after the initial false claim,a court in such a case could properly conclude that the defendant is liable for the entire amount that the government paid.but h ere,the jury expressly found that the initial application contained no false statements,and there was no false certification ever at issue.id.the defendants argue that mackby,rogan,and longhi therefore do not support the damages theory employed by the district court.
we see no principled distinction,however,between fraudulently inducing payment initially,thereby requiring all payments produced from that initial fraud to be returned to the government trebled and with certain fees and costs added as provided by statute,and requiring payments based on false statements to be returned to the government when those false statements were made after an initial contractual relationship based on truthful statements had been established.although it may be true that under a fraudulent inducement theory,subsequent claims for payment made under the contract that were not literally false,because they derived from the original fraudulent misrepresentation,are also actionable false claims,longhi,at second brackets in original internal quotation marks omitted,this proposition simply speaks to the time period for which fca liability may be found.it does not suggest that without fraudulent inducement,no subsequent false statements can result in fca liability.
if the government made payment based on a false statement,then that is enough for liability in an fca case,regardless of whether that false statement comes at the beginning of a contractual relationship or later.the only difference would be that liability begins when the false statement is made and relied upon,rather than at the beginning of the contractual relationship,as it would be in a fraudulent inducement case.here,the jury found that materially false statements had been made by the defendants in years,and of the grant,and the court properly awarded damages based on that finding.
damages as a matter of law 
the defendants argue that the calculation of damages should have been decided as a question of fact by a jury,not as a matter of law by the district court.indeed,in fca cases,the jury ordinarily does determine the amount of damages to be imposed upon the defendant.see chandler,at.we conclude,however,that here,where the question is not the benefit of the bargain between the plaintiff and the defendants,and the amount of each payment for which liability has been assessed is not in dispute,no further finding of fact as to the amount of the damages was necessary.
as the government correctly observes in its amicus brief,awarding damages in this manner is not novel.and often,the amount of damages in such cases has been determined as a matter of law in the course of the court grant of summary judgment to the plaintiff.see,longhi,at affirming summary judgment and damages award united states tdc mgmt,agreeing that the district court could properly decide the damages award where the government received no benefit from the transaction.
united states ex rel.antidiscrimination center of metro new york,westchester county,civ,wl,dist.lexis,is illustrative.there the federal government paid approximately million as part of a federal grant to westchester county for the purposes of housing and community development.id.at,dist.lexis,at.the grant required the county to certify that it would conduct an analysis of impediments to fair housing choice,including those impediments imposed by racial discrimination and segregation,to take appropriate actions to overcome the effects of any identified impediments,and to maintain records reflecting the analysis and actions.id.at,dist.lexis,at.the court granted summary judgment for the plaintiff after finding that westchester county had not conducted the analysis as promised.the court agreed with the plaintiff contention that damages should be the full amount the government paid,and rejected the county argument that the damages question should be submitted to the jury.there,as here,the united states did not get what it paid for,and there was no role for the jury because westchester damages can not be reduced by reference to the alleged benefit it provided to hud.id.at,dist.lexis,at.
we conclude that in the case before us,inasmuch as the damages equal the full amount that the government paid and that amount is not in dispute,they were properly determined by the district court as a matter of law.
sufficiency of the evidence 
finally,the defendants contend that the plaintiff did not submit sufficient evidence to the jury to establish by a preponderance of the evidence that the government suffered damages equal to the full amount of the grant.the defendants argue that to prove that the amount of damages was the entire amount of the grant,a relator would be required to prove that the government received no value at all through the grant work it funded.defs.br.at.
the defendants support this contention by citing cases.the defendants argument is therefore unavailing.unlike a case,no specific amount of damages must be proved because,as we have explained at length,damages in this case equal the entire amount of the grant that was lost as a result of the fraud.
ii.materiality 
the defendants assert that the false statements to the government that are at issue were not material to the transactions in question.the district court therefore erred,they say,in denying the defendants motion for judgment as a matter of law and for a new trial 
we conclude that the jury had sufficient evidence from which to conclude,as it did,that the defendants false statements materially influenced nih decisions to renew the grant.
a motion for a new trial will ordinarily be granted so long as the district court determines that,in its independent judgment,the jury has reached a seriously erroneous result or its verdict is a miscarriage of justice.nimely city of new york,cir internal quotation marks omitted.we review the district court denial of a motion for a new trial for abuse of discretion.id.
a motion for judgment as a matter of law may be granted only i f a party has been fully heard on an issue during a jury trial and the court finds that a reasonable jury would not have a legally sufficient evidentiary basis to find for the party on that issue.a.a court evaluating such a motion can not assess the weight of conflicting evidence,pass on the credibility of witnesses,or substitute its judgment for that of the jury.black finantra capital,cir internal quotation marks omitted.because such a judgment is made as a matter of law,we review it de novo.we must consider the evidence in the light most favorable to the party against whom the motion was made and give
