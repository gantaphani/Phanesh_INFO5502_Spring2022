ii.background 
in,john allan meing opened a men grooming salon near wall street in new york city.the salon,john allan,was designed to provide salon services for men in a environment.since that time,the company has grown.at the time of the bench trial,the john allan company operated two club locations and two smaller in new york city.the salons are furnished with leather chairs at styling stations as well as antique barber chairs where patrons sit while receiving a hot towel treatment and shoe shine.the salons are equipped with a pool table,bar,and,until recently,a cigar room.patrons wear black smoking jackets while at john allan,and the employees wear black smocks,decorated with the salon logo.in addition to its salons,the john allan company markets its grooming products nationwide.in,it registered the mark john allan ja circle design for men and women haircutting services,namely haircutting,manicures,facials,and massage services retail counter in the field of hair and skin products the circle design 
the craig allen company opened a men salon,craig allen,in wichita,kansas after its owners visited john allan in new york.the owners of the craig allen company,craig allen tatro and erik leschuk settled on the name craig allen after learning about john allan.the duo hired a designer to create a logo for craig allen and provided the designer with materials created by the john allan company.although the designer expressed concerns about copying another mark,tatro and leschuk suggested they were working with john allan,and thus had permission to use a similar design.the result was a logo,nearly identical to the trademarked circle design 
further,craig allen shared many of the features of john allan clubs,including outside windows with frosted glass embossed with the craig allen circle design logo circle design and the phrase a return to a simpler time,which also appeared on the frosted windows of john allan clubs.craig allen also provided black smoking jackets for its patrons to wear and was furnished with leather chairs,antique barber chairs for hot towel treatments,a bar,and a pool table.
in,attorneys representing the john allan company contacted the craig allen company concerning the alleged trademark infringement.tatro and leschuk ultimately removed the circle design from everything in craig allen as well as the protected slogans from the windows.they also created a new logo 
the interior design and furnishings,however,were not changed.nor did craig allen change its name.
the john allan company sought injunctive relief for,inter alia,the defendant use of the name craig allen,including the name the craig allen company,llc and the original circle design.the district court concluded the circle design infringed on the john allan company circle design.it declined,however,to enjoin craig allen use of the circle design,finding it was unnecessary as the defendants had expended more than to change to its new logo.unlike the logo,the court concluded the use of the name craig allen did not infringe on the unregistered mark john allan.
on appeal,the john allan company argues the district court erred in finding the craig allen mark does not infringe on the john allan mark and failing to apply the safe distance rule to enjoin the use of the craig allen mark based on the conclusion that the craig allen circle design infringed john allan circle design.
iii.alleged infringement of john allan mark 
the lanham act prohibits,in connection with any good or service,the unauthorized use or misleading representation of any word,term,name,symbol,or device in a way that is likely to cause confusion,or to cause mistake,or to deceive.a a confusion occurs when consumers make an incorrect mental association between the involved commercial products or their producers.jordache enter.hogg wyld,cir quotation omitted.further,confusion results when a mark is likely to deceive purchasers or users as to the source,endorsement,affiliation,or sponsorship of a product.a a see also amoco oil rainbow snow,cir.whether the use of a mark will result in a likelihood of confusion,and thus violate the lanham act,is a question of fact we review for clear error.heartsprings,heartspring,cir.in an appeal from a bench trial,we review the district court legal conclusions de novo.keys youth,city of olathe,cir.
to determine whether a likelihood of confusion exists,this court examines six,factors 
the degree of similarity between the marks the intent of the alleged infringer in adopting the mark evidence of actual confusion similarity of products and manner of marketing the degree of care likely to be exercised by purchasers and the strength or weakness of the marks.

the john allan company argues the district court committed clear error in light of evidence that actual confusion existed and of craig allen intent to copy its marks.specifically,it contends the district court committed clear error by failing to apply a rebuttable presumption based on evidence that the defendants intended to confuse customers and refusing to find a likelihood of confusion based on evidence that consumers were confused.although the district court need not apply a rebuttable presumption based on a finding of intent to copy,it did err by failing to consider evidence that consumers were confused by the two names of the salons.the district court opinion also contains internal inconsistencies complicating several of its findings and requiring a remand.
a.the district court internally inconsistent findings 
in its assessment of the six factors,the district court found three factors weighed in the favor of the john allan company the similarity of the marks,albeit only slightly weighing in the plaintiff favor the intent to copy and the strength of the mark.it found two factors were neutral,weighing in favor of neither the plaintiff nor the defendants the similarity of products and manner of marketing and the degree of care exercised by consumers.finally,it found the john allan company had not presented any evidence of actual confusion,and that weighed in favor of the defendants,the craig allen company.it then concluded,however 
after reviewing all of the applicable factors,the court finds that a likelihood of confusion does not exist between the mark john allan and craig allen.while there is some similarity and john allan does have a protectable mark,the other factors are neutral or weigh in favor of the defendants.the court is reluctant to find that the use of tatro middle name,and a common one at that,violates the plaintiff mark without a stronger showing by plaintiff.see sardi rest.sardie,cir brennan,brennan,cir.
this conclusion is inconsistent with the court previous findings that three factors weighed in favor of the john allan company,while only one factor,the absence of actual confusion,weighed in favor of the craig allen company.
initially,the court found that the defendants purposefully used the mark craig allen to take advantage of plaintiff goodwill and therefore concluded that the craig allen company intended to copy the mark john allan.it stated,t he fact that craig allen was named after one of the partners,craig allen tatro,seems too coincidental given defendants purposeful copying of plaintiff registered marks and other features of plaintiff salons.the district court then proceeded to ignore this finding in resolving that tatro use of his own name,without more,was insufficient to establish a trademark violation.evidence tha
