adam wiercinski,a polish man of jewish descent,immigrated to the united states in with the assistance of rav tov international jewish rescue organization rav tov,a community organization helping jews resettle in israel and the united states.starting in approximately and continuing until december,wiercinski worked as a deliveryman for mangia,a food catering company with several locations in manhattan all mangia locations are owned by sasha muniak.malgorzata cymanow,muniak sister,served as the general manager of all mangia locations throughout the period of wiercinski employment.
there were only two notable breaks in wiercinski employment by mangia during this year period.wiercinski left the mangia location in approximately and worked as a security officer until he returned to work at the mangia location in.in,wiercinski was fired by his manager at the mangia location,allegedly because of that manager.shortly thereafter wiercinski asked his friend and rav tov sponsor,zindel zelmanovitch,to help him get his job back.zelmanovitch approached muniak and cymanow and convinced them to rehire wiercinski.they did so and wiercinski then worked at mangia wall street branch.
in,wiercinski asked zelmanovitch to help him transfer from the wall street location to the mangia location because it was the busiest location in the midtown and wiercinski believed he would be able to earn some decent money at that branch.ja.wiercinski worked at mangia until he took an extended leave of absence to visit family in poland in late.when he returned in early,he asked to be rehired at mangia and was rejected.
in october,wiercinski sued mangia and six individual defendants together,mangia,alleging discrimination on the basis of religion and national origin,retaliation,conspiracy,wrongful termination,and violation of various new york state and city laws.wiercinski alleged that a night shift manager,artur zbozien,verbally harassed and abused him with slurs such as stinking jew,dirty jew,jewish pederast,and kike throughout wiercinski eight year period of employment at mangia.in october,following several years of motion practice,the parties proceeded to trial on wiercinksi sole remaining claim hostile work environment under section.
the evidence presented by both sides was almost entirely testimonial.wiercinski recounted multiple instances of zbozien harassing conduct.for example,wiercinski testified that on the first day of work,he accidentally bumped into zbozien while carrying boxes,to which zbozien responded,did anybody ever fuck you up,you stupid fucking jew.ja.wiercinski also said that,on several occasions,zbozien paid out wiercinski tips in pennies and threw them on the floor.ja.wiercinski recalled that zbozien sometimes passed gas in front of him,laughed,and said,here is your zyklon b that was used to gas jews in the concentration camps.ja.according to wiercinski,zbozien used slurs at least a dozen times over the eight years during which wiercinski worked at mangia.ja.
wiercinski also introduced testimony from three former coworkers,who testified in detail about the specific instances described above and explained that wiercinski commonly complained to them and others about the slurs he was subject to.see,ja.nevertheless,wiercinski admitted that he never looked for another job during the eight years of harassment from zbozien,and in fact,asked to be transferred to zbozien night shift,a request that mangia granted.
wiercinski testified that he complained to cymanow about the harassment on several occasions,but then she always discouraged him from com ing back.ja.according to wiercinski,he spoke with cymanow at least ten times about zbozien and other individuals calling him dirty names about his jewish religion.ja.the only result of these conversations,according to wiercinski,was cymanow decision to transfer zbozien to mangia wall street.zbozien returned to mangia approximately three weeks later.shortly after zbozien returned,wiercinski was transferred to a different shift,again apparently upon his own request.see ja affidavit of artur zbozien wiercinski was transferred to work on the day shift,while i continued to work the night shift.since then,i have had very limited contact with him.ja testimony of wiercinski at th e time that zbozien returned i think i was off the night shift i quit the night shift and became a delivery person.according to wiercinski,cymanow was herself known for being,although his only specific allegation of such behavior was her occasional use of a polish term for jews that wiercinski characterized as not very derogatory.ja.other than these alleged complaints to cymanow,wiercinski testified that he commonly complained to his coworkers and brought the issue to muniak attention in.wiercinski stated that as a result of zbozien harassment,he suffered from depression,anxiety,and sleep issues,although he did not present any medical evidence as to these problems.
on,mangia undertook to impeach wiercinski credibility but was thwarted as a result of his repeated invocation of the fifth amendment privilege against.specifically,wiercinski invoked the fifth amendment privilege when about his use of a different name for payroll purposes while at mangia,his failure to report income earned at mangia on tax returns,his application for and receipt of social security and other public assistance benefits without reporting income earned at mangia,and his failure to report income earned at cucina,a catering company where wiercinski worked after his termination in see ja.although mangia was,at times,able to impeach wiercinski using prior deposition testimony,see,ja wiercinski deposition testimony admitting that he used a different name to receive income earned at mangia in order to conceal it from government authorities,its ability to present a defense was significantly hampered by wiercinski obstructive behavior during.in total,wiercinski invoked the fifth amendment at least twenty four times over the course of a brief,including in response to questions as basic as whether or not he recalled giving prior deposition testimony.see ja.
mangia also attacked the credibility of wiercinski witnesses by impeaching their trial testimony with prior inconsistent deposition testimony.see,ja deposition testimony of marian krajewski stating that he could not remember instances of slurs directed at wiercinski ja,deposition testimony of marcin swiderski and jaroslaw ubowski stating that wiercinski never complained to them about.at the conclusion of plaintiff case,mangia moved for a directed verdict on the ground that wiercinski testimony was not credible,citing to the inconsistencies in his testimony and his pervasive invocation of the fifth amendment.the district court denied the motion because it was based on questions of credibility,which are in the domain of the jury.ja.
mangia introduced five witnesses in its.robert ranfranz,a former of wiercinski and mangia current director of operations,testified that he received a phone call from wiercinski in august,shortly before wiercinski left the company and that he offered him a bribe.specifically wiercinski told ranfranz that he is not happy with the way that things are going at mangia or zbozien,and he said he is thinking about opening a case,suing the company,and he asked ranfranz if he will testify for him.wiercinski said that he will offer ranfranz one thousand or as an exchange,and that if he wins the lawsuit they can speak about additional money after the case.ja.
zelmanovitch also testified about his extensive relationship with wiercinski,and recalled that even though wiercinski frequently spoke to him about work and compensation issues,he never mentioned that he was subject to harassment at work.zbozien testified and denied using slurs against wiercinski.zbozien admitted that cymanow transferred him to mangia wall street for a brief period because of wiercinski complaints,but could not remember whether he knew at the time that those complaints alleged remarks.cymanow denied ever being told by wiercinski of alleged remarks,and claimed that she fired wiercinski in because of job performance issues and because he requested too much vacation time.finally,another former deliveryman testified that he never heard zbozien make remarks,and that wiercinski never complained to him about in the office,even though they were both jewish and discussed jewish holidays and other topics.
the jury found mangia liable under section,concluding on a special verdict form that wiercinski was subjected to a hostile work environment based on conduct perpetrated by his supervisor s but not perpetrated by his coworker s.the jury awarded wiercinski nominal damages in the amount of and punitive damages in the amount of.the verdict form did not require the jury to name which supervisor,or supervisors,subjected wiercinski to a hostile work environment following the verdict,wiercinski applied for an award of attorneys fees and costs,and mangia moved,pursuant to rules and,for remittitur of the punitive damages award,or in the alternative,a new trial on the issue of punitive damages.
although mangia moved only for relief as to the punitive damages award,the district court vacated the jury liability verdict,conditionally granted mangia motion for a new trial on the issue of punitive damages,and denied wiercinski application for fees and costs.wiercinski mangia,d e.in reaching this decision,the district court concluded,
h aving seen and heard the witnesses and having a firm hold on and not merely a feel,for every jot and title of this case,i am driven to the determination that a judgment entered for the defendant pursuant to rule b notwithstanding the verdict,is the only determination that reasonable and persons could arrive at and to do less would be to endorse a gross miscarriage of justice.
id.at.the district court found that wiercinski repeated invocation of the fifth amendment severely impacted his credibility and limited mangia opportunity to mount a defense.the district court was,no doubt,also deeply troubled by essentially unrebutted testimony that wiercinski had offered to purchase the testimony of a witness.further,the district court found the plaintiff witnesses to be incredible,finding that t heirs was the glib testimony of school witnesses reciting a lesson,a parody of wiercinski.the glaring inconsistencies between their testimony at trial and at depositions years earlier are vital to note for their relevance in arriving at a reasoned and comprehensive disposition id.at internal quotation marks omitted.the district court also concluded there was no evidence in the record to support a conclusion that zbozien was a supervisor as that term has been defined by the supreme court.see id.at.
by contrast,the district court found the testimony of mangia witnesses to be more credible.specifically,the district court noted that cymanow had been family friends with wiercinski for years,and testified that she never directed or heard anyone direct any remarks at wiercinski at work.the district court also noted that zelmanovitch testified that he knew wiercinski for years,and that wiercinski had never told him that he was facing this kind of harassment at work,even though wiercinski had come to him with many other problems over the years.see id.at.finally,the district court cited evidence that wiercinski stayed at the job for years,despite the allegedly hostile environment and in fact,asked to be assigned to the night shift where zbozien is the dispatcher,as undermining wiercinski testimony and supporting mangia witnesses.see id.at.wiercinski filed a timely appeal from this decision.
