this case illustrates the adage which counsels against going into business with someone who has less money than you.
the procter gamble company hired the daniel joint venture the joint venture as a general contractor to build a complex in cape girardeau,missouri.in april,the joint venture hired gere obg to design and build six buildings in the complex for the lump sum of million.in april,after the project had undergone many changes and delays and the joint venture had paid obg million,the joint venture terminated obg before it completed the work it had been hired to perform.obg then brought this diversity action and submitted the case on a quantum meruit theory,seeking to recover the reasonable value of its services,which exceeded the contract price.the joint venture counterclaimed alleging obg had breached the contract.
the district court ruled the parties abandoned the contract,awarded obg million in damages and dismissed the counterclaim.on appeal,the joint venture contends the court erred in finding the parties abandoned the contract and in calculating the reasonable value of obg services.we affirm.
contract formation and early departures from the subcontract 
on february,the joint venture sent obg a request for proposal rfp inviting it to bid on the design and construction of the six buildings.the rfp had two important requirements.first,buildings and,which were to hold the paper production equipment,had to be completed by january,the date procter gamble expected to start operating the plants second,the rfp required bidders proposals to conform to certain seismic requirements.
on april,obg submitted a proposal to do the work for million.because of the joint venture compressed timetable,obg proposed holding a kickoff meeting within a week of the project award to determine the weight and location of building,so obg could then begin the design process.
obg proposal also contained a section entitled commercial and technical clarifications and exemptions.one commercial clarification was obg request the joint venture eliminate the pay when paid provision,under which the joint venture would become obligated to pay its subcontractors only after it was paid by procter gamble.because of obg limited,obg required payment within thirty days of invoicing in order to support its continued work on the project.
on april,the parties met to discuss the project and obg clarifications.two days later,obg submitted its best and final offer bafo,which stated new technical clarifications.as a result of the technical clarifications discussed on april,the bid price rose to million,which obg then agreed to discount to million,the final contract price.
the next day,april,the joint venture sent obg a notice to proceed,which stated the scope of the work would be according to the documents recently exchanged and discussed,and the official subcontract would be issued within fourteen working days and was effective as of the date of the notice.obg understood the recently exchanged documents to include the joint venture rfp,obg own original proposal,and obg bafo.james fox,obg project manager,executed the notice and entered into contracts with contractors.
on april,the joint venture forwarded obg eleven new drawings for buildings and.on may,while the joint venture had yet to send the official subcontract,the joint venture dropped building from obg scope of work.between this date and the date they executed the subcontract,july,obg bid for a new building.though obg started work on building on july,it could not submit invoices until september,when the joint venture executed the million subcontract modification adding the building to the scope of the work.
on july,the joint venture sent the official subcontract to obg.although the parties had already changed significant aspects of the agreement by dropping building and adding,the subcontract substantially restated the joint venture request for proposals.
on july,fox signed and returned the subcontract.in his cover letter,he noted the subcontract had not incorporated all previously communicated and agreed upon comments.to avoid further delays in subcontract execution and release of payment obg has executed the subcontract based upon incorporation of changes by hand and initialed.he also stated milestones would follow in a separate document and crossed out the milestone dates in the body of the contract.
design and performance delays 
neither party disputes the district court finding both parties created delays through faulty design and performance.first the design delays.the parties agreed to use an expedited process on the two most important buildings in the complex,and,which would be the site of the manufacturing plants.once building design was complete,building was to follow shortly with only minor modifications.early on,however,the joint venture made frequent changes to building equipment loads by changing the location and quantity of equipment components the building would support.obg engineers could not finalize the design for building until the joint venture could identify the proper equipment loads.
obg own design flaws compounded the problem.most critically,obg bid had understated the amount of steel and concrete needed to meet the rfp seismic specifications meant to prevent building drift in the event of an earthquake.also,because the joint venture initial drawings specified column lines could not be moved without permission,obg assumed the joint venture had arrived at the proper distances between buildings,although the subcontract stated that the joint venture drawings represented a conceptual phase.
as a result of the design flaws,building requirements rose from the tons indicated in the rfp to tons.the amount of steel and concrete increased proportionally.while obg had proposed using tons of steel,for example,it actually used tons to complete the building.in time,obg admitted only of the additional tons could be attributed to the joint venture increased equipment loads.the rest were attributable to obg design flaws.
there were also delays in performance.the contract called for completion of the project by april.when obg was fired on april,none of the buildings had been completed and construction on building had not begun.again,the parties appear not to dispute they both had a part in causing delays.
starting with the eleven changes it forwarded to obg on april,the joint venture made eighty changes to building design elements,including the weight and location of the mezzanines and the number,weight,and size of air handling units on the roof.these elements affected the structural design.as a result,within a period through the summer of,obg had to reissue its issued for construction drawings for building foundation eight times and for its roof plan ten times.
obg also experienced delays in completing the steel erection.its erection contractor was one month late in starting,the contractor maintained a smaller crew than anticipated,and steel was late in arriving.other delays were caused by obg defective doweling and use of defective anchor bolts.
finally,an unanticipated delay occurred when obg discovered poor subsoil and fire lines which the joint venture had failed to designate in its conceptual drawings.because of these conditions,a retaining wall,which obg had agreed to build as work outside the scope of its bid,had to be redesigned and made much larger.due to the delays in completing the wall,the construction of building had to be resequenced,with the date reset for october.despite the many delays and disputes,obg eventually missed the deadline for this critical first building by only two days 
changes in the scope of work 
through paragraph,the subcontract required obg to make changes to its scope of work whenever it received written instructions for changes from the joint venture.although obg had to promptly proceed in compliance with such written instructions,it could not collect on any increase in costs from the change until the parties had agreed to the price in writing the merger clause,moreover,required modifications to the subcontract be in writing otherwise,they were not enforceable.
thus,the two and the merger a lag between obg performance of changes and its receipt of payment for those changes obg was required immediately to comply with the joint venture written instructions but it had to wait for the parties to agree to a price and then reduce the agreement to writing before it could receive payment.naturally,these delays exacerbated obg problems,and the possibility always lurked the parties might not agree on the price of a change after even after obg had already completed the work.
the change process itself is the subject of much dispute.whenever obg determined it was required to perform work outside the scope of its base,it sent the joint venture a potential change orders form pco.if the joint venture agreed the pco order was a change to the scope of the contract,or if the joint venture wanted to initiate such a change,the joint venture sent obg a change order request cor.during the course of the project,obg sent the joint venture pcos,and the joint venture sent obg cors 
the parties disagreement came to a head as they tried to negotiate the costs to accelerate the date for building.on july,the joint venture issued cor and asked obg to provide pricing to accelerate the partial date to october.on august,obg submitted a proposal in response to the cor,indicating it could complete the acceleration for million,a sum it later reduced to million.obg alleged the joint venture instructed it to spread this sum across five other open cors,which,together with cor,became known as the big six.the joint venture,of course,denied giving the directive and argued obg drastically underbid the contract and was attempting to make up the costs by submitting inflated cors 
on august,the joint venture signed the big six for a total amount of million,and in september,it prepared the corresponding subcontract modifications.however,it never issued them.instead,the joint venture wrote a letter to all its subcontractors announcing that its representatives could approve changes of no more than.
as the dispute over the big six swelled to a crisis,the parties held meetings on october and,at which obg informed the joint venture it would not perform work on change orders until the written subcontract modifications were issued.in response,the joint venture reminded obg of its contractual obligation to comply with written instructions regarding changes and stated that obg refusal would place it in default.consequently,obg continued performing work on the disputed work changes.
at the meetings,it also became clear the parties disagreed about the point from which to measure changes obg insisted changes should be measured from the drawings in place on april,the date of the notice to proceed.the joint venture wanted to measure changes from the drawings obg issued on may.like the big six,this issue was never resolved.
impasse and exhibit a 
having reached an impasse,the parties established teams of negotiators to examine the and issues.the teams met through january and february and had minimal success.during this same period,the parties also executed subcontract modifications through in the total amount of million.through exhibit a to these modifications,obg attempted to proceed with the work even while protecting the right it claimed to be paid for the other,disputed changes and delays 
this contract modification is entered into by the parties with the understanding that the contractor obg has made certain claims against the company the joint venture for delays,accelerations,and schedule impacts occurring prior to the date of this contract modification and certain claims against the company for scope of work changes and extra work that are not covered by this contract modification,all of which remain unresolved and open and with respect to which both parties hereto fully reserve and retain all of their respective rights,positions,defenses and arguments.
thus,the parties proceeded with the work although they could not resolve their disputes.ironically,even in signing the modifications,the parties could not agree to the incorporation of exhibit all the contract modifications contained a recitation that obg agreed to perform the modification work in accordance with all of the terms and conditions of the subcontract.moreover,the joint venture representative did not initial exhibit a,and instead wrote,the company rejects all changes to this contract modification form which was agreed to in the original subcontract.
subcontract amendment and escrow fund 
by the time the disputes over changes and scope of work came to a head in october,obg was experiencing problems and was struggling to pay its contractors.in an effort to keep the contractors on the job,the joint venture and obg executed an amendment to the subcontract on november.the joint venture agreed to make advance payments of up to million in exchange for obg completion of new milestone dates.obg received an advance of million upon execution of the amendment and another advance of million in december when it achieved some of the amended milestones.obg did not,in the end,meet all the new milestones,and the joint venture later learned obg used the advance payments to satisfy its loans before paying its contractors.
the amendment acknowledged obg cash flow problems have arisen as a result of both parties delays in the timely resolution of subcontractor change orders which have produced corresponding delays in subcontractor invoicing and payments.the amendment also contained a pledge by both parties that they would continue negotiating their respective claims in good faith and that the parties shall conduct a meeting on or before december,to establish a procedure for the timely resolution of all change orders.
in march,in yet another attempt to pay obg subcontractors,the joint venture agreed to place million in escrow on the condition obg surety,reliance insurance,do the same.reliance agreed.but,unbeknown to the joint venture,reliance delayed establishing its fund until it renegotiated a agreement with obg loan holder.meanwhile,and without the joint venture knowledge,obg offered its contractors settlement packages of fifty to sixty cents on the dollar.upon learning of the settlement offers,the joint venture became more concerned the contractors would quit,and this concern became another factor in its decision to terminate obg.
termination 
pursuant to the subcontract,the joint venture withheld the january and february progress payments because obg had failed to reach the goals.the joint venture then fired obg in early april.
