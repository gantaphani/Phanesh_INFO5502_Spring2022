a collective bargaining agreement cba obligates defendant bellon wrecking salvage company to hire members of plaintiff east louis laborers local to do certain highway construction work.bellon and the union amended the agreement orally to permit the employer some latitude to use labor from outside local on a project in southwestern illinois.the parties disagree about the extent of the oral amendments.when work slowed,bellon laid off a member of local instead of a laborer from a neighboring union.local believed this violated the agreement as amended,sued for breach of the cba,and sought a preliminary injunction.the district court granted the injunction,and bellon appeals.because the union has not shown that it will suffer irreparable harm absent the injunction,we reverse.
background 
in june,bellon was hired to remove the road deck from the macarthur bridge,which spans the mississippi river from louis,missouri to east louis,illinois.the project aimed at ensuring the bridge structural integrity by removing excess weight from the bridge.the work began on the missouri side of the river and moved east.at the time,bellon employed laborers from a missouri union,but had not signed a cba with local,whose jurisdiction covers the illinois side of the river.when local learned of the work on the bridge,it requested that bellon hire its members.bellon refused,and the union picketed in protest.the picket ended after a week,and bellon continued to use laborers from the missouri union.
for reasons that are not clear from the record,in october,bellon signed on to a cba already in effect among local,the southern illinois builders association,the southern illinois contractors association,and other local employers.the agreement extends through july,and obligates signatories to use local as the exclusive source of referrals for highway construction laborers in east louis and specified neighboring areas.the agreement provides that the union will maintain a list of eligible laborers participating employers bind themselves to hire from the list.
the cba sets forth a detailed schedule of wage rates for each laborer hired by an employer.the wage rates vary according to the type of job,the skills possessed by the laborer,and the number of hours worked within a day or week.the agreement also obligates employers to contribute to a health and welfare fund on behalf of each laborer they hire.
bellon and local acknowledge that they amended the agreement orally,although they disagree about the nature and extent of the changes bellon contends that the union authorized it to employ john fletcher,a laborer from a missouri union,as its lead person on the macarthur bridge.fletcher had been working on the project from the outset,and bellon valued his experience and loyalty.according to bellon depiction of the amendments,it would hire the second and third laborers from local as work on the bridge increased.bellon would draw the fourth laborer from outside the union,and thereafter it would alternate between hiring one member from local and one laborer from outside that union.bellon asserts that the parties designed this arrangement to maintain a staffing ratio between members of local and other laborers.
local contends that it agreed to allow bellon to use fletcher services,but only after the employer had hired two of the union members.the order of hiring takes on importance because both parties agree that,in the event of a layoff,the worker would lose his job first.moreover,the union asserts that the parties never contemplated a staffing ratio,and that all other laborers would be hired from local.
during october and the beginning of november,the work on the bridge called for three laborers.bellon hired fletcher and two members of local sean abernathy and leroy bailey.heavy rains on november,destabilized the footing of a crane that the three men had been using to demolish the road bed.without the crane,bellon could utilize only two laborers.it told abernathy not to report to work the next day.nevertheless,abernathy showed up on november and argued that fletcher,not he,should be laid off.bellon disagreed,asserting that abernathy held the least tenure of the three workers,and therefore should be laid off first.both abernathy and bailey left the job site in protest,returning some time later to picket.bellon hired replacement workers from outside local to work on the bridge.as of oral argument before this court,the work on the bridge continued.
on january,the union filed suit for breach of the cba in the circuit court of clair county,illinois.the state court issued a temporary restraining order directing that bellon adhere to the cba.
bellon removed the case to federal court under of the labor management relations act lmra,and of the employee retirement income security act erisa.on january,the district court held a hearing on bellon motion to dissolve the temporary restraining order and the union motion to convert the restraining order into a preliminary injunction.after taking testimony from both parties,the district court found the union witnesses credible,rejected bellon version of events,and held that local had established a likelihood of success on the merits.it held,moreover,that the union would suffer irreparable harm absent an injunction,that bellon would not be harmed by an injunction,and therefore that the balance of harms tipped in the union favor.accordingly,it issued a preliminary injunction mandating that bellon comply with the union account of the amended cba pending a trial on the merits.bellon appeals the order issuing the preliminary injunction.
ii.discussion 
the act cabins a district court power to issue injunctive relief in cases involving or growing out of a labor dispute.as explained below,a court enjoys far less leeway to issue a preliminary injunction in a case governed by the act than it does under traditional equitable principles.bellon argues that the act controls this case,and that judging by the act strict standards,the district court abused its discretion by issuing the injunction.the union contends that the act does not apply here for two reasons first,it argues that the statute does not protect employers second,it contends that the facts of this case fall within an exception to the act recognized by boys markets,retail clerks union,local,d,and its progeny.the union urges us instead to apply traditional equitable principles,under which,it contends,the injunction should stand.we need not decide which framework governs this case,however.both tests require the movant to show,at a minimum,that it will suffer irreparable harm absent the injunction.because the union has not made this threshold showing,it is not entitled to a preliminary injunction under either analysis.
traditional equitable principles 
our traditional approach to preliminary injunctions requires that the party seeking the injunction demonstrate,among other things,that it has no adequate remedy at law and will suffer irreparable harm if preliminary relief is denied.abbott labs.mead johnson,cir.if the moving party can not make this showing,a court inquiry is over and the injunction must be denied.id.we review the district court decision to issue a preliminary injunction for abuse of discretion.id.at.a court abuses its discretion when it commits an error of law or makes a factual finding that is clearly erroneous.id.at.
the union offers several arguments as to why it will suffer irreparable harm in the absence of a preliminary injunction.first,it contends that bellon has violated the cba repeatedly,and would continue to do so but for the injunction.even if this is true,it establishes only that bellon actions may harm the union it does not prove that the harm will be irreparable.an injury is irreparable for purposes of granting preliminary injunctive relief only if it can not be remedied through a monetary award after trial.see graham med.mut.of ohio,cir.thus,even repeated and ongoing violations of a cba do not warrant a preliminary injunction if each violation may be remedied by a monetary award.
relying on crane,cir,the union asserts that an ongoing violation amounts to irreparable harm.plai
