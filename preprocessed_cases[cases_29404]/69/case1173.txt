this class action was brought by california prisoners to challenge deficiencies in prison medical care that allegedly violated the eighth amendment and the americans with disabilities act.the parties consented to the entry of stipulated orders providing steps to remedy the deficiencies.when the state was unable to comply with the consent orders,the court imposed a receivership on the california department of corrections and rehabilitation cdcr to administer and improve prisoner health care.
although the state did not oppose or appeal from the appointment of the receiver,it now seeks,after several years,to terminate the receivership on the ground that the prison litigation reform act,plra or act,deprived the district court of the power to appoint a receiver in prison litigation.in addition,the state contends that the receivership was not the least intrusive means necessary to correct the violation of the federal right,as the act requires the district court to find in granting prospective relief.id.a a.finally,the state challenges the receiver planning for construction of additional prison facilities on the ground that the act implicitly prohibits such planning.
we conclude that the act does not deprive the district court of its equitable power to appoint a receiver in prison litigation.we also reject the state challenge to the district court finding that a receivership was the least intrusive means of remedying constitutional violations in prisoner health care.finally,we conclude that we lack jurisdiction to review the district court refusal to terminate the receiver construction plan.we accordingly affirm the portion of the district court order that denied the state motion to terminate the receivership,and we dismiss the appeal of the portion rejecting the challenge to the receiver construction planning.
background 
the plaintiffs brought this action on behalf of all inmates of california state prisons.the complaint alleges that the state has provided inmates with inadequate medical care in violation of the eighth amendment and the americans with disabilities act in january,after almost three years of informal negotiations and prior to discovery or any ruling on the part of the court,the parties entered into a stipulation and order for injunctive relief relief order designed to remedy the alleged violations.the court approved the relief order that june.
as part of the relief order,the state agreed to implement specific remedial procedures to ensure the provision of constitutionally adequate medical care in prisons statewide.these measures were to be taken on a rolling basis with seven prisons implementing the procedures in and five additional prisons implementing them each year through.the relief order provides that it shall be binding upon,and faithfully kept,observed,performed and be enforceable by and against the parties and empowers the district court to enforce its terms through specific performance and all other remedies permitted by law.in accord with this authorization,the district court convened monthly status conferences,toured one of the subject prisons,enlisted experts to monitor compliance with the relief order,and encouraged the parties to devise a joint plan for attaining the goals of the relief order.the going was slow.in september,after two years of little progress,the parties entered into a stipulated order regarding the quality of patient care and staffing care order,which the court promptly approved.this care order was meant to ensure the competency of medical staff and to establish procedures for the identification and treatment of patients.
three years after entering into the consent decree,not a single prison had successfully implemented the remedial procedures,despite the fact that a significant number of inmates had died as a direct result of substandard medical fact the state openly acknowledges.reckoning that the medical delivery system was too far gone to be corrected by conventional methods,the district court issued an order directing the state to show cause as to why it should not be held in contempt for failing to comply with prior orders and,also,why the court should not appoint a receiver to manage the delivery of constitutionally adequate medical care in state prisons.
because the relief order was the product of a settlement,attained without findings of fact,the district court conducted a evidentiary hearing on the order to show cause.at the hearing,the court received dozens of exhibits into evidence and took testimony from various experts and state employees.numerous experts testified as to the incompetence and indifference of prison physicians and medical staff and described an abysmal medical delivery system where medical care too often sinks below gross negligence to outright cruelty.despite such damning revelations,the state let the reports and testimony of those experts go,in the words of the court,essentially uncontested.indeed,the state candidly admitted in its response to the order to show cause that to date it had failed to attain compliance with all aspects of prior court orders.
in october,after briefing by the parties and amici curiae,the district court issued its findings of fact and conclusions of law regarding the order to show cause.after cataloguing extensive and disturbing constitutional violations in the delivery of medical care to inmates,the court declared its intention to hold the citation for contempt in abeyance and to establish a receivership to remedy the violations.echoing the plra,see a a,the court found that the receivership and those actions necessary to effectuate its establishment,are narrowly drawn to remedy the constitutional violations at issue,extend no further than necessary to correct a current and ongoing violation of a federal right,and are the least intrusive means necessary to correct these violations.i f the system is not dramatically overhauled,the court observed,an unconscionable degree of suffering and death is sure to continue.
in february,the district court issued an order appointing a receiver and conferring upon the receiver all of the powers of the secretary of the cdcr with respect to the delivery of medical care,while concurrently suspending the secretary exercise of the same.notwithstanding the unprecedented scope and dimension of the receivership,as noted by the court,the state neither objected to nor appealed the order see a authorizing appeals from i nterlocutory orders appointing receivers.among other things,the order requires that all costs related to the receivership be borne by the state and directs the receiver to prepare a plan of action for remedying the constitutional violations and to file regular progress reports with the court.
in may,the receiver filed a draft plan of action calling for the construction of new beds and a motion to modify the original stipulated orders to accommodate the changed circumstances reflected by the need for the receiver appointment,and in order to facilitate implementation of the plan of action.plata schwarzenegger,cir alteration in original internal quotation marks omitted.california response was to join the motion,which the district court subsequently granted.over the course of the next fourteen months,the receiver filed numerous motions and revised plans of action,many of which concerned the construction of new facilities and all of which,until,met with the approval or acquiescence of the state.id.at.
in july,the receiver requested million in previously appropriated funds from the state for the implementation of its final,plan of action.id.at.when the state denied its request,the receiver moved the district court to cite state defendants schwarzenegger and chiang for contempt of court for failing to transfer the funds.id.following the submission of briefs and a hearing,in which the state averred that it was unable to provide any of the unencumbered previously appropriated funds to the receiver,the court issued an order directing the state to transfer million to the receiver no later than november,or risk being cited for contempt.id.alteration in original internal quotation marks omitted.the state appealed the order,but,in march,we dismissed the appeal as because further proceedings relating to the contempt were clearly contemplated.id.at.
meanwhile,in january,the state had filed in district court the motion that is the subject of this appeal.the state moved to end the receivership and replace the receiver with a special master.the motion also sought to terminate the receiver construction plan.the state contended that,as a matter of law,the plra barred the district court from both appointing a receiver and ordering the construction of prisons.the receiver made two requests of the district court first,that it convene an evidentiary hearing on the motion to terminate,and,second,that the district court grant it leave to conduct limited discovery regarding certain factual issues implicated in the motion.the state opposed the requests,arguing that the motion to terminate was based on the plain language of the plra and present ed discrete legal questions and,therefore,could be decided without an evidentiary hearing.
observing that the state sought to terminate the receivership on purely legal grounds,the district court denied without prejudice the receiver request to schedule an evidentiary hearing,and denied as premature the receiver request to conduct limited discovery.three weeks later,the district court issued an order denying the entire motion to terminate,which the state now appeals.
ii.standards of review 
we review de novo the district court construction or interpretation of a statute.united states carranza,f d,cir.we review mixed questions of law and fact for clear error when the factual issues predominate.see tolbert page,cir en banc.
iii.discussion 
a.the plra does not bar the appointment of receivers in prison litigation.
the heart of the state argument is that the plra implicitly bars the district court from appointing a receiver because it provides for the appointment of a special master.the state relies on the general intent of the plra to limit judicial intervention into prison management,and contends that the act provision for a special master must be read to exclude the appointment of receivers.
certainly nothing in the plra expressly prohibits the appointment of a receiver.receiverships were far from unknown in prison litigation before the enactment of the plra in.the best known example was the appointment by chief judge frank johnson of a receiver the state governor to oversee the entire alabama prison system.see newman alabama.other receivers were employed to govern city or county jails or jail systems.see inmates of jail jackson,jail medical and mental health services shaw allen,county jail wayne county jail inmates wayne county chief executive officer.county jail system.receiverships were also a recognized tool for taking over other governmental agencies that could not or would not comply with the law.see morgan mcdonough,cir school desegregation gary louisiana,civ,wl,at,state children services agencies turner goolsby,county school system judge rotenberg educ,comm r of dep t of mental retardation,department of mental retardation,abrogated on other grounds by in re birchell.
there can be little question,therefore,that receiverships are recognized equitable tools available to the courts to remedy otherwise uncorrectable violations of the constitution or laws.the state accordingly has a high burden in attempting to show that the plra revoked this power by implication.in gilmore california,cir,we recognized the principle that a statute should not be construed to displace courts traditional equitable powers a bsent the clearest command to the contrary.id.at quoting califano yamasaki,alteration in gilmore.
t he comprehensiveness of equitable jurisdiction is not to be denied or limited in the absence of a clear and valid legislative command.unless a statute in so many words,or by a necessary and inescapable inference,restricts the court jurisdiction in equity,the full scope of that jurisdiction is to be recognized and applied.
porter warner holding.we find no such clear command or inescapable inference in the plra.
the provisions of the plra on which the state focuses are codified at f and g,which provide in pertinent part 
f special masters.
in general.a in any civil action in a federal court with respect to prison conditions,the court may appoint a special master who shall be disinterested and objective and who will give due regard to the public safety,to conduct hearings on the record and prepare proposed findings of fact.
limitations on powers and special master appointed under this subsection 
a may be authorized by a court to conduct hearings and prepare proposed findings of fact,which shall be made on the record 
b shall not make any findings or communications ex parte 
c may be authorized by a court to assist in the development of remedial plans and 
d may be removed at any time,but shall be relieved of the appointment upon the termination of relief.
g used in this section 
the term special master means any person appointed by a federal court pursuant to rule of the federal rules of civil procedure or pursuant to any inherent power of the court to exercise the powers of a master,regardless of the title or description given by the court 
f g.these provisions clearly authorize the appointment of a special master in prison litigation to hold hearings,make recommended findings,and perform certain other related functions.they do not,however,provide that the court may appoint a special master with these powers and no one else.nor does anything in f or g purport to address the quite different office of a receiver,appointed by the court to take over the management of a prison system or a segment of it 
the state invokes,however,the canon of expressio unius est exclusio alterius,arguing that,by providing for special masters,congress implicitly negated the appointment of receivers.but that canon does not work when a single thing provided for is quite different from another thing omitted.the canon does not apply to every statutory listing or grouping it has force only when the items expressed are members of an associated group or series,justifying the inference that items not mentioned were excluded by deliberate choice,not inadvertence.barnhart peabody coal co,quoting united states vonn,see also chevron echazabal.the role of a special master as envisaged by federal rule of civil procedure and the plra is sufficiently distinct from that of a receiver appointed under the inherent authority of a court so that congress treatment of one without the other does not imply a prohibition against receivers.instead,the better inference is that what we face here is nothing more than a case unprovided for.barnhart,at.we also note that,even if expressio unius did apply,the negative implication arguably drawn from it scarcely could qualify as the clearest command of congress,yamasaki,at,or a necessary and inescapable inference,warner holding,at,required to limit the traditional equity powers of the district court.
the state argues,however,that we should draw a prohibition against receivers from the general intent behind the plra.there is no doubt that one of the purposes of the act was to restrict severely the intrusion of the judiciary into the operation of prisons.see gilmore,at.much of that goal was achieved by a a of the act,which provides that all prospective judicial relief necessarily including the appointment of receivers must be accompanied by findings that the relief is narrowly drawn,extends no further than necessary to correct the violation of the federal right,and is the least intrusive means necessary to correct the violation of the federal right.a a.we are not convinced,however,that congress effectuated an intent to prohibit receivers when it wrote the provision governing special masters into the act 
there is little legislative history attending the final enactment of the plra because it was tacked onto an omnibus bill.see omnibus consolidated rescissions and appropriations act of,a,stat.the plra had its origins in three bills earlier addressed by both chambers of congress the violent crime control and law enforcement improvement
