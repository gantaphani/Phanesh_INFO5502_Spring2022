the letter 
by letter dated july,biosense demanded that jude cease its unlawful raiding of biosense employees,including dowell,chapman and plaza.the letter stated that the former employees had covenants not to compete which precluded their employment with jude and their use of biosense confidential and trade secret information about its business and personnel.the letter stated that to the extent jude cooperates in and benefits from the former employees breaches of their obligations to biosense,it was exposing itself to tort liability,including claims for interference with contract,unfair competition and misappropriation of trade secrets.biosense demanded that jude provide adequate assurances that there would be no further raiding of its employees and agree that the named employees be transferred to positions not requiring their use of biosense confidential information.the letter further stated receipt of the above assurances will hopefully help us to work towards a resolution of this matter regarding the employees without the need for any litigation.jude medical needs to understand,however,that biosense webster will pursue all rights and remedies it deems appropriate including litigation if this matter is not resolved to its satisfaction in the immediate future.the letter concluded we look forward to hearing from you within two weeks of the date of this letter in the hope that we can resolve this matter expeditiously and efficiently for all parties involved.
jude received the letter on july,and on that day responded that it would need additional time to review the matter.on july,jude faxed a letter to biosense stating that as a result of biosense threats of litigation,jude had considered it necessary to initiate litigation in california.jude enclosed copies of a complaint filed the previous day by real parties against biosense for declaratory relief and unfair competition under business and professions code sections and and a tro and order to show cause osc re preliminary injunction that real parties had obtained ex parte on the morning of july,without providing advance notice to biosense.
the tro and osc 
the ex parte application for the tro and osc stated that exigent circumstances excused advance notice to biosense because biosense had evidenced a clear intent to evade california public policy against restraints of trade and california unfair competition law governing its employment contracts by instituting litigation in a remote forum.real parties submitted copies of tro previously issued by the respondent court in three unrelated cases granting the same relief real parties were seeking.real parties also presented the declarations of dowell,chapman and plaza,who each stated that he or she left biosense and joined jude subsidiaries for career advancement.they also stated they were not told by anyone at biosense,either in their exit interviews or at any other time,that they could not work for usd or pacesetter or that doing so was a breach of any obligation owed to biosense.
the trial court granted the tro enjoining biosense and its agents from c ommencing or taking any action other than in this court,the superior court of the state of california for the county of los angeles,to enforce any noncompetition agreement with dowell,chapman and plaza,or to enforce any restrictive covenant in any agreement with dowell,chapman and plaza on the ground that they,or one or more of them,have in their possession or had access to any trade secret,confidential or proprietary information belonging to biosense or on any other ground.the court noted during the ex parte hearing that biosense would have a right to sue here in the federal court in,and i do intend to enjoin that,but i not going to change it to an order to that effect at this point.the court also issued the osc,setting the matter for hearing on august.
the writ petition 
on august,biosense filed a petition for writ of mandate or prohibition in this court,seeking an immediate stay of all trial court proceedings.biosense asserted three grounds for relief the tro was issued ex parte without notice to biosense in violation of its constitutional and statutory rights to notice the tro violated the basic principles of comity and judicial restraint announced in advanced bionics and real parties came to court seeking equity with unclean hands.the following day,the trial court granted the parties request to continue the osc hearing to august,and ordered the tro to remain in effect until that date.
on august,this court ordered the hearing on the osc.the order stated that it appeared the trial court had erred in issuing the tro and setting the osc hearing because the prospect that petitioners would institute litigation against real parties in interest does not constitute great or irreparable injury,immediate danger,or any other statutory basis for issuing a temporary restraining order without notice code civ,subd.c cal.rules of court,rule g the temporary restraining order is overbroad,restraining litigation in any and all federal courts and principles of judicial restraint and comity prohibit antisuit injunctive relief to restrain litigation in another state.the order gave notice under palma industrial fasteners,cal d,palma that this court was considering issuing a writ of mandate in the first instance unless the trial court vacated the tro and osc.in the event the trial court did not do so by august,the parties were directed to submit further briefing to this court 
subsequent trial court proceedings 
on or about august,biosense filed opposition to the osc.on august,real parties filed an ex parte application requesting the opportunity to file briefing in response to this court palma notice,and requesting the trial court to correct the tro nunc pro tunc to permit the filing of an action in federal court in california,and to clarify the tro to reflect certain findings.biosense received notice of the ex parte application and appeared at the hearing,which lasted approximately minutes.the court denied the application with respect to the requests for further briefing and for a clarification of findings,but granted the request to correct the tro nunc pro tunc to permit the filing of an action in any federal court in the state of california.
discussion 
standard of review 
the law is well settled that the decision to grant a restraining order rests in the sound discretion of the trial court.it county of imperial cal d,a trial court will be found to have abused its discretion only when it has exceeded the bounds of reason or contravened the uncontradicted evidence.ibid.further,the burden rests with the party challenging the trial court order to make a clear showing of an abuse of discretion.ibid.church of christ in hollywood superior court th,d.mandate lies to control judicial discretion when that discretion has been abused.state farm.ins.superior court cal d,see also robbins superior court cal d,although mandamus does not generally lie to control the exercise of judicial discretion,the writ will issue where,under the facts,that discretion can be exercised in only one way.
real parties argue that in light of the trial court proceedings subsequent to the filing of the writ petition,the writ petition directed to a tro without notice is moot.following our palma notice,biosense received notice of real parties august,ex parte application for correction of the tro.at the outset of the hearing,biosense pointed out to the respondent court that it had filed a lengthy opposition to the osc.the court stated that it had read the opposition and invited biosense to stress anything that you wish to stress.biosense then proceeded to argue that the tro should be vacated.the trial court rejected biosense arguments and continued the tro in force,corrected nunc pro tunc to permit the filing of an action in federal court in the state of california.
because biosense was given a full and fair opportunity to be heard on the merits of the tro,we find that the issue of whether the tro was improperly granted in the absence of notice is now moot.finnie town of tiburon d.reviewing courts will decide only actual controversies and not questions that have become moot by subsequent acts or events.however,because the writ petition raises challenges to the issuance of the tro,that are separate and apart from the issue of notice,we find that the writ petition itself is not moot.t he general rule governing mootness becomes subject to the qualification that an appeal will not be dismissed where,despite the happening of the subsequent event,there remain material questions for the court determination.eye dog foundation state board of guide dogs for the blind cal d.
we agree with biosense that the tro is irreconcilable with our supreme court decision in advanced bionics,supra,cal th,d,which held that a tro enjoining a party in a california action from taking any action in a minnesota proceeding involving the same dispute over a covenant not to compete was improper under principles of judicial restraint and comity.
in advanced bionics,supra,medtronic,medtronic,a minnesota corporation with headquarters in minnesota,hired mark stultz in minnesota.stultz signed an employee agreement containing a covenant not to compete and a minnesota provision.cal th at,d.five years later,stultz resigned from medtronic and went to california to work for a competitor,advanced bionics corporation advanced bionics,a delaware corporation with headquarters in california.id.at,d.that same day,in los angeles county superior court,stultz and advanced bionics sued medtronic for declaratory relief and unfair competition.they notified medtronic that they intended to apply for a tro enjoining medtronic from taking any action in any other court to enforce its noncompetition agreement.ibid.medtronic removed the action to federal court and sued stultz and advanced bionics in minnesota state court.id.at,d.after the matter was remanded,the minnesota court issued a tro,and ultimately a preliminary injunction,precluding advanced bionics from hiring stultz in any competitive role and barring both parties from taking any action or obtaining any order from any court that would interfere with the minnesota court determination of whether it should determine the claims in the minnesota lawsuit.id.at,d.meanwhile,stultz and advanced bionics obtained a tro in the california action,prohibiting medtronic from taking any further steps in the minnesota action.ibid.thereafter,the minnesota court directed stultz and advanced bionics to move to vacate the tro obtained in the california action,but that court refused to vacate its order.id.at,d.medtronic appealed from the tro,and the court of appeal held that it was properly issued.ibid.the supreme court reversed.id.at,d.
acknowledging that it was a case of first impression,the supreme court recognized that while california courts have the power to issue a tro or antisuit injunction restraining proceedings in a sister state,t he significant principles of judicial restraint and comity inform that we should use that power sparingly.advanced bionics,supra,cal th at,d.the court noted that the use of injunctive relief to prohibit a person from resorting to a foreign court is a power rarely and sparingly employed,for its exercise represents a challenge,albeit an indirect one,to the dignity and authority of that tribunal.ibid.the court also noted that potentially conflicting judgments naturally result from parallel proceedings but do not provide a reason for issuing a tro.id.at,d.the court concluded that enjoining proceedings in another state requires an exceptional circumstance that outweighs the threat to judicial restraint and comity principles.id.at,d.the court specifically rejected the argument that california strong public policy against noncompetition agreements provided the exceptional circumstance warranting the tro we agree that california has a strong interest in protecting its employees from noncompetition agreements under business and professions code section.but even assuming a california court might reasonably conclude that the contractual provision at issue here is void in this state,this policy interest does not,under these facts,justify issuance of a tro against the parties in the minnesota court proceedings.id.at,d.the court made clear that the minnesota action did not divest california of jurisdiction and that advanced bionics remained free to litigate the california action.ibid.
real parties argue that advanced bionics is distinguishable because here there was no other lawsuit pending when the tro was issued.they claim that the comity principles so crucial to the formulation of the court exceptional circumstance test have little if any relevance where there is no proceeding pending in another forum.we disagree.judicial restraint and comity concerns are present whether a court is restraining a litigant from
