plaintiffs in a construction defect case appeal from a cost bill after a defense verdict.they argue the memorandum of costs should have been stricken because defendant si corporation si did not apportion its costs among the plaintiffs although their claims were separate,rather than joint.we conclude si was entitled to file a single costs memorandum and was not required to apportion costs among the plaintiffs.the trial court did not err in awarding costs to si as prevailing party.plaintiffs also challenge the sufficiency of the evidence to support the cost award.because the record does not show that the trial court engaged in the itemized review required,and in fact indicated that it did not,we reverse the award and remand so that an itemized review may be made.
factual and procedural summary 
this appeal arises from two consolidated construction defect actions involving homes located in the california marquis tract in palmdale.acosta et kaufman broad.county,no.alvarez et kaufman broad.county,no.the houses were constructed by kaufman broad.the same attorney represented all the plaintiffs in the two actions.each home was owned by a separate plaintiff or group of plaintiffs.plaintiffs settled their claims against kaufman broad and dismissed it from the actions.as a part of the settlement,si was added as a defendant.the fourth amended complaints against si alleged that it provided fibermesh for installation in the concrete slabs under the homes instead of welded wire mesh.plaintiffs alleged the concrete slabs cracked,causing extensive damage to their homes.
following a number of pretrial motions not relevant here,the consolidated case was tried to a jury on a theory of strict product liability.the jury returned a verdict in favor of si.si filed a memorandum of costs,claiming.plaintiffs moved to tax costs,and argued that the entire cost bill should be stricken because it attempts to impose all of defendants costs,unallocated,jointly and severally on all plaintiffs despite the fact that the claims of said plaintiffs were and are separate and not joint.the motion also challenged of specific cost items.si opposed the motion.
at oral argument,the trial court referred to the motion to tax and stated,what i do want to do,is go through this individually.i have done that too many times,and it just as tedious as can be.i will do it if i have to,but i do want to.the matter was taken under submission.the trial court later denied the motion to tax costs in its entirety.we are not provided with a copy of the judgment for costs in favor of si.plaintiffs filed a timely appeal.
discussion 
the only issues on appeal concern the trial court award of costs to si.plaintiffs argue we should review the issue of the apportionment of costs among them as an issue of law on undisputed facts subject to de novo review.we agree.d e novo review of a trial court order is warranted where the determination of whether the criteria for an award of attorney fees and costs in this context have been satisfied amounts to statutory construction and a question of law.citations.carver chevron,th,d.lockheed martin th,d see also smith law group cal th,d,independent review appropriate where issue involves the proper interpretation of a statute and its application to undisputed facts.
plaintiffs argue that their claims for damages were separate,not joint,because different homes were involved in the litigation.it is undisputed that all plaintiffs were represented by the same counsel and that they jointly pursued a single strict liability cause of action at trial.plaintiffs contend that since their claims were separate,the burden was on si,in its costs memorandum,to offer a legal or factual basis to apportion costs among the plaintiffs.the plaintiffs assert that the memorandum should have been stricken because si failed to do so.if their position is wrong,si would be entitled to a cost award against the plaintiffs jointly,and would then be entitled to collect that amount as it saw fit from the various plaintiffs.any plaintiff who satisfied the cost award would be entitled to seek contribution from the other plaintiffs in a separate action.
si concedes that the trial court has discretion to apportion costs under code of civil procedure section.all further statutory references are to that code.it argues that this discretion allows trial courts to assess costs jointly and severally against multiple losing plaintiffs who jointly prosecute claims against a prevailing defendant.si contends that section does not preclude a joint and several award of costs against multiple losing parties,and cites authority from other jurisdictions where such an assessment has been allowed.
plaintiffs cite the opposition to their motion to strike the cost memorandum filed by si to argue that a mathematical apportionment suggested by si is not appropriate.the proposal to which plaintiffs refer was a fallback position suggested by si.first si argued there is no legal support for plaintiffs argument that si was required to apportion costs among them.it then suggested that in the event the trial court found apportionment proper,the court may apply a reasonable method for doing so such as simply splitting the costs pro rata among each of the households.on appeal,plaintiffs reject the suggested pro rata apportionment,arguing that each household suffered different damages they do not suggest a specific alternative method of apportionment.
in addition,plaintiffs argue that even the most cursory review of the record establishes that si incurred different costs as to each plaintiff.they contend,for example,that the deposition costs for each plaintiff varied as much as percent.because of these variances,plaintiffs contend a mechanical division of costs would have been fundamentally unfair and contrary to case law requiring a basis of.
as we shall explain,we do not adopt the approach suggested by plaintiffs.the right to recover any costs of a civil action is determined entirely by statute.lockheed martin,supra,th at,d,italics added.section governs the award of costs of trial court litigation.subdivision b states that a prevailing party is entitled as a matter of right to recover costs in any action or proceeding.subdivision a defines prevailing party prevailing party includes the party with a net monetary recovery,and a defendant as against those plaintiffs who do not recover any relief against that defendant.when any party recovers other than monetary relief and in situations other than as specified,the prevailing party shall be as determined by the court,and under those circumstances,the court,in its discretion,may allow costs or not and,if allowed may apportion costs between the parties on the same or adverse sides pursuant to rules adopted under section,subd.a hereafter subdivision a.
the current version of section is the product of a major revision of the statutes governing the recovery of costs.the legislation was sponsored by the california judges association.rules,reading analysis of bill reg.sess.as amended july.senate bill,as enacted,repealed former section and enacted a new section in its place.under the new statute,t he fundamental principle of awarding costs to the prevailing party remains the same,but whether those costs are awarded as a matter of right or as a matter of the court discretion now often depends on how the prevailing party is determined.if a party fits one of the definitions of prevailing listed in a that party is entitled as a matter of right to recover costs.a,b.in other situations,the prevailing party is determined by the court and the award of costs is discretionary.witkin,cal.procedure ed.judgment.there is no doubt that si was the prevailing party under the first sentence of subdivision a.the plaintiffs,joined in this litigation,failed to prove that whatever damages they may have suffered were caused by a defect in the si product used in their homes.
the relevant question on entitlement to costs is whether a party qualifies as a prevailing party under subdivision a.since the amendment to section,t he allowance of costs as a matter of right no longer depends on the character of the action invo
