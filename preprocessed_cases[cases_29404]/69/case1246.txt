a latin cross sits atop a prominent rock outcropping known as sunrise rock in the mojave national preserve preserve.our court previously held that the presence of the cross in the consists of more than percent land,including the land where the cross is the establishment clause of the united states constitution.buono norton,cir.we affirmed the district court judgment permanently enjoining the government from permitting the display of the latin cross in the area of sunrise rock in the mojave national preserve.
during the pendency of the first appeal,congress enacted a statute directing that the land on which the cross is situated be transferred to a private organization in exchange for a parcel of land located elsewhere in the preserve.see,a f,stat.that land exchange is already in progress and would leave a little donut hole of land with a cross in the midst of a vast federal preserve.the issue we address today is whether the land exchange violates the district court permanent injunction.we conclude that it does,and affirm the district court order permanently enjoining the government from effectuating the land exchange and ordering the government to comply with the original injunction.
i.the mojave national preserve 
the preserve encompasses approximately million acres,or square miles,of primarily land in the mojave desert,located in southeastern california.in,the bureau of land management blm transferred the land to the national park service nps both the blm and the nps are federal agencies under the department of the interior doi.within the preserve,approximately acres of land are privately owned and acres belong to the state of california.thus,slightly more than percent of the land in the preserve is federally owned.the preserve is a unit of the national park system and is given statutory protection as a national preserve,id.c.the preserve is under nps jurisdiction and authority.id.
ii.the cross 
the current incarnation of the cross atop sunrise rock is between five and eight feet tall and is constructed out of diameter metal pipes painted white.it is a latin cross,meaning that it has two arms,one horizontal and one vertical,at right angles to one another.it is undisputed that t he latin cross is the preeminent symbol of christianity.it is exclusively a christian symbol,and not a symbol of any other religion.buono i,d at.
historic records reflect that a wooden cross was built on that location as early as by the veterans of foreign wars vfw as a memorial to veterans who died in world war photographs depict the wooden cross and signs near it stating the cross,erected in memory of the dead of all wars,and erected by members of veterans of foregin sic wars,death valley post.the wooden signs are no longer present,and the original wooden cross,which is no longer standing,has been replaced by private parties several times since.the cross has been an intermittent gathering place for easter religious services since as early as,and regularly since.
the current version of the cross was built by henry sandoz,a local resident,sometime in.when nps investigated the history of the cross,sandoz explained that he drilled holes into sunrise rock to bolt the cross in place,making it difficult to remove.sandoz did not receive a permit from nps to construct the cross.
following buono i injunction against display of the cross,the cross has been covered by a plywood box.when uncovered,the cross is visible from vehicles traveling on cima road,which passes through the preserve,from a distance of approximately yards away.no sign indicates that the cross was or is intended to act as a memorial for war veterans.
iii.litigation over the cross and the congressional response 
the current controversy surrounding the cross surfaced in,when nps received a request from an individual seeking to build a stupa a buddhist shrine on a rock outcropping at a trailhead located near the cross.nps denied that request,citing a as prohibiting the installation of a memorial without authorization.a note on the denial letter warns that a ny attempt to erect a stupa will be in violation of federal law and subject you to citation arrest.the letter also indicates that c urrently there is a cross on a rock outcrop located on national park service lands it is our intention to have the cross removed.
in,nps undertook a study of the history of the cross.nps determined that neither the cross nor the property on which it is situated qualifies for inclusion in the national register of historic places.specifically,nps recognized that the cross itself has been replaced many times and the plaque that once accompanied it even though it is not known if it is original has been removed.also,the property does not qualify as an historical site because,among other things,the site is used for religious purposes as well as commemoration.
following the announcement by nps of its intention to remove the cross,the united states congress passed a series of laws,described below,to preserve the sunrise rock cross.the first piece of legislation,enacted in december,provided that no government funds could be used to remove the cross.see,stat.hereafter 
frank buono filed suit in march against the secretary of the doi,the regional director of nps,and the superintendent of the preserve collectively,nps or defendants.the district court concluded that the presence of the cross in the preserve violates the establishment clause.see buono i,d at.in july,the court entered a permanent injunction ordering that the defendants,their employees,agents,and those in active concert with defendants,are hereby permanently restrained and enjoined from permitting display of the latin cross in the area of sunrise rock in the mojave national preserve.
designation of the cross as a national memorial 
in january,while this matter was pending in district court,congress passed a defense appropriations bill,which included a section designating the sunrise rock cross as a national memorial.see,stat,codified at note hereafter.that section provides 
a designation of national white cross first erected by the veterans of foreign wars of the united states in along cima road in san bernardino county,california,and now located within the boundary of the mojave national preserve,as well as a limited amount of adjoining preserve property to be designated by the secretary of the interior,is hereby designated as a national memorial commemorating united states participation in world war i and honoring the american veterans of that war.
b legal memorial cross referred to in subsection a is located at latitude north and longitude west.the exact acreage and legal description of the property to be included by the secretary of the interior in the national world war i memorial shall be determined by a survey prepared by the secretary.
c reinstallation of memorial secretary of the interior shall use not more than of funds available for the administration of the mojave national preserve to acquire a replica of the original memorial plaque and cross placed at the national world war i memorial designated by subsection a and to install the plaque in a suitable location on the grounds of the memorial.
id.emphases added.the cross is designated the white cross world war i memorial.note.
nps is statutorily charged with the supervision,management,and control of the several national parks and national monuments.national memorials fall within the broader category of national monuments.see note identifying recognized national monuments,including various categories of national monuments and national memorials.
in october,less than three months after the district court injunction,in legislation aimed at the sunrise rock cross,congress passed a defense appropriations bill that included a provision barring the use of federal funds to dismantle national memorials commemorating united states participation in world war.b,stat.hereafter.
buono ii and passage of 
the government appealed the district court order and injunction.in september,one month after oral argument before a panel of our court but before a decision issued,congress enacted another defense appropriations bill that included a land exchange agreement regarding the sunrise rock cross.see.a f,stat,codified at note,hereafter.the statute provides 
a exchange exchange for the private property described in subsection b,the secretary of the interior shall convey to the veterans home of,veterans of foreign wars post in this section referred to as the recipient,all right,title,and interest of the united states in and to a parcel of real property consisting of approximately one acre in the mojave national preserve and designated by section of the department of defense appropriations act,public law stat.as a national memorial commemorating united states participation in world war i and honoring the american veterans of that war.notwithstanding the conveyance of the property under this subsection,the secretary shall continue to carry out the responsibilities of the secretary under such section.
b consideration for the property to be conveyed by the secretary under subsection a,and henry sandoz of mountain pass,california,have agreed to convey to the secretary a parcel of real property consisting of approximately five acres,identified as parcel apn,and located in the west of the northeast of the northwest of the northwest of section,township north,range east,san bernardino base and meridian.
a b emphases added.the government retains a reversionary interest in the property as follows 
e reversionary conveyance under subsection a shall be subject to the condition that the recipient maintain the conveyed property as a memorial commemorating united states participation in world war i and honoring the american veterans of that war.if the secretary determines that the conveyed property is no longer being maintained as a war memorial,the property shall revert to the ownership of the united states.
e emphasis added.the in a to pertains to use of federal funds to acquire a replica cross and plaque.see c.the land transfer was when the district court enjoined its enforcement,as described below.
in june,in affirming the district court permanent injunction,we held that the presence of the cross in the preserve violates the establishment clause,agreeing with the district court that this case is squarely controlled by separation of church and state committee city of eugene,cir scsc.buono ii,at.in scsc,we reasoned that the presence of a cross on city land,even where it bore a plaque dedicating the cross as a war memorial to veterans,at,violated the establishment clause because the presence of the cross may reasonably be perceived as governmental endorsement of christianity.id.at.
the government several attempts to distinguish scsc were not persuasive.for example,we held that it was of no moment that the cross in scsc was significantly taller,located in an urban area,or illuminated during certain holidays 
though not illuminated,the cross here is bolted to a rock outcropping rising fifteen to twenty feet above grade and is visible to vehicles on the adjacent road from a hundred yards away.even if the shorter height of the sunrise rock cross means that it is visible to fewer people than was the scsc cross,this makes it no less likely that the sunrise rock cross will project a message of government endorsement nor does the remote location of sunrise rock make a difference.that the sunrise rock cross is not near a government building is was the scsc cross.what is significant is that the sunrise rock cross,like the scsc cross,sits on public park land.national parklands and preserves embody the notion of government ownership as much as urban parkland,and the remote location of sunrise rock does nothing to detract from that notion.
buono ii,at emphasis added.
we also held that a reasonable observer,even without knowing whether sunrise rock is federally owned,would at least the cross rests on public land because of the vast size of the preserve,more than percent of which is federally owned.id.at citing reasonable observer test set forth in capitol square review advisory bd.pinette,d,concurring.a reasonably informed observer aware of the history of the sunrise rock cross would know not only that the cross was erected by private individuals which the government argued favored its view,but also that congress has taken various measures to preserve the cross,designating it a war memorial,prohibiting use of federal funds to remove it,and denying similar access for a buddhist shrine.id.
acknowledging the passage of while the appeal was pending,we addressed the government challenge that rendered the appeal moot or would soon do so.we rejected the government mootness challenge for two reasons first,we held that the case was not moot because the land transfer had not yet taken effect.id.at.second,because m ere voluntary cessation of allegedly illegal conduct does not moot a case,we held that even if the land transfer had taken effect,the government still had not carried its heavy burden to show mootness.id.at.even if the land were transferred under a,it may revert to the government under e,or as provided in other statutes.in particular,we noted that authorizes relinquishment of lands containing national monuments to the federal government,and authorizes the department of the interior to acquire all lands and interest in lands within the boundary of the mojave preserve by donation,purchase,or exchange.id.at discussing.
despite the injunction against display of the cross in the preserve,the government began moving forward with the mechanics of the land exchange under.buono then moved to enforce the district court prior injunction,or modify it to prohibit the land exchange as a violation of the establishment clause.in april,the district court granted buono motion to enforce the injunction,and denied as moot the request to amend the permanent injunction.see buono norton,d,buono iii.according to the district court,the transfer of the preserve land containing the latin cross which as a sectarian war memorial carries an inherently religious message and creates an appearance of honoring only those servicemen of that particular religion is an attempt by the government to evade the permanent injunction enjoining the display of the latin cross atop sunrise rock.id.at citation and quotation marks omitted.the district court deemed the exchange invalid and permanently enjoined the government from implementing the provisions of section of public law and ordered the government to comply forthwith with the judgment and permanent injunction entered by th e court on july.id.it is that decision that the government now appeals.
standard of review 
we review for abuse of discretion the district court order enforcing its prior injunction.paulson city of san diego,cir.a district court abuses its discretion in this regard if it bases its decision on an erroneous legal standard or on clearly erroneous findings of fact.id.
in the district court,buono advanced two alternative arguments challenging the land exchange under.first,buono argued that the land exchange is an attempt to evade the permanent injunction.alternatively,he argued that the land exchange itself violates the establishment clause because it is an improper governmental endorsement of religion.the district court holding is grounded only on the first basis,that the land exchange is a sham transaction with the purpose of permitting continued display of the cross in violation of the permanent injunction.on appeal,the government contends that was a bona fide attempt by congress to comply with the injunction.the government also argues that because it was not given the opportunity to fully effectuate the transfer,there are unknown facts that render this controversy unripe for judicial review.
turning first to the government ripeness challenge,we conclude that this controversy is ripe for review.as to the second question,the district court did not abuse its discretion in enforcing the injunction.we agree that the exchange effectuated by violates the injunction,which prohibits the display of the latin cross because it runs afoul of the establishment clause.
ripeness is a justiciability requirement that seeks to avoid premature litigation of disputes.thomas union carbide agr.products,d r ipeness is peculiarly a question of timing.citations omitted.the ripeness doctrine is drawn both from article iii limitations on judicial power and from prudential reasons for refusing to exercise jurisdiction.reno catholic soc,d accord thomas anchorage equal rights comm n,cir en banc discussing constitutional and prudential components of ripeness.the ripeness question we address is whether it is premature to consider a violation of the injunction before completion of the land exchange.
constitutional component of ripeness 
the constitutional component of there be an article iii case or controversy requires a concrete impact upon the parties arising from the dispute.union carbide,at.this analysis is similar to the inquiry under the standing doctrine.see anchorage equal rights comm n,at.
the government argues that before litigation proceeds,it should be given an opportunity to try to execute the land exchange in compliance with the prior injunction and the government constitutional obligations.buono responds that the concrete injury ripe for review is that the land transaction very structure evidences its lack of a secular purpose and its effect continues the government improper endorsement of religion that we already held exists.
this case can best be described as an ongoing controversy about the cross,the specifics of which shift with successive congressional enactments.the controversy is neither premature nor will it go away on its own.given the specifics of,it is no answer to say that the land exchange is not complete.it is,as the district court notes,already in progress,and the government intends to complete it.buono iii,d at.buono challenge to the present terms of the exchange is not a hypothetical request for an advisory opinion.anchorage equal rights comm n,at.
the supreme court has held that review of a statute is appropriate where the governmental purpose in enacting the statute evidences an improper endorsement of religion in violation of the establishment clause.see santa fe indep.sch.dist.doe,d.it is no legal leap to conclude that review is similarly appropriate where the purpose of a statute is to evade an injunction intended to end an ongoing establishment clause violation.
in santa fe,the supreme court considered the ripeness of a facial challenge to a school district policy purportedly allowing school prayer.id.the policy permitted students a to vote on whether there should be a invocation given at the start of high school football games,and b to later vote to select the one student who would deliver the invocation at all games throughout the year.id.at.the school district argued that it was premature to review the policy because there can be no certainty that any of the statements or invocations will be religious.id.at.rejecting that challenge,the court concluded that while forcing a student to participate in religious worship was a serious constitutional injury,so too was the mere passage by the school district of a policy that has the purpose and perception of government establishment of religion and the implementation of a governmental electoral process that subjects the issue of prayer to a majoritarian vote.id.at.recognizing that the constitution also requires that we keep in mind the myriad,subtle ways in which establishment clause values can be eroded.quoting lynch donnelly,d,concurring.thus,the mere enactment of the policy,particularly in light of the school district conduct,was a sufficient constitutional injury to warrant review,and ultimately an injunction against implementation of the policy.id.at importantly,in analyzing ripeness,the court looked to the history of the school district conduct in enacting the policy and the true purpose of the policy.id.at.
the analogy to santa fe is apt.here,both the district court and this court have concluded that a grave constitutional injury already exists.the permitting display of the sunrise rock cross in the preserve is an impermissible governmental endorsement of religion.see buono ii,at.as discussed further below,the constitutional injury will persist as a result land exchange effectuated under.this is so because among other things and other applicable statutes permit the government significant ongoing control of and involvement with the cross and the property on which it is situated.see santa fe,at.concluding that the text of the school district policy alone reveals the extent of school involvement in the election of the student speaker and the content of the message to be delivered.and,the government repeated actions in preserving the cross and forestalling enforcement of the injunction further evidence its goal of keeping the cross in place,see,b,just as the school district in santa fe acted with the purpose of maintaining a school policy permitting prayer at school events.santa fe,at.
buono has alleged a sufficient constitutional injury to overcome any argument that his challenge to is unripe.see santa fe,at.the challenge in this case presents a concrete injury,rather than an imaginary or speculative one 
prudential component of ripeness 
even where a concrete case or controversy is present,we consider whether,because of prudential concerns,we should decline to exercise jurisdiction.see union carbide,at.anchorage equal rights comm n,at.we evaluate two interrelated factors a the hardship that the party seeking relief will suffer from withholding judicial action,and b the fitness of the issues in the record for judicial review.abbott labs.gardner,d,overruled on other grounds by califano sanders,d.
this case easily satisfies both prudential components.as to the harm,o ne does not have to await the consummation of threatened injury to obtain preventive relief.if the injury is certainly impending,that is enough.union carbide,at.internal quotations and citations omitted the hardship resulting from the continuation of an establishment clause violation enjoined by the court is sufficient.
a claim is fit for decision if the issues raised are primarily legal,do not require further factual development,and the challenged action is final.exxon heinze,cir citations omitted.these requirements are satisfied here.
the key issue is primarily a question of law,whether the land exchange under violates the district court order permanently enjoining the government from permitting display of the cross in the preserve.see,santa fe,at.permitting facial challenge to school district policy prior to enforcement of the policy based largely on the court ability to construe the constitutionality of the policy purpose as a legal matter union carbide,at.granting review of constitutionality of administrative scheme requiring registrants to participate in binding arbitration of disputes with limited judicial review because party challenge raised solely legal issues.
next,we assess the state of the factual record,an inquiry that overlaps with and in this case collapses into the third component,the finality of the decision.friedman.inv.lewis,cir.the government argues that the record is incomplete because certain factual scenarios,as yet unknown,could occur at some time in the future.the government illustrates its claim by positing two potential scenarios that may occur rendering decision on this appeal premature.upon examination,neither proposed scenario persuades us that we should delay decision in this matter.
first,the government argues that once the land exchange is complete the vfw might at some point in the future remove the cross,but continue to maintain the property as a war memorial as provided under.thus,according to the government,the court should not decide whether the injunction is violated unless and until the land exchange is complete and the vfw has an opportunity to decide whether to maintain or remove the cross.
under the government construction,the dispute would never be ripe because,even if the transfer occurred,the government or the vfw could always argue that removal of the cross could occur at some point in the future.such gamesmanship is not sanctioned by our prudential ripeness doctrine.
the government view is also at odds with two statutes related to the sunrise rock cross,which,when read together,demonstrate that the vfw can not remove the cross without forfeiting the property to the government.section a designates the white cross as a national memorial.a emphasis added see also b referring to t he memorial cross note listing national memorial titled white cross world war i memorial.in other words,the cross itself is the memorial.section e conditions transfer of the land on the vfw agreement to maintain the conveyed property as a memorial commemorating united states participation in world war i and honoring the american veterans of that war.e.section e further provides that if the conveyed property is no longer being maintained as a war memorial,the property shall revert to the ownership of the united states.id.emphasis added.under these two statutes,the vfw removal of the cross from sunrise rock would trigger the reversionary clause of e and the land would revert to the united states.nothing permits the vfw to destroy a national memorial,remove the cross,and erect a substitute memorial.the entire scheme is directed to preservation of the cross.
to suggest that we do not yet know enough facts to decide this dispute ignores the practical reality of these statutory mandates.in santa fe,the court rejected the school district similarly implausible explanations for its conduct,based on the history and context of the school district actions 
the district,nevertheless,asks us to pretend that we do not recognize what every santa fe high school student understands this policy is about prayer.the district further asks us to accept what is obviously untrue that these messages are necessary to solemnize a football game and that this,position is essential to the protection of student speech.we refuse to turn a blind eye to the context in which this policy arose,and that context quells any doubt that this policy was implemented with the purpose of endorsing school prayer.
santa fe,at.emphasis added.
the government also argues that doi might never exercise the reversionary clause,even if the cross is removed.again,this argument fails as e itself provides that the property shall revert if the property is no longer maintained as a war memorial,the cross under.countenancing this argument would also render the claim perpetually unripe,bringing to mind the rule against perpetuities.although the rule surely does not apply in this context,common sense should.
even though the transfer itself is not complete,the certainty of the governmental action taking place is sufficiently ripe to allow review.see,friedman,at concluding that challenge to agency action as violating national environmental policy act was ripe where agency had granted funds for project and exempted it from certain of nepa requirements,despite that formal action to acquire the subject property by condemnation had not yet commenced.thus,none of the prudential ripeness concerns weigh against our rendering a decision 
ii.violation of the permanent injunction 
we next address whether the district court abused its discretion in concluding that transfer of the preserve land containing the latin cross,which as a sectarian war memorial carries an inherently religious message and creates an appearance of honoring only those servicemen of that particular religion is an attempt by the government to evade the permanent injunction enjoining the display of the latin cross atop sunset rock.buono iii,d at citation omitted.
government action 
in buono ii,we noted that the presence of a religious symbol on land that has been transferred into private hands may still violate the establishment clause.buono ii,at citing freedom from religion,city of marshfield,cir but we left for another day the question of whether a transfer completed under section would pass constitutional muster.id.in considering that question,we examine both the form and substance of the transaction to determine whether the government action endorsing religion has actually ceased.see marshfield,at 
as did the district court,based on the circumstances of this case,we consider three aspects of the land exchange under the government continuing oversight and rights in the site containing the cross after the proposed land exchange the method for effectuating the land exchange and the history of the government efforts to preserve the cross.
continuing government oversight and control over the cross and preserve property 
although congress sought to transfer the property to the vfw,a private entity,the various statutes,when read as a package,evince continuing government control.the following summary highlights that control 
nps retains overall management and supervision of the preserve.
nps is responsible for the supervision,management,and control of national memorials.
the white cross in the mojave national preserve is designated as a national memorial.
the transfer of land to the vfw is conditioned on the vfw maintenance of the conveyed property as a memorial to world war i veterans.
the secretary must carry out its duties under,which provides for nps to acquire and install replicas of the original cross and plaque.
the property shall revert to government ownership if it is no longer being maintained as a war memorial.
the government retains various rights of control over the cross and the property.nps is granted statutory powers of supervision,management,and control of national memorials.see.thus,nps general supervisory and managerial responsibilities with respect to the cross remain,despite a land transfer.see,providing that the newly created nps is responsible for regulating and promoting national parks,monuments,and reservations by such means and measures as conform to the fundamental purpose of conservation the secretary of the interior shall make and publish such rules and regulations as he may deem necessary or proper for the use and management of the parks,monuments,and reservations under the jurisdiction of nps.
in addition,a expressly reserves nps management responsibilities under.see a notwithstanding the conveyance of the property under this subsection,the secretary shall continue to carry out the responsibilities of the secretary under such section.section not only designates the cross a national memorial,but provides for in funds for nps to acquire and install replicas of the original plaque and cross located at the site.see a c.the district court found that these provisions gave the government an easement or license over the subject property for this particular purpose.buono iii,d at.such an easement or license reflects ongoing control over the property requiring compliance with constitutional requirements on that land.see,first unitarian church of salt lake salt lake,cir holding that where the government sells land to a private religious organization but maintains a pedestrian easement on the land,the first amendment speech clause applies even though the private party holds title to the land.
the district court also focused on the significance of the government retention of a reversionary interest in the property under e.see hampton city of jacksonville,cir holding that the inclusion of a reversionary clause in deeds to segregated golf courses conveyed by the city to private parties was sufficient state action to bring the golf courses within the fourteenth amendment because the reversionary clauses allowed the city to exercise complete present control over the golf courses eaton grubbs,cir holding that a reverter clause in a deed of trust allowed the city to effectively exercise control of the facility to ensure that it was always used as a hospital,and that such ongoing city control over use of property constituted sufficient state action to subject the hospital to the fourteenth amendment prohibitions against racial discrimination.as in hampton and eaton,the reversionary clause in e results in ongoing government control over the subject property,even after the transfer.
although the government argues that reversionary interests are mill clauses in contracts with the government,the commonality of such clauses does not diminish their power or effect.the fact remains that the govern
