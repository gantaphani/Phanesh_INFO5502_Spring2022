the principal issue presented in this case is whether an intentional tortfeasor is entitled to a reduction or apportionment of noneconomic damages under proposition otherwise known as the fair responsibility act of and codified at civil code sections to.we answer this question in the negative.
william thomas and woodrow taylor the plaintiffs sued duggins construction company,duggins and certain of its employees for injuries they sustained when the scissor lift it sold to their employer collapsed on a construction jobsite.a jury found in the plaintiffs favor on their claims for breach of implied warranty,negligence and intentional misrepresentation it awarded taylor million and thomas in damages and found that duggins and the plaintiffs employer were each percent responsible for the injuries,while two of duggins employees each bore percent responsibility.the jury also found that one of the duggins employees made intentional misrepresentations about the scissor lift to plaintiffs employer in connection with the sale.thereafter,the court rejected duggins arguments that its liability for the plaintiffs noneconomic damages was subject to apportionment in accordance with proposition and entered a judgment against duggins for the entirety of the plaintiffs damages.
duggins appeals,contending that the trial court erred in refusing to apportion its liability for the plaintiffs noneconomic damages in accordance with proposition the plaintiffs pretrial settlement offers to it pursuant to code of civil procedure section section were invalid because the offers did not address its liability for the plaintiffs claims against its employees who were named as defendants or for the claim in intervention filed by the workers compensation carrier that paid worker compensation benefits to the plaintiffs and the court erred in determining that the plaintiffs obtained a more favorable judgment than their settlement offers.the plaintiffs,arguing that the trial court should have granted their request for a finding that duggins had specifically agreed the jury allocation of fault related solely to their negligence claims and thus was precluded from challenging the court decision that proposition was inapplicable.
we conclude the trial court was correct in finding that proposition does not apply in favor of an intentional tortfeasor as against the plaintiffs or negligent tortfeasors and thus uphold its refusal to apportion the plaintiffs noneconomic damages,a conclusion that renders duggins third argument and the plaintiffs moot.further,we hold that duggins failure to raise any challenge to the validity of the section settlement offers in the proceedings below waived the issue for purposes of appeal.accordingly,we affirm the judgment.
factual and procedural background 
on february,electrical contractor greg bentley electric bentley purchased a used scissor lift for use in its electrical business from duggins for.two days later,the plaintiffs,bentley employees,were seriously injured when the platform of the lift became uncentered while being raised,causing the lift to tip over and the platform on which they were standing to collapse to the concrete floor to feet below.
in june,the plaintiffs filed this action against duggins for products liability and general negligence.after duggins answered,the plaintiffs amended their complaint to name as defendants duggins employees or agents james duggins,russel roben,scott dhalliwal and doug calhoun and to add claims for fraud,deceit,willful misconduct and punitive damages.fremont compensation insurance company fremont filed a complaint in intervention to recover workers compensation benefits that it had paid to the plaintiffs and filed a notice of lien as to the it paid to thomas and it paid to taylor.prior to trial,each of the plaintiffs served duggins with an offer to settle his claims against it under section taylor offer was for.and thomas offer was for.duggins did not accept either of the offers,which made no reference to the plaintiffs claims against duggins employees or fremont claim for reimbursement of worker compensation payments.
at trial,a jury returned a special verdict in favor of the plaintiffs,finding in part that in selling the lift to bentley,duggins made an express or implied warranty that the lift was suitable for bentley intended purpose the lift was not suitable for bentley intended purpose and this was a substantial factor in causing the plaintiffs injuries defendants roben and dhalliwal were employees and agents of duggins acting within the scope of their employment or agency in selling the lift to bentley these same defendants were negligent in maintaining or repairing the lift and in failing to inform bentley of problems with it dhalliwal intentionally made false representations or failed to disclose important facts about the lift to bentley and bentley relied on those representations or concealments the negligence,fraud or breach of warranty by the defendants caused the plaintiffs injuries plaintiff taylor suffered economic damages of and noneconomic damages of and plaintiff thomas suffered economic damages of and noneconomic damages of and the defendants allocations of fault for the plaintiffs injuries were percent each to duggins and bentley and percent each to roben and dhalliwal.the parties ultimately stipulated that dhalliwal acted at all relevant times in the course and scope of his employment for duggins and that the punitive damage claim against dhalliwal would be dismissed.after trial but before judgment was entered,fremont dismissed its complaint in intervention,indicating its intent to rely on its lien rather than participate further in the proceedings.
the parties thereafter briefed the issue of whether the plaintiffs damages were subject to apportionment under proposition.after hearing oral argument,the court ruled that proposition was inapplicable to the plaintiffs fraud cause of action based on its determination,the court declined the plaintiffs request for a finding that duggins had stipulated to this point during trial.after the court entered judgment,duggins moved,unsuccessfully,for a new trial based in part on the contention that proposition apportionment was required.the plaintiffs each filed a memorandum of costs,seeking to recover ordinary costs,as well as special costs,expert witness fees and prejudgment interest as provided in section.duggins apparently moved to tax the cost bills although the record before us does not include its motion the court awarded the plaintiffs special costs and fees under section,after partially granting duggins motion to tax certain of the costs requested by the plaintiffs.both parties now appeal.
discussion 
failure to allocate economic and noneconomic damages under proposition 
in,the voters approved proposition,a compromise measure that sought to balance the interests of injured parties who have sustained considerable damages caused by several tortfeasors,one or more of which is insolvent,against unfairness of the existing rule,which might result in a minimally culpable tortfeasor being held liable for the entirety of the plaintiff damages.evangelatos superior court cal d.proposition provides in relevant part 
in any action for personal injury,property damage,or wrongful death,based upon principles of comparative fault,the liability of each defendant for noneconomic damages shall be several only and shall not be joint.each defendant shall be liable only for the amount of noneconomic damages allocated to that defendant in direct proportion to that defendant percentage of fault,and a separate judgment shall be rendered against that defendant for that amount,subd.a.
at the time proposition was adopted,the law was well established that a tortfeasor who intentionally injured another was not entitled to contribution from any other tortfeasors.code civ.proc,subd.d.thus a defendant who committed an intentional tort against the plaintiff was not entitled to a reduction of the judgment because the plaintiff injuries also resulted from his or her own negligence or the negligence of a third party.allen sundean d.third party see also godfrey steinpress d.th
