metropolitan news company mnc appeals a judgment declaring the wall street journal wsj a newspaper of general circulation for the city of los angeles pursuant to government code section mnc contends wsj fails to satisfy the statutory requirements because it is not printed and published exclusively in the city of los angeles and because the typesetting does not take place in the city.we conclude that mnc has shown no error and will affirm the judgment.
factual and procedural background 
wsj is a daily newspaper published in new york city and several other cities by dow jones company.andrew johnson,a manager of dow jones company,filed a petition pursuant to section to declare wsj a newspaper of general circulation for the city of los angeles.
mnc opposed the petition,arguing that wsj is a national newspaper and is not a los angeles newspaper italics omitted.mnc also argued that the petition failed to allege that the typesetting takes place in the city of los angeles and therefore failed to properly allege that the newspaper is printed in the city.mnc argued further that a newspaper can be printed and published within the meaning of sections and in one city and only one city and therefore can not qualify as a newspaper of general circulation for more than one city.
after a hearing on the petition,the trial court entered an order on december,declaring wsj a newspaper of general circulation for the city of los angeles.the court found that wsj was printed in the city for at least one year before the filing of the petition because during that period of time the mechanical work of multiplying copies of the newspaper has been performed in the city of los angeles.the court also found that wsj was published in the city during that period of time and that the other statutory requirements had been satisfied.
mnc timely appealed the order 
contentions 
mnc contends wsj is not printed and published in the city of los angeles because it is printed in other cities and can not be printed and published within the meaning of section in more than one city and wsj is not printed in the city of los angeles because the typesetting,or its modern equivalent of computer keyboard typing by newspaper reporters,does not take place in the city.

a newspaper need not be printed and published exclusively in one city to qualify as a newspaper of general circulation 
mnc construes section to mean that a newspaper of general circulation must be printed and published in one city and only one city.mnc argues,i t follows that a newspaper printed and published in one city may not qualify as a newspaper of general circulation for another city.western states newspapers,gehringer d.we conclude that mnc misconstrues the statute.
our fundamental task in construing a statute is to ascertain the legislative intent so as to effectuate the purpose of the law.hassan mercy american river hospital cal th,d.because the statutory language ordinarily is the most reliable indicator of legislative intent,we begin by examining the words of the statute.ibid.we give the words of the statute their ordinary and usual meaning and construe them in the context of the statute as a whole and the entire scheme of law of which it is a part.state farm mutual automobile ins.garamendi cal th,d.if the language is clear and a literal construction would not result in absurd consequences that the legislature did not intend,we presume that the legislature meant what it said and the plain meaning governs.coalition of concerned communities,city of los angeles cal th,d.if the language is ambiguous,we may consider a variety of extrinsic aids,including the purpose of the statute,legislative history,and public policy.ibid.frontier oil rli ins.th.
the plain language of section states that a newspaper must be both printed and published in the same town or city to qualify as a newspaper of general circulation for that town or city.this is consistent with the judicial construction of printed and published in section and its predecessor,former political code section,prior to the enactment of section.application of monrovia evening post cal,stated that a newspaper must be printed and published in the same city,town or county to qualify as a newspaper of general circulation in re hancock d,same in re hoyle,same.an uncodified statute enacted in at the same time that section was originally enacted stated that section was declaratory of existing law and that no substantive change was intended.stats,ch.neither the plain language of section nor any prior case authority suggests that a newspaper that is both printed and published in one town or city can not qualify as a newspaper of general circulation for another town or city in which it is both printed and published or that a newspaper can not qualify as a newspaper of general circulation for more than one town or city where it is both printed and published.
section,enacted in stats,ch,provides alternative criteria to qualify as a newspaper of general circulation.the newspaper must be published at regular intervals of not less than weekly in the city,district,or judicial district for which it is seeking adjudication for at least three years preceding the date of adjudication,but need not be printed in that same city,district or judicial district,criterion a see in re tri valley herald d.the newspaper also must satisfy other requirements,including that i t has only one principal office of publication and that office is in the city,district,or judicial district for which it is seeking adjudication,criterion d.section,in contrast,does not state that to qualify under that statute a newspaper must have only one principal office of printing and publishing.sections and are alternative provisions for qualifying as a newspaper of general circulation,and the requirements of section can not be read into section if those requirements are not st
