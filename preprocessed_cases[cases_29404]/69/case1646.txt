this suit arises from two spare parts requirements contracts between the united states army communications electronics command cecom and technology corporation.following a trial,the court of federal claims held that cecom had breached the contracts by negligently overestimating in its invitations for bids ifbs the number of spare parts that would be required during the contract period.tech.united states.the court awarded damages in the amount of,plus interest.id.at tech.united states,fed.cl.denying motion for reconsideration.
on appeal,argues that our decision in rumsfeld applied,cert.denied,d,requires reversal and the award of damages in the form of an equitable adjustment in contract price.because we conclude that the court of federal claims employed a reasonable method to calculate damages,and because that method is not inconsistent with our decision in applied,we affirm the court decision.
background 
the two requirements contracts called for to provide spare parts for the circuit switch circuit switch the circuit switch has over individual spare parts,approximately of which were managed by cecom in the procurement at issue in this case,fed.cl.at.in connection with the procurement,cecom identified the particular spare parts that were appropriate for contracts.it then grouped those parts into acquisition packages based on similarity of materials and components.id.at.once the parts were allotted between acquisition packages,cecom calculated the quantities that would be required for each spare part within each package.id.for pricing purposes,each part was assigned one of three quantity ranges for each year of the contract.id.because of well recognized economies of scale,cecom expected bidders to offer a different price for each quantity range.see,crown laundry dry cleaners,united states,fed.cl,t he work estimate provided the basis for the bid price submitted to the government.the larger the number of work items listed in the work estimates,the lower the cost allocation per item of work performed.the lower the number of work items listed in the work estimates,the higher the cost allocation per item of work performed.
the acquisition packages eventually matured into ifbs.each ifb described a requirements contract,with a government option to extend the contract for up to four years.for each line item,each ifb set forth three estimated quantity ranges ranges a,b and c,as well as a specific estimated contract quantity,fed.cl.at.in the case of each line item,the estimated contract quantity corresponded to the lower end of the middle quantity range for the item.id.the ifbs also stated that,in the case of each line item,bidders were to provide unit prices for each of the quantity ranges for each of the five possible ordering years.id.at.submitted bids in response to two ifbs.in doing so,in the case of each line item,it bid the same price for each quantity range for all five years,contrary to what cecom had expected.id.at.asserted that it priced its bids based on the total estimated requirements for each contract,rather than based on the quantity ranges in the ifbs.id.in due course,was awarded the two contracts for which it bid,contract and contract.ultimately,contract covered nine line items,while contract covered seven line items.
as it turned out,the requirements estimates in the ifbs failed to take into account two important factors of which cecom was aware,or should have been aware.id.at.first,cecom failed to consider that the level of need for parts would be affected by an increase in the number of parts on hand based on new incentives for field units to return defective or damaged parts.id.second,the requirements estimates did not take into account the number of parts on hand at the time the estimates were made.id.as a result of neglecting this information,cecom used the base average monthly demand,rather than the net base average monthly demand for the parts involved in the procurement.id.at.as a result,the spare parts requirements set forth in the ifbs,and thereafter stated in the contracts,were overestimated.
subsequently,although cecom extended both contracts twice,it only issued one order under contract and two orders under contract.id.at.the order under contract was for worth of spare parts,which represented less than twelve percent of the total estimated quantity of parts for that contract.the total value of orders under contract was,representing less than twenty percent of the total estimated quantity of parts for that contract.
when cecom chose not to exercise any options after the second option year under either contract,filed certified claims with the contracting officer.id.at.claimed breach of contract damages in the amount of under contract and under contract.id.in its claims,sought to recover the fixed overhead and general and administrative g a costs that it alleged it would have incurred,as well as the gross profit it stated it would have made,under each contract had the government purchased all of the estimated requirements for the base year and each of the four option years stated in the ifbs.id.at.
after the contracting officer denied its claims,timely filed suit in the court of federal claims under the contract disputes act of.following a trial,the court held that cecom had breached the two requirements contracts by negligently overstating,in the ifbs,its estimated requirements for spare parts.however,the court disagreed with damages assessment and awarded only in total damages for both contracts.
before the court of federal claims,sought damages spread over the base year and the four option years of each contract,even though cecom only extended each contract twice,fed.cl.at.relying on dangfeng shen ho united states,fed.cl,aff,the court of federal claims rejected claim for damages based upon the unexercised option years because it determined that cecom failure to exercise the additional options was not in bad faith,fed.cl.at.the court stated p laintiff may not recover for any items which might have been ordered during the fourth and fifth option years even if the government incorrectly estimated its contract requirements.id.the court then turned to claim insofar as it related to the base year and the first two option years under each contract.
as far as the base year and the exercised option years were concerned,asserted that it was entitled to the profit and burden that it anticipated in its bid and would have earned if the government representations of its requirements had been true.id.at.specifically,as it had before the contracting officer,sought to recover the profit it would have made under the contracts if the government had ordered the quantity of spare parts estimated in the ifbs,plus fixed overhead and g a costs.id.
the court of federal claims ruled first that was not entitled to anticipated profits on unordered parts.the court stated a plaintiff that has proven that the government was negligent in estimating contract requirements,however,still bears the risk of variances in the government requirements due to factors other than the government negligence id.to determine damages,the court instead resorted to what has been referred to as the jury verdict method for approximating damages.the jury verdict method is most often employed when damages can not be ascertained by any reasonable computation from actual figures.dawco construction,united states,overruled on other grounds by reflectone,dalton.before adopting the jury verdict method,the court must first determine three things that clear proof of injury exists that there is no more reliable method for computing damages and that the evidence is sufficient for a court to make a fair and reasonable approximation of damages.id.
the court of federal claims started from the premise that damages recovery should be based upon what cecom would have estimated its contract requirements to be if it had not been negligent,fed.cl.at.the court reasoned that was due a percentage of the portion of the difference between the actual orders and the estimated contract requirements attributable to the government failure to consider net base average monthly demand and assets on hand.id.to calculate damages,the court first determined what cecom would have estimated in the ifbs had it not been negligent.to accomplish this,the court identified and addressed the errors that led cecom to its faulty estimates.mainly,this included determining net base average monthly demand using the formula that government witnesses testified cecom should have used when developing its estimates.with the proper demand established,the court then generated new estimates of required parts.see id.at.the reconstructed estimates were lower than the original negligent estimates,but greater than the government actual orders.using pricing for the original contract,the court then computed what the total price of each contract would have been based on the recomputed totals.id.at.the court used these new contract totals as the basis for determining its damages award.
as noted,claims included fixed overhead relating to the unordered quantities and gross profit related to the unordered quantities,including g a costs.id.at.in assessing these claims,the court of federal claims relied,in part,on a government audit by the defense contract audit agency dcaa.the dcaa audit accepted claim for unrecouped fixed overhead costs.id.however,both claims and the dcaa audit based the amount of fixed overhead recoverable by on the assumption that was entitled to all of the estimated contract requirements for the base year and all four option years.the court of federal claims concluded that was only entitled to a computation based on the quantities the government would have ordered had it accounted for unserviceable returns and only during the base year and the two executed option years.id.accordingly,the court only awarded fixed overhead costs related to the quantities the government would have ordered had it ordered all of its properly prepared estimates,and only for the base year and the two exercised option years,less the fixed overhead already covered by cecom actual orders.id.this amounted to for contract and for contract,for a total of.
with respect to the gross profit related to unordered quantities,the court of federal claims again turned to the dcaa audit.the dcaa concluded that based on our analyses,the contractor would have experienced a loss on both of these contracts even if all contract requirements had been ordered.id.at.the court noted that p laintiff has presented no evidence that,if capitalized and amortized,the engineering costs would have been sufficiently covered by the orders the court has found it entitled to,namely,the orders the government would have estimated had it accounted for unserviceable returns over the base year and the two executed contract years.id.thus,concluded the court,plaintiff has failed to prove that it is entitled to lost profits.id.consequently,was not awarded any lost profits.
finally,the court of federal claims addressed claim for g a costs.the dcaa audit agreed with estimate that its g a rate was percent.the court noted that did not incur any labor or material costs on the contracts for items that were not ordered.nor has it claimed overhead costs.id.therefore,reasoned the court,may only recover g a costs related to fixed overhead,which amounted to percent of the fixed overhead to which was entitled,or.id.the total damages award was thus,plus interest pursuant to from may.thus,the court awarded the fixed overhead and g a costs that it would have incurred during the base year and the first two option years if the government had ordered the quantity of spare parts that cecom would have estimated in the ifbs if it had properly prepared its estimates.following the denial of its request for reconsideration,timely appealed to this court.we have jurisdiction pursuant to a.
the sole issue before us is whether the court of federal claims erred in arriving at high shear damages award.we review a damages award by the court of federal claims for an abuse of discretion.hughes communications galaxy,united states.a court abuses its discretion when the court decision is clearly unreasonable,arbitrary or fanciful the decision is based upon an erroneous construction of the law the trial court factual findings are clearly erroneous or the record contains no evidence upon which the trial court could have rationally based its decision.air land forwarders,united states.
on appeal,argues that the decision of the court of federal claims in this case is contrary to applied,where we stated that an adjustment in contract price is the proper way for a contractor to recover damages for breach of a requirements contract resulting from negligently prepared government estimates.at.according to,the court of federal claims erred as a matter of law,and thus abused its discretion,by not following applied,but instead taking as the starting point for the damages award what the government would have estimated its contract requirements to be if it had not been negligent,fed.cl.at.contends that if its damages are calculated on the basis of an equitable adjustment,it will be entitled to a recovery in the amount of.
we do not agree with that the decision of the court of federal claims in this case is contrary to applied.in applied,the defense logistics agency dla entered into a requirements contract to purchase refrigerant storage cylinders from applied companies applied.there were two types of refrigerant for refrigerant and one for refrigerant.in its initial request for proposals rfp,dla estimated that it would require cylinders and cylinders.prior to the contract award,dla personnel realized that they had greatly overestimated the number of cylinders required.this information,however,was not communicated to applied or any of the other offerors.applied was awarded the contract.eventually,dla ordered only about ten percent of its estimated requirements before terminating the contract for convenience,apparently prior to delivery of any cylinders.applied,at.
applied came to us as an appeal by the government from a decision of the armed services board of contract appeals asbca or board.in its decision,the asbca held that the dla had breached its contract with applied by negligently failing to inform applied that the estimates in the rfp were inaccurate.id.at.the board also stated that,during quantum proceedings,applied could seek to recover the profits it anticipated making on the total number of cylinders that dla estimated in the rfp.id.we affirmed the board ruling on liability.in so doing,we held that to the extent that a government estimate is inadequately or negligently prepared,its inclusion without correction in a solicitation or contract constitutes a misrepresentation that,whether deliberate or unintentional,amounts to a breach of contract.id.at citing womack united states.liability was the only issue decided by the asbca.however,because the board observed in dictum that applied is entitled to be made whole,and here that includes anticipatory profits to the extent they can be proved,we examined the type of damages applied was entitled to recover.id.the board statement regarding quantum suggests that it is appropriate for us to provide guidance regarding the proper measure of applied recovery.citing.coast ry.united states.
we first noted the general rule that when there has been a breach of contract,the party is entitled to an award of damages that will place it in as good a position as it would have been had the breaching party fully performed.id.at quoting wells fargo bank,united states.we then stated that the logical starting point for a damages analysis is an understanding of the breaching party obligations under the contract.id.in that regard,we pointed out that a requirements contract calls for the government to fill all its actual requirements for specified supplies or services during the contract period by purchasing from the awardee,who agrees to provide them at the agreed price.id.quoting medart,austin.we then explained that where the government enters into a requirements contract,and has requirements under the contract,but does not use the contractor to satisfy those requirements and instead diverts business away from the contractor,the contract
