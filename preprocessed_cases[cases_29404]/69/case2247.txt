this appeal arises from a survival and wrongful death action brought by linda crist,executrix of the estate of irene and matthew harris,donald harris,william harris and kathy mcevoy plaintiffs.the are mary ann connor,and her professional association,van buren medical associates,connor and christiana care health services cchs.plaintiffs alleged that connor and cchs were negligent in the professional care provided to matthew harris during his stay at the hospital following hip surgery.a superior court jury found that both connor and cchs were negligent,that their negligence was a proximate cause of harris death,and awarded damages of million in favor of plaintiffs.the jury attributed percent of the fault to connor and percent of the fault to cchs.
on appeal,cchs argues that the trial court improperly allowed a line of questioning of plaintiffs expert witness,which tainted the testimony presented to the jury and prejudiced its defense.cchs also contends that connor counsel closing remarks referring to cchs expert witness credibility were also prejudicial.on,connor argues that cchs expert on causation gave an impermissible opinion on the standard of care that was never identified and confused the jury.we find no merit to these arguments.
on,plaintiffs argue that the trial judge erred as a matter of law in denying their request for prejudgment interest.prior to trial,plaintiffs made a settlement offer to connor and cchs for million each,which both parties rejected.the trial judge found that the combined settlement offer exceeded the million award of damages by the jury and denied prejudgment interest.we agree with plaintiffs that the trial judge erred in denying prejudgment interest under.d.an award of prejudgment interest was required because plaintiffs settlement offer to connor of million,and its separate settlement offer to cchs of million,were each for an amount less than the amount of the million judgment entered against them jointly and severally.we reverse the denial of plaintiffs motion for prejudgment interest and remand for further proceedings consistent with this opinion.
matthew harris was years old when he fell and fractured his hip on february.he was admitted to cchs hospital and,on february,asked for medication to help him sleep.at,the nurse called ying zhu,a member of connor medical practice group who was on call for connor.zhu prescribed mg of ambien,a sleep aide.the ambien was administered at approximately.at approximately,harris got out of bed and fell.hospital staff notified zhu of the fall.
connor evaluated harris at,and gave orders for his care,including a ct cat scan to rule out any cranial injury,including a subdural hematoma.connor ordered the ct scan routine at that time.this ct scan was placed by the unit clerk as ct head,with or without contrast at.around this time,harris family came in and explained to nurse godek that harris had had a similar problem in a previous hospital visit,and no ct scan was given.nurse godek took blood and notified connor of the results between and connor testified that because harris physical condition was dramatically different,she ordered a cat scan stat immediately.there is no written documentation that connor gave the nurse this order,and the nurse testified that she did not remember hearing it.a ct scan was eventually given to harris at.the scan revealed that he had a subdural hematoma and needed emergency surgery to remove the clot.the surgery was performed,but harris remained comatose after the surgery and died in the hospital ten days later.
as framed by plaintiffs,the allegations of medical negligence were zhu should have only prescribed mg of ambien because of harris age the nurse who administered the ambien should not have done so because the chart did not indicate that he had difficulty sleeping and connor should have ordered a stat ct scan,or,if she did order it,it should have been in writing as required by hospital policy and the standard of care.experts testified on all of these issues.the jury found connor and cchs individually negligent,jointly and severally in a manner proximately causing matthew harris death and awarded damages of million because defendants were allegedly joint tortfeasors with a right of contribution the jury was asked to apportion fault.the jury found connor to be percent at fault and cchs to be percent at fault.the superior court denied defendants motions for a new trial and plaintiffs motion for prejudgment interest.this appeal followed.
ii.discussion 
a.the leading questions 
cchs argues that plaintiffs attorney led his expert witnesses improperly throughout his direct examinations.cchs objected several times and was eventually granted a continuing objection on this point.the trial judge overruled the objections,stating that the witnesses were experts.he later explained that the questions were not leading or barely leading and that experts are less likely to give an answer suggested by an attorney.
a trial judge has discretion to exercise reasonable control over the mode and order of the interrogation of witnesses.this court reviews trial management decisions for an abuse of discretion an abuse of discretion occurs when a court has exceeded the bounds of reason in view of the circumstances,or so ignored recognized rules of law or practice so as to produce injustice.it is that a trial judge is responsible for management of the trial and is vested with broad discretion to perform that function.
a trial judge has broad discretion in allowing leading questions of a witness,including during the direct examination c provides the boundaries of this discretion leading questions should not be used on the direct examination of a witness except as may be necessary to develop his testimony.the rule proscribing leading questions on direct examination is grounded in the principle that the most important peculiarity of the interrogational system is that it may be misused by suggestive questions to supply a false memory for the is,to suggest desired answers not in truth based upon a real recollection.
while the rule vests the trial judge with broad discretion to permit leading questions on direct examination,the record does not show that any party asked for the blanket ruling which the trial judge made in this case.nor does the record show that the trial judge determined that leading questions were necessary to develop each witness testimony as required by c.even though the trial judge did not apply c for each witness,cchs has not demonstrated that the questions suggested false memories for any witness.to the contrary,it appears that even if some questions were leading,the experts testified in accordance with their own disclosures.accordingly,we conclude that the trial judge error was harmless.
counsel remarks during closing 
cchs next argues that the trial judge abused his discretion by failing to correct connor counsel comments about the truth during closing arguments.the issue was preserved through cchs motion for a new trial.we review a trial court refusal to grant a new trial based on improper comment of counsel for abuse of discretion to establish abuse of discretion the appellants must show that the improper comment was significantly prejudicial so as to deny them a fair trial.
cchs argues that connor counsel closing comments were improper and focuses on three statements italicized 
now,i want to talk about cogen.i going to say a few things about cogen,that quite frankly,are complimentary.it not something that i,who represents doctors regularly,enjoy doing.it not something,quite frankly,that my client enjoys having me do.but he was here yesterday and what he basically did,although he did come out and say it,he told you you ca believe connor.
now,the role of the jury is credibility.i do dispute everything zappa says.but he did say one thing which i absolutely agree with.i even wrote it down.credibility should not be for any witness to tell you who was telling the truth.no witness should tell you who was telling you the truth.he right.that your role.that is your role and your role alone.
now,his presentation was shrouded in the concept,well,he a record revi
