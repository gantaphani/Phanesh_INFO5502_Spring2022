since the early,private pilot organizations have operated throughout the united states,arranging for volunteer pilots to transport needy patients and donated organs to hospitals around the country.historically,many of these organizations have used the service mark angel flight to promote their services and solicit donations.
in,a number of private pilot organizations banded together to form a national association known as angel flight america afa.the new association divided the country into territorial zones,authorizing its members to operate in designated geographical regions using the angel flight mark.for reasons that are unclear,several longstanding angel flight organizations,including angel flight georgia afga,did not become members of afa.nevertheless,these organizations continued operating in their home territories using the angel flight mark.
when afa member angel flight southeast afse established offices in georgia and began soliciting donations in areas where afga had traditionally operated,afga sued afa and afse for common law trademark infringement and various related violations of state and federal law.afa counterclaimed for infringement of its united states trademark the angel flight mark and other related claims.
following a bench trial,the district court found in favor of afga on all claims and later issued a permanent injunction prohibiting afa and its members from using the angel flight mark in georgia,alabama,mississippi,tennessee,north carolina,and south carolina for the purpose of soliciting donations,advertising or promoting their services,or recruiting volunteers.
history of angel flight 
in,jack welsh,a pilot living in california,formed an organization called the american medical flight support team amfst.the organization consisted of volunteer pilots who agreed to provide free transportation for donated organs and medical patients to ensure the timely receipt of needed medical services.chapters of the new organization sprang up across the country.many of these chapters eventually adopted the name angel flight as their service mark.over time,the chapters lost their connection to the original organization,but they continued their mission of providing free air transportation for medical services.the organizations continued to use the angel flight mark.
in,an amfst chapter was formed in georgia.it later took the name angel flight of georgia afga.the organization was the first group east of the rocky mountains to use the name angel flight and the first group to use the mark in each of the six states in which it operates georgia,alabama,south carolina,mississippi,north carolina,and tennessee.afga used the angel flight mark continuously from the onward.
in,an amfst chapter formed in florida.this group later became known as afse.the organization operated primarily within the state of florida,but made periodic handoffs in the afga territory.for several years during the,afga contracted with afse to coordinate afga flights the arrangement ended in.at some point during the,afse and afga considered merging,but failed to do so.
in,a number of regional angel flight organizations came together to form afa.although many regional angel flight organizations joined the association,several did not.among those was afga.members of the organization divided the country into geographic regions,with each accepting responsibility for a region.
before joining afa,afse served florida patients and medical facilities,transporting patients and organs into and out of the state of florida.after joining afa,afse began operating in florida,georgia,mississippi,alabama,and south carolina.afse also began recruiting donors and promoting its services at trade shows and to medical facilities within afga territory.
in,afga became aware of afse plans to open an office in augusta,georgia.on may,after afga allegedly learned donors and the news media were confusing the two organizations,afga wrote to afse,asking it to stop promoting its services under the angel flight mark in georgia,alabama,south carolina,mississippi,north carolina,and tennessee.when afse refused to do so,afga filed suit.
b.the registered mark 
sometime in the early,an amsft chapter in las vegas,nevada,developed a mark that combined the words the angel flight with a winged caduceus.during the same period of time,a los amsft chapter later known as angel flight west began using the same mark,with permission from the las vegas chapter.when the las vegas group later became defunct,angel flight west continued to use the mark,which it modified slightly by altering the design of the wings and adding a stylized type to the words angel flight.
in,after confirming the las vegas organization was no longer in existence,angel flight west applied for registration of the modified mark.the registration application was completed by dennis torres,of angel flight west.on the application,torres listed a first use date of november.that date preceded the creation of the modified logo by more than three years.
in the same trademark application,torres represented that angel flight west was the owner of the mark and,to the best of his knowledge and belief,no other person,firm,corporation,or association had the right to use the mark in commerce,either in an identical form or a near resemblance such as would be likely to cause confusion or mistake or deceive.despite this representation,at the time the registration application was completed,other organizations were using the name angel flight or the angel flight in connection with volunteer pilot efforts in other states.some of these groups were in contact with angel flight west.
on june,the patent and trademark office issued trademark to angel flight west for the following combination of words and symbols 
in may,angel flight west assigned the registered mark to the afa.in turn,afa licensed the mark to its affiliated member organizations.
proceedings in the district court 
on november,afga filed suit against afse alleging afse had engaged in false designation of origin and false advertising under the lanham act and common law trademark infringement,unfair competition,deceptive trade practices,and other related state law claims.when afa intervened in the lawsuit six months later,afa and afse raised counterclaims mirroring those brought against them by afga.
in july,the district court conducted a bench trial.afterward,the court issued a opinion,adopting with slight modification the facts and legal conclusions propounded by afga.the district court ruled in afga favor on all its claims,and against afa and afse on each of their counterclaims.the court determined angel flight west had committed fraud on the patent and trademark office by falsifying information on its application for trademark registration,including the date of first use and its knowledge of others right to use the mark in an identical or nearly identical fashion.four months later,the court entered a permanent injunction,enjoining defendant afa and its members from using the angel flight mark in georgia,alabama,mississippi,tennessee,north carolina,or south carolina for the purpose of soliciting donations,advertising,promoting their services,or recruiting volunteers.at the same time,the court cancelled trademark.
ii.discussion 
afa and afse raise four issues on appeal.they contend the district court erred by relying on hearsay testimony to find their use of the angel flight mark in afga territory resulted in actual confusion,and thus constituted infringement refusing to apply the doctrine of laches or acquiescence to bar afga enforcement of its common law rights in the mark crafting an overly broad,draconian injunction and canceling united states trademark on the ground angel flight west procured it fraudulently.
infringement 
following trial,the district court found afga was the senior user of the angel flight mark in the relevant geographical finding appellants do not challenge on appeal.as the senior user of the mark,afga had the right to use the mark in its territory and to enjoin others from doing so in a manner likely to cause confusion.see custom eng g,midway,cir t he touchstone of liability in a trademark infringement action is not simply whether there is unauthorized use of a protected mark,but whether such use is likely to cause consumer confusion.jellibeans,skating clubs of,cir noting test for service mark infringement has been expressed as whether or not the offending mark is likely to cause confusion 
in its order following trial,the district court provided two reasons for concluding afa and afse had infringed afga common law rights.first,the court found consumer confusion was likely given the manner in which afse used the mark in the relevant territory.second,the court found afse use of the mark had resulted in the actual confusion of hospital employees and donors on more than occasions.
afa and afse object strongly to the evidentiary basis for the incidents of actual confusion referred to in the district court order,contending it was inadmissible hearsay.no confused donors or medical personnel testified at trial rather,two afga employees testified regarding the content of conversations they allegedly had with donors and medical personnel,in which the donors reported misdirecting donations and the medical professionals reported problems with medical transportation.in all cases,third parties allegedly confused afga with afse,and.
during trial,the district court received the evidence under,the hearsay exception permitting receipt of out of court statements for the purpose of showing the declarant confused state of mind.in its opinion,however,the district court recounted as fact the stories of actual confusion relayed by afga employees.by finding the incidents described to the employees by the out of court declarants had actually taken place,the court used the statements as evidence of the truth of the matters classic hearsay purpose.c.
what afa and afse overlook,however,is that although the evidence of actual confusion occupied a large portion of the district court opinion,it was largely superfluous to the court ultimate finding of infringement.again,it is essential to remember infringement turns on whether a likelihood of confusion exists.jellibeans,at.to determine whether it does,georgia courts examine many factors,including the strength or distinctiveness of the trademark at issue similarity or overall impression created by the designs similarity of product identity of retail outlets and purchasers identity of advertising media used defendant intent and actual confusion.ackerman sec,design sec,citing ambrit,kraft,cir.the best evidence,of course,is proof of actual confusion,but such evidence is not essential to a common law infringement claim.id.
to prove infringement,afga was not required to show consumers were actually confused,but rather that consumer confusion was likely to result from the manner in which afse used the mark in the relevant territory.even if the evidence of actual confusion were excluded,there remains ample evidence to support the district court finding that confusion was likely.as the court explained 
t he angel flight word mark used by defendants afa and afse in the territory is identical to that used by afga in the territory for over twenty years.afse,afa and afga all use the mark angel flight in conjunction with identical services,public benefit flying.moreover,afse,afa,and afga also target the same,patients,hospitals and conjunction with these identical services,and have identical advertising,television and fundraisers.
dist.order at.in addition,the district court found appellants had intentionally exploited the goodwill associated with afga mark by opening a new office in atlanta during the course of litigation and had reached out to established afga donors to insert itself into afga relationships with those donors.id.at.in short,afga,afa and afse used the same mark in the same territory directed to the same entities by the same means.the risk of confusion was therefore,the district court did not err by concluding consumers were likely to be confused by the concurrent use of the angel flight mark in the same territory by both afse and afga and that afse therefore infringed afga common law trademark rights.
laches and acquiescence 
when the district court has weighed the proper factors in determining whether a defendant has proven the elements of a laches defense,we review the district court decision for abuse of discretion.see ambrit,at.the same standard applies to review of a decision regarding the defense of acquiescence.coach house,coach six,cir.
to prove the affirmative defense of laches under georgia law,a defendant must show it would be inequitable to allow the plaintiff to enforce his legal rights.whiten murray.whether laches should apply depends on a consideration of the particular circumstances,including the length of the delay in the claimant assertion of rights,the sufficiency of the excuse for the delay,the loss of evidence on disputed matters,and the opportunity for the claimant to have acted sooner id.in the context of trademark infringement,a defendant invoking laches typically must show the plaintiff inexcusably delayed in enforcing its trademark rights,thereby causing the defendant undue prejudice.citibank,citibanc group,cir.
the defense of acquiescence requires proof of three elements the plaintiff actively represented it would not assert a right or claim the delay between the active representation and assertion of the right or claim was not excusable and the delay caused the defendant undue prejudice.coach house,at.the difference between acquiescence and laches is that laches denotes passive consent and acquiescence denotes active consent.id.
appellants argue strenuously the district court erred when it concluded they had not met their burden of proving the affirmative defenses of laches and acquiescence.they focus particularly on the court finding that afga did not unreasonably delay before bringing its lawsuit,offering many reasons why they believe their position was correct.they do not,however,provide any reason why this court should find,as a matter of law,the district court abused its discretion by crediting afga evidence rather than their own.
after hearing the evidence,the district court found afse use of the mark had been limited within the territory until shortly after afa was formed.the court also found that before afse only use of the mark within the territory related to flying patients and organs in and out of the area.after,afse opened branch offices in the territory and began soliciting donations and promoting its services.
under the doctrine of progressive encroachment,delay is to be measured from the time at which the plaintiff knows or should know she has a provable claim for infringement.kason,component hardware group,cir see also thomas mccarthy,mccarthy on trademarks and unfair competition ed.the senior user has no obligation to sue until the likelihood of confusion looms large.the district court found afse change of tack in justified the timing of afga lawsuit.that finding was supported by the evidence and was not an abuse of discretion.
furthermore,even if afa and afse had proven their affirmative defenses,afga would still be entitled to a permanent injunction because the court found that the concurrent use of the angel flight mark by afse and afga had caused and would continue to cause confusion among members of the public.as the district court explained 
laches and acquiesence are inapplicable to the facts of this case because the public is confused,and afa and afse admit as much.laches or acquiesence do not preclude the court issuance of an injunction to prevent further acts of trademark confusion by afa and afse.even in cases where these defenses bar a suit for damages due to inequity to the infringer,the court may still grant injunctive relief to avoid putting a judicial stamp of approval on conduct which will confuse consumer.
id.at quoting thomas mccarthy,mccarthy on trademarks and unfair competition ed.when inevitable confusion occurs in the marketplace due to unrestricted dual use of a trademark,the paramount value of the public interest demands some adjustment to the status quo,even in cases involving acquiesence.sunamerica sun life assur.of canada,ci
