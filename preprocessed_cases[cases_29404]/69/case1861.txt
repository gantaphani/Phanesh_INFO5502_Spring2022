appellant was directed to pay restitution after being adjudged a person described in section of the welfare and institutions code.on appeal he contends that the restitution order was erroneous in several respects.we sustain some of his objections and reject others.we will therefore affirm the order with modifications.
background 
the juvenile court sustained a petition under welfare and institutions code section alleging that appellant committed assault by means of force likely to produce great bodily injury and producing great bodily injury,subd.a,subd.a and battery with serious bodily injury,subd.d.in a previous appeal,we affirmed that order with modifications.in re k,wl nonpub.opn.the facts surrounding the assault are adequately set forth in that opinion,and not pertinent here.the essential fact for present purposes is that in the course of the assault,the victim,gregory rangel,suffered a broken finger.
after the court sustained the petition,and while the appeal was pending,the probation officer submitted a report recommending that the court order restitution to rangel in the amount of.the report was accompanied by a letter from the victim,to which were attached certain documents concerning medical services valued at about,lost time from work,and other claimed costs.
on march,the court conducted a restitution hearing.among those present were the minor,his attorney,and his mother.early in the hearing the prosecutor asked the court to amend the request by deducting from the total requested for rangel and directing payment of that sum to the victims restitution fund instead.defense counsel then addressed the request on the merits,opening with the observation that he was new to this case he expressed our belief and a lay belief but i think a reasonable reading that the medical procedure used in this particular instance was clearly an over treatment for a broken finger.such things occur and are commonplace daily on school grounds and in sports arenas,and are generally a fairly simple procedure of adding a splint.this seemed to be well in excess of anything that reasonable.so we would simply make that objection,and again in our reading and realizing that we are not bringing experts in at this point to contest it,simply alerting to the court of our concerns in this particular matter.and we would submit it on the medical records as are in the court file.counsel went on,however,to express the desire to subpoena some further medical records,particularly specifically that were not provided for or obtained in the trial,and asked the court to set a compliance date a few weeks out in order to accommodate that request.he added,whether or not the appellate attorney is entitled to those or they have to jump through some other hoop to get them,that we deal with that or cross that bridge when we get there,but that we simply have a date that the medical facility can respond to our subpoena.
the court then told appellant mother that she would be responsible for any restitution ordered,and after acknowledging that she was having trouble talking,gave her an opportunity to address the court if you can.she replied,i would just like to say that is a lot of money to be paying out,and in regards to how the trial went and the outcome of the trial and the information that should have been submitted,that was and i have requested it,i think that it needs to have more of an evaluation.i worked in the medical field.i worked in orthopedics,and i think we need to go through the appeals part of it before,i asking you to if you could wait until the appeal is over before this account is set up.i on a fixed income and disabled.i on a fixed income and disabled,so i asking for time to have this case really evaluated,which it was did go through that process.and i requested of the lawyer several times and it was just like my voice was fallen on deaf ears,and maybe we would be here at this point.and like i said,i worked with orthopedic doctors,and even though the medical records was written forms was submitted also,the film should have been part of the evidence also,and should have been read,and that was.because what you see on films and what on the paper is two different things.if my son is going to be been charged and convicted with this offense,and it all i asking for you to sustain and wait till the appeals process.
the court viewed these comments as a request for a stay of restitution proceedings pending appeal,which it denied.it then proceeded to set restitution in the amount of dollars and cents for gregory rangel,and dollars to the victim compensation fund.it declined to set a delayed compliance date,stating that if appellate counsel wished some relief in this regard,he or she is going to have to approach the court it scheduled a restitution review for september.
this timely appeal followed.
discussion 
governing statute 
appellant asserts that several elements of the restitution order were not supported by any evidence showing them to be compensable under the restitution statute.the order was made under welfare and institutions code section,the declared purpose of which is to ensure that a victim of conduct for which a minor is found to be a person described in section who incurs any economic loss as a result of the minor conduct shall receive restitution directly from that minor,subd.a.the statute directs that the court in such a case shall order the minor to pay b restitution to the victim or victims,if any,in accordance with subdivision h,subd.a.it goes on to provide,in pertinent part,restitution shall be imposed in the amount of the losses,as determined.if the amount of loss can not be ascertained at the time of sentencing,the restitution order shall include a provision that the amount shall be determined at the direction of the court at any time during the term of the commitment or probation.the court shall order full restitution unless it finds compelling and extraordinary reasons for not doing so,and states them on the record.a minor inability to pay shall not be considered a compelling or extraordinary reason not to impose a restitution order,nor shall inability to pay be a consideration in determining the amount of the restitution order.a restitution order shall be of a dollar amount sufficient to fully reimburse the victim or victims for all determined economic losses incurred as the result of the minor conduct for which the minor was found to be a person described in section,including all of the following medical expenses.wages or profits lost due to injury incurred by the victim wages or profits lost by the victim due to time spent as a witness or in assisting the police or prosecution,subd.h,italics added.
the statute grants the minor the right to a hearing before a judge to dispute the determination of the amount of restitution,and empowers the court to modify an order after it is made,subd.h.it also permits the court,w hen the amount of victim restitution is not known at the time of disposition,to declare that the amount will be determined later.ibid.it declares that the order shall identify the losses to which it pertains,and shall be enforceable as a civil judgment,subd.i.
ii.preservation of objection 
respondent contends that appellant challenges to the restitution order have not been preserved for appeal.but the gist of the challenges is that certain components of the restitution order are not shown by substantial evidence to come within the terms of the governing statute.sufficiency of the evidence has always been viewed as a question necessarily and inherently raised in every contested trial of any issue of fact,and requiring no further steps by the aggrieved party to be preserved for appeal.see people viray th,d eisenberg,et,cal.practice guide civil appeals and writs the rutter group,cal,appellate review.this view has been repeatedly adopted in appeals from juvenile court orders.see in re gregory th,d,and cases cited.
respondent implicit assertion of a contrary rule appears to rest entirely on people brasure cal th,d,brasure.that was a capital murder case in which the court dealt with at least a dozen major contentions before reaching the one relevant here,which was that a restitution order in favor of the victim mother was inappropriate because of evidence not introduced at trial that she had sought a restraining order against her son and because her economic loss was not shown by documentation or sworn testimony.ibid.the court held that by his failure to object,defendant forfeited any claim that the order was merely unwarranted by the evidence,as distinct from being unauthorized by statute.people smith cal th,d,smith,ibid.
respondent apparently reads brasure as a repudiation or abandonment of the rule noted above,that no predicate objection is required to challenge the sufficiency of the evidence on appeal.we can not join in this reading.the supreme court itself explicitly reaffirmed the stated rule in people butler cal th,d.nor is a contrary rule suggested by smith,supra,at page,d,the one decision cited on this point in brasure,supra,cal th at page,d.the court in smith listed a number of decisions imposing a forfeiture of objections going to defects of form or procedure,such as a failure to state reasons for a sentence choice or to make a required finding.people smith,supra,cal th at,d.it did not purport to hold that a party may similarly forfeit an objection to the sufficiency of the evidence.brasure can not be understood to have adopted such a rule.
we find no waiver of defendant points.
iii.standard of review 
generally speaking,restitution awards are vested in the trial court discretion and will be disturbed on appeal only where an abuse of discretion appears.people fortune th,d.like most generalizations,however,this one can lead to errors if not applied with circumspection.no court has discretion to make an order not authorized by law,or to find facts for which there is not substantial evidence.a reviewing court will generally examine an issue of law independently of a lower tribunal ruling see yield dynamics,tea systems th,d we will not defer to a trial court determination on a question of law.its determination on an issue of fact is reviewed under the substantial evidence standard.see people jones th,d.the standard of review therefore depends on the nature of the question presented.
here,as we have said,the gist of defendant argument is that the evidence before the trial court was insufficient to establish the statutory conditions for an award of restitution for medical expenses in the amounts stated.this contention necessarily implies two component questions the nature and meaning of the statutory conditions for an award,and the sufficiency of the evidence to establish those conditions.the former is a question of law,which we will consider without deference to the trial court action.the latter we will review with the usual deference to the court resolution of any factual issues tendered.
iv.medical costs 
defendant notes that the statute has been construed to permit reimbursement only for demonstrated actual loss to the victim.in re anthony th,d anthony.he contends that the materials submitted below failed to show that the victim had sustained actual loss on account of medical treatment necessitated by the assault.his challenge focuses on two amounts that were included in the restitution order associated with services rendered by kaiser,and associated with kaiser ambulance service.he complains that these claims were based on statements of benefits generated by the hospital and ambulance company,not on evidence of payment to the hospital or the ambulance company or even on invoices to rangel.the tendered documents,he contends,do not demonstrate actual loss on rangel part,or even that he had been billed for any particular figure,much less that he actually paid for medical treatment.italics in original.
appellant cites anthony,supra,th,d,where the court reversed an order to pay restitution of over million dollars based on services rendered by a medical provider.the rationale for that decision,however,has no application here.the key fact was that the provider had sought payment from this had the effect of precluding the provider from seeking payment from the victim for any unpaid balance other than the nominal deductible or cost sharing amount.id.at,d,citing welf,code,subd.d,subd.a olszewski scripps health cal th,d.in those circumstances,the court held,the victim losses were limited to the sums paid by.see id.at,d.since had not yet made final payment,the proper amount of restitution could not have been ascertained at the time of the order,and the trial court should have postponed a determination of that issue.ibid.
anthony is best understood as resting on the conclusion that because the service provider was barred from recovering the cost of services from the victim,the victim could not be found to have incurred those costs for purposes of a criminal restitution order.see,subd.h order shall fully reimburse the victim for all determined economic losses incurred as the result of the minor conduct.nothing in the present record suggests a similar bar to recovery against the victim.to incur is to become liable or subject to bring down upon oneself.webster collegiate dict.to constitute evidence of a loss incurred,there must be some basis to conclude that the victim is liable or subject to a charge.where collection of the charge is barred by law,the victim is not liable or subject to it,and the charge is not incurred.this rationale has no application here,where no such legal bar to recovery appears.
however,appellant does touch on a vulnerability in the order before us when he asserts that the two challenged documents do not demonstrate actual loss to the victim,or even that he had been billed for any particular figure.this raises the question whether these documents constituted substantial evidence that the sums they recited reflected charges incurred by the victim in the sense we have just stated.one of the documents satisfies this test,but the other does not.
the first document is a letter from healthcare recoveries in louisville,kentucky,stating,kaiser california north is using the services of healthcare recoveries to obtain reimbursement of the medical benefits it has provided on your behalf relating to your accident.the purpose of this letter is to serve as the health plan formal notice to you that in the event you receive settlement from an insurance carrier or other party,the plan may have a right of reimbursement for medical benefits provided.for your convenience,we have enclosed a consolidated statement of benefits with the total provided benefits to date.the enclosed statement consisted largely of a table listing medical services and materials furnished to rangel,with columns labeled billed amt.and provided benefits.the two columns contained identical numbers for each service provided.above the table was the text,instructions if remitting payment,make checks payable to healthcare recoveries.write the patient name,gregory rangel,and event number specified,on the check.at the end of the statement appeared the following sums total billed charges,total benefits provided amount received and balance due.
on its face this document reflects billed charges the specified amount.it therefore constitutes substantial evidence that these charges were incurred by the victim.assuming it was not itself a bill,as defendant asserts,it was nonetheless evidence of billing.it could be reasonably viewed by the trial court as evidence that the victim had been billed for the amount stated.
we acknowledge some uncertainty arising from the status of kaiser hospitals as a health maintenance organization providing medical services to its members rather than a medical service provider with a conventional relationship to its patients.apart from the described records,however,the present record is entirely silent on this subject.we are therefore left with the uncontested recital in the quoted document that the victim was billed for the stated amount.this makes it unnecessary,and indeed impossible,to consider the effect on criminal restitution of a victim having received treatments for which he in fact was not billed 
the other document challenged by appellant is an explanation of benefits from kaiser
