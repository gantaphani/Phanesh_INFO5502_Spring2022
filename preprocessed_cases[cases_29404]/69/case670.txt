background 
debtor united producers,united producers is an agricultural cooperative that provides financing to farmers through its subsidiary producers credit pcc.creditors curreys of nebraska,gerald eggerling,james eggerling,marcella eggerling,nancy eggerling,eggerling farms,cattle,harry hayes,diane kuchta,rick kuchta,kuchta farms,randy oertwich,producers livestock credit corp,and r l financial,creditors are former investors in united producers.united producers and pcc filed for chapter bankruptcy relief on april,after creditors were awarded over million in damages for united producers breach of contract,fraud,conversion and packers and stockyards act violations regarding cattle marketing.united producers and pcc created a joint amended plan of reorganization that provided for the cancellation of ownership interests and the issuance of new interests and stock after the plan confirmation.under the reorganization plan,creditors would receive only a fraction of the judgments owed to them by united producers and pcc.one of creditors central objections to the plan was that it left management in place despite management misconduct.creditors claimed that this plan provision did not protect the interest of creditors and equity security holders and was against public policy.creditors also claimed that the plan was not proposed in good faith.
the bankruptcy court held a confirmation hearing on september and.on september,the court entered an order finding that the amended plan met all the confirmation standards of the bankruptcy code and directing the submission of a separate confirmation order.the court subsequently confirmed the amended plan on october.creditors timely appealed the september and october,orders to the bankruptcy appellate panel of the sixth circuit but did not seek a stay of the confirmation order.
on november,united producers and pcc filed a motion to dismiss creditors appeal as equitably moot because the plan of reorganization had been substantially consummated and the relief sought on appeal would be detrimental to third parties not before the court and to the success of the plan.the motion was accompanied by a memorandum of law and the affidavit of dennis bolling,president and chief executive officer of both united producers and pcc,describing the transactions of the companies.because creditors disputed the evidence contained in the affidavit,the bankruptcy appellate panel remanded the matter to the bankruptcy court to determine whether the plan had been substantially consummated and the extent to which third parties relied upon the confirmed plan.
the bankruptcy court oversaw discovery and conducted an evidentiary hearing on june,at which dennis bolling was the only witness.at the hearing creditors conceded that the plan was substantially consummated.based upon the evidence presented,the bankruptcy court issued supplemental findings of fact and conclusions of law regarding substantial consummation and reliance upon the confirmed plan.the bankruptcy court found that the plan was substantially consummated and that innocent third parties would be adversely affected if the plan were to be vacated due to creditors appeal.in support of these conclusions,the bankruptcy court listed thirty findings of fact detailing the extent to which the reorganization had progressed and the possible consequences of the plan vacation for third parties.
following remand the bankruptcy appellate panel granted united producer and pcc motion to dismiss the appeal as equitably moot.relying upon the bankruptcy court findings of fact,the bankruptcy appellate panel concluded that the appeal should be dismissed as equitably moot because the plan had been substantially consummated and vacating the plan as a result of a successful appeal would harm innocent third parties who relied upon the confirmed plan.creditors filed a timely appeal from the bankruptcy appellate panel october,judgment.
discussion 
standard of review 
this court independently reviews a decision of the bankruptcy court that has been appealed to the bankruptcy appellate panel.tidewater finance curry in re curry,cir.the bankruptcy court findings of fact are reviewed for clear error,while its conclusions of law are reviewed de novo.behlke eisen in re behlke,cir.while these general principles regarding review of bankruptcy court decisions are well established,the parties disagree regarding the standard of review to be applied to the bankruptcy appellate panel equitable mootness determination.
as with many aspects of the equitable mootness inquiry,the case law is sparse regarding the standard of review to be applied.the third circuit reviews equitable mootness decisions under an abuse of discretion standard because such a decision involves a discretionary balancing of equitable and prudential factors rather than the limits of the federal courts authority under article iii.in re continental airlines,cir such review of equitable mootness determinations is consistent with the standard of review applied to other equitable determinations made by lower courts.see in re behlke,at t he bankruptcy court equitable determinations are reviewed for an abuse of discretion.citation omitted.however,the dissent in in re continental airlines espoused the opposite view,arguing that a district court equitable mootness determination should be reviewed de novo because the district court acts as an appellate court in bankruptcy cases.in re continental airlines,at alito,dissenting.such a standard of review would be appropriate because the court of appeals is in just as good a position to make this determination as was the district court.id.
the standard of review for equitable mootness decisions proposed by the dissent in continental airlines is more consistent with this circuit precedent than is the continental airlines majority position.although only clearly setting forth a de novo standard of review for equitable mootness determinations in an unpublished case,unofficial committee of,in re eagle picher,wl,at cir unpublished table decision,this court has reviewed determinations of equitable mootness de novo.see,bank of montreal official comm.of unsecured creditors in re american homepatient,cir.such a standard of review is consistent with this court plenary review of the decisions of a lower court exercising its appellate jurisdiction.see in re big rivers,cir noting that review for abuse of discretion is appropriate when a district court is exercising its original jurisdiction and not when it is exercising its appellate jurisdiction over a bankruptcy case.see also united states gwi pcs in re gwi pcs,cir holding that a district court dismissal of an appeal as equitably moot is reviewed de novo first union real estate equity mortgage invs.club assocs.in re club assocs,cir reviewing de novo equitable mootness determination by a district court.as a result,we review the bankruptcy appellate panel equitable mootness determination de novo.
the equitable mootness doctrine is applied in appeals from bankruptcy confirmations in order to protect parties relying upon the successful confirmation of a bankruptcy plan from a drastic change after appeal.city of covington covington landing,cir a plan of reorganization,once implemented,should be disturbed only for compelling reasons.unlike mootness in the constitutional sense,equitable mootness does not follow from article iii standing principles but is an equitable doctrine applied to protect parties settled expectations and the ability of a debtor to emerge from bankruptcy.united steelworkers ormet in re ormet,wl,at.see mac panel virginia panel,cir t he doctrine of equitable mootness is a pragmatic principle,grounded in the notion that,with the passage of time after a judgment in equity and implementation of that judgment,effective relief on appeal becomes impractical,imprudent,and therefore inequitable.although bankruptcy courts have always had broad equitable powers,the equitable mootness doctrine has only been formally recognized within the last twenty years.in re american homepatient,at discussing sixth circuit cases that have applied the equitable mootness doctrine.
issues relating to equitable mootness have rarely been decided in the sixth circuit.early cases treated equitable mootness similarly to traditional article iii mootness despite incorporating some equitable factors.in re eagle picher,wl discussing equitable mootness in context of constitutional mootness bennett veale,cir same.the leading sixth circuit case on equitable mootness issues is in re american homepatient in which we adopted the fifth circuit test for determining whether an appeal from the confirmation of a bankruptcy plan should be dismissed as equitably moot.in re american homepatient,at.in making this determination,a court must weigh three factors whether a stay has been obtained whether the plan has been substantially consummated and whether the relief requested would affect either the rights of parties not before the court or the success of the plan.city of covington,at citing manges bank in re manges,cir.
existence of a stay 
when an appellant does not obtain a stay of the implementation of a confirmation plan,the debtor will normally implement the plan and reliance interests will be created.thus,the failure to obtain a stay will count against the appellant in determining whether an appeal should be denied on equitable mootness grounds.in re manges,at.the failure to seek a stay,however,is not necessarily fatal to the appellant ability to proceed.city of covington,at.
it is undisputed that creditors did not seek a stay in this case.although creditors attribute this omission to their poverty which was caused by debtor actions,the reason for the absence of a stay is immaterial to the equitable mootness analysis.as we have stated,a stay not sought,and a stay sought and denied,lead equally to the implementation of the plan of reorganization.and it is the reliance interests engendered by the plan,coupled with the difficulty of reversing the critical transactions,that counsels against attempts to unwind things on appeal.city of covington,at quoting in re unr,cir.thus,creditors failure to seek a stay weighs in favor of debtors.
substantial consummation 
substantial consummation is a statutory term used to determine whether a bankruptcy court may modify or amend a reorganization plan.the proponent of a plan or the reorganized debtor may modify such plan at any time after confirmation of such plan and before substantial consummation of such plan.the bankruptcy code defines substantial consummation as 
a transfer of all or substantially all of the property proposed by the plan to be transferred b assumption by the debtor or by the successor to the debtor under the plan of the business or of the management of all or substantially all of the property dealt with by the plan and c commencement of distribution under the plan.
this standard has been adopted in the equitable mootness analysis to determine the extent to which the plan has progressed.in re manges,at.if a plan has been substantially consummated there is a greater likelihood that overturning the confirmation plan will have adverse effects on the success of the plan and on third parties.
although creditors did not dispute the fact that the plan has been substantially consummated at the bankruptcy appellate panel,they qualify their concession before this court by contending that the plan can only be deemed substantially consummated because debtor continues as it did and that the deficient plan requires no more than maintenance of the status quo creditors arguments,which are more relevant to the merits of their claim than to the equitable mootness determination,are forestalled by the factual findings of the bankruptcy court.as the bankruptcy appellate panel summarized,the bankruptcy court found that debtor had taken numerous steps to effectuate the reorganization plan 
these actions include the termination and issuance of new membership interests in upi the collection by upi of in new membership fees and in new per unit retains the liquidation and dissolution of the related entity uphc,llc,which permitted the transfer to upi of parcels of real property and capital stock the cancellation of shares of pcc preferred stock held by southern states cooperative,the closing and funding of exit financing of cobank in the amount of million,secured by upi new stock in pcc and various mortgages,permitting the appellees to pay off the loan and fund plan distributions the settlement of a million claim against the appellees and final distribution on that claim plan distribution to priority and general unsecured creditors which represented the distribution of approximately all of the remaining balance in the pool established to pay claims and the sale by upi of its west plains,missouri facility.
internal quotations and alterations omitted.no evidence has been presented that these findings are clearly erroneous creditors conclusory allegations that debtor would have taken the same actions absent the confirmed reorganization plan are unsupported by any evidence in the record.
as creditors have previously conceded,debtor actions demonstrate that the plan is substantially consummated.thus,this factor weighs in favor of debtor.
rights of third parties and success of the plan 
even when a plan has been substantially consummated,it is not necessarily impossible or inequitable for an appellate court to grant effective relief.manges,at.the most important factor this court must consider is whether the relief requested would affect either the rights of parties not before the court or the success of the plan.in re american homepatient,at.determinations of mootness require a judgment regarding,the feasibility or futility of effective relief should a litigant prevail.in re aov.
as part of our analysis of the feasibility of granting relief,this court considers the nature of the relief requested and whether it amounts to a piecemeal revision of the plan or a wholesale rewriting of it.in re manges.at we must evaluate actions taken pursuant to the plan,many of which appear irreversible,against the backdrop of the relief less than a wholesale annihilation of the plan.in guardian savings loan association arbors of houston associates in re arbors of houston associates,wl cir unpublished table decision,we held that equitable mootness did not apply where the creditor contested the interpretation of a provision of a reorganization plan.we found that the adoption of the creditor interpretation would not substantially upset the plan of reorganization itself.the refinancing would go through and no other term of the reorganization would be affected.in re arbors of houston,wl,at.we have also declined to declare an appeal equitably moot when there is uncontested evidence that the creditor requested relief would not require abandonment of the plan.in in re american homepatient we determined that despite the substantial consummation of the plan,the lenders appeal was not equitably moot.in re american homepatient,at.in light of the debtor failure to present evidence specifically rebutting the lenders arguments,we determined that the lenders presented a plausible argument that the implementation of their suggested changes to the confirmation plan would not require any of the actions undertaken pursuant to the plan to be reversed.id.at.
in this case,creditors offer little detail regarding the requested revision of the confirmation plan.creditors claim that their requested relief is limited and that they are asking that this court vacate only the portion of the plan that requires management to remain in place.however,creditors also ask that they be allowed to propose an entirely new reorganization plan.they claim that their plan would treat every cr
