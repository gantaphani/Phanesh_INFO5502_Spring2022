in this case,we address the issue of the relative priorities and enforcement of a judgment lien and a competing contractual lien for attorney fees claimed by the debtor law firm for its work in creating the very fund from which the creditor seeks to satisfy its judgment lien.for the reasons discussed below,in this factually complex case,we conclude that the law firm contractual lien has priority.
factual and procedural background 
american benefit plan administrators benefit administrators sued pangborn 
plumbing corporation and pangborn collectively pangborn for failing to fund pangborn employees benefit plan.benefit administrators recovered a judgment of approximately against pangborn.the relationship between benefit administrators on the one hand,and pangborn on the other,thus became that of judgment creditor and judgment debtor,and,for purposes of this appeal,we shall henceforth refer to pangborn as debtor and to benefit administrators as creditor.
debtor surety company,insurance company of the west icw,sued debtor the accounting litigation.debtor against icw,carruthers skiffington,debtor own accounting firm,and two of carruthers skiffington principals,robert and gary carruthers.we shall refer to carruthers skiffington and robert and gary carruthers collectively as accounting firm.debtor retained the law firm of westrup,klick associates wka to represent it in the accounting litigation,and entered into a contract that provided for a lien for attorney fees to be paid out of any proceeds debtor might recover in the accounting litigation.
creditor,aware of the pending accounting litigation,gave notice,under code of civil procedure sections et to all parties to such litigation that creditor was asserting a judgment lien against any proceeds debtor might obtain.
debtor settled with accounting firm.the terms of the settlement required that accounting firm pay the settlement proceeds to wka to hold in trust.under the applicable law,however,accounting firm had a duty not to pay such proceeds to debtor without the consent of creditor or a court order,subd.a.however,despite the notice of judgment lien that had been given by creditor,the settlement proceeds were paid over in trust to wka,although neither creditor consent nor a court order had been obtained before the funds were transferred to wka client trust account for debtor.
a few months later,creditor sought relief from the settlement.it did not raise any equitable arguments that its judgment lien should be given priority over the contractual lien for attorney fees,nor did it seek relief pursuant to section.instead,it simply asked that the settlement between debtor and accounting firm be set aside because the settlement proceeds,contrary to creditor statutory notice,had been paid out without any notice to it and without its consent.creditor thereby eschewed any objection to the reasonableness of the settlement and to the amount of attorney fees that wka had claimed for its services and as to which its claimed contractual lien would apply.in short,creditor argument was that,under section,subdivision a,the settlement was void.notably,creditor also moved for judgment against accounting firm,pursuant to sections,subdivision b and,subdivision c.
accounting firm opposed the motion to set aside the settlement.it admitted that its law firm,haight,brown bonesteel,had creditor notice of judgment lien in its files,but claimed the law firm did not know that creditor had a lien on the settlement proceeds.it also blamed wka for not bringing up the issue of the judgment lien at the time the parties entered into the settlement,and contended that,in any event,there was enough money in the debtor client trust fund to satisfy the judgment lien.it urged that the settlement was reasonable and wise,and should not be set aside,and that the only issue was who should pay creditor judgment lien.
accounting firm urged that debtor,not accounting firm,should be required to satisfy creditor judgment lien.the reasons accounting firm gave to justify this argument were that otherwise,debtor would be unjustly enriched if it received the settlement proceeds and accounting firm was forced to pay off debtor judgment in favor of creditor a constructive trust existed over the moneys in wka client trust fund,based on accounting firm mistaken belief that debtor was entitled to the full settlement proceeds there was enough money in the client trust account to pay off the judgment lien and wka,debtor law firm,upon receipt of such funds,had become a fiduciary creditor,because the law firm had received money on behalf of a third party who was not the firm client,creditor,for which proposition accounting firm cited johnstone state bar cal d.
debtor,like accounting firm,also opposed creditor motion to set aside the settlement,and also objected to accounting firm suggestions as to how the matter should be resolved.debtor asserted that although there was still money in wka client trust account,the amount of money needed to satisfy the contractual lien for attorney fees had not stabilized,since there was more legal work to be done in the accounting litigation.in fact,debtor contended,it was likely that the amount owed for the legal work would exceed the settlement proceeds.debtor also argued that the transfer of the settlement proceeds had not harmed creditor because wka had always had a superior lien over all proceeds from the accounting litigation,and it appeared likely that all such proceeds would be used up in litigation costs,and would never end up as an asset available for the benefit of debtor creditors.
in reply,creditor raised an equitable argument as to priority,along with other issues.it urged that the settlement was void because it was obtained without notice to,or consent from,creditor creditor was entitled to a mandatory judgment in its favor and against accounting firm,pursuant to section,subdivision c,because accounting firm had transferred money to debtor without creditor consent or a court order the contractual lien for attorney fees should not be said to extend for services not yet rendered,because recent federal authority cast doubt on the validity of a contractual lien for unearned attorney fees creditor cited in re croshier,a case that,notably,did not involve a contractual lien for attorney fees,and therefore wka must be required to provide an accounting of the fees actually earned thus far and the equities favored giving priority to the claims of debtor employees,whose and not fully compensated services formed the basis of creditor judgment lien,versus giving priority to the claims of debtor law firm for work still to be performed.
as to this final appeal to equity,creditor stressed that debtor employees had already performed the work for which they had been promised pension,vacation and health benefits,while wka,sit ting in its downtown long beach tower,claimed a lien for which it had not yet performed the work.creditor then cited the california constitution article xiv,section,which provides for mechanic liens,various statutes giving employees liens for wages under certain circumstances,and even the bible.deut.finally,it reiterated the relief it sought vacation of the settlement,a judgment in favor of creditor and against accounting firm,and an accounting from wka as to the fees it had earned thus far.
thereafter,accounting firm made a motion to set aside the dismissal of the accounting litigation,itself,so that the trial court would have jurisdiction to retroactively authorize the settlement,determine the lien priorities,and order that creditor seek to satisfy its judgment lien from the settlement proceeds,rather than by way of a judgment against accounting firm pursuant to section,subdivision c.accounting firm based its motion to set aside the dismissal on section,subdivision b,and asserted that its law firm was under the mistaken impression that there was no applicable judgment lien.it contended that if its law firm had known that there was such a lien,it would not have paid over the settlement proceeds to debtor without written consent from creditor.
the end result of these various motions was that trial court affirmed the settlement as fair and reasonable.it then ordered wka to pay creditor judgment lien with the trust account funds.debtor has appealed from this last order 
contentions on appeal 
debtor contends that the trial court erred by treating creditor judgment lien as having priority over debtor law firm contractual lien,and ignoring the statutory scheme set out in sections et,which scheme limits accounting firm and creditor remedies.accounting firm and creditor dispute this.creditor also contends that this appeal should be dismissed,because it is not actually being prosecuted by debtor,but rather by wka.
discussion 
the appeal is proper 
we necessarily deal with the predicate standing issue first.
creditor claims that wka,not debtor,is the real party in interest here,and that therefore the appeal should be dismissed.while it is true that wka asserts a contractual attorney fee lien over the moneys in debtor client trust account,that does not mean that such funds belong to wka rather than to debtor,or that debtor itself has no interest in making sure such funds are used to pay one creditor rather than another.in fact,debtor obviously has an interest in being able to retain legal representation,given its current involvement in the accounting litigation,which means it has an interest in being able to pay for such continuing representation.
public policy favors giving attorneys contractual liens for legal services priority over judgment creditors liens.it is often crucial for debtors to be able to retain legal counsel,and a debtor ability to retain counsel may also accrue to the benefit of the client creditors.cetenko united california bank cal d,cetenko.thus,a judgment that interferes,directly or indirectly,with a party ability to retain counsel may be said to aggrieve that party.
for example,in roa lodi medical group,cal d,a medical malpractice action,some of the defendants settled with plaintiffs,and the trial court was called upon to approve the settlement.the plaintiffs asked that their attorneys receive contingent fees in the amount in their retainer was more than allowed by business and professions code section.the trial court noted that the work performed was worth the higher amount,but refused to grant the request,concluding that it was prohibited by law from doing so.
the plaintiffs appealed from this decision,contending the law was unconstitutional,and defendants moved to dismiss the appeal on the ground that plaintiffs were not the parties aggrieved by the law.defendants argued that only plaintiffs attorneys were aggrieved by order limiting attorney fees,and thus were the only proper party to prosecute the appeal.the california supreme court rejected defendants argument,holding that,in fact,plaintiffs,rather than plaintiffs attorneys,could maintain the appeal because the plaintiffs were aggrieved by the potential effect of the limitation on their attorneys incentive to pursue additional recovery against the remaining defendants who are not covered by the settlement.
so,too,here,debtor is aggrieved by a decision that interferes with its ability to continue to retain counsel for the accounting litigation.although the settlement proceeds were paid to wka,such proceeds were to be held in trust for debtor by wka,and were subject to a lien to ensure payment of debtor attorney fees,a purpose that clearly benefits debtor.obviously,debtor has an ownership interest in such funds and in how they are disbursed,and in obtaining a determination that creditor remedy as a judgment creditor lies against accounting firm,rather than against debtor trust account funds.debtor is clearly the party aggrieved by the trial court order,and is a proper party to this appeal,because of the order potential effect on wka incentive to continue to represent debtor against icw.thus,there is no valid basis for dismissing the appeal.code civ,see,roa lodi medical group,supra,cal d at,fn.
standard of review 
generally speaking,a trial court approval of a settlement subject to certain conditions related to a judgment lien is reviewed under an abuse of discretion standard.section,subdivision a,provides that any party may seek a court order authorizing a compromise,settlement,dismissal or satisfaction of the pending action in lieu of the written consent thereto of the judgment creditor.in other words,the trial court may order an action subject to a judgment creditor lien compromised on such terms as it thinks are necessary.see,ahart,cal.practice guide enforcing judgments debts the rutter group muller reagh d.however,its power to impose terms is limited by the fact that it is an abuse of discretion for a trial court to make an order that deprives any party of the legal rights to which it is entitled in terms of the priority of its lien,in the absence of appropriate equitable considerations 
however,when a party to litigation has been served statutory notice,pursuant to section,subdivision b,of a judgment creditor lien,and then nonetheless transfers property to or on behalf of the judgment debtor without the creditor consent,any orders designed to remedy such a transfer are reviewed under a de novo standard,with an eye to whether such orders comply with the applicable statute.section,subdivision c,provides if the court determines that a party other than the judgment debtor having notice of the lien created under this article has transferred property that was subject to the lien or has paid an amount to the judgment debtor that was subject to the lien,the court shall render judgment against the party in an amount equal to the lesser of the following the value of the judgment debtor interest in the property or the amount paid the judgment debtor.the amount of the judgment creditor lien created under this article.italics added.thus,the question on appeal is whether or not,as a matter of law,the trial court complied with the applicable statutory law.
wka contractual lien for attorney fees is entitled to priority 
the general rule,all things being equal,is that liens have priority among themselves according to the date of their creation,except in cases of bottomry and respondentia,cetenko,supra,cal d at,bluxome street associates fireman fund ins.d.bluxome.however,this rule only applies when all other things are equal.under certain circumstances,priority may not be based upon which lien was created first,but may depend upon which lienholder first gave notice to the person in possession of property subject to competing lien claims.thus,in smitton mccullough cal,smitton,an equitable lien created by operation of law was held to have priority over a previously created lien of the same kind,simply because the holder of the later lien was the first to give notice of his lien to the person in possession of the property subject to both liens 
while the priority of certain kinds of statutory liens,for example,judgment liens,is dependent on the timing of the giving of proper notice see bluxome,supra,d at,no notice is required before a contractual lien for attorney fees is valid and protected against a levy by a judgment creditor.cetenko,supra,cal d at.here,in fact,the parties all concede that wka contractual lien for fees in the accounting litigation has priority in time over creditor judgment creditor lien,because a contractual lien for attorney fees,entered into before the client has succeeded in recovering any proceeds by way of litigation,is first in time as to such potential proceeds.the liens of other creditors,such as attachment liens and judgment liens,reach only the debtor interest in property,and are subject to prior equities against the debtor.cal d at fn.this rule,as it applies to judgment creditors,is reflected in section,subdivision a,which provides that a judgment creditor may only obtain a lien against a judgment debtor who is a party to a pending action or special proceeding,subd.a,italics added.until wka filed the accounting litigation,there was no pending action,and thus there was nothing upon which creditor could place a lien.see epstein,supra,th at,d.thus,wka contractual lien over any proceeds from the litigation to be filed was first in time as to such proceeds.
of course,if an attorney does not enter into an agreement for a contractual lien upon any litigation proceeds until after the action has been filed,and after a judgment creditor has given notice pursuant to sections and,the judgment creditor lien will have priority.del conte,supra,d at.moreover,an attorney contractual lien for fees can not displace a creditor recorded security interest in real property that is the subject of litigation.atascadero factory outlets,augustini wheeler llp th,d atascadero however,when the provider of a service,such as a doctor or lawyer,has entered into a contract for a lien on any recovery his or her efforts may secure,then equity and public policy requires such lien to have priority see,cetenko,supra,cal d at,nicoletti,supra,d at.
thus,for example,in nicoletti,supra,a judgment creditor appealed from an order subordinating his statutory lien to the consensual liens of doctors and other medical lienors on the settlement proceeds from a personal injury action.the appellate court held that the trial court had not abused its discretion,noting that the medical lienors are medical people required to provide services to people in emergency situations.they are not judgment creditors.to force a medical person to perfect a lien every time a service is provided is not logical nor reasonable.such a requirement would not only damage the relationship but would create a tremendous burden upon an already burdened judicial system.in personal injury matters the ability of litigants to pay the doctors before the services are performed is not always present.if the doctors were then obligated to file a court action to protect their liens after the services were performed it would not be long before doctors would cease to perform their services until they were paid.such a practice would truly culminate in an unfortunate result.and public policy should support a system which enables medical people and medical businesses to be secure in a belief they will be paid for their services without having to become involved in civil litigation.to place any responsibility upon respondent and the other medical lienors to do more than perform their much needed services should not be encouraged nor allowed.id.at.
accordingly,the nicoletti court concluded that the trial court had not abused its power by reviewing the conflicting claims,ruling on their reasonableness and genuineness,and establishing an equitable distribution based on the public policy of encouraging doctors to provide medical services to injured persons who were not immediately able to pay for them.nicoletti,supra,d at.
here,just as in nicoletti,public policy and equitable considerations favor giving wka contractual lien priority over creditor judgment lien.no facts support a contrary result creditor did not file notice of its lien before debtor and wka entered into their fee agreement,as in del conte and fleet credit.creditor has no secured interest as in atascadero.
creditor does attempt to raise a public policy argument by asserting that there should be a lien priority in favor of its judgment,which represents money owed by debtor to debtor employees for unpaid benefits.creditor urges that such compensation should be entitled to priority over wka contractual lien at least to the extent that such contractual lien applies to all moneys recovered by wka as debtor attorney,not just to that portion of such recovery that wka has actually earned.
in support of this public policy argument,creditor cites various code sections that entitle employees to liens and to priorities in certain circumstances,none of which is directly applicable here.creditor cites section,subdivision a,which gives priority to wage claims in assignments for creditors,and civil code sections et,which give priority,via the mechanic lien laws,to persons who provided labor,services,material or equipment that improved real property.if anything,creditor examples militate in favor of giving priority to wka.
the statutory liens and priorities given as examples by creditor all relate to specific potential sources of funds to pay such with which the claimants have some direct connection in the sense that their efforts helped created the fund.for example,unpaid wages of employees earned within days before the sale or transfer of a business are entitled to be treated as preferred claims and liens on the proceeds from such sale or transfer,and must be paid first from such proceeds.the proceeds from the sale or transfer of a business are a fund that the unpaid employees helped to create the business total value upon sale or transfer reflects value added by its employees uncompensated labor.so,too,unpaid wages and bills for goods and services used to improve real property may be perfected as mechanic liens on the real property so improved,et the real property value is a fund that the mechanic lien claimants helped create the improved property total value reflects value added by the claimants labor,goods and services.
thus,these statutes simply reflect the equitable principle that those whose labor,skills and materials resulted in the creation of a fund should be entitled to priority in the payment of their claims from such source.this principle can be applied to the holding in nicoletti,too,in which the medical lienors labor,skills and materials were inextricably tied to the creation of the personal injury settlement proceeds the final value of that settlement reflected the value added by the medical providers labor,goods and services.
when the same logic is applied to the facts before us,it is apparent that wka is entitled to retain the priority of its contractual lien.it was wka labor,skill and materials and willingness to take the risk that there would be no recovery at all that resulted in the settlement proceeds paid by accounting firm to debtor.in contrast,and unlike the situation in nicoletti,or the unpaid employee scenario under section,or the unpaid improvers of real property scenario under civil code sections et,there is no evidence that debtor uncompensated employees on whose behalf creditor obtained its judgment lien helped to create the accounting settlement fund at issue here.debtor failure to pay such employees their earned benefits may have increased debtor assets,but debtor assets are not the source of this settlement fund.the fund here represents the compensation allegedly owed by accounting firm to debtor because of accounting firm tortious conduct,and it was created through the labor of wka,not the uncompensated labor of debtor employees.
creditor also urges that wka should not be allowed to assert a lien over the settlement proceeds for fees not yet earned.it cites no authority for this proposition,however.in fact,common sense,and cetenko,supra,cal d,compel the opposite conclusion.
the point of cetenko was that public policy requires that attorneys,just like the medical providers in nicoletti,be assured that they will be repaid for their labor,so as to encourage them to provide labor to persons not then able to pay for it.unlike the provision of medical services and care,legal representation in litigation is not a matter primarily determined by the person who has agreed to provide the service in the hope of later compensation.instead,litigation is an adversarial process,in which one adversaries often dictate or influence its course.such adversaries may utilize various tactics in an attempt to win,including extensive discovery and pre and motions.even if one is successful at trial,additional legal work may be required to protect the judgment on appeal.thus,attorneys can not always predict how much work will be required when they enter into fee agreements,nor when the need for such work will end.
therefore,to meet the public policy behind cetenko,it is obvious that an attorney contractual lien over the proceeds of litigation must have priority until the litigation is finally resolved,and all related fees have been billed and paid.few attorneys would take the risk of a contingent fee if they could not be assured that their attorney fee liens were applicable to all potential proceeds they might recover until
