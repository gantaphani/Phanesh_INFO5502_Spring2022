after a jury trial,appellant fire insurance exchange fire was found to have intentionally concealed and misrepresented an important fact and to have unreasonably failed to investigate and pay a claim covered under a fire insurance policy.on appeal,fire contends that the judgment should be reversed because the appointment of respondent james baron as receiver for the insured property was void or at least invalid for purposes of recovering punitive damages.notwithstanding the righteous,histrionic tone of respondent brief,we find no error in the trial court judgment upholding the verdict.
background 
from to dennis sanfilippo and carole verni were engaged in a joint venture pertaining to property located on big talk court in san jose.under the terms of their written agreement,any disputes were to be settled by arbitration.in a dispute did arise,and in march they engaged an arbitrator,the honorable read ambler ret.
on may,the property was extensively damaged by a fire.verni was insured on the property under a farmers insurance company policy provided by fire verni filed a claim,which was assigned to gary corbett,an independent adjuster.independent adjusters handled claims when adjusters were unavailable,but unlike the latter,independent adjusters had no authority to settle claims.
in july the arbitrator reached a decision in sanfilippo favor.in accordance with the parties subsequent stipulation,he appointed respondent as receiver to take possession of the property,together with any and all insurance proceeds relating to past,present,or future claims for damages to the property including those settlement proceeds in response to claims made against farmers insurance exchange sic policy.the order also specifically authorized respondent to restore or sell the property and to institute,prosecute,defend,compromise,intervene in or become a party to such suits,actions or proceedings as may in his reasonable judgment be necessary or proper for the protection,maintenance,operation,preservation or enhancement of the receivership estate,or the performance of his obligations pursuant to the terms of this order respondent was to be compensated at an hourly rate.
in december gregory sterling,respondent associate,wrote to corbett advising him that respondent had been appointed as receiver to handle the insurance claim.corbett appeared to welcome the appointment because he had been frustrated that the claim had not progressed.corbett gave sterling the names of two approved contractors for the purpose of repair,including double r construction.corbett told sterling that if he and respondent used an approved contractor,processing the claim would be much smoother and it would be easier to get full value for their insurance claim but if they selected a contractor that was not on the approved list,it would be more difficult to give them full value for the claim.
corbett affirmed his recommendation in a letter and advised respondent that he was forwarding respondent contact information to double r construction.in a subsequent meeting at the property site,corbett told sterling that based on farmers experience,double r would be a very good choice.sterling made it clear that he and respondent expected to pay for any improvements not covered by the policy,but corbett suggested that some of those additions might be compensated if some covered repairs were not made.corbett estimated the total cost of the repairs to be or more.he represented to respondent and sterling that he had full authority to settle the claim,and that he was farmers.he promised that he would take care of respondent on the claim completely.
at trial ron iwasaki,corbett supervisor,testified,as did suzanne slater,a former manager of adjusters in the division,and sharon sims,a northern california zone manager,that there had never been any list of approved contractors for large losses both iwasaki and slater admitted that using the term approved contractor could mislead an insured into believing that the contractors had been screened by the insurer and that the insurer was guaranteeing the contractor work.
iwasaki understood that the property was under the management of a receiver and that all payments were to be made to that person.he testified that he treated respondent the same way he would have treated a homeowner.however,iwasaki probably did not correct corbett misrepresentation to respondent that double r construction was on a list of approved contractors.
based on corbett very strong recommendation and representation about the ease of reimbursement,respondent hired double r construction to perform the repairs on the property.respondent notified corbett that he intended to hire double r since it was an approved contractor for farmers.respondent added that he expected the insurance proceeds to be adequate to fully repair the home with the exception of the pool.respondent asked corbett to advise him if his understanding was incorrect but he received no response to that effect.on march,sterling wrote to corbett,asking him to address specific coverage conditions and to verify that certain repair costs would be compensated.corbett did not respond.
farmers sent respondent a payment of,representing its estimate of the actual cash value of the loss.the company also paid for the removal of asbestos in the damaged house.additional payments were expected once repairs were completed.other work,such as structural upgrades,became necessary,but when sterling requested confirmation that the costs would be reimbursed,he received no response from anyone at farmers.
double r began demolition work in march or april of.the repair did not progress expeditiously,however.by september both respondent and sterling were extremely worried.in respondent had already paid the contractor of the amount he had received from farmers.around the beginning of october,sterling expressed his concern to corbett.he asked corbett whether there was something he should know about double r,but corbett said he could not talk to sterling about that.no one associated with farmers informed respondent or sterling that as early as june the company had been sending checks to double r at an address in arizona.respondent and sterling nevertheless decided that double r had abandoned the job.sterling called corbett to obtain additional names from the approved list and thereafter solicited bids from other contractors.eventually,respondent hired sun restoration,which completed the reconstruction of the home between january and june of at a cost of.
meanwhile,on november,sterling received a letter from corbett stating that his office would address only supplemental changes required by the building department and unit prices for existing line items.demolition or construction initiated by the previous contractor which was not agreed to in writing by this office will not be addressed.according to respondent expert at trial,this statement amounted to a denial of coverage.
sterling was totally confused and somewhat stunned by this correspondence,as it was contrary to the promises corbett had made regarding the process of reimbursement.later that month he and respondent met with corbett and another prospective contractor regarding an alternative bid.corbett was angry about the extent of the demolition that had been done,such as the removal of the roof,even though his recommended contractor,double r,had performed that work.
during this brief meeting respondent asked corbett how farmers was going to help recover the money double r had taken.corbett,however,got very angry and pretty aggressive,insisting that there was no way farmers would pay twice.when respondent suggested that perhaps he should talk to a lawyer,corbett blew up,announced that respondent would not be getting anything more out of him,and walked away.
respondent initiated this action against farmers,corbett,and the large loss center of excellence on may,alleging breach of an insurance contract,refusal to pay policy benefits and damages caused by double r,declaratory relief,negligence,fraudulent misrepresentation,and negligent misrepresentation.fire july demurrer to respondent first amended complaint was sustained and its request to strike a request for punitive damages was granted with leave to amend.
the second amended complaint substituted fire for farmers.in the meantime,sanfilippo filed a petition in superior court to confirm the arbitration award.verni stipulated to such an order,which was granted by the court on august.the court confirmed not only the arbitrator award but also his appointment of respondent as receiver.
in february respondent settled with corbett for,and the matter proceeded to trial against fire.in bifurcated proceedings the jury submitted a special verdict in respondent favor on all issues.as to intentional misrepresentation and concealment,it found damages of.on the questions of breach of contractual duty to pay a covered claim,breach of the covenant of good faith and fair dealing by failing to pay policy benefits,and bad faith failure to investigate the claim,the jury determined the loss to be approximately.in the second phase of the proceeding,the jury determined that fire,both independently and through approval or adoption of corbett conduct,had acted with malice,oppression or fraud.in accordance with the jury verdict,the trial court entered judgment awarding respondent compensatory damages of and punitive damages of million.in an amended judgment,the court added attorney fees and costs,for a total award of.
discussion 
respondent authority to litigate as receiver 
fire primary contention on appeal is that respondent had no authority to proceed in this action because the arbitrator had no jurisdiction to appoint him as receiver.because that appointment was void for all purposes,fire argues,he was not the proper real party in interest and therefore was not entitled to damages,attorney fees,or costs.
code of civil procedure section sets forth the conditions under which a receiver may be appointed.subdivision b of the statute permits an appointment by the court in which an action or proceeding is pending,or by a judge thereof in an action between partners or others jointly owning or interested in any property on the application of the plaintiff,or of any party whose right to or interest in the property or the proceeds thereof,is probable,and where it is shown that the property is in danger of being lost,removed,or materially injured.subdivision b broadly permits such appointments in any case in which a receiver is necessary to preserve the property or rights of any party.
fire contends,citing marsch williams th,d,that any appointment made by an arbitrator is not specifically authorized by section and therefore is void.in marsch,as here,a partnership agreement provided for binding arbitration of disputes.the partners had a dispute that was submitted to arbitration,and the trial court subsequently confirmed the arbitration award.the appellate court reversed,holding that section vested the power to appoint a receiver in the superior court and did not extend to arbitrators,even by agreement of the parties.id.at,d.
respondent correctly observes that the challenge to the appointment in marsch was made by a party to the arbitration.he also points out that the appointment would be valid on remand if the trial court determined that an appointment would be warranted.in this case,respondent argues,fire is not a party entitled to the benefit of the procedures for securing appointment of a receiver set forth in section,subdivision b.respondent further insists that sanfilippo and verni properly applied for the appointment of respondent and thus substantially complied with the procedures outlined in section,subdivision b.
we need not reach these arguments because we agree with respondent last point,that fire challenge to the appointment is precluded by its failure to attack it earlier.had it done so and prevailed,respondent urges,he would have saved in excess of in attorney fees and t he right to pursue the insurance benefits would have reverted to the insure d,who could have timely pursued fire.because any action by the insured is now,respondent suggests,fire would obtain a windfall by invalidating the appointment,thereby escaping payment of damages for its bad faith.
respondent position,though framed as one of estoppel,ratification,and acquiescence rather than waiver or forfeiture,has merit.hise superior court cal d,estoppel to deny validity of appointment,based on failure to make timely objection and affirmative acts recognizing authority of receiver.while fire did contest respondent standing as a party to assert the first two causes of action and disputed his right to claim punitive damages,it did not seek dismissal of the lawsuit based on the invalidity of the receivership appointment.addressing fire demurrer to the first amended complaint on september,the court recognized the unusual procedural posture of the case presented by the arbitrator appointment.but the focus of the court at that point was whether the arbitrator had authorized respondent specifically to prosecute this lawsuit.respondent counsel noted that the appointment had been made a court order in august in the course of confirming the interim award.counsel for fire did not contest respondent status as a duly appointed receiver indeed,he conceded that the appointment order gave the receiver the authority to maintain causes of action arising out of the property itself.instead,defense counsel point was only that respondent was not authorized to pursue personal tort causes of action because they belonged exclusively to the insured.
in a motion to dismiss respondent as a party on october,fire again challenged respondent standing,arguing that baron,as a receiver,is a stranger to the insurance contract and the insured had not made a valid assignment of her causes of action.the trial court,while acknowledging that this argument was powerful and seductive,rejected it,affirming that respondent was proceeding with prior court authorization as receiver,and not as assignee or transferee the court also expressed the view that the equities require recognition of the capacity of the receiver to proceed as previously authorized,because failure to do so,among other things,could lead to the parties to the arbitration being time barred from prosecuting which they relied on the receiver to attend to within the scope of his court conferred authority.in its answer to the second amended complaint which was filed one week after the judicial order confirming respondent authority to litigate,fire asserted only that respondent lacked standing to sue because he was not an insured under the policy.
we thus conclude that fire has forfeited its challenge to the validity of respondent appointment by failing to raise it below.we further agree with the trial court that to deem the judicial appointment invalid merely because it occurred through the ratification of the arbitrator act would effect an injustice not only to respondent but to the insured,who by stipulating to his appointment removed herself early from the pursuit of the policy benefits and of a remedy for the damage caused by corbett misconduct.a major reason the statutory limits are so stringent is that the appointment of a receiver necessarily means the taking of property by the court from one who may turn out to be the rightful owner thereof,and it may thus strike at the very substance of a person property rights.takeba superior court,accord,marsch,supra,th at,d.in this case,however,neither sanfilippo nor verni complained that the appointment of a receiver deprived him or her of possession or control.the rationale underlying the restrictive and cautionary application of section is not applicable in these procedural circumstances.
fire attempts to overcome its untimely opposition by arguing that a void order may be challenged at any time.the order was not void,however,as the court unquestionably had fundamental jurisdiction over the parties and the subject matter before it if a trial court has personal and jurisdiction,then an order entered in excess of that jurisdiction remains valid but voidable.in re marriage of jackson th,d see also whether act in excess of jurisdiction and thus voidable is enforced depends in large part on the degree of the procedural irregularity and whether the court act violated a comprehensive statutory scheme or offended public policy.
thus,even if the court exceeded its jurisdiction by ratifying and adopting the arbitrator ruling,that error does not compel reversal.nevertheless,the order was not unjustified in the circumstances before the court.confirming respondent appointment made it a judicial one,and we can not presume that the order was made without due consideration of the merits of the parties joint request.
punitive damages 
we reach a different conclusion regarding the viability of fire challenge to the punitive damages award.fire objected to this claim multiple times in the proceedings below.in its july demurrer to the first amended complaint,fire contended that respondent lacked standing to maintain the tort causes of action or recover punitive damages because these were purely personal claims that are not assignable under california law.murphy allstate ins.cal d.as to these claims the court sustained the demurrer with leave to amend,as respondent had not established that he had received the arbitrator permission to institute the claims against fire.morand superior court d.the next day,october,the arbitrator signed an amended order nunc pro tunc,which more precisely authorized respondent to pursue the claims made against the policy at issue,including but not limited to any suits or actions arising out of the insurance carrier handling of such claims including but not limited to the right to institute any action for breach of contract,bad faith,negligence,fraud,concealment,or any other contract or tort cause of action and specifically including the right to recover any and all damages including but not limited to punitive damage.on october,the trial court confirmed as an order of this court the arbitrator clarification order.
fire repeated its standing argument in a motion in limine to dismiss respondent as a party,a motion in limine to strike the claim for punitive damages,and its trial brief,all filed on october.in a motion for judgment notwithstanding the verdict,fire again contended that respondent was not entitled to recover damages on behalf of the insured verni for purely personal tort claims.clearly the issue of whether respondent was entitled to seek punitive damages was before the trial court and is therefore properly before us on appeal.
respondent maintains that he had standing to sue for bad faith and fraud and to recover punitive damages because he served a function analogous to that of a bankruptcy trustee appointed by the court to take possession of the assets of the debtor.whether respondent was permitted to assert bad faith and fraud is not an issue fire raises on appeal,and we need not address it.as to respondent standing to pursue the remedy of punitive damages,he relies on inapposite authority for litigation of claims existing before the trustee or here,the receiver appointment.see,mosier southern california physicians ins.exchange th,d because fraud action arose before bankruptcy petition was filed,trustee properly prosecuted action on debtor behalf reichert general ins.of america cal d,plaintiff bankruptcy trustee,not plaintiff,was proper party to assert claim for breach of contract,as claim related back to contract with insured.in this case the claims for which punitive damages were sought arose after respondent took control of the property and was subjected to fire tortious conduct.in any event,it is unnecessary to decide the extent to which respondent was serving a function like that of a bankruptcy trustee,because we are convinced that respondent judicially authorized role encompassed the pursuit of the controverted request for punitive damages.
fire argues that respondent could not pursue punitive damages because he was the receiver not for sanfilippo and verni personally,but for a limited estate consisting of only those assets that were subject to the dispute,the property and the insurance proceeds.as so limited,the receivership estate could not include a punitive damage claim,which is neither real property nor part of the insurance proceeds that were subject to dispute,but a statutory claim requiring proof of a tort violation and malice,oppression,or fraud.
the initial appointment,as fire observes,encompassed any and all insurance proceeds relating to past,present or future claims for damages to the real property or to personal property of either property that was damaged along with the real property by fire or other covered event including,but not limited to,those settlement proceeds in response to claims made against fire.but the subsequent clarification made in response to the sustaining of the demurrer further defined the receiver authority to include not only the right to institute the lawsuit against fire but also the right to recover any and all damages including but not limited to punitive damage s.emphasis added.fire description of the receivership estate as being limited to the physical property and insurance proceeds does not undermine the broader scope of the appointment,which conferred a more expansive authority on respondent in order to benefit the receivership estate.
fire insists,however,that the appointment was of no legal effect because a claim for punitive damages is personal and not assignable as a matter of law.it points out that the final arbitration award in january confirmed by the court in june referred to the litigation as having been assigned to respondent.closer examination of the distribution approved by the court reveals,however,that an assignment of a personal claim did not take place in the sense urged by fire,and,as noted earlier,the trial court expressly found that this matter did not involve an assignment of rights.in his final award the arbitrator delineated the distribution of the funds received from sale of the property,settlement proceeds,and other sources.the arbitrator phrase assignment of claims against insurer was used in the context of defining the compensation for receiver service.the arbitrator explained that respondent had been awarded fees and costs in september in addition to other consideration assignment of claims against insurer and judgment against the general contractor.by way of further explanation,the arbitrator incorporated an attached breakdown of respondent expenses,and stated that a fter the receiver fees and costs are paid from the funds held by the receiver,there should be a balance available for distribution from the sale of the property of.there were other assets in the receivership account,leaving available for distribution the receiver was to distribute all remaining funds,consistent with this final award,to sanfilippo counsel.and any recovery settlement in the lawsuit against fire which was assigned to the receiver,which would have otherwise been payable to verni,shall be paid to sanfilippo the distribution outlined by the arbitrator and adopted by the court indicates that it was the receivership estate that was to recover damages.whatever amount respondent was permitted to retain was in the nature of compensation,not the product of a personal assignment of an insured legal rights.thus,neither the facts found by the trial court nor the cases on which fire relies support its premise that an assignment took place.
fire notes that an earlier order by the arbitrator which was adopted by the court called for distribution of any recovered damages to respondent,sanfilippo,and verni such that respondent would receive percent of any amount recovered after paying himself from the cash in the receivership estate,repaying himself for his costs and attorney fees,paying himself an additional in fire view,this aspect of the order demonstrates that respondent is an assignee.although it is impossible to discern from the record whether respondent was permitted personally to retain more than million,as fire represents,that question is not relevant to the issue of whether fire conduct made it liable for punitive damages,and fire has correctly refrained from raising it as a separate challenge as respondent was not acting as an assignee and fire
