appellants ann daniel and leonard hill the daniels purchased beachfront property in santa barbara county the county in.in,carl johnson,one of the daniels predecessors in interest,made a firm,continuing offer to dedicate to the county a pedestrian and bicycle easement across the property.in,johnson renewed the offer.these two offers to dedicate were exacted by the county in return for granting permits to johnson to divide and then to build on the property.in,bruce and darleine bucklew the bucklews,also predecessors in interest,made a irrevocable offer to dedicate the same easement.all three offers to dedicate were matters of public record.
in,shortly after the daniels purchase of the property and within the periods of all three offers to dedicate,the county accepted the offer to dedicate made by the bucklews.the daniels challenged the county action in federal district court under,alleging a violation of the takings clause of the federal constitution.they also alleged violations of state law.the county successfully moved to dismiss the complaint,and the daniels appeal the dismissal of their claim.we affirm the district court.
in,the daniels purchased beachfront property in santa barbara county that had once been part of a larger parcel owned by johnson.in and,johnson had divided the original parcel into four separate parcels the division included a driveway and a passageway to the beach for the common use of the owners of the four parcels.a regional commission of the california coastal zone conservation commission coastal commission or commission approved the division,conditioned on johnson 
offer ing for dedication to the county of santa barbara or its successor in jurisdiction,for recreational pedestrian and bicycle access an easement in width from padaro lane to the mean high tide line said offer shall be a firm continuing offer of dedication which is not rejected or vitiated by failure to accept or purported rejection for a period of years,unless the county has in the meantime provided beach access within a distance of yards upcoast or downcoast of this parcel.the offer of dedication shall be conditioned on assumption by the county of santa barbara or its successor,of the burden of maintenance of the easement and the beach area to which access is provided,together with the burden of public liability on the easement.
emphasis added.johnson appealed the imposition of this firm continuing offer to dedicate fcotd to the commission,which affirmed the regional commission decision.johnson brought no judicial challenge to the administrative decision.
in,johnson applied to the coastal commission for a permit to build a house on the parcel that is now owned by the daniels.the permit was approved by the commission,conditioned on a renewal of the fcotd described above.johnson built the house under the permit in,and he did not challenge the imposition of the renewed fcotd either administratively or judicially.
the bucklews owned the parcel on which johnson built the house as successors in interest.in august,in response to a demand by the commission,the bucklews signed a irrevocable offer to dedicate iotd the same easement described in the two fcotds granted by johnson.the bucklews did not challenge the commission demand for the iotd either administratively or judicially.
the daniels purchased the property in.on september,the county notified them that on october,it would consider whether to accept the bucklews iotd.on october,the daniels unsuccessfully attempted to rescind it.on october,the county board of supervisors adopted a resolution accepting the iotd.
in november,the daniels filed suit against the county for declaratory and injunctive relief under,alleging a physical taking in violation of the takings clause of the fifth amendment,as applied to the states by the fourteenth amendment.they also alleged several violations of state law.on motion by the county,the district court dismissed the takings claim.it held that the daniels lacked standing because all the offers to dedicate were attached to the property at the time they purchased it.alternatively,the district court held that any takings claims accrued in and,and in any event no later than,and were therefore.finally,the district court held that even if the daniels had standing and their takings claim was not,the claim would not be ripe because the daniels could not allege that the state had refused to compensate them or their predecessors for the alleged taking.the district court then dismissed the supplemental state claims without prejudice pursuant to c.the daniels appeal the dismissal of their takings claim.

under the takings clause of the fifth amendment,the government may not take property for public use,without just compensation.const.amend.v.the takings clause is applied to the states through the fourteenth amendment.the clause was designed to bar government from forcing some people alone to bear public burdens which,in all fairness and justice,should be borne by the public as a whole.armstrong united states,d.
we affirm the district court dismissal of the daniels takings claim on two independently sufficient grounds.first,the daniels claim is an impermissible attempt to revive the claims of their predecessors in interest.second,the injunctive and declaratory remedy sought by the daniels is,in any event,not available under the takings claim they seek to bring.
we first examine the takings claims of the daniels predecessors in interest,johnson and the bucklews.johnson and the bucklews claims arising out the exaction of the offers to dedicate can plausibly be characterized as either regulatory or physical takings.under either characterization,johnson and the bucklews are from pursuing those claims.the daniels,as their successors in interest,are similarly.they may not bring a claim based on the exaction of the offers to dedicate,or on the later acceptance of one of those offers.
we think it most plausible to characterize johnson and the bucklews claims as alleged regulatory rather than physical takings.the coastal commission regulated the development of private property along the california coast,including the property.as part of that regulation,it granted permission to subdivide the parcel and to build on one of the four lots in return for johnson agreement to grant the two fcotds.the commission did not grant anything in exchange for the bucklews grant of the iotd,but the bucklews grant was part of the ongoing regulatory process that had begun with johnson grant of the first fcotd in.
under williamson county regional planning commission hamilton bank,d,a challenge to an alleged regulatory taking is not ripe unless two conditions are satisfied.first,the action alleged to constitute the taking must be a final decision regarding how the owner will be allowed to dev
