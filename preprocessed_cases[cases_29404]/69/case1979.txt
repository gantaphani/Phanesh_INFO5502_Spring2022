when a public official violates the hobbs act,title of the united states code section a,by soliciting and obtaining an extortion payment in exchange for approval of a public contract,that contract runs afoul of government code section and may be avoided pursuant to section regardless of whether the third party who obtained the public contract is an innocent victim,the public entity is entitled to recover all consideration it paid to the third party.with this holding in mind,we conclude that the trial court properly granted summary judgment in favor of respondent carson redevelopment agency the agency on its complaint to recover from appellants michael and bertha padilla the padillas.the was paid to the padillas through a public contract that was approved and signed only after they paid in extortion money to agapito diaz fajardo fajardo,the former mayor pro tempore of the city of carson.
we affirm the judgment entered in favor of the agency.
the padillas are the owners of a senior housing complex known as camino senior village in the city of carson.in,the padillas and the agency signed the affordable housing agreement the housing agreement.it established that the agency would provide the padillas rental assistance for six years,at a rate of not more than per month per unit occupied by a qualified tenant,up to a maximum of units.in exchange,the padillas agreed to a rental restriction that required them to offer units in camino senior village as low income housing for senior citizens for at least years.
in early,before the rental assistance provision expired,the padillas asked the agency to extend the rental assistance another years so it would last as long as the rental restriction.also,they wanted the rental assistance to cover all units in camino senior village.in lieu of future monthly rental assistance,the agency proposed that the parties enter a new agreement that would require the agency to loan the padillas at percent to be used for a buydown of their existing mortgage on camino senior village the buydown agreement.under the terms of the buydown agreement,the loan would be forgiven so long as the padillas cured any defaults on their obligations.
fajardo told michael padilla that he would have to pay if he wanted the city council to approve the buydown agreement.fajardo wanted up front and another after the buydown agreement was approved.michael padilla paid pursuant to fajardo demands.subsequently,fajardo solicited a third payment of to secure the agency signature on the buydown agreement,and michael padilla once again paid thereafter,the agency and the padillas signed the buydown agreement.it stated,inter alia,that the padillas would provide low income housing to seniors age or older in of the camino senior village units for at least years.
in,the agency sued the padillas for avoidance of the buydown agreement pursuant to section imposition of a constructive trust and an accounting rescission and restitution based on fraud and declaratory relief regarding the continuing validity of the housing agreement.the agency sought to recover the paid to the padillas 
the agency moved for summary judgment or summary adjudication with respect to each cause of action.the trial court granted summary adjudication as to the first cause of action to void the buydown agreement.after the agency requested dismissal of the unresolved portions of the complaint,judgment was entered and the padillas were ordered to pay the agency plus interest.
the padillas appealed the judgment.
discussion 
our review of the trial court decision to grant the agency motion for summary judgment is de novo.see merrill navegar,cal th,d.likewise,we consider issues of statutory interpretation without deference to the trial court that is,we start from a blank slate.people ex rel.lockyer shamrock foods cal th,d.
the principle issue in this appeal,the interpretation of section,is a one that calls upon us to examine the public policy of the state of california and carefully analyze when,if ever,individuals can retain consideration paid to them pursuant to a public contract that was secured through payments extorted by a corrupt public official.
according to the padillas a public contract is not void under section unless a public official is financially interested in that contract.when a public official receives a payment of extortion money in exchange for approval of a public contract,section is not triggered.although the public official receives an illegal payment,he is not getting paid with public funds through a public contract and therefore does not have a cognizable financial interest in the contract.
acknowledging case law,and duly considering public policy,our opinion takes a different tack.section was designed to protect the public to hold as the padillas urge would subvert the purpose of section by giving life to contracts born of conflicts of interest.here,there was a conflict of interest because fajardo voted to approve the buydown agreement based on his greed rather than on the due diligence and integrity he owed the city of carson.as a result,the city of carson was entitled to recover the paid to the padillas.this result may be harsh for individuals such as the padillas,but it is necessary to protect the public and encourage people like the padillas to report people like fajardo.no one should ever ante up an extortion payment to a public official.
below,we examine the law and the padillas arguments in detail and explain why the judgment must be affirmed.
as history reveals,there has long been a common law proscription against public officials having a financial interest in contracts created by them in their official capacities.breakzone billiards city of torrance th,d.in,the legislature codified the proscription when it enacted section to curb conflicts of interest with respect to contracts,purchases and sales made by public officials.breakzone,supra,at,d.section is triggered when a public official has a direct financial interest in a contract.even when a public official financial interest is indirect,section will still apply unless the interest is too remote and speculative.breakzone,at,d.
the evil to be thwarted by section is easily identified if a public official is pulled in one direction by his financial interest and in another direction by his official duties,his judgment can not and should not be trusted,even if he attempts impartiality.see people honig th,d honig.the lessons of human foibles and frailties teach that an impairment of impartial judgment can occur in even the most men when their personal economic interests are affected by the business they transact on behalf of the government.citation.ibid.for these reasons,section is aimed at any interest,other than an interest that is too remote or speculative,that could compromise a public official judgment or cast doubt on whether he executed his duties with the utmost allegiance,diligence,and loyalty to his office.see thomson call cal d,thomson noting that no man can faithfully serve two masters whose interests are or may be in conflict.properly understood,section stands as a prophylactic against the temptations that might corrupt or influence public officials.thomson,supra,at,the statute is more concerned with what might have happened than with what actually happened.it attempts to prevent honest government agents from succumbing to temptation by making it illegal for them to enter into relationships which are fraught with temptation honig,supra,th at,d in view of the purposes of our statutes,it is well established that their scope is not limited to instances of actual fraud,dishonesty,unfairness or loss to the governmental entity,and criminal responsibility is assessed without regard to whether the contract in question is fair or oppressive thus,it has been repeatedly held that such matters are irrelevant under section.as thomson noted it follows from the goals of eliminating temptation,avoiding the appearance of impropriety,and assuring the city of the officer undivided and uncompromised allegiance that the violation of section can not turn on the question of whether actual fraud or dishonesty was involved.nor is an actual loss to the city or public agency necessary for a section violation.thomson,supra,cal d at,fn.omitted.
when section is transgressed,the public entity involved is entitled to recover any compensation that it paid under the contract without restoring any of the benefits it received.citations.the contract is against the express prohibition of the law,and courts will not entertain any rights growing out of such a contract,or permit a recovery upon quantum meruit or quantum valebat.citations.this principle applies without regard to the willfulness of the violation.a person who violates section,regardless of whether the violation is intentional,forfeits any rights or interests flowing from the illegal contract.citation.finnegan schrader th,d finnegan.
the rule of forfeiture is not an outmoded remedy blind to equity.it is,rather,a remedy that is utilitarian in its design it recognizes what is equitable for the community and necessarily subordinates the individual in a given case.ultimately,this policy serves all individuals because they comprise our communities and need every guarantee the law can provide that they will be free from the tyranny of corrupt politicians and the burden of contracts tainted by conflicts of interest.
existence of a financial interest.
the padillas tell us that there has not been a published california opinion in over years stating whether a public official who receives an extortion payment to approve a contract has a financial interest in the contract.according to the padillas,fajardo did not have a financial interest or a conflict of interest.for this reason,they contend that there is no basis for applying section.we disagree.in our view,fajardo had a financial interest in the buydown agreement that triggered section.that financial interest was neither remote nor speculative because it created an immediate and palpable conflict of interest it divided his loyalties between his greed and promise to vote for the buydown agreement on one hand,and his duty to the interests of the city of carson on the other hand.
a.the hobbs act.
before reaching the issue posed by the padillas,we must first determine whether this case involves extortion.we conclude that it does.
title of the united state code section a makes it a crime to affect commerce through extortion.extortion is defined in title of the united states code section b as the obtaining of property from another,with his consent,induced by threatened force or fear.as explained by united states greger cir,courts interpreting this language have focused on the intent of the defendant to induce payment through the use of threats or the exploitation of fears in his victim,and the reasonable state of mind of the victim based on his words,actions,and perceptions.citations.fear in this context has been held to include fear of economic loss.
the undisputed facts and reasonably deducible inferences suggest that fajardo exploited the fear of michael padilla that without the continuing rental assistance or the proposed mortgage buydown,he and his wife would no longer be able to afford the debt service on the camino senior village.
b.an extortion payment creates an indirect financial interest.
our task is to interpret section and analyze whether it was triggered by fajardo act of extorting money from the padillas.as we recently stated in watson land shell oil th,d when interpreting a statute,we must ascertain the intent of the legislature so as to effectuate the purpose of the law.citation.we must look first to the words of the statute themselves,giving to the language its usual,ordinary import and according significance,if possible,to every word,phrase and sentence in pursuance of the legislative purpose.a construction making some words surplusage is to be avoided.the words of the statute must be construed in context,keeping in mind the statutory purpose,and statutes or statutory sections relating to the same subject must be harmonized,both internally and with each other,to the extent possible.citations.where uncertainty exists consideration should be given to the consequences that will flow from a particular interpretation.citation.both the legislative history of the statute and the wider historical circumstances of its enactment may be considered in ascertaining the legislative intent.citations.citation.a close cousin of the foregoing quote is the rule that the objective sought to be achieved by a statute as well as the evil to be prevented is of prime consideration in its interpretation.citations.citations.
the padillas lobby us to restrictively interpret the phrase city officers shall not be financially interested in any contract made by them in their official capacity in section to mean only that city officers can not make a public contract and then obtain some kind of benefit that flows from the existence,performance or implementation of that contract.thus,they essentially encourage us to hold that tainted public contracts escape avoidance under section as long as bribes,extortion payments or other favors received by the public officials can not be linked directly to the terms of those tainted public contracts.courting such a holding,however,flies in the face of case law.t he legislature was not concerned with the technical terms and rules applicable to the making of contracts,but instead sought to establish rules governing the conduct of governmental officials.citation.accordingly,those provisions can not be given a narrow and technical interpretation that would limit their scope and defeat the legislative purpose.citations.honig,supra,th at,d.in particular,the term financially interested in section can not be interpreted in a restricted and technical manner.the law does not require that a public officer acquire a transferable interest in the forbidden contract before he may be amenable to the inhibition of the statute,nor does it require that the officer share directly in the profits to be realized from a contract in order to have a prohibited interest in it.citations.honig,supra,at,d.
the padillas rejoinder to the authority against them is the following argument t he commission of crimes of extortion by public officials do es not create prohibited financial interests,automatically voiding agreements between the victims of the extortion and the public entity,because extortion payments flow from the fear created and wielded by the extortionists.the e xtortionists do not owe their loyalty to the agreement,which is nothing more than the means to their corrupt ends,or the contracting parties who are their victims.they cite no law for this proposition,nor could they.only by trying to revise the law to suit their purposes can they claim that public officials who are extortionists have no conflicts.suffice it to say,this argument does not match the cases turned up by our research.
it is not the type,size or source of interest that a public official obtains or is promised that matters when applying section.rather,it is the potential impact of that interest on a public official integrity that demands attention.see honig,supra,th at,d.the sweep of section is broad within its reach comes any interest that might deter a public official from the most righteous and noble path of civil service possible.stigall city of taft cal d.if any interest compromises a public official fidelity such that he may be influenced by personal considerations rather than the public good terry bender d,then there must be a mechanism to ameliorate the concomitant injury to society.section is that mechanism.it would lose much of its sting if it were not permissible to unravel the machinations of criminal minds and trace their paths of deceit to pinpoint indirect financial interests that might influence public officials.see people watson d.
