busch invited his was nineteen at the her friends anne huffman and ricci kowalski to his simpson college dorm room for a party.all three women accepted busch invitation with the expectation that there would be alcohol served at the party.a friend of busch purchased the bottle of vodka and a bottle of the party.busch and hildreth contributed money to the alcohol and other party supplies.
after consuming an unknown quantity of alcohol,freeman became visibly intoxicated.busch,with the assistance of huffman and kowalski,carried freeman to his bedroom to lie down.freeman became ill,vomited on her clothes and passed out.busch and others helped her to change her clothes.eventually the others left to attend a fraternity party,leaving freeman and busch alone in busch bedroom.at some point later,busch left his fourth floor room and went downstairs to the third floor of his dormitory.while there,he had a conversation with the resident assistant,brian huggins.busch informed huggins that freeman was his visitor that she had consumed alcohol and that after consuming it,she had vomited and passed out.huggins told knew busch because both served as simpson college security monitor freeman condition and,if the condition worsened,to report back to him.
later that evening,busch and freeman had sexual intercourse.busch claims that they had consensual sex after freeman awoke.freeman,who can not remember what happened after she became inebriated,alleged that busch sexually assaulted her.after busch and freeman sexual encounter,the others returned from the fraternity party to busch dorm room.when hatfield was getting ready to leave,busch called him into the bedroom.busch directed hatfield attention to a freeman and permitted him to fondle her breasts.busch later also admitted that he permitted hildreth to do the same.
the next morning freeman awoke on busch couch,unable to remember what had happened the previous evening.she first became suspicious that something may have happened when she went to the bathroom,discovered that her underwear was on backwards,and realized that her tampon was crushed.

on appeal freeman raises two issues that merit discussion first,freeman appeals the district court grants of summary judgment.in addition,she appeals the dismissal of her claim for punitive damages.we discuss each claim in turn.
freeman initially argues that the district court erroneously granted simpson college and busch motions for summary judgment.we review de novo grant s of summary judgment,applying the same standard as the district court.forrest kraft foods,cir citation omitted.summary judgment is proper if the evidence,viewed in the light most favorable to the nonmoving party,demonstrates that no genuine issue of material fact exists and the moving party is entitled to judgment as a matter of law.thomas union pac,cir citation omitted.in this diversity case,we also review the district court interpretation of state law de novo.walk starkey,cir citations omitted.the district court addressed each of the grants of summary judgment separately.so do we.
first,freeman alleged a claim of negligence against simpson college.in this claim,freeman alleged in part that simpson college should be liable for the negligence of its and the doctrine of respondeat superior.however,the doctrine of respondeat superior provides that an employer is liable for the negligent acts of its employees,only if the employees acts were within the scope of their employment.godar edwards,iowa.in this case,it is undisputed that neither busch nor huggins was on duty as a university security guard.as a result,simpson college can not be responsible for any negligent acts that their employees may perform while off duty restatement second of agency cmt.d the master liability for the servant tortious conduct ordinarily exists only during such times and in such places as he is authorized to perform service,or at times and places reasonably close to them.see also restatement second of agency.nevertheless,simpson college concedes that huggins was acting within the scope of his duties as an thus,if huggins was negligent as an,then simpson college could be liable for any of his negligent acts.
in order to prove a case of negligence against huggins,freeman must establish that huggins owed her a legal duty that he breached that duty and that the breach of the duty caused her damages.hartig francois,iowa citations omitted.freeman argues that huggins owed her legal duties based upon and of the restatement second of torts.
freeman first argues that huggins owed her a legal duty based upon restatement.in essence,she argues that a special relationship existed between freeman and huggins,which imposed such a duty on huggins to act for freeman protection.see restatement second of torts.usually the law recognizes that a special relationship exists between persons in a relationship of dependence or of mutual dependence.id.cmt.commonly recognized special relations under restatement include common,and peace.garofalo lambda chi alpha fraternity,iowa citing restatement second of torts,at.freeman urges us to recognize a new special relationship one between a college and a guest of a student attending that college.freeman does not cite,and we can find no cases that so hold.
in fact,since the late,the general rule is that no special relationship exists between a college and its own students because a college is not an insurer of the safety of its students.see,bradshaw rawlings,cir holding that the time in which colleges and universities assumed a role in loco parentis no longer exists and as a result no special custodial duty between a college and its students exists booker lehigh,finding no special relationship nero,same of denver whitlock,en banc same eiseman state,same beach of utah,utah same rabel illinois wesleyan,d,holding that the responsibility of a university is to properly educate its students,not to act as their custodian baldwin zoradi,d.finding no special relationship garofalo,at analogizing the lack of a
