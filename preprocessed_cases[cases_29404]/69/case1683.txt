the consumer warranty act hereafter sometimes the act or the act,civil code section et provides,in section,subdivision d,that when a manufacturer does not repair a motor vehicle to conform to an express warranty after a reasonable number of attempts,the buyer may opt to have the item replaced,or may return the item and obtain restitution for its cost hereafter sometimes the remedy.in the present case,the trial court found that plaintiff rosemarie gavaldon dodge caravan minivan was substantially impaired because of a defective transmission that defendant daimlerchrysler corporation and its representatives hereafter daimlerchrysler had been unable to repair after numerous attempts.the court found that the defect arose after the expiration of gavaldon mile warranty.nonetheless,the court concluded that gavaldon was entitled to section,subdivision d remedy because the transmission defect was covered by gavaldon mile service contract,and that,for purposes of the act,a service contract was a type of express warranty.the trial court therefore awarded gavaldon the purchase price of the vehicle,minus the value attributed to its past use see,subd.d c,for a total of,plus attorney fees provided under the act.the court of appeal disagreed and reversed the trial court award.gavaldon petition for review calls on us to decide whether a service contract is an express warranty within the meaning of the act.we conclude that it is not.
gavaldon also contends that even if a service contract is not an express warranty,section,governing remedies available under the act,authorizes the remedy for breaches of service contracts.as explained below,we conclude gavaldon misreads the statute.gavaldon also contends that she may prevail on the theory that she properly revoked acceptance of the vehicle,and is therefore authorized to be reimbursed for the vehicle under section,subdivision b,which expressly incorporates various commercial code remedies into the act.we conclude the court of appeal is correct that she did not properly raise this issue below,and we will not consider it here.we also conclude that gavaldon did not properly raise in the court of appeal the issue of whether the judgment in her favor could be sustained on the theory that daimlerchrysler breach of the service contract entitled her to damages based on the diminution in the value of the automobile.
statement of facts 
the facts below are taken largely from the court of appeal opinion.gavaldon bought her new dodge caravan minivan in june.the vehicle came with daimlerchrysler standard factory warranty under which the owner could choose either a mile basic warranty the warranty or a mile basic warranty plus a mile power train coverage.gavaldon stipulated,and the trial court found,that the warranty applied.
when gavaldon purchased the minivan,she also purchased a service contract,issued by daimlerchrysler,for an additional.the service contract provided it was to protect the buyer against major repair bills should a component covered by the plan fail in normal use.the stated coverage was the plan will pay the total cost parts and labor less a deductible per visit,to correct any of the following part failures,due to a defect in materials or workmanship,not covered by the vehicle limited warranties.covered components included power train parts such as the engine and transmission.the service contract advised the buyer that the vehicle might also be covered by a manufacturer limited warranty,that only vehicles covered by one of daimlerchrysler standard limited warranties are eligible for the service contract,and that it did not cover r epair or replacement of any component covered by the vehicle factory warranty or recall policies.it provided that coverage for repairs would not start until the vehicle limited warranties expired,and would end years after the factory warranty start date or when the vehicle has accumulated total miles of service whichever occurs first.the service contract warned the buyer,important the maximum reimbursable amount should a covered component fail will be the total cost of the repairs less the deductible or,if less,the cash value of the vehicle 
after she had driven the minivan about miles,gavaldon began to notice the transmission was slipping.although she took the vehicle to the dealer for regular service at miles,miles and miles,she made no mention of any transmission problems.
at miles,and again at miles,gavaldon took the minivan to the dealer for regular service and complained the transmission was shifting hard and getting stuck in gear.on both occasions,the dealer investigated but found no problems.
at miles,the vehicle transmission became stuck in mode and was towed to the dealership.in mode,the vehicle gets locked in second gear to protect the transmission from further damage while permitting the car to be driven at a reduced speed to a repair facility.the transmission was removed,overhauled,and the torque converter replaced.the repairs were covered by the service contract.
at miles,gavaldon took the minivan to the dealer,complaining it was stalling at stops and surging as if running out of gas.the throttle position sensor,spark plug wires,and transmission controller were replaced.these repairs were covered by the emissions systems warranty.
at miles,the vehicle was towed to the dealer because of overheating.the water pump,water pump gasket,and a heater hose were replaced and the repairs were covered by the service contract.although the dealer records made no mention of complaints about the transmission,gavaldon testified the car was stuck in mode and she complained about the transmission.
at miles,gavaldon brought the car in,complaining the transmission was slipping in and out of mode.the solenoid pack,which controls the transmission hydraulic fluid,was replaced,as were a throttle positioning sensor and wiring harness.
at the same time in february,gavaldon wrote to the dealer,and then directly to daimlerchrysler,complaining of the vehicle chronic transmission problems and asking that it be repurchased or replaced.her request was denied.
at miles,gavaldon brought the car to the dealer complaining about the transmission hard shifting and slipping.the dealer determined that the front and rear brakes were in disrepair,that they had been worked on by another repair shop,and that it could not authorize its service personnel to drive the vehicle without first repairing the brakes.gavaldon did not authorize that work.the dealer was unable to verify or diagnose the transmission complaint.
in july,at miles,the minivan again got stuck in mode and was towed to the dealer.the transmission was completely replaced.the service contract covered the cost of the repairs.this new transmission was itself replaced at miles under a parts warranty because it was leaking.
gavaldon testified that these measures did not solve her transmission problem,and she continued to experience hard shifting and slipping.she did not present the minivan for further repairs.in october,she filed her complaint alleging daimlerchrysler had breached its obligations under section,subdivision d,by failing to promptly replace or repurchase the minivan when it was unable to conform the vehicle to the applicable express warranties after a reasonable number of attempts.she also alleged daimlerchrysler breached the express warranty under the act and common law.gavaldon alleged the vehicle was covered by the warranty,a defect arose while that express warranty was still in effect,and daimlerchrysler breached the express warranty by failing to remedy the defect.at trial,gavaldon was permitted to amend her complaint to allege breach of the service contract as well.
a jury trial ended in a mistrial when the judge became ill.a second trial,this time a bench trial,commenced.before it began,the trial court ruled the service contract was not an express warranty under the act.
on august,the court issued a tentative ruling in favor of daimlerchrysler.it concluded the minivan transmission was defective,but that the defect arose after the applicable warranty had expired.it concluded the service contract was not an express warranty.thus,the court stated,the only remedy available to plaintiff is the repairs under the service agreement.a judgment for daimlerchrysler was entered on august.
on september,gavaldon filed a notice of intention to move for a new trial.at a hearing on september,the court noted that its august ruling was only a tentative ruling and it had now reached a different conclusion about the nature of the service contract.the court stated the august judgment had been entered by mistake the court had not intended that a final judgment be entered because it had not yet finished deciding the case and vacated the august judgment.
on september,the court issued a new tentative ruling in favor of gavaldon.in response to daimlerchrysler request,the court issued a formal statement of decision on october,which included answers to questions posed by daimlerchrysler.the court concluded that the service contract constituted an express warranty,a conclusion it believed to be compelled by the holding in reveles toyota by the bay th,d reveles.given that conclusion,and given the trial court finding that plaintiffs suffered damages from having purchased an automobile that was substantially impaired,the trial court ruled that gavaldon was entitled to the remedy set forth in section,subdivision d.the court concluded that daimlerchrysler was entitled to an offset for the use of the vehicle until the time gavaldon first delivered it for correction,pursuant to section,subdivision c,which it determined to be at miles,when the transmission first became stuck in mode.further,the trial court found that gavaldon was entitled to costs,including attorney fees,but not to civil penalties.in response to the question whether gavaldon would have the remedy under the act if the service contract purchased at additional cost is not considered an express warranty under the act,the trial court replied not at the time this decision was brought.
a judgment awarding gavaldon purchase price minus a deduction for actual use of the vehicle was entered on november.daimlerchrysler appealed the november judgment.a postjudgment order awarded gavaldon in attorney fees and costs.daimlerchrysler appealed that order as well and the two appeals were consolidated.
the court of appeal reversed.after reviewing the statutory language and legislative history of the act,it concluded that the service contract could not be considered an express warranty under the act.it further concluded that reveles was distinguishable on various grounds.it also rejected gavaldon contention that the judgment could be upheld on the alternative ground that it was an appropriate award for breach of the service contract,holding that the trial court had rejected that theory and sufficient evidence supported the trial court ruling.the court rejected as not properly raised below gavaldon further claim that she was entitled to the damages award under a provision of the commercial code because she had revoked acceptance of the vehicle.it also reversed gavaldon award of costs and attorney fees.we granted review.
ii.discussion 
is a service contract an express warranty within the meaning of the act 
the act,in section,subdivision d,provides in pertinent part that i f the manufacturer or its representative in this state is unable to service or repair a new motor vehicle to conform to the applicable express warranties after a reasonable number of attempts,the manufacturer shall either promptly replace the new motor vehicle or promptly make restitution to the buyer however,the buyer shall be free to elect restitution in lieu of replacement,and in no event shall the buyer be required by the manufacturer to accept a replacement vehicle.gavaldon argues that a service contract is an express warranty within the meaning of that section and the act generally,and therefore she is entitled to the remedy,as the trial court concluded.daimlerchrysler contends that the court of appeal is correct in holding that a service contract is not an express warranty,and the judgment can not be sustained.we conclude that daimlerchrysler is correct.
daimlerchrysler essentially advances two arguments as to why a service contract can not be considered an express warranty a service contract,as defined by statute,does not fit the statutory definition of express warranty and aside from the definitions,the terms service contract and express warranty are used together in the statute in such a way as to make clear that they are mutually exclusive terms.we find the second persuasive.the legislative history of the act provides additional support for daimlerchrysler interpretation.
the definitions of express warranty and service contract 
an express warranty under the act is defined in section in pertinent part as follows a a written statement arising out of a sale to the consumer of a consumer good pursuant to which the manufacturer,distributor,or retailer undertakes to preserve or maintain the utility or performance of the consumer good or provide compensation if there is a failure in utility or performance b it is not necessary to the creation of an express warranty that formal words such as warrant or guarantee be used,but if such words are used then an express warranty is created.an affirmation merely of the value of the goods or a statement purporting to be merely an opinion or commendation of the goods does not create a warranty.c statements or representations such as expressions of general policy concerning customer satisfaction which are not subject to any limitation do not create an express warranty.
section,subdivision o provides service contract means a contract in writing to perform,for an additional cost,over a fixed period of time or for a specified duration,services relating to the maintenance,replacement,or repair of a consumer product,except that this term does not include a policy of automobile insurance,as defined in section of the insurance code.
daimlerchrysler argues that an express warranty arises out of the sale of a consumer good see,subd.a because it is a representation integrally included in the purchase price a service contract does not because it offers additional performance purchased for additional cost.see,subd.o.moreover,it argues,section addresses the sale of a service contract,implying that a service contract is sold separately from the consumer good,and therefore can not be said to arise out of the sale of the latter.gavaldon points out,however,that the purchase of her automobile and her service contract were part of the same transaction,concluded at the same time,and therefore the service contract would be reasonably understood to arise out of the sale of the automobile.see reveles,supra,th at,d.
we need not decide which party has the better argument.as discussed below,another reason supports the conclusion that daimlerchrysler position is correct.
the use of the terms together in the statute 
the terms service contract and express warranty are used together in several sections of the act in such a way as to indicate,daimlerchrysler argues,that the legislature conceived of them as distinct entities.section,subdivision a,for example,provides the service contract is applicable only to items,costs,and time periods not covered by the express warranty.however,a service contract may run concurrently with or overlap an express warranty if a the contract covers items or costs not covered by the express warranty or b the contract provides relief to the purchaser not available under the express warranty,such as automatic replacement of a product where the express warranty only provides for repair.italics added.
section,subdivision a provides that nothing in this chapter shall be construed to prevent the sale of a service contract to the buyer in addition to,or in lieu of,an express warranty if that contract fully and conspicuously discloses in simple and readily understood language the terms,conditions and exclusions of that contract italics added.and section,subdivision a provides any buyer of consumer goods who is damaged by a failure to comply with any obligation under this chapter or under an implied or express warranty or service contract may bring an action for the recovery of damages and other legal and equitable relief.italics added.
the above three statutes indicate that the legislature not only conceived of service contracts as distinct from express warranties,but intended the two categories to be mutually exclusive.section,subdivision a,does not permit a service contract to cover the same items as an express warranty.section specifies that service contracts are sold in addition to or in lieu of express warranties.and section refers to express warranties and service contracts in the alternative.if express warranties and service contracts were intended to overlap,then these sections would have been phrased differently,by modifying the term express warranty to at least leave open the possibility of overlap.for example,section,subdivision a might have read nothing in this chapter shall be construed to prevent the sale of a service contract to the buyer in addition to,or in lieu of,an express warranty that is included in the original price of the consumer good if that contract fully and conspicuously discloses in simple and readily understood language the terms,conditions and exclusions that contract without such a modifier to the term express warranty,it is difficult to escape the inference that the legislature considered service contracts to be categorically distinct from express warranties.
the legislative history of the act supports this interpretation.as originally enacted,the act sole reference to service contracts was the provision in section allowing service contracts to be sold in addition to or in lieu of express warranties.stats,ch.the act was amended in to,among other things,specify in section,subdivision a,that the term consumer goods with which the act was concerned signified new goods.stats,ch.at the same time,section was added to extend the act application to used consumer goods sold with express warranties.it provided that,notwithstanding the definition of consumer goods as new goods,the obligation of a distributor or retail seller of used consumer goods in a sale in which an express warranty is given shall be the same as that imposed on the manufacturer under this chapter,with certain enumerated exceptions.stats,ch.
in response to concerns about the prospective enactment of section from the northern california motorcar dealers association,senator song staff assured the association that the proposed remedies with respect to express warranties on used vehicles would not apply to used vehicles with service contracts.that response is perhaps the clearest window we have into the legislature reason for distinguishing between a service contract and an express warranty.it stated you may be correct that the distinction between a warranty and a service contract is purely one of semantics,but such is often the most important kind.i believe the words guarantee and warranty possess a meaning that service contract does not share.we think that an as is sale,with or without a service contract,will better inform the public as to what they are actually buying than a sale accompanied by the express warranties presently used in the used car trade.richard thomsen,admin.to song,letter to wallace.
it is true that,functionally speaking,warranties and service contracts appear to have the same guarantee the repair or replacement of certain products or parts of products for a specified period of time.but,as the above passage suggests,the legislature apparently conceived of an express warranty as being part of the purchase of a consumer product,and a representation of the fitness of that product that has particular meaning for consumers.in contrast,it apparently thought of the purchase of a service contract as distinct from the purchase of the product,and not as a representation of fitness but only an agreement to provide repair services,a kind of insurance.hence,one difference between express warranties and service contracts is that the latter is generally purchased for an additional cost,subd.o.
in arguing that express warranties and service contracts do indeed overlap,gavaldon points to language in the definition of express warranty in section stating that i t is not necessary to the creation of an express warranty that formal words such as warranty or guarantee be used,but if such words are used then an express warranty is created.therefore,a service contract that is denominated an extended warranty,as service contracts are sometimes called,will also be an express warranty under section,and therefore subject to the remedy.
this argument does not assist gavaldon.as discussed above,the legislature apparently believed that the terms warrant or guarantee had particular significance to consumers.and because the legislature generally conceived of service contracts and extended warranties as falling into distinct categories,it also provided that a manufacturer that confused those categories by labeling service contracts as warranties should assume the obligations imposed on manufacturers that issued express warranties.daimlerchrysler did not so label its service contract in the present case.
gavaldon also argues that sections and are antifraud provisions,designed to protect a consumer who pays for an express warranty,as part of the price of the vehicle or other consumer good,from paying extra for a service contract that partly provides the same coverage as the warranty.assuming she is correct,such purpose is nonetheless wholly consistent with the legislature view that service contract and express warranty should be considered distinct entities.
in sum,reading the various portions of the act,together with relevant legislative history,it appears that the legislature thought of service contracts and express warranties as mutually exclusive categories,except when the manufacturer chooses to use the terms warrant or guarantee in a service contract.when,as here,the manufacturer has not used those terms in its service contract,the breach of its service contract does not make it subject to the remedy reserved in section,subdivision d for purchasers of motor vehicles sold with express warranties.
the reveles case 
gavaldon argues that the above conclusion conflicts with the court of appeal holding in reveles,supra,th,d.the court of appeal in the present case usefully summarized reveles in that case,the plaintiff purchased a used vehicle from a dealership.the sale was as is,without an express warranty,so he also purchased a vehicle service agreement covering repair of mechanical failures of various parts for two years or miles.two months later,the front end of the car suddenly dropped,and the dealer mechanic told the plaintiff the vehicle had significant preexisting frame damage and could not be repaired.nonetheless,the dealer refused the plaintiff demand it replace the vehicle or refund his purchase price,insisting repairs would be made.reveles,at,d.
the plaintiff sued the dealer for breach of contract,rescission and restitution,negligent and intentional misrepresentation,breach of the consumers legal remedies act et and breach of the act.after rejecting the plaintiff repeated offers to settle for,on the morning of trial the dealer announced it would settle for that amount.the plaintiff settled but reserved his right to move for attorney fees and costs to which he argued he was entitled under various statutes,including the act.the trial court eventually found the plaintiff was the prevailing party and awarded him in attorney fees,plus expert witness fees and costs.reveles,supra,th at,d.
the court of appeal affirmed the award,concluding in part that the plaintiff was the prevailing party under the act,and was therefore entitled to costs and attorney fees pursuant to section,subdivision d.reveles,supra,th at,d.in so deciding,the court had to address the argument that the act remedies do not apply to used vehicles sold as is.as discussed ante,the act generally applies to the purchase of consumer goods which are generally defined as being new goods,subd.a.notwithstanding that definition,section provides,as noted ante,that the act also applies to used consumer goods in a sale in which an express warranty is
