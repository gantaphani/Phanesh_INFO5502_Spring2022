this appeal involves the parties ongoing dispute over the efforts of torpharm,apotex,and apotex corporation collectively,apotex to market a generic version of depakote,an medication containing divalproex sodium patented,produced,and sold by abbott laboratories abbott.apotex now appeals from a final judgment of the united states district court for the northern district of illinois holding apotex in contempt for violating an injunction barring it from commercially manufacturing,using,selling,offering to sell,or importing into the united states generic divalproex sodium infringing abbott patent and until their expiration.abbott labs.apotex,d,abbott v.the charged conduct was the filing of a repetitive abbreviated new drug application anda with the food and drug administration fda.we uphold the district court decision to entertain a contempt proceeding as well within its discretionary authority.however,because the district court erred in finding apotex in contempt when the conduct at issue was not within the express terms of the injunction,we reverse the district court judgment of contempt.
this is the third time the parties are before us,and a brief history of the facts is warranted.in,apotex filed anda the apotex anda under the provisions of the drug price competition and patent term restoration act,stat.codified as amended at and the act,seeking fda approval to manufacture and sell a generic version of depakote.the active ingredient of depakote is divalproex sodium.abbott owns two patents directed to divalproex sodium patent and collectively,the abbott patents.the claims of the abbott patents recite an oligomer containing about to repeating units of divalproex sodium.in its anda,apotex certified under j a vii iv paragraph iv certification that the abbott patents are invalid.
abbott responded by filing suit against apotex for patent infringement under e a.the district court granted summary judgment in favor of abbott on both validity and infringement.abbott labs.torpharm,d abbott i.on appeal,this court affirmed the ruling on validity but remanded for a trial on infringement.abbott labs.torpharm,abbott ii.we held that,when making all reasonable inferences in favor of apotex,a genuine issue of material fact was raised by the evidence as to whether apotex product was an oligomer having about to repeating units as required by abbott claims.id.at.
on remand,judge posner of the united states court of appeals for the seventh circuit,sitting by designation in the united states district court for the northern district of illinois,conducted a bench trial,then concluded that apotex filing of the apotex anda infringed the claims of the abbott patents because abbott claims read on the product that was the subject of the apotex anda.abbott labs.torpharm,d abbott iii.in that case,the district court found that abbott proved by a preponderance of the evidence that apotex product is an oligomer of to sic units of divalproex sodium and therefore infringes abbott patent.id.at.accordingly,the district court entered the following injunction 
torpharm,apotex,apotex,and their respective affiliates,successors in interest,and assigns are enjoined from commercially manufacturing,using,selling,or offering to sell generic divalproex sodium which the court has found to be infringing within the united states,or from importing such product into the united states,until abbott patent and expire and defendants have received final approval from fda to market generic divalproex sodium.
the effective date of any approval by fda of anda,or any other application concerning defendants generic divalproex sodium which the court has found to be infringing,shall be no earlier than january,the date of expiration of abbott patent and.

apotex appealed the district court judgment of infringement and the injunction,which this court affirmed without opinion following oral argument.abbott labs.torpharm.abbott iv.
apotex,according to its evidence,then attempted to design around abbott patent claims and allegedly developed divalproex sodium in the form of a polymer which differs from an oligomer in that the polymer is made up of much more than about to repeating units of divalproex sodium.rather than file a new anda itself,however,apotex entered into an informal agreement with,whereby apotex would pay for costs associated with preparation of a new anda filing but nupharm would take on what apotex characterizes as the litigation risks arising from such a filing 
on march,filed anda the anda under j seeking fda approval to manufacture and sell a mg divalproex sodium product.made a paragraph iv certification that its product did not infringe the claims of the abbott patents.abbott filed a complaint for patent infringement under e a against in the northern district of illinois on june,alleging that the anda also infringed the abbott patent claims.the case was routinely assigned to district judge pallmeyer.in march,filed an amended anda seeking fda approval of mg and mg divalproex sodium products.shortly thereafter,on may,abbott filed a second section e a action for patent infringement,this time against both and apotex,who abbott apparently had just learned were acting in concert.in its complaint,abbott alleged that apotex was the true party in interest behind the anda and the product described therein.the case,also filed in the northern district of illinois,was assigned in the normal course to district judge guzman.upon motion by abbott,the latter action was reassigned for related case treatment before judge pallmeyer.
on august,moved before judge pallmeyer for summary judgment of noninfringement of the abbott patent claims.the same day,abbott filed a motion to enforce its injunction order before judge posner still sitting by designation in the northern district of illinois in the original case,and filed a motion to stay the proceedings before judge pallmeyer.judge pallmeyer,after ordering two continuations,granted the stay on october.
meanwhile,contempt proceedings continued before judge posner,who issued a decision on october,finding apotex in contempt for violating the injunction issued in abbott iii.abbott v,d at.after first confirming the district court authority to enforce its own injunctions,judge posner characterized the injunction as extending to any generic divalproex sodium manufactured by apotex that has been found to be infringing.id.at.he then found that there was no difference between apotex old product and its new product let alone a colorable difference,and that,based upon the evidence presented by the parties,apotex new product would infringe the claims of the abbott patents.id.at.accordingly,on october,the district court extend ed the injunction to embrace the anda.specifically,the expanded injunction prohibited apotex from 
commercially manufacturing,using,selling,or offering to sell generic divalproex sodium which the court has found to be infringing,including divalproex sodium products synthesized using the processes employed in connection with anda,within the united states,or from importing such products into the united states,until abbott patent and expire and defendants have received final approval from fda to market generic divalproex sodium.
id.at.no sanctions were imposed.instead,the district court stated that should the violation continue,apotex will be risking heavy sanctions for its willful disobedience of the injunction.id.
final judgment was entered on october,against apotex.this appeal followed.this court has jurisdiction to review the appeal under a.
on appeal,apotex argues that the contempt proceeding was beyond the district court statutory authority because the act does not itself grant a district court subject matter jurisdiction to conduct such contempt proceedings.therefore,asserts apotex,the contempt proceeding was a nullity.in the alternative,apotex argues that contempt proceedings were improper in any event,because the infringement inquiry was amenable only to trial under the federal rules of civil procedure.we address each argument in turn below.
we review subject matter jurisdiction de novo.kunkel topmaster int l.apotex argues that a contempt proceeding is unlawful in the context of a suit because such a lawsuit is filed before the accused infringer has engaged in any classically infringing,making,using,selling or offering to sell,or importing into the the patented drug.apotex argues that,because it did not engage in any of these activities but merely filed a second anda,it has at most committed an act of artificial infringement and therefore can not be called to answer for any alleged violation of the first injunction in a contempt proceeding.
apotex characterization of classically infringing activity is legally meaningless.as we have held numerous times,the filing of a paragraph iv certification is itself an act of infringement if the purpose of the anda submission is to obtain the fda approval to engage in the commercial manufacture,use,or sale of a patented drug before expiration of the drug patent.bayer ag elan pharm.research,glaxo,novopharm,see also e a.while the supreme court has characterized infringement as defined in the act as highly artificial,see eli lilly medtronic,d,by statutory command it is infringement nonetheless.apotex has failed to provide any authority,be it statute,case law,or legislative history of the act,suggesting that suits commenced under the provisions of the act are to be treated any differently than patent infringement suits under a.indeed,we have previously held that the district court infringement analysis in a suit is no different than that in any other patent infringement suit.glaxo,at.
further,apotex errs by looking only to the district court authority under the act when principles of equity govern injunctions in patent disputes just as in disputes in other areas of law.see ebay mercexchange,d.the power of a district court to enforce its injunction through contempt proceedings is no different,and section j b iii of title does not counsel otherwise.the statute is simply silent regarding a district court contempt authority.because we assume congress familiarity with general principles of law when enacting a statute,congress must have intended for the courts to maintain their inherent authority to enforce their own injunctions under the principles of equity.see raney federal bureau of prisons,congress is presumed to enact legislation with knowledge of the law and a statute is presumed to be harmonious with existing law and judicial concepts.citing cannon of,d.therefore,the district court clearly had subject matter jurisdiction.
apotex asserts that the district court abused its discretion in proceeding via a contempt proceeding because any determination of infringement in this case would require scientific testing,expert opinions,and a host of credibility determinations that would preclude a contempt proceeding.appellant br.at.it is true that we have counseled against contempt proceedings of a summary nature where expert and other testimony subject to would be helpful or necessary.arbek,moazzam,quoting ksm fastening,jones.however,we have said so in the context of a former infringer who has made a effort to modify a previously adjudged or admitted infringing device to remain in the marketplace.arbek,at.the district court found that apotex choice of to file the anda was a subterfuge intended to give apotex a crack at another district judge who might find that anda drug noninfringing.abbott v,d at.we do not disturb that finding,and conclude that the district court did not abuse its discretion in electing to try issues relating to the anda in a contempt proceeding.see also additive controls measurement,flowdata,need for expert testimony not dispositive.
notwithstanding the above,we have held that before entering a judgment of contempt of an injunction in a patent infringement case,a district court must address two separate questions.first,the district court must address whether a contempt hearing is an appropriate forum for adjudging whether an allegedly redesigned product is infringing.ksm fastening,at additive controls,at.in doing so,the district court must compare the accused product with the original infringing product.if there is more than a colorable difference between the accused product and the adjudged infringing product such that substantial open issues with respect to infringement to be tried exist,contempt proceedings are not appropriate.ksm fastening,at we review the district court decision to entertain a contempt proceeding for an abuse of discretion,applying federal circuit law.id.an abuse of discretion may be established under federal circuit law by showing that the court made a clear error of judgment in weighing the relevant factors or exercised its discretion based on an error of law or clearly erroneous fact finding.lab.of am.holdings chiron,quoting int l rectifier samsung elecs.
second,if contempt proceedings are appropriate,the district court must address whether the accused product infringes the claims of the asserted patent.additive controls,at.to show infringement,the patentee must prove by clear and convincing evidence that the modified device falls within the admitted or adjudicated scope of the claims.arbek,at quoting ksm fastening,at.
here,we hold that the district court did not abuse its discretion in holding contempt proceedings.judge posner carefully reviewed the evidence presented by the parties and assessed the credibility of the witnesses.clear and convincing evidence,including apotex own evidence,supports his finding that there is no more than a colorable difference,if any,between the apotex anda drug and the anda drug.specifically,apotex own expert,stephens,testified that when he tested and compared the apotex anda drug with the anda drug,they were identical.where,as here,a party files a second anda to a drug having no more than a colorable difference from the first,the district court is well within its discretion to entertain contempt proceedings.
further,the district court did not clearly err in finding that abbott proved by clear and convincing evidence that the anda drug would infringe the claims of the abbott patents.even though the district court already had strong documentary evidence suggesting that there was no difference between the adjudicated infringing drug and the accused drug,the district court relied on fresh evidence presented by abbott expert,atwood,showing that the anda drug is an oligomer.the evidence was based on results obtained by atwood from depression,vapor phase osmometry,and fab mass spectrometry tests.the district court also found that abbott expert was more credible than apotex experts.considering all the evidence,the district court did not clearly err in holding that the nupharm anda drug would infringe the claims of the abbott patents.
from the above,it follows that judge posner acted entirely within his discretionary authority to issue an order expanding the original injunction.see conoco,energy envtl.int l,we review a district court decision to extend injunctive relief for an abuse of discretion.citing eli lilly medtronic.we note that the original injunction clearly prohibited the fda from approving the apotex application and any other application concerning defendants generic divalproex sodium which the court has found to be infringing.the language of the injunction was upheld in apotex iv and can not be challenged now.because the anda drug would infringe the claims of the abbott patents,the district court did not abuse its discretion in extending the injunction to prohibit the fda from approving the anda.therefore,we decline to vacate the revised injunction as apotex requests.
finally,apotex complains that it did not have adequate time in which to obtain formal comparative testing results.we note,however,that apotex failed to request a continuance from the district court.further,rather than follow the district court order to explain why more time was necessary,apotex simply filed further declarations.apotex can not complain now and we disregard these arguments.
we now turn to the finding of contempt.we review the district court finding of contempt for an abuse of discretion,again applying federal circuit law.ksm fastening,at.there must be clear
