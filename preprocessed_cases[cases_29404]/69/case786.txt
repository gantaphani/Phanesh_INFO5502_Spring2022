international production specialists,ips entered into a contract with schwing america,schwing to make and install five silos to store and treat sludge at a wastewater treatment plant owned by the general contractor,north shore sanitary district nssd.initially ips piece of the process was to take about eight months.after several years of attributable to nssd,some to ips,and some to events beyond anyone years after the parties signed the initial purchase order,the project still had not been completed.on february,schwing notified ips that it was cancelling the contract for cause.ips responded by suing for breach of contract and schwing countersued.the district court ruled in favor of schwing,awarding damages in the amount of.we affirm,but remand in part to correct a small error in the calculation of damages.
this case comes to this court after a trial in the district court.the facts of this case,as determined by the trial court,are long and tedious,but necessary for a full understanding of the intricacies of the relationship between the parties.
schwing and ips were both subcontractors on a larger project to build a wastewater treatment facility.in,nssd hired industries,va tech to work on the construction of its new wastewater treatment plant in waukegan,illinois,agreeing to pay it million.va tech,in turn,entered into a million subcontract with schwing to supply and install two wet sludge silos,a dry granules silo conical silos,two receiving bins,and other associated equipment for the nssd facility.pursuant to the terms of the contract with va tech,schwing obtained a performance bond.
schwing operations manager,nancy predatsch,decided to find a local contractor to fabricate the silos.a web search turned up ips,a wisconsin manufacturer of construction equipment,including standard and custom built bulk material handling equipment.on august,ips and schwing executed a purchase order in which,for payment of,ips agreed to manufacture and install at the nssd waukegan facility the five silos,incorporating the specifications and technical supplies from the va contract.
by attachment,the parties set forth a delivery,installation,and payment schedule.exh.at.according to the delivery schedule,ips was to deliver all of the silos the two receiving bins,the two wet storage,and the one dry storage by december.the installation schedule was labeled approximate and noted the following dates 
two sliding frame silos receiving bin,approximately february,
two sliding frame silos wet storage,approximately february,
one conical silo dry storage,approximately april,
id.a note below the schedule states,a ctual schedule will be dictated by progress on the plant construction contract.installation activity will need to be coordinated with the site contractor.id.the delivery schedule contains no such approximate language.
ips executive vice president,jordan kopac,managed ips work directly on site as ips worked through the late summer and fall.schwing made progress payments to ips totaling.
in november,nssd decided to suspend work on the project.consequently,on november,schwing sent ips a facsimile directing ips to cease work,but to continue fabricating the two receiving bin silos at the shop,as scheduled.schwing also informed ips that it could continue to deliver materials to the site and unload them,but they should not be fabricated on site.schwing estimated that the work stoppage would continue for ninety days and asked ips to inform schwing of any cost changes associated with the schedule change.
on april,va tech inspected ips work on the silo parts.representatives from va tech,nssd,ips,and schwing attended the inspection.the next day,a schwing representative sent out an identifying fifteen problems with the silos including improper painting and welding.a va tech representative also prepared a memorandum noting manufacturing defects,including poor painting and improper welding.at the time of the memorandum,of the receiving bin silo manufacturing had been completed,as had of the wet sludge silos and of the dried granules silos.of course,no installation had begun or was yet required.after the inspection,the project lay dormant for approximately two about february,when va tech notified schwing that nssd had restarted the project at a new site in zion,illinois and that va tech expected schwing to honor its contract.va tech did not increase its payment to schwing.
schwing,in turn,informed ips that the project was restarting and that schwing expected ips to honor its contract.schwing project manager asked ips to inform him of any additional expenses that ips might incur as a result of the change of location.
ips responded that a deep silo fabrication area in layman terms a work be necessary at the zion site and would be used to fabricate and store the wet sludge silos on site.it provided two field service quotations for a total of.
in spring,representatives from schwing,ips,va tech,and nssd met to view the project site,coordinate the silo construction site,discuss scheduling,and review potential lay down sites where ips could work on the silos.schwing asked ips vice president,kopac,to identify ips area preference and to present schwing with a proposal for reimbursement of the additional costs for relocating the project and transporting materials.
after the meeting,ips kopac called schwing project manager,david miller once,but did not identify his area preference.miller left a number of unreturned messages for kopac and eventually called ips president,jordan kopac,who informed schwing that ips would not be participating in the project because the new site was problematic.ips maintains that had a suitable work area been provided,ips would have been able to complete the project in three to four months.the new area,however,was a construction site and ips believed that the lay down area and roadways were insufficient to complete the project.
schwing solicited bids from other companies to complete ips work,but those bids were high compared to schwing contract with va tech,factoring in the payments schwing already had made to ips.consequently,schwing wrote to ips on june,asking ips to honor the contract and resume work,or,in the alternative,return all payments it received.
ips responded that the agreement it had made was for the waukegan site and not the zion site,stating further,
ips stands ready,willing and able to perform per its contract with schwing.we are not willing,however,to modify the terms of our contract and commit to the performance at a new site that poses potential pitfalls and complexities that did not exist with respect to the waukegan site.from a complexity of performance standpoint,the zion site,being a construction project,is substantially more complex.
notwithstanding ips position,schwing and ips continued to negotiate.on july,ips sent a quote to schwing indicating that for approximately,it could complete the project at the zion site.the quote contained three general notes only note one and two are relevant to this appeal.
general note 
additional costs from the original job quotation in waukegan based on an august start date with the majority of the main coned silo work expected to be completed by september.
general note 
ips has requested and has not received a zion project time lines sic from schwing,nssd or the general contractor.therefore ips will not be responsible for any monetary penalties on this project caused by unrealistic milestones,delays caused by others or acts of god.
on july,the project manager from schwing ips kopac a proposed change order which included nine additional work items with a proposed additional payment.ips increased the change order price to and noted the outstanding purchase order balance of,for a total price of.kopac quickly sent a return back to schwing proposed revisions including that general notes of the july quotation be incorporated.ips also requested a final paragraph that stated 
no other changes to this order apply at this time.access to silo installation area infrastructure for eventual silo placement into the general contractor s facilities or the use of the general contractor s material handling equipment or requirements for the hiring of general contractors labor personnel has not yet been established by schwing america project manager and must be established.additional charges may apply if accessibility is delayed or limited,and charges from the general contractor or unforeseen issues arise.
the modifications requested by ips were incorporated into the final change order which was executed on august.exh.
that same day,the new schwing project manager sent kopac a copy of a classic layout schedule common on large construction sites,scheduling activity at the site.the time line contained the following dates 
schwing made a progress payment of on august,and then again on august.ips installed the two receiving bin silos on september.on september,ips kopac sent schwing an stating that nssd had informed ips that it wanted the remainder of the silos the first week of october.kopac told schwing that this was the first he had heard of this time frame,and that ips had been planning on delivering the first week of december,referencing the specific lines in the layout schedule which showed a december date for the wet silo installation.on october,ips sent schwing an invoice for a progress payment.schwing called ips and noted that the underlying work had not been completed.ips agreed,and thus schwing withheld the payment.
from this point forward,things began to deteriorate rapidly.schwing operations manager began to hear reports that ips was delaying the nssd project and that,with only two workers on site,it was not providing adequate staff for the work.va tech began calling schwing,threatening to call schwing performance bond because the work was not progressing.
by november,the zion site was ready for the installation of the two wet sludge silos.ips indicated that the two wet sludge silos would be installed by december.on december,however,schwing field project manager received a report of welding defects in ips work.on december,schwing asked ips to provide a date for installation of the silos.ips responded that the silos would be on transport trucks by january,and ready for transportation by january.
concerned about the delays,schwing engaged its former project manager,david miller,as an outside consultant to go to the zion work site for two weeks and put matters back on track.miller testified that the job site was in disarray and chaotic,that the two wet sludge silos were only fifty percent complete,that the dry storage silo had not been assembled,and pieces of it were still at the waukegan site.he testified further that ips had sufficient work space.miller spent some time assisting with welding and fabrication.
while miller was on site,ips kopac raised concerns that the road was insufficient to transport the wet sludge silos from the lay down area to the building site.kopac,miller,and a representative from the general contractor,henderson,walked the site,discussed the road conditions,and laid out flags indicating where kopac wanted the general contractor to place additional gravel.at some point not identified in the record,henderson put down the fresh gravel.
on january,schwing paid ips outstanding october,invoice.on february,ips sent a revised quotation with a cover note that stated t his covers the eventualities that the delays in preparing the site continue for an unforeseen time sic and proposed additional charges of.schwing believed that the additional charges were improper because ips included installation costs which were part of the original purchase order and were not removed in the change order.ips believed that the change order did not address silo installation at the zion site and therefore the purchase order only obligated ips to install at the waukegan site.
on the same day that ips sent the revised quote,schwing inspected the paint and noticed obvious unpainted stripes of white primer on the undersides of the wet sludge silos where they had been laying on the trailers when they were painted.the inspection also revealed other paint problems.by february,schwing advised ips that it would be liable for any delay until the paint is within specifications,and advised ips of other repairs that had to be made.
in a february,letter,schwing terminated ips contract citing delays and the increased costs flowing therefrom.exh.the letter noted that the schedule required installation of the wet sludge silos by november,and the dry granules silo by december.id.the letter also stated that ips failure to complete the project within the agreed time frame caused delays and thus additional costs to the project for which schwing would hold ips liable.id.
schwing hired henderson,northeast water technologies nwt,and manta industrial and prime coat corporation to finish the remaining work.schwing paid henderson for labor,equipment,and rigging of the wet and dry sludge silos.it paid nwt to complete fabrication of the dry granules silo and to transport four remaining sections of the roof and other miscellaneous pieces from waukegan to zion.schwing paid manta to sandblast and the interior of the silos with coal tar epoxy,and paid to prime coat to paint the exterior of the three silos.see exh.
ips filed suit alleging that schwing lacked cause for cancelling the contract and that schwing was liable for ips damages.schwing counterclaimed arguing that it justifiably cancelled the contract after ips breached and that ips was liable for damages incurred by schwing due to ips delays and deficient performance.
the action was initially filed by ips in the circuit court for racine county,wisconsin but removed to the district court by schwing as the parties are diverse and the amount in controversy exceeds.ips is incorporated in wisconsin with its principal place of business in wisconsin and schwing is incorporated in minnesota with its principal place of business in minnesota.see pastor state farm mut.auto.ins,cir.
after a trial,the district court concluded that schwing was justified in cancelling the contract after ips materially breached,schwing did not breach the contract,and that schwing sustained damages in the amount of.we affirm in most part and remand for a recalculation of damages.
the parties dispute the standard by which we review various aspects of this case.the fixing of the boundary between questions of law and questions of fact,is a matter of federal procedural law and therefore governed by federal rather than state law in diversity as in other federal suits.dilworth dudley,cir tax track.new investor world,cir in a diversity suit when the judge acts as a fact finder the federal standard of review applies.although the interpretation of an established written contract is generally a question of law for the court holmes potter,cir,the question of whether or not a particular breach of a contract is material is a question of fact.abm marking,zanasi fratelli,cir.thus,we interpret the contract de novo but review the district court determination of whether ips materially breached the contract for clear error.see united states lake,cir questions of law reviewed de novo findings of fact for clear error.
breach of contract 
the district court concluded,and the parties do not contest,that wisconsin law applies to the agreement in this case.under wisconsin law,a material breach of contract releases the party from performance of the contract.mgmt.computer,hawkins,ash,baptie.a breach is material if it destroys the essential object of the agreement or deprives the party of a benefit that the party reasonably expected.ranes am.family mut.ins,mgmt.computer,at.in this case,schwing terminated the contract due to ips failure to complete work satisfactorily within particular time frames.consequently,the district court task was to determine whether fabrication and installation by a particular date was a benefit that schwing reasonably expected and whether the delays and the claimed defects in performance destroyed the essential object of the contract.
the first step in such a determination is identifying the contract and what it required.the district court determined that the september,purchase order,and the august,change order together formed the contract between the parties.at.the question before this court is interpreting what,if anything,those orders say about performance standards and deadlines.
when a contract is silent on the time for performance,a reasonable time is implied.delap inst.of.stat.ips argues that the contract here was such a reasonable time contract.we think the better interpretation is that the contract did indeed set forth specific dates for performance.as we ultimately conclude,however,whether the contract was one demanding performance within a reasonable time,or by a date certain,ips failed to meet the requirement.
the original purchase order clearly identified a time frame for performance,requiring delivery by december,and installation by the approximate dates of february,for the two receiving bins,february for the two wet storage silos,and april for the dry storage bins.exh,attachment a at.of course,these dates were later modified by the parties first,by a november,fax,in which schwing directed ips to continue shop fabrication,but to cease fabrication until further notice exh,and later by the august,change order to which we will turn our attention momentarily.these initial dates indicate that schwing and ips had a meeting of the minds that the project would be completed within a particular time approximately period,with installation occurring just one month from the delivery date for receiving bins,days from delivery for the wet sludge silos,and months from delivery for the dry granules silo.in sum,the initial contract contemplated a short time frame and a quick turn around time from delivery to installation.
nothing in the language of the change order alters those expectations or modifies the contract from one requiring specific dates to one requiring only a reasonable time for performance.in fact,the change order specifically states that other than the changes specifically iterated in the change order,no other changes to this order apply.exh.at.we know,of course,that it was the intent of the parties to alter the delivery and installation dates from the original purchase order.clearly,schwing altered the contract deadlines when it sent the fax directing ips to cease all fabrication as of november,and later when it agreed to a change order.to what date,then,did the parties alter the original deadlines 
general note one to the change order states that the majority of the main coned silo work is expected to be completed by september.exh.the main silo work refers to the wet sludge silos and the coned silo refers to the dry granules silos see exh,thus leaving only a smaller truck receiving complete after september.in fact,the receiving bins were installed on september,well before the september deadline.this express language sets forth some clear expectations regarding timing.september came and went without completion of the majority of the main and coned silo work.
not even schwing,however,seems to be arguing that ips breached by missing the september,deadline from the change order.schwing argues instead that the new deadlines came from the layout,spreadsheet used to coordinate all of the projects on the site.general note three to the change order states,ips has requested and has not received a zion project time lines sic from schwing,nssd or the general contractor.therefore ips will not be responsible for any monetary penalties on this project caused by unrealistic milestones,delays caused by others or acts of god.exh.at exh.at.this language contemplates that the timelines will be guided by the layout schedule.in fact,ips language indicates that without such a timeline,all bets are off.clearly this is not a contract that anticipated that the parties would perform in a reasonable time.the project at hand was complex and involved coordination of many different subcontractors.the layout schedule contained approximately lines of activities that were to be completed over the course of eighteen activity carefully scheduled to coordinate with the project as a whole.even ips relied upon the layout schedule for its deadlines.ips senior vice president stated in an to schwing,they are actually looking for the remainder of the silos in the first week of october.this is also the first i have heard this and was to be ready the first week in december as described in the attached layout schedule line s and.exh.in sum,this appears to be a contract containing specific deadlines and one that was referring to the layout schedule to provide them.
in arguing that the layout schedule did not establish deadlines,ips raises some noteworthy points.first,ips argues that the parties could not have intended to incorporate some of the layout schedule deadlines in their contract.for example,the layout schedule states an early finish date of august,for installation of the truck receiving bins.the parties,however,did not execute the change order until august.ips argues that it certainly did not intend to execute a contract that it was in breach of before it had any opportunity to perform.ips,however,puts too fine a point on these exact dates.after the lengthy delay while the project sat on hold,and after some mildly contentious correspondence,on july,the parties began negotiating to resume the project under revised terms.on july,ips sent schwing a field service quotation which eventually led to the final change order which the parties signed on august.on july,when schwing drafted the field service quotation that would become the final change order,the august deadline certainly was feasible.it is quite possible that the parties contemplated beginning work or perhaps did begin work before the ultimate change order agreement was finalized and signed.in fact,the receiving bins were installed on september,only days after the parties signed the change order.moreover,the fact that some of the dates were either unrealistic or inaccurate does not eviscerate the import of the general framework of the layout schedule to the project.of course,as ips points out,one expects some amount of delay and revision in the scheduling of construction projects.and although w hen performance is due anything short of full performance is a breach steele pacesetter motor cars,internal citations omitted,a relatively minor breach does not excuse the other party from its contractual performance.mgmt,at.
even if we were to determine that the parties did not intend to incorporate the layout schedule into the contract,we would arrive at the same conclusion regarding the question of a material breach.if the contract contained no time for performance,the law will imply a reasonable time.delap,at.what constitutes a reasonable time for performance given the facts of the case is again a question of fact to which we defer to the district court.klockner,fed.wire mill,cir.and how would a court determine what a reasonable time for performance is in a complex construction project such as this the logical place to begin is by looking at the highly detailed document that sets forth all of the various time frames for the layout schedule.it is true,as ips points out,that the layout schedule speaks not of deadlines,but of early start and early finish dates.once again,however,the layout schedule is the beginning,and not the end of the consideration.in determining materiality of breach and the parties reasonable expectations,a court would look not only at the construction schedule,but would also consider the circumstances as a whole,bearing in mind normal delays of construction,whether schwing or other contractors or subcontractors bore responsibility for the delays,and the benefit schwing could reasonably expect.in short,whether we conclude,as the district court did,that the layout schedule was part of the contract,or whether we find that ips had a reasonable time to perform,the determination of whether ips materially breached the contract must be made by looking initially to the time frames set forth in the purchase orders and layout schedule.
the district court found that ips had materially breached the terms of the contract and the record certainly supports such a determination.the original purchase order required delivery less than five months from the date the order was
