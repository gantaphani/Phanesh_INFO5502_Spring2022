storage technology corporation appeals the district court entry of summary judgment against it on its various claims against cisco systems,arising out of the hiring of a number of storage technology employees by cisco predecessor,nuspeed internet systems.the district court held that storage technology claims for interference with contractual relations,inducing breach of contract,conversion,and breach of fiduciary duties failed because storage technology did not come forward with any evidence of recoverable damages.the district court held that minnesota has not recognized a claim for corporate raiding,or hiring away another firm employees.the district court held that the remaining claim,for misappropriation of trade secrets,was not supported by evidence that satisfied the requirements of.e.we affirm the judgment of the district court.
in november,mark cree and clint jurgens founded nuspeed internet systems,a new computer technology company.cree and jurgens plan was to develop a product to link computers at one location to data storage networks at other locations through the internet or other wide area network using internet protocols.on december,cree and jurgens offered employment to mark schrandt,an engineer at storage technology,which was developing data storage networking products.schrandt accepted nuspeed offer and gave storage technology oral notice on or about december that he was leaving.he later gave a written resignation effective at the end of december.schrandt began work for nuspeed in january.in december,while schrandt was still at storage technology,he told four other storage technology engineers,mark bakke,ed fiore,tim kuik,and dave thompson,that he was going to work for nuspeed,and they expressed interest in following schrandt.schrandt met with them outside of work to discuss nuspeed,and by,these four storage technology employees had signed on with nuspeed.through november,nuspeed hired more engineers who were or had been employed at storage technology,as nuspeed grew to employ people.
in february,a new open internet protocol was published,called iscsi for internet,small computer systems interface.nuspeed quickly began working on incorporating iscsi in its product,the sn,which linked storage area networks over the internet.in april,nuspeed announced that it was developing a device to transmit data using the iscsi protocol.nuspeed aspired to be the first company to bring such a product to market.cisco systems,acquired nuspeed in september in a transaction in which nuspeed shareholders received million in cisco stock.although the sn was indeed the first iscsi device to market,cisco never made a profit on nuspeed,or the storage router business unit,as it was called after the acquisition as of january,cisco operating losses for the unit stood at million.
storage technology brought this suit against cisco,alleging that nuspeed had engaged in corporate raiding by hiring schrandt,bakke,fiore,kuik and thompson,and the other former storage technology employees,alleging that the employees had gained knowledge at storage technology of a device for joining disparate and otherwise incompatible computer networks and nuspeed had used that knowledge to develop a product based on storage technology device.storage technology also alleged claims for interference with contractual relations for hiring away persons with whom storage technology had employment contracts for inducing breach of contracts for conversion of confidential information for encouraging breach of fiduciary duties by former storage technology employees and for misappropriation of trade secrets.
cisco moved for summary judgment.cisco denied that nuspeed misappropriated any trade secret information or acted improperly in hiring storage technology engineers.
the district court granted summary judgment to cisco.first,the district court considered storage technology claim for tortious interference with storage technology contracts with its employees.the court held that under minnesota law,the measure of damages for tortious interference with contract is the amount the plaintiff could have recovered for breach of the underlying contract.storage technology made no effort to prove the value of the employment contracts allegedly breached,but pinned its entire case on a theory of unjust enrichment by which it sought to recover the entire million of value which the nuspeed shareholders received from cisco in the form of cisco stock.the district court held that the million figure had no relation to the damages suffered by storage technology from the alleged breach of any of its contracts with the former employees.the claim therefore failed for lack of proof of the element of damages.the claim for inducing breach of contract required proof of the same elements as the tortious interference claim and therefore failed with that claim.the conversion claim failed both because the type of property affected was trade secrets,which are not covered by the tort of conversion,and because storage technology failed to prove damages.similarly,the district court held that storage technology claim for breach of fiduciary duties by mark schrandt in december failed for lack of proof of damages.
the district court next considered storage technology claim for corporate raiding,or the systematic and massive program of hiring another company employees.the court held that minnesota had not recognized a cause of action for corporate raiding and that minnesota has disfavored any cause of action that would inhibit employees mobility in the workforce,as seen by the disfavor with which minnesota regards noncompetition clauses.accordingly,the district court declined to fashion a new tort under minnesota law.
finally,the district court held that storage technology had failed to come forward with evidence of misappropriation of a trade secret sufficient to meet the requirements of.e,since it relied on assertions by people who had no personal knowledge of the subjects of their statements.accordingly,the district court entered judgment for cisco on the misappropriation of trade secrets count.

under minnesota law,the elements of tortious interference with contract are the existence of a contract,the tortfeasor knowledge of the contract,the tortfeasor intentional causation of a breach of the contract,a lack of justification for the tortfeasor action,and damages resulting from the breach.bouten richard miller homes.the tort of inducing a breach of contract,which storage technology pleads in a separate count,requires the same elements.aslakson home sav.ass n.
we turn to the question of whether storage technology adduced any evidence to prove its damages for the alleged tortious interference with its employment contracts.
the district court focused on the nature of damages in a tortious interference with contract case.storage technology has declined to prove damages to its own business and instead only attempted to establish a right to restitution in the amount of cisco alleged unjust enrichment.cisco contends,and storage technology does not deny,that cisco lost money on the nuspeed product.at the deposition of timothy schulte,storage technology counsel expressly denied that storage technology claims or has proven lost profits.instead,storage technology contends it is entitled to million,which was the price cisco paid for nuspeed.the district court held that damages for interference with contract are limited to those that might have been rec
