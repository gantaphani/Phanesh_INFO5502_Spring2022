mutual indemnity bermuda,the defendant in the trial court mutual,appeals from a district court order enjoining bank of america,bank from honoring mutual efforts to draw down on a letter of credit loc posted by diane and kenneth hendricks,the trial court plaintiffs the hendricks.we have jurisdiction to review the district court preliminary injunction order pursuant to a,and we affirm.
the hendricks own american patriot insurance agency,american patriot,a company that specializes in providing insurance products to roofing contractors.in early,the hendricks established a commercial insurance program for workers compensation and other insurance coverages with underwriting assistance from mutual risk management and its subsidiaries mutual,legion insurance company,commonwealth risk services,and villanova insurance company collectively,the mutual entities.several contracts govern the relationship between american patriot and the mutual entities,but only one is directly relevant here a shareholder agreement,which entitles the hendricks to reap certain profits and income generated by the commercial insurance program and commits the hendricks to indemnify mutual for losses on the program.the shareholder agreement also requires the hendricks to post irrevocable locs and maintain the locs for the duration of mutual outstanding or potential liability for program losses.
in april,the hendricks filed an action in the northern district of illinois alleging fraud,misrepresentation,conspiracy,breach of contract,rico violations and negligence arising out of the mutual entities alleged fraudulent mishandling of their underwriting and practices from to.am.patriot ins.agency,mut.risk,d.the mutual entities moved to dismiss for lack of venue,citing the shareholder agreement forum selection clause,which states this agreement shall be exclusively governed by and construed in accordance with the laws of bermuda and any dispute concerning this agreement shall be resolved exclusively by the courts of bermuda.the district court agreed that the forum selection clause precluded the hendricks illinois action and granted the motion to dismiss.id.at.on appeal,the seventh circuit affirmed.see am.patriot ins.agency,mut.risk,cir.
one day after filing their illinois complaint,the hendricks brought an action in the central district of california seeking injunctive relief to prevent mutual from drawing down on an loc in the possession of the bank.the california complaint listed both mutual and the bank as defendants and requested a preliminary injunction based on california commercial code section b,which provides that i f an applicant claims that honor of the presentation would facilitate a material fraud by the beneficiary on the issuer or applicant,a court of competent jurisdiction may temporarily or permanently enjoin the issuer from honoring a presentation.cal.com.code b.
the district court reviewed the hendricks pleadings and promptly issued a temporary restraining order against mutual,directing it to show cause why a preliminary injunction should not be entered.after the northern district of illinois filed its decision in the illinois action,mutual invoked collateral estoppel and asked the district court to dissolve the temporary restraining order and deny the hendricks request for injunctive relief.following oral argument,the district court determined that the hendricks ha d stated a claim for interim relief against the bank of america as the issuer of the loc pursuant to section.the district court reasoned that collateral estoppel did not prevent the hendricks from seeking injunctive relief against the bank,because the bank was not a party in the illinois action against the mutual entities.in addition,it concluded that mutual was not a necessary,much less an indispensable,party to that action against the bank.it therefore stayed the hendricks claims against mutual and issued a preliminary injunction to remain in effect until the earlier of the following f inal resolution of the merits of the underlying claims between plaintiffs and the mutual defendants in either the illinois federal court or bermuda or april.
mutual does not challenge the district court decision to stay indefinitely the hendricks action against it individually.instead,it seeks to appeal from the portion of the district court order that grants preliminary injunctive relief against the bank.the bank has chosen not to participate in mutual appeal since it does not assert an independent interest in the loc.this raises an important threshold question for our consideration whether mutual,a party to the hendricks action and the loc beneficiary,has standing to appeal from the district court preliminary injunction order against the bank.
we have held that a defendant may assert standing to contest the grant of the preliminary injunction issued against other defendants under certain circumstances,even though those defendants have not appealed.goldie bookstore,superior court,cir.to meet our standing requirements for appeal,a defendant must demonstrate that he or she was a party at the time judgment was entered and was aggrieved by the decision being appealed.see also in re exxon valdez,cir concluding that a litigant had standing to appeal because it was a party to this case from the beginning and contends that it is aggrieved by the district court order.mutual clearly satisfies these requirements because it was both a party of record when the district court entered its preliminary injunction and the intended beneficiary of the enjoined loc.see lueker first bank of boston guernsey,cir observing that an loc beneficiary had standing to appeal from an injunction entered against a bank under similar circumstances andy marine,zidell,cir exercising jurisdiction over an loc beneficiary appeal from a district court order,which enjoined a bank from honoring the beneficiary draft.
the hendricks also contend that mutual lacks standing to appeal because it steadfastly contested personal jurisdiction in the central district of california,but they cite no authority which supports this argument.were we to treat personal jurisdiction defenses under federal rule of civil procedure b as waivers of appellate standing,we would essentially immunize district courts personal jurisdiction determinations from appellate untenable proposition,to be sure.
we recognize,of course,that a nonparty generally can not simultaneously challenge personal jurisdiction and assert standing to appeal.the rule that only parties to a lawsuit,or those that properly become parties,may appeal an adverse judgment,is well settled.marino ortiz,d per curiam.for this reason,an interested loc beneficiary who deliberately chooses to remain a nonparty lacks standing to appeal from a district court order which permanently enjoined a bank from making payment on the loc.citibank int l,cir.
however,mutual was a party to the district court proceedings and was aggrieved by the preliminary injunction.it therefore has standing to appeal the injunction.see goldie bookstore,at.we hold,therefore,that mutual has standing to appeal from the district court preliminary injunction.
mutual raises essentially two procedural challenges to the district court preliminary injunction improper venue and lack of personal jurisdiction over a necessary and indispensable party.see fed.civ.b improper venue fed.civ.a b necessary and indispensable party.
before advancing to the merits of mutual procedural challenges,we must decide whether these issues are amenable to appellate review at this stage.under a,we may exercise interlocutory appellate jurisdiction over the district court preliminary injunction and pendent jurisdiction over any otherwise ruling that is inextricably intertwined with or necessary to ensure meaningful review of the order properly before us on interlocutory appeal.meredith oregon,cir quoting swint chambers county comm n,d,amended by cir.district court rulings are inextricably intertwined with a preliminary injunction when the legal theories on which the issues advance are so intertwined that we must decide the pendent issue in order to review the claims properly raised on interlocutory appeal,or resolution of the issue properly raised on interlocutory appeal necessarily resolves the pendent issue.meredith,at,quoting cunningham gates,cir.we also construe swint necessary to ensure meaningful review language narrowly to require much more than a tangential relationship to the decision properly before us on interlocutory appeal.poulos caesars world,cir.
the hendricks contend that mutual personal jurisdiction and venue defenses are not inextricably intertwined with the district court preliminary injunction.we need not decide here whether their assertion is correct,because we conclude that review of these two defenses is necessary to ensure meaningful review of the district court preliminary injunction.swint,at.
in reaching this conclusion,we consider whether the issue calls into question the district court authority to rule on a party motion for a preliminary injunction.meredith,at emphasis added.for example,we have recognized that it is necessary to decide subject matter jurisdiction defenses to ensure meaningful review of a district court interlocutory rulings because if appellate courts lack jurisdiction,they can not review the merits of these properly appealed rulings.id.internal quotation marks omitted see also wong united states,cir discussing pendent jurisdiction over subject matter jurisdiction issues.similarly,we have invoked pendent jurisdiction under section a to decide whether a district court lacked authority to rule on a party motion for a preliminary injunction because it was required to abstain.meredith,at.on the other hand,we have declined to exercise pendent jurisdiction over rulings such as the availability of a bivens remedy that were not a logical predicate to the issues properly raised on appeal and did not implicate the very power of the district court to issue the rulings on appeal.wong,at.the common thread running throughout these decisions is our recognition that section a furnishes pendent jurisdiction over those questions that implicate the very power the district court used to issue the rulings then under consideration.meredith,at internal brackets omitted,quoting merritt shuttle,cir.
from these principles,it follows that we may exercise pendent jurisdiction to review mutual personal jurisdiction and venue defenses under the particular circumstances of this interlocutory appeal.like the various rulings discussed in meredith,mutual procedural defenses bear on the district court power to issue the injunction,because the court would lack authority to grant relief if mutual was a necessary and indispensable party and immune from personal jurisdiction in this forum,or venue was improper because the clause precluded preliminary injunctive relief outside bermuda.see ruhrgas ag marathon oil,d personal jurisdiction is an essential element of the jurisdiction of a district court,without which the court is powerless to proceed to an adjudication.internal quotation marks and ellipsis omitted.
we recognize,of course,that we need not consider rule and rule defenses in every case to ensure meaningful review of preliminary injunctions on interlocutory appeal.had mutual waived the privilege to assert these defenses,for instance,by failing to raise them by motion or in a responsive pleading,we would lack pendent jurisdiction to review them on interlocutory appeal.fed.civ.h see also poulos,at declining to review a district court exercise of personal jurisdiction because the district court would have retained jurisdiction regardless of whether it asserted personal jurisdiction over a subgroup of defendants.in this case,however,mutual did not waive its venue and personal jurisdiction defenses because it raised them in a timely manner in its first responsive pleading after securing several reasonable extensions of the filing deadline to facilitate settlement negotiations.see fed.civ.h.because mutual procedural defenses were properly raised,and because they attacked the district court authority to grant relief,the district court had to consider the defenses as a logical predicate to its preliminary injunction order.wong,at.we therefore exercise pendent jurisdiction over mutual two procedural defenses pursuant to section a.in re diet drugs,cir we have pendent appellate jurisdiction over the issue of personal jurisdiction,because,in this case,that issue bears upon the propriety of the preliminary injunction.internal quotation marks and brackets omitted.
mutual contends that the district court should have dismissed the instant action pursuant to federal rule of civil procedure b because mutual was not subject to personal jurisdiction in the central district of california.rule provides that a court must dismiss a civil action if it lacks personal jurisdiction over any necessary and indispensable party.fed.civ.a b takeda northwestern life ins,cir reviewing this analysis.a party is necessary if in its absence complete relief can not be afforded among those already parties,or it claims an interest relating to the subject of the action and is so situated that the disposition of the action in its absence may i as a practical matter impair or impede its ability to protect that interest,or ii leave any of the persons already parties subject to a substantial risk of incurring inconsistent obligations.fed.civ.a.whether a party is indispensable is an equitable determination to be decided based on a variety of factors,including 
first,to what extent a judgment rendered in the person absence might be prejudicial to the person or those already parties second,the extent to which,by protective provisions in the judgment,by the shaping of relief,or other measures,the prejudice can be lessened or avoided third,whether a judgment rendered in the person absence will be adequate fourth,whether the plaintiff will have an adequate remedy if the action is dismissed for nonjoinder.
fed.civ.b.if mutual is not a necessary and indispensable party to the hendricks request for injunctive relief against the bank,its argument for dismissal based on personal jurisdiction fails.
rule necessary and indispensable party inquiry is a practical,one,designed to avoid the harsh results of rigid application.dawavendewa salt river project agric.improvement power,cir.as such,we review the district court resolution of this inquiry for an abuse of discretion.kescoli babbitt,cir.
the district court delivered complete relief to the hendricks without mutual direct participation in the suit by enjoining the bank from honoring a draw on the loc pending the outcome of litigation between the hendricks and mutual in another forum.fed.civ.a.moreover,the preliminary injunction does not as a practical matter impair or impede mutual ability to protect its interest in the loc or leave any of the persons already parties subject to a risk of incurring inconsistent obligations in another forum.see fed.civ.a.instead,it merely preserves the asset pending a final judgment on the merits in bermuda.thus,as a practical matter,the preliminary injunction does not impede mutual ability to protect that asset 
having rejected mutual challenge to the district court necessary party analysis,we need not decide whether in equity and good conscience mutual qualifies as an indispensable party under rule b.see united food commercial workers union alpha beta,cir.since mutual has not demonstrated that the district court lacked personal jurisdiction over a necessary party to the hendricks action,the district court could grant injunctive relief against the bank without deciding whether it had personal jurisdiction over mutual individually.
mutual argues next that the shareholder agreement forum selection clause required the district court to dismiss the hendricks action for improper venue.see argueta banco mexicano,cir holding that a motion to dismiss based on a clause should be treated as a rule b motion to dismiss for improper venue.there is some ambiguity in the record as to whether the district court actually reached mutual improper venue argument prior to issuing its preliminary injunction.after oral argument,the court stated initially that it would not at this point decide whether the forum selection clause is in fact applicable in this case.later on,however,the court returned to the venue question and reasoned that to the extent that mutual may be making any argument with respect to the forum selection clause or collateral estoppel,neither of those arguments prevent us from issuing an injunction under section against the bank because we are making different determinations of issues against a different party.that is,the district court held that the forum selection clause did not preclude venue,insofar as it interpreted the clause not to apply to the hendricks section claim against the bank,which is a nonparty to the shareholder agreement.we need not decide whether this interpretation was correct,because,as explained later,we hold that the clause does not apply for different reasons.we review the district court decision not to enforce the forum selection clause for an abuse of discretion.see kukje hwajae ins.hyundai liberty,cir.
according to mutual,the seventh circuit decision in american patriot insurance agency,mutual risk management,cir,compels the conclusion that venue was improper.that court held that the shareholder agreement forum selection clause bars courts outside bermuda from adjudicating the hendricks substantive claims for fraud,breach of contract,and other claims.at.this determination is dispositive here,mutual maintains,because c ollateral estoppel,or issue preclusion,bars the relitigation of issues actually adjudicated in previous litigation between the same parties.offshore sportswear,vuarnet int l,cir.
by definition,collateral estoppel does not foreclose our independent consideration of a district court venue determination unless the issue at stake in the instant litigation is identical to an issue alleged and actually litigated in the prior litigation.id.the venue issues under consideration here do not meet this test.in the illinois action,the hendricks sought a final judgment on the merits of their dispute with the mutual entities,so the seventh circuit had no occasion to consider the precise venue question posed in this case whether the shareholder agreement forum selection clause prevents courts outside bermuda from issuing temporary injunctions to secure assets pending a final judgment on the merits in bermuda.collateral estoppel might preclude the hendricks from bringing a common law fraud or misrepresentation action in the central district of california.however,that is different from the hendricks seeking temporary injunctive relief in this forum to preserve an asset,which was not an issue actually adjudicated in the illinois case.id.
turning to the merits of mutual improper venue defense,we presume that the shareholder agreement forum selection clause is prima facie valid and enforceable unless the hendricks can show that enforcement would be unreasonable under the circumstances.bremen zapata,d see also argueta,at although bremen is an admiralty case,its standard has been widely applied to forum selection clauses in general.to the extent the forum selection clause applies here,the hendricks have the burden to show that trial in the contractual forum would be so gravely difficult and inconvenient that they will for all practical purposes be deprived of their day in court,gucci,cir,quoting bremen,at.
the question presented here is significantly different,however,from the typical forum selection clause case.the hendricks do not dispute the forum selection clause validity,nor do they contest the seventh circuit determination that the clause is enforceable where applicable instead,they contend that the clause scope does not extend to actions designed to preserve assets pending a judgment on the merits in the contractually selected forum.whether the hendricks must secure a preliminary injunction in bermuda to preserve this asset or may claim protection under the california statute is a question of first impression in our circuit.however,our reasoning in an analogous admiralty case,polar shipping,oriental shipping,cir,is instructive 
it is clear from the bremen and its ninth circuit progeny that where there is an enforceable foreign court selection clause,dismissal of the action is generally appropriate.however neither the supreme court in the bremen,nor this court,has addressed the issue of whether the district court,instead of unconstitutionally dismissing the action,may ensure the availability of security pending a determination of the merits in the contractually selected forum 
the enforceability of foreign court selection clauses is a matter of contract law.the question,then,is,what does the contract permit or require does it permit attachment in another forum,and maintenance of the attachment pending decision in the contractually selected forum 
it is clear that the parties intended that they would litigate the merits of any dispute in another forum.there is,however,no indication that the parties intended to limit proceedings to obtain prejudgment security to that forum 
we hold that in an admiralty action,absent express intent to the contrary,a forum selection clause providing that all disputes under the charter will be determined by a selected foreign court neither precludes a plaintiff from commencing an action in the district court to obtain security by maritime attachment,nor prohibits the district court from ensuring the availability of security adequate to satisfy a favorable judgment by the selected forum.

although we cautiously confined polar shipping holding to admiralty actions,there is no compelling reason why the analysis developed in that case should not apply to temporary injunctions issued under section b.in both polar shipping and the instant case,t he enforceability of foreign court selection clauses is a matter of contract law,meaning that the intent of the parties governs the extent to which the district court may exercise its jurisdiction to preserve assets pending a judgment in the contractually designated forum.polar shipping,at see also bremen,at.rejecting the argument that forum selection clauses oust a district court of jurisdiction,and describing the proper inquiry as whether the court should have exercised its jurisdiction to do more than give effect to the legitimate expectation of the parties.
in this case,the forum selection clause manifests the parties consensus to litigate the merits of any dispute concerning the shareholder agreement in bermuda.but the case before us is not about the agreement itself or its validity.on the contrary,there is no indication from either the agreement or the record,that the parties intended to limit proceedings to obtain prejudgment security to that forum.if the parties had so intended they could easily have worded the forum selection clause to so provide.they did not do so.polar shipping,at see also gregorio wilson,cir observing that in granting a preliminary injunction we do not review the underlying merits of the case.
since mutual has not shown from the language of the shareholders agreement or presented any evidence that the parties intended to limit actions outside bermuda for prejudgment injunctive relief,the district court did not abuse its discretion by concluding that the central district of california was an appropriate venue for the hendricks action under section b to preserve the loc.we hold that the district court did not abuse its discretion in denying mutual motion to dismiss the hendricks action for improper venue.
mutual did not address the merits of the injunction in its pleadings filed in district court because of counsel fear that challenging the fraud allegations would have submitted mutual to its jurisdiction.at the oral argument,mutual did make passing reference to the merits.although mutual arguably waived its challenge to the merits,as the question is a close one,we address the merits of mutual appeal on this point.
with these procedural hurdles behind us,we turn at last to the merits of the district court preliminary injunction.our review is limited and deferential.southwest voter registration educ.project shelley,cir en banc.we must affirm the injunction unless the distr
