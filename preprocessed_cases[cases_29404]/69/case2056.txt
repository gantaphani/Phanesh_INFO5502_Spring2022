b.the summary judgment evidence 
plaintiff was the sole owner of a residence in palos verdes estates.on february,plaintiff executed a special power of attorney in favor of kaneko,her.the february,special power of attorney stated in part,plaintiff hereby appoints kaneko her true and lawful attorney for her and in her name,place and stead and for her use and benefit.plaintiff granted kaneko powers with respect to her real property,to wit,t o exercise any or all of the following powers as to real property,any interest therein any building thereon to contract for,purchase,receive and take possession thereof and of evidence of title thereto to lease the same for any term or purpose,including leases for businesses,residence and oil mineral development to sell,exchange,grant or convey the same with or without warranty and to mortgage,transfer in trust,or otherwise encumber or hypothecate the same to secure payment of negotiable or note or performance of any obligation or agreement.italics added.plaintiff signature on the special power of attorney was not notarized.further,no witnesses executed the february,special power of attorney.
in her summary judgment opposition,plaintiff declared i gave the special power of attorney to kaneko so that he could help sell my residence i did not instruct him to borrow any money and i gave him no authority to borrow any money.it was my understanding that he would use the special power of attorney only for purposes of assisting me in finding a buyer and selling the residence.kaneko agrees that plaintiff asked him to assist her in the sale of the residence since he was in los angeles and she was frequently in japan and the special power of attorney was given to him for that purpose.
on march,kaneko borrowed money from asano,to invest in a restaurant.kaneko signed a promissory note and trust deed in plaintiff name.kaneko also signed his own name as plaintiff attorney in fact.according to kaneko,asano knew he was borrowing the money to invest in a restaurant.at that time,kaneko received from asano.he deposited the funds in a bank account for restaurant purposes.kaneko showed the february,special power of attorney to asano.as part of the summary judgment opposition,kaneko declared on march,asano suggested that i sign plaintiff name to the note and deed of trust.asano told me that she would only loan of her own funds,but i could obtain an additional from her friend yumi yager.however,to do so i needed to execute the promissory note and deed of trust.asano also told me that i needed to obtain a power of attorney in order to get the additional from yager.during this period of time,i again told asano that the additional would be used for the restaurant.
on april,after kaneko executed the note and trust deed,and asano loaned him of the he would eventually borrow,plaintiff executed a general power of attorney.the april,general power of attorney stated in part,plaintiff hereby appoints kaneko her true and lawful attorney for her and in her name,place and stead and for her use and benefit.plaintiff granted kaneko the power,among other things,to sign all documents and enter into all procedures necessary and proper to mortgage my real property and to use the funds in ways deemed proper by him and full power and authority to do and perform all and every act and thing whatsoever requisite,necessary or appropriate to be done in and about the premises as fully to all intents and purposes as i might or could do if personally present.the april,general power of attorney concluded my said attorney is empowered hereby to determine in his sole discretion the time when,purpose for and manner in which any power herein conferred upon him shall be exercised,and the conditions,provisions and covenants of any instrument or document which may be executed by him pursuant hereto.the april,general power of attorney was notarized.kaneko provided the general power of attorney to defendants.kaneko maintains,however,that defendants knew at all times,t he money he borrowed was being used for the restaurant.defendants did not record the trust deed for several months.kaneko states they did so only when they learned that the restaurant was unsuccessful and the residence might be lost to foreclosure.
in the summary judgment opposition,plaintiff stated i requested that kaneko help me in selling my automobile.he presented to me a general power of attorney.with this second general power of attorney i did not ever instruct or authorize kaneko to borrow money on my behalf or for himself.also,i never instructed nor requested that kaneko make repairs to the residence.kaneko admits he misled plaintiff.he never told plaintiff he was borrowing to invest in a restaurant.moreover,kaneko led plaintiff to believe the special power of attorney was only to help her sell her residence.also,kaneko led plaintiff to believe the general power of attorney was only to sell her automobile.
asano declared she is a licensed real estate broker who was introduced to kaneko by a mutual acquaintance.the introduction was made because kaneko wanted to sell some real property.asano inspected the property and told kaneko the residence needed significant repair and refurbishing in order to maximize its sales value.she estimated the cost of repairs at.asano later agreed to loan kaneko money to repair the property.asano had only to lend kaneko.therefore,asano arranged for yager to lend kaneko an additional for purposes of refurbishing the residence.the agreement between kaneko and asano was that she would be retained as the listing agent and repaid with interest from the proceeds of the sale of the property.asano and yager agreed to share the listing commission upon sale.asano knew that because the february,special power of attorney was not notarized it could not be recorded.kaneko assured asano he would obtain a notarized power of attorney from plaintiff.on march,asano gave kaneko a check.after he obtained the notarized general power of attorney from plaintiff,on or about april,asano gave kaneko a check for an additional.yager delivered a check to kaneko on or about april.yager states,i loaned to p laintiff by delivering a check in said amount to kaneko,her,pursuant to a power of attorney appointing him in said capacity.
asano states that when another party commenced foreclosure proceedings against the real property,i was required to loan an additional payable to western financial to stop the foreclosure when the residence was sold,defendants received.plaintiff declares she allowed defendants to be paid the full amount they claimed even though she did not believe any money was owed to them,because she did not want the property to be lost to foreclosure.
iii.discussion 
standard of review 
we apply the following summary judgment standard of review as articulated by the supreme court.in aguilar atlantic richfield cal th,d,the supreme court described a party burdens on a summary judgment or adjudication motion as follows f rom commencement to conclusion,the party moving for summary judgment bears the burden of persuasion that there is no triable issue of material fact and that he is entitled to judgment as a matter of law.that is because of the general principle that a party who seeks a court action in his favor bears the burden of persuasion thereon.citation.there is a triable issue of material fact if,and only if,the evidence would allow a reasonable trier of fact to find the underlying fact in favor of the party opposing the motion in accordance with the applicable standard of proof t he party moving for summary judgment bears an initial burden of production to make a prima facie showing of the nonexistence of any triable issue of material fact if he carries his burden of production,he causes a shift,and the opposing party is then subjected to a burden of production of his own to make a prima facie showing of the existence of a triable issue of material fact a prima facie showing is one that is sufficient to support the position of the party in question.citation.fns.omitted see kids universe th,d.we review the trial court decision to enter summary judgment de novo.johnson city of loma linda cal th,d,sharon arman,cal th,d,disapproved on another point in aguilar atlantic richfield,supra,cal th at,fn,d.the trial court stated reasons for granting summary judgment are not binding on us because we review its ruling,not its rationale.continental ins.columbus line,th,d dictor david simon,th,d.
b.the power of attorney immunity 
the power of attorney law,section et,was adopted as part of a recodification and reorganization of statutes pertaining to powers of attorney.stats.ch.the law revision commission recommendation states the proposed comprehensive power of attorney law restructures the power of attorney statutes and relocates them as a new division of the probate code,starting with section.recommendation comprehensive power of attorney law cal.law revision com.hereafter recommendation.later in its recommendation,the commission described the proposed changes to the power of attorney statutes thusly the great majority of changes that would be made by the proposed law concern the law relating to powers of attorney for property because these statutes are incomplete and disorganized.much of the proposed legislation is directed toward supplying more detailed rules and filling gaps in existing coverage,rather than making any major substantial revisions.recommendation,supra,fn.omitted.later,in its recommendation,the commission explained the proposed law generalizes certain rules to apply to all powers of attorney covered by the statute,whether for property matters,personal care,or health care.rules concerning execution,termination,revocation of authority,and the like would apply to all powers covered by the statute,thereby achieving a greater consistency in the law.the statutes relating to durable powers of attorney for health care and powers under the uniform statutory form power of attorney act would remain largely,with only minor technical changes to conform to the restructured statute.recommendation,supra.
one of the purposes of the law was to explicitly define how to create a power of attorney.the law revision commission recommendation explained the state of the law in and how the new proposed legislation would alter matters the proposed law provides general rules governing creation of a power of attorney.as under existing law,a power of attorney must be in writing and signed by the principal or at the principal direction.there is no requirement that the sign the instrument.the proposed law generalizes the requirement that the power of attorney be dated,which applies under existing law only to the durable power of attorney for health care and the statutory form power in addition,the proposed law requires as a general rule that powers of attorney be either acknowledged before a notary public or signed by two witnesses.this requirement is drawn from the execution requirements applicable to durable powers of attorney for health care.the principal is given the alternative of witnessing in the interest of flexibility,and in recognition of the fact that a notary is not needed if a power of attorney does not pertain to real property and in some situations may not be available.recommendation,supra,italics added.
in this vein,the commission recommended the enactment of and the legislature ultimately adopted section,which states a power of attorney is legally sufficient if all of the following requirements are satisfied a the power of attorney contains the date of its execution.b the power of attorney is signed either by the principal or in the principal name by another adult in the principal presence and at the principal direction.c the power of attorney is either acknowledged before a notary public or signed by at least two witnesses who satisfy the requirements of section.the law revision commission comment to section states in part section provides the general execution formalities for a power of attorney under this division.a power of attorney that complies with this section is legally sufficient as a grant of authority to an in subdivision b,the requirement that a power of attorney be signed by the principal or at the principal direction continues a rule implicit in former law.see former,c.in addition,it generalizes the rule applicable to durable powers of attorney for health care under former civil code section.the requirement that the power of attorney be either acknowledged or signed by two witnesses,in subdivision c,generalizes part of the rule applicable to durable powers of attorney for health care under former civil code section a.former general rules did not require either acknowledgment or witnessing.however,the statutory form power of attorney provided for acknowledgment.see former now.this rule still applies to the statutory form power of attorney witnessing does not satisfy section.subdivision c provides the general rule as to witnessing specific qualifications for witnesses are provided in section.cal.law revision com.hereafter comment,supra law com,west ann.probate code,foll,cum.pocket,italics added.
in this case,the february,special power of attorney did not comply with the statutory requirements in section,subdivision c.the february,special power of attorney was neither witnessed nor notarized.hence,plaintiff argues the february,special power of attorney was invalid.on its face,plaintiff is february,special power of attorney was invalid.
but defendants argue that they were entitled to rely on the february,special power of attorney because of the provisions of section et which provides an immunity for third parties who rely on a power of attorney.the law revision commission recommendation identifies the problems the statutes were intended to address existing law provides a number of rules concerning the relation between and third persons,both in the general agency statutes and in the power of attorney statutes the proposed law continues these principles of existing law,but adds several additional rules intended to make powers of attorney more effective.the proposed law sets forth a general duty on the part of third persons to accor
