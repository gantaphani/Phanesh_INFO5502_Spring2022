melvin porter sued his employer for violating title vii of the civil rights act of,et,after he was passed over for promotion to three different positions.although the jury rejected his allegations of racial discrimination,it found that retaliation against him for his previous complaints of racial discrimination was a motivating factor in his employer decision not to select him for two of the positions and awarded him in compensatory damages.as further relief,the district court awarded porter prejudgment interest on the damages award,his attorney fees and costs,and enjoined the employer from retaliating against porter in the future,but denied his request for back pay and placement in a position.the only issue on appeal is whether the district court abused its discretion by denying an award of back pay and a placement.porter contends it did for two reasons first,because the district court erred as a matter of law by determining that the employer would not have promoted porter to either of the two positions in the absence of retaliation,after deciding,upon porter objection,not to instruct the jury on the same issue under the civil rights act of act,g b and second,because the district court,in rejecting porter request for back pay and placement in a position,failed adequately to consider the deterrent purpose of title vii,and clearly erred in finding that the employer would not have selected porter for either position in the absence of retaliation.we hold that the district court did not abuse its discretion in determining under g that back pay and a placement did not constitute appropriate equitable relief.accordingly,we affirm the judgment of the district court.
melvin porter,an male,has been employed by the united states agency for international development usaid since.since his promotion to a position in,he has been repeatedly passed over for advancement to a position,despite receiving numerous positive performance evaluations.porter claims that usaid failure to promote him is part of a larger atmosphere of hostility and opposition towards the professional advancement of black males within the agency.complaint,at.in and,porter filed two equal employment opportunity eeo complaints alleging racial discrimination,which were later settled.in,according to porter,usaid transferred him from the office of human resources,where he had been employed since,to the bureau for policy and program coordination because of hostility toward him within the office of human resources for filing his eeo complaint.id,at.
in april,porter applied for a position in the bureau for latin america and the caribbean lac,but the position went to an female.porter maintains that he was denied a fair opportunity to compete for the position when his name was initially omitted from the list of best qualified candidates,that a candidate was for the position before the vacancy was announced,and that usaid discriminated against him on the basis of his race and gender and retaliated against him for his prior eeo activity,because an official named in his two eeo complaints had participated in the promotion decision.id,at.two years later,in march,when porter applied for a position in the personnel operations division pod of the office of human resources,a white male who porter claims had no experience with the agency foreign service personnel system was selected for the position.porter maintains that he was denied the pod position because of his race and his prior eeo activity.id,at.in april,porter applied for another position in the executive management em division of the office of human resources.although he did not initially rank among the best qualified candidates,he later received a perfect score on an independent evaluation of the candidates,at which point the agency canceled the vacancy announcement.usaid the position in november as a foreign service position and selected a white male foreign service officer who porter alleges had no substantive experience with personnel management.id,at.porter maintains that usaid actions in connection with the em position were based on racial discrimination and retaliation for his prior eeo activity.porter also claims that he was denied a position on the agency special awards committee because of his race and his prior eeo activity.id,at.
on may,porter sued usaid for discriminating and retaliating against him in violation of title vii.specifically,the complaint alleged a continuous and uninterrupted course of discriminatory conduct that occurred between and the present,during which time caucasian and asian individuals with inferior qualifications were selected for positions within the agency for which he was qualified and for which he had applied.id,at.the complaint sought an injunction against future discrimination and retaliation,as well as relief that would make porter whole,including back pay and benefits,placement in a position that he would have attained but for usaid discrimination and retaliation,compensatory damages for emotional distress,physical pain,mental anguish,and humiliation,and attorney fees and costs.id,at.in its answer to the complaint,usaid admitted that porter had received numerous positive performance evaluations of exceeds fully successful,excellent,and exceptional,but denied all allegations of discrimination and retaliation.it asserted in its pretrial statement of defenses that there was no discrimination or retaliation in the three selections at issue and that porter would not have been selected for any of the three positions even in the absence of discrimination.def.pretrial statement,at.usaid also proposed a jury instruction and special interrogatory on the same action affirmative defense established by the act,g b,asking the jury to determine,if it found discrimination or retaliation,whether usaid would have taken the same action even in the absence of discrimination or retaliation.
at the close of the evidence,the district court sustained porter objection to usaid request for a jury instruction on the same action affirmative defense.instead,as porter requested,the district court instructed the jury to determine whether discrimination or retaliation was a motivating factor in usaid decision not to promote porter to each of the three positions even though other factors may also have played a role in that decision.the instruction stated that porter is not required to prove that his race or protected activity was the only reason for usaid decision,but that i f you find that porter has proven by a preponderance of the evidence that racial discrimination or retaliation more probably than not motivated usaid,then you must find for porter.finding that usaid had not discriminated against porter on the basis of his race or gender with respect to any of the three positions,but that it had retaliated against him in deciding not to promote him to the pod and em positions,the jury awarded porter in compensatory damages for each of those claims.
porter then petitioned the district court for equitable relief,including back pay and placement in a position,relying on lander lujan,for the proposition that district courts must strive to grant the most complete relief possible in cases of title vii violations,id.at quoting franks bowman transp,d,and i n particular,the courts must make the victim whole by plac ing him,as near as may be,in the situation he would have occupied if the wrong had not been committed,id.second alteration in original quoting albemarle paper moody,d.usaid,in turn,again invoked the same action affirmative defense under g b,and asked the district court to find by a preponderance of the evidence that usaid would have taken the same action regarding the pod and em positions in the absence of retaliation.concluding that the jury verdict left it free to decide the same action issue,the district court credited the testimony of usaid witnesses and found that the agency would not have selected porter for either of the positions in the absence of retaliation.accordingly,the district court enjoined usaid from future retaliation and awarded porter his attorney fees and costs,as well as prejudgment interest on his damages award,but denied back pay and a placement,concluding that these remedies were unnecessary to make porter whole.
on appeal,porter contends that the district court committed legal and factual errors in denying him back pay and placement in a position.in reviewing the district court determination of an appropriate remedy under title vii,the court considers whether the district court was clearly erroneous in its factual findings and whether it abused its traditional discretion to locate a just result in light of circumstances peculiar to the case.albemarle,at.quoting langnes green.see also peyton dimario,barbour merrill.while the district court has wide discretion to award equitable relief,the question for this court is whether the district court failed to consider a relevant factor or relied on an improper factor,and whether the reasons given reasonably support the conclusion.peyton,at quoting barbour,at.our deferential standard of review comports with the recognition that the district court is in the best position to determine the appropriate equitable relief in light of the particular facts of the case,as it heard all of the evidence and observed all of the witnesses at trial.see.a bishopp district of columbia.
title vii makes it an unlawful employment practice for an employer to discriminate against an individual because of such individual race,color,religion,sex,or national origin,a,or because he has opposed any practice made an unlawful employment practice by this subchapter,id.a.absent direct evidence of intentional discrimination or retaliation,see,swierkiewicz sorema,d,an employee can establish a prima facie case of an unlawful employment practice under the single motive or pretext framework of mcdonnell douglas green,d,and texas department of community affairs burdine,d,if he proves by a preponderance of the evidence that he applied for an available position for which he was qualified,but was rejected under circumstances which give rise to an inference of unlawful discrimination or retaliation.burdine,at.see mcdonnell douglas,at.the burden of production then shifts to the employer to rebut the presumption of discrimination or retaliation by presenting evidence of a legitimate reason for its employment decision.see burdine,at.mcdonnell douglas,at.the employee retains the ultimate burden of persuasion and may prove intentional discrimination or retaliation by demonstrating that the employer proffered legitimate reason is pretextual and not the true reason for the employment decision.burdine,at.mcdonnell douglas,at.
the mixed motive framework was established by the supreme court in price waterhouse hopkins,d,in recognition that the statutory phrase because of does not mean solely because of,id.at.under that framework,an employee could establish a prima facie case of an unlawful employment practice by demonstrating that discrimination or retaliation played a motivating part or was a substantial factor in the employment decision.id.at.plurality opinion id.at.white,concurring in the judgment id.at,concurring in the judgment.the employer could avoid all liability,however,if it proved that it would have made the same employment decision in the absence of the unlawful motive.id.at.
congress responded to the price waterhouse mixed motive framework by enacting section a of the act,stat,which amended title vii to provide standards for mixed motive cases.see desert palace,costa,d.the act provided for employer liability based on evidence that an impermissible consideration was a motivating factor in the employer decision 
a n unlawful employment practice is established when the complaining party demonstrates that race,color,religion,sex,or national origin was a motivating factor for any employment practice,even though other factors also motivated the practice.
m emphasis added.in such cases,the act also limited the employer exposure to certain remedies by establishing a same action affirmative defense 
on a claim in which an individual proves a violation under section m of this title and a respondent demonstrates that the respondent would have taken the same action in the absence of the impermissible motivating factor,the court 
i may grant declaratory relief,injunctive relief,and attorney fees and costs and 
ii shall not award damages or issue an order requiring any admission,reinstatement,hiring,promotion,or payment 
id.g b emphasis added.thus,the mixed motive framework of the act allows an employee to establish a title vii violation under m without proving that an impermissible consideration was the sole or motive for the employment action,while providing the employer with a limited affirmative defense under g b that does not absolve it of liability,but restricts the remedies available to a plaintiff.desert palace.at.
as a threshold matter,we note that porter case implicates several issues that have not been presented to the court by the parties on appeal.first,although every circuit to address the issue has held that the mixed motive provisions of the act do not apply to retaliation claims it remains an open question in this circuit.see borgo goldin.because neither party contends that the act does not apply to porter retaliation claim,the issue will remain an open question in this circuit after this appeal.second,for reasons we will explain,it is unnecessary to decide whether the same action defense under g b is an issue reserved for the jury.third,in the absence of a by usaid,the court has no occasion to decide whether the district court erred in denying usaid request for a jury instruction on the same action defense.
porter contends that the district court erred as a matter of law in determining for itself whether usaid would have selected porter for the pod or em positions in the absence of retaliation.he maintains that the same action defense did not apply to his case,and that even if it did,it should have been decided by the jury rather than the district court.porter first contends that the same action defense does not apply to his case because both parties litigated the case as a single motive or pretext case,not a mixed motive case.porter points out that his consistent position throughout trial was that discrimination and retaliation were the only plausible reasons for usaid decision not to promote him to each of the three positions and that usaid consistent position was that discrimination and retaliation played no role whatsoever in its decision not to promote him to each of those positions.porter also points to the district court denial of a jury instruction on the same action defense after he objected on the ground that usaid took the defense off the table when all of its witnesses categorically den ied that any impermissible motive played a role in the.
to the extent porter contends that usaid waived the same action defense or failed to provide adequate notice of its intention to raise the defense at the remedial stage of the proceedings,that contention is unavailing.while usaid did not assert the defense in its answer to the complaint,an omission of an affirmative defense is not fatal as long as it is included in the pretrial order.pulliam tallapoosa county jail,cir citing.e.in its pretrial statement of defenses,usaid asserted not only that there was no discrimination or retaliation in the three selections at issue,but also that porter would not have been selected for any of the three positions even in the absence of discrimination.along with its pretrial statement,usaid proposed a jury instruction on the same action defense asking the jury to find whether usaid would have taken the same action in the absence of discrimination or retaliation and to note that finding on its verdict form.moreover,usaid stated during a pretrial conference that it intended to raise the same action defense with respect to the issue of back pay.therefore,usaid gave adequate notice of its intention to raise the same action defense at the remedial stage of the proceedings.
porter contention that the same action defense is inapplicable because the case was litigated on a single motive or pretext theory is also unavailing because,consistent with the
