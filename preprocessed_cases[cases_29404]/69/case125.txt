this is a case arising under the employee retirement income security act of erisa.after a bench trial,plaintiff john janeiro,was awarded in benefits,a sum that the district court held had been wrongfully withheld from him by two retirement plans.the plans were administered by the urological surgery professional association uspa,and their primary trustee was edward chibaro,janeiro former business partner.
on appeal,the main issue is what standard of review the district court should have applied to the benefits claim in evaluating the defendants decisionmaking.the standard varies,depending on whether there was a conflict of interest.defendants argue that they were entitled to greater deference from the court as to their repeated revaluations of,and delay in paying,the amount due to janeiro.we disagree.on these facts,the district court properly engaged in plenary review,in light of the conflict of interest of the plans trustee,chibaro.it then correctly found for plaintiff on his benefits claim.
for his part,janeiro has,seeking attorneys fees and prejudgment interest.we hold that the district court did not abuse its discretion in denying these requests.in sum,both the appeal and the fail.the judgment of the district court is affirmed in all respects.
background 
we describe the facts in the light most favorable to the judgment,drawing all reasonable inferences from the record in favor of janeiro as to the benefits claim,but in favor of defendants as to attorneys fees and prejudgment interest.see servicios comerciales andinos,del caribe,cir wainwright bank trust boulos,cir.our summary is based largely upon the district court factual findings,in which we see no clear error.
a.the plans 
for over a decade,janeiro was an employee of the uspa,a medical practice.he and chibaro,both doctors,were of the practice.the uspa was,and still is,the sponsor and administrator of two pension benefit plans governed by erisa the money purchase pension plan and trust,and the profit sharing plan and trust.janeiro participated in both plans.
the money purchase plan was funded by contributions from employees salaries,and the profit sharing plan was funded by a combination of employee and employer contributions.both plans were defined contribution,pooled asset plans.both plans consisted of several prototype plan,an adoption agreement,a trust agreement,and a summary plan are,in all relevant respects,identical for each plan.
the pertinent terms created by the documents are these first,of each plan adoption agreement provides that t here are no restrictions other than those of article in the prototype plan on when,following termination of employment,a participant may begin receiving benefits.article of the prototype plan,in turn,provides in b that u nless a participant elects otherwise,benefit distribution occurs or begins no later than the sixtieth day following the end of the plan year in which the participant terminates his employment with the employer.no other provision of article is pertinent here.
section of each plan adoption agreement provides that w hen an account balance becomes payable,it is paid in a lump sum at the valuation date following the occurrence precipitating the disbursement.under,v aluation dates occur at the end of each plan period.the plan period was the same as the plan year the calendar year,ending on the last day of december.
section of the prototype plan provides accounts are adjusted to reflect investment changes on each adjustment date each valuation date is an adjustment date.the plan administrator may also provide for an extraordinary adjustment date whenever market values of underlying assets have changed so much that it would be inequitable to do otherwise.
finally,under of the prototype plan,t he principal employer is the plan administrator and has discretionary authority to determine eligibility for benefits and to construe the terms of the plan.
this lawsuit concerns benefits under both plans.for convenience,we refer to both as the plan,the usage adopted by the district court.
chibaro was listed on the plan as the individual trustee.although janeiro was named in and signed some documents in that capacity,the district court found that he was a trustee in name only,and that chibaro was the one who exclusively exercised both the responsibilities of trustee and the uspa responsibilities of plan administration.in particular,the court found,it was chibaro who was exclusively responsible for interactions with both the plan investment advisor and the third party administrator.
the plan administrator was fecteau associates,fecteau.fecteau handled the annual valuation of plan assets.it generated this information using a census form it sent to the uspa every december or january a statement,obtained from the plan investment advisor,of the value of the assets in the plan as of december and other information,concerning developments such as deposits and withdrawals,obtained from the uspa during the ordinary course of the year.the court found that it took the uspa roughly two hours to complete the census,and that it took five to ten hours for fecteau to complete the valuation once it had all the information.
b.the business breakup and the benefits dispute 
in july of,janeiro gave notice that he intended to leave the uspa.thereafter,the relationship between janeiro and chibaro was,in the district court words,cold and at times very contentious.in october of,janeiro terminated his employment.the next valuation date,which would apply in the ordinary course,was december.
the district court found that both before and after december,janeiro clearly and repeatedly communicated his intention to chibaro to withdraw his plan assets as soon as they could be withdrawn.in addition,several other terminated employees and chibaro,claiming by way of a recent divorce,sought to obtain their share of assets as of the december,valuation date.in all,chibaro knew that as of that date roughly of the plan assets would be departing.of the remaining,belonged to chibaro.
the district court further found that the uspa had fecteau annual census form in early january of,but did not complete and return it to fecteau until march.fecteau completed the valuation for december,the first valuation and transmitted it to chibaro by letter dated june.janeiro share of assets as of december,was valued at.
importantly,between december of and june of,the market value of the plan assets declined.the district court found that chibaro became concerned because he did want to make money for other people that were leaving the plan,and in effect if janeiro were to be paid the valuation as of december,he would receive a greater percentage of the plan assets than he would be entitled to if a new valuation was conducted.chibaro,who was determined to have the assets revalued,directed fecteau to revalue the assets,this time as of june,the second valuation.fecteau did so,conveying the results to chibaro on august.this time,janeiro share was valued at.as the district court explained,the effect of the revaluation was to transfer a loss that otherwise would have been born e by the parties whose assets remained in the plan to the parties who were leaving.
at some point after august and before september,forms were distributed to janeiro and the other claimants.janeiro returned his completed form on september.by then,the market had further declined,most notably after september.chibaro had fecteau perform another revaluation,this time as of october,the third valuation the results were communicated to him on november.he did not notify the terminated employees about this revaluation until november,and he did not provide them with forms which would have specified the value of their shares.
december,was the end of the plan year,and so was a valuation date.the valuation as of december,the fourth valuation was transmitted to chibaro on april,in april of,forms were distributed,but this time janeiro did not sign or return his.
on july,fecteau transmitted to chibaro a valuation as of june,the fifth valuation.forms were sent to the departing employees janeiro completed his and returned it on august.the value of janeiro share,as of this valuation,was.he received this sum less than the first late fall of,nearly two years after the first valuation date of december.he unsuccessfully sought to recover this amount through administrative means.
janeiro then sued the uspa,the two plans,and chibaro.he asserted four claims.the first two,for benefits,see a b,and for equitable relief and restitution for breach of fiduciary duty,see id.a,were essentially theories of recovery for the.the third was for prejudgment interest,and the fourth was for attorneys fees.
c.the district court bench ruling 
at the end of a bench trial,the district court made findings of fact,most of which are summarized above.the court further determined that chibaro was in breach of his fiduciary duty in two ways first,chibaro was aware as of december,that a substantial amount of the assets,having been claimed by the departing participants,would or should shortly be leaving the plan,but he failed to apprise the plan investment advisor of this fact so that the advisor could liquidate and segregate sufficient plan assets.this failure meant that the assets remained invested in a mixture of stocks and bonds,which exposed the assets to be distributed to an unacceptable degree of market risk.second,chibaro failed to take reasonable steps to ensure that the december,valuation was completed in a timely manner by promptly transmitting the census to fecteau and insisting that fecteau timely do its job.the delay simply was not justified.
taken together,these fiduciary breaches led to otherwise avoidable losses market losses traceable to the departing assets,which had not been liquidated and segregated,but rather had remained in risky investments.this particular category of losses,as distinct from the market losses traceable to the remaining assets,was due entirely and exclusively to chibaro fiduciary breaches.the court found that janeiro was not at all responsible for the breaches or the losses.the court also declined to find that chibaro relied in good faith on the advice of professionals,noting that,if anything,the evidence tended against such a finding.
the district court then made the following conclusions of law first,chibaro and the uspa were entitled to judgment as a matter of law on the claim for damages based on a breach of fiduciary duty theory,because such a claim does not lie where,as here,the suit is only on behalf of a claimant who has an available claim for benefits.see varity howe,d.the court stressed that although janeiro was not legally entitled to any relief on a breach of fiduciary duty theory,chibaro was in fact in breach of his fiduciary duty.
second,the court held,janeiro was entitled to prevail on his benefits claim.the court reasoned that janeiro account balance became payable on the valuation date following his is,on december,that janeiro had timely elected such payment.further,the amount to which janeiro was entitled was the value of his account on december,unless some departure from that valuation date was justified.the court agreed with defendants that of the prototype plan,which permitted the plan administrator to provide for an extraordinary adjustment date whenever market values of underlying assets have changed so much that it would be inequitable to do otherwise,supplied a potential basis for departure.the ultimate question,therefore,was whether chibaro,exercising the uspa plan administration authority,was entitled to declare extraordinary adjustment dates on june,and on later dates.
in answering this question,the court first determined the appropriate standard of review of defendants application of the plan terms.the court acknowledged that ordinarily it would review only for abuse of discretion,but it held that in this case,chibaro was operating under a conflict of interest that was so severe that it entitles his determinations to no deference.the court cited several facts supporting this conclusion.
first,chibaro judgment as to whether to employ an extraordinary valuation date was inevitably going to be affected by a concern that he could be subject to suit for breach of fiduciary duty.it was his failures to timely liquidate and segregate plan assets,and to obtain a december,valuation that produced avoidable is,market losses traceable to the departing assets,which should have been isolated from market risk and given to the departing participants.using a later valuation date with a lower value would put these avoidable losses on the departing participants and thus reduce the risk that anyone remaining in the plan would sue for breach of fiduciary duty.second,the district court noted,chibaro felt personal animus toward the departing participants.by june of,he was in a highly adversarial relationship with the departing employees,including the office manager,with whom he had a very hostile relationship,and janeiro,with whom he was then engaged in litigation.it was janeiro who had commenced that litigation,and the district court found that there was animosity between them as a result of this litigation.as mentioned above,one of the other owners of the departing assets was chibaro,claiming by way of a recent divorce.the court found that chibaro did not want to make money for people who were leaving the plans,and that he harbor ed an animus against them sufficient to amount to conflict of interest.
third,chibaro personal financial interests were set directly against those of the departing participants.the court found that because he owned of the remaining assets that is,of the remaining,he would be the principal beneficiary of a decision to revalue.
reviewing the revaluation decisions de novo under the plan terms,the court ruled that chibaro was not entitled to declare an extraordinary valuation date either as of june,or on any of the subsequent dates.the court described this as a very difficult question.it reasoned that even if chibaro had not been the principal beneficiary of revaluation,it still would have been inappropriate to declare an extraordinary valuation date.this was because revaluing did not equitably allocate the avoidable losses caused by chibaro fiduciary breaches among all of the assets,but rather completely shifted all of those losses from the plan participants whose assets remain in the plan,to plan participants whose assets are leaving the plan.
the court cited several reasons for rejecting defendants argument that the consequence of not,leaving all of the avoidable losses caused by chibaro fiduciary breaches on the remaining their course of action.first,the market decrease between the first and second valuations,roughly in six months,was not unusual at all,and causing the remaining assets to bear the full amount of losses including losses traceable to the departing assets would not have been so unusual or substantial as to cause a failure to revalue to be inequitable.second,revaluing delayed the distribution of funds.third,shifting all of the avoidable losses caused by the breaches onto departing participants was not more fair,because t he fairest place to leave the consequence of the fiduciary breach under these circumstances is where it lies as a result of the is,with the remaining plan assets.the court explained that the remaining participants injured by the breach have recourse against,and can recover from,the administrator.
lastly,the court noted,chibaro owned of the remaining assets,meaning that the primary effect of revaluation would be to shift losses from the wrongdoer to innocent parties departing the plan.not revaluing would simply have left the losses from chibaro fiduciary breaches to fall almost entirely on the wrongdoer himself and would not have been inequitable.
the court thus found that the june revaluation was inappropriate,and that janeiro had a right to his benefits as valued as of december.he was therefore entitled to recover difference between the initial valuation and the amount that he had actually been paid to date.
the court then heard oral argument on attorneys fees and prejudgment interest and,after determining that it had discretion as to both matters,denied both as for attorneys fees,the court cited the test described in cook liberty life assurance,cir,and it determined that each factor cut in favor of defendants first,chibaro did not act in bad faith,but instead believed that he was permitted under the law to act as he did second,the plan did not have deep pockets,but rather had no more than in assets,of which nearly was already being awarded to janeiro third,an award was not necessary for deterrence purposes fourth,an award coming at the expense of the remaining plan participants,who except for chibaro were innocent,would be inappropriate and fifth,this was a close case.
as for prejudgment interest,the court emphasized its concern about the effect such an award would have on the plan.it added that in its view,much the same factors that influence an award of attorney fees here should apply in a interest situation,and that those same factors indicated that an award of prejudgment interest was not warranted.
the benefits claim defendants appeal 
in reviewing a judgment following a bench trial,we accept the district court findings of fact unless they are clearly erroneous,keeping in mind that the district judge had the opportunity to assess the credibility of the witnesses.a.w e may not disturb the district court findings of fact unless on the whole of the evidence we reach the irresistible conclusion that a mistake has been made.smith morse,cir.this deferential standard extends to inferences drawn from the underlying facts,and if the trial court reading of the record with respect to an actor motivation is plausible,appellate review is at an end.id.we review conclusions of law de novo,and the parties are in agreement that this de novo review extends to the district court ultimate decision as to which standard of review applied to defendants own decisions.
standard of review of revaluation decisions 
the heart of defendants argument is that the district court should not have applied de novo review to their decisions.they raise two arguments based on the fact that the plan vested the uspa,the plan administrator,with discretionary authority first,they say,the plan administrator did not operate under a conflict of interest,so the usual highly deferential standard of review should apply.second,they argue,even the existence of a genuine conflict of interest should only have added some bite to the review,without making it wholly nondeferential.these arguments fail in light of the particular facts of the case.
where the terms of an erisa plan give discretion to the plan administrator to make benefits decisions and to construe the terms of the plan,the district court ordinarily should uphold such determinations by the administrator unless they constitute an abuse of discretion,or are arbitrary and capricious.see wright donnelley sons.group benefits plan,cir leahy raytheon,cir.as this court has repeatedly made clear,however,i t is well settled that when a plan administrator labors under a conflict of interest,courts may cede a diminished degree of no deference at the administrator determinations.leahy,at emphasis added see also wright,at quoting the same language from leahy.
as for whether there was a conflict of interest,defendants first attack the role chibaro ownership of the remaining assets played in the district court analysis.they invoke the rule that structural conflicts arising from the administrator or trustee own financial not sufficient to abandon the normal highly deferential review.see wright,at fact that plan administrator was also plan insurer did not,by itself,alter normal arbitrary and capricious standard of review mahoney bd.of,cir applying arbitrary and capricious standard of review where trustees exercised clearly granted discretion to benefit one group of beneficiaries more than another,and the trustees benefited from that action as members of the much larger,favored group.this rule makes sense because,where the potential conflict arises solely from the fact that any payment of benefits will come at the decisionmaker expense,market forces can generally be expected to mitigate undue stinginess.see doyle paul revere life ins,cir wright,at.
the district court decision is entirely consistent with the rule that a structural conflict by itself does not provide a basis for departing from the usual standard of review.the court did not rely solely on the structural conflict arising from chibaro financial interest,but rather cited additional factors present in this case.these additional factors made it especially likely that chibaro personal financial interest played a real role in the decisions to revalue,and they showed in their own right that the decisions were actually improperly motivated.doyle,at see also wright,at considering various factors allegedly showing improper motivation,in addition to structural considerations,as possible bases of conflict of interest itt hartford life accident ins,cir distinguishing between potential or possible conflicts of interest arising from structural considerations and cases where the circumstances actually indicate an improper motivation.
defendants attacks on the other two factors cited by the district court are also unavailing.as for the conflict based on chibaro fear of litigation stemming from his earlier fiduciary breaches,defendants claim that t here is simply no evidence that the prospect of litigation factored into chibaro decision to revalue.they assert that there simply was no prospect of a lawsuit,and if there was,chibaro was neither aware nor afraid of it.
first,defendants say,none of chibaro professional advisors told him he was obliged to liquidate and segregate assets sufficient to pay the imminently departing plan participants,and the first decision to revalue was based solely on the advice of professionals,not on the possibility of liability for any failure to liquidate and segregate.but the district court found that chibaro failed to inform the investment advisor in the first place that a significant exodus was imminent,found that it was chibaro who was determined to have a revaluation and who directed that one occur,and expressly refused to find that he relied in good faith on the advice of professionals.the defense of reliance on advice is not available to one who omits to disclose material information to advisors or dictates imprudent outcomes to advisors united states rice,cir defendant not entitled to defense where he neither fully disclosed all material facts to his attorney before seeking advice nor actually relied on his counsel advice in the good faith belief that his conduct was legal.
second,defendants argue,there was no evidence that chibaro feared liability stemming from the delay in completing the first valuation.they say that annual valuations were generally completed in april because it took the uspa time to determine the amount of its contribution to the profit sharing plan,and that several months passed after the uspa submitted the census form to fecteau before fecteau completed the valuation.taking these points in reverse order,we note that the delay once the census was in fecteau hands was attributable to chibaro,who should have ensured promptness on fecteau part that an arguably justified delay as to one plan does not justify a delay as to the other plan and that habitual delays in valuation of four months,not conclusively shown to be justified to begin with,are hardly conclusive proof that a delay of half a work that should take a matter of hours or justified.
the evidence,in sum,supported a finding that chibaro was at fault for failure to timely liquidate and segregate sufficient assets and for failure to ensure that the first valuation was timely completed.it was also plausible to find that there was a prospect of litigation by the remaining participants aside from chibaro himself,who would bear the full costs of chibaro failures if no revaluation was done.and it was plausible to infer that chibaro must have been aware of and feared this prospect of litigation,and that this played a role in his decision to revalue.
with respect to the district court finding that chibaro harbored animus toward the departing participants,defendants offer no contrary factual argument.they rely instead on a non sequitur that chibaro had a fiduciary duty to protect the financial interests of all plan participants,including the remaining ones.there is no doubt chibaro had a legal duty to the remaining participants but that duty did not necessarily motivate in whole or even in part his decision to revalue,nor did it make it factually impossible for him to have been motivated by animus.the district court expressly found chibaro not credible with respect to his claim that,in directing each revaluation,he was trying to protect the other participants aside from himself remaining in the plan.further,the relationship between chibaro and the departing participants was plainly acrimonious,and we have no reason to doubt that there was animus and that it played a role in chibaro decision to revalue.
finally,we reject defendants fallback argument that even if there was a conflict of interest,the district court should have applied arbitrary and capricious review with bite but without ruling out all deference.we have repeatedly stated that when a plan administrator labors under a conflict of interest,courts may cede a diminished degree of no deference at the administrator determinations.leahy,at emphasis added see also wright,at.
the district court approach was consistent with the supreme court statement that if a benefit plan gives discretion to an administrator or fiduciary who is operating under a conflict of interest,that conflict must be weighed as a facto r in determining whether there is an abuse of discretion.firestone tire rubber bruch,d alteration in original quoting restatement second of trusts cmt.d see also wright,at in applying the arbitrary and capricious standard the existence of a conflict of interest on the part of the administrator is a factor which must be considered.in some cases,the conflict is so severe that giving it sufficient weight as a factor or applying the level of bite necessary to account for the severity of the actual conflict requires giving no deference to the conflicted decisionmaker.given the severe conflict of interest under which chibaro was laboring,the district court properly gave no deference to the decisions he made in exclusively exercising the uspa plan administration authority.
correctness of revaluation decisions 
the defendants argue the belated revaluations were proper under the provision allowing the administrator to provide for an extraordinary adjustment date whenever market values of underlying assets have changed so much that it would be inequitable to do otherwise.the district court did not err in finding that this provision did not apply and that it provided no basis to deny the benefits sought.defendants purport to justify all the revaluations on the ground that they were necessary to ensure that the market losses that occurred after december,were borne equally by all plan participants.for the exact reasons stated by the district court,this is an inadequate explanation.
first,the district court found that the market decrease during the six months following december,was not unusual at all,and that not revaluing would not have put an especially large burden on the remaining assets the loss to the remaining assets would have been roughly.defendants have not shown that this essentially empirical analysis,in the context of a plan provision for extraordinary adjustment dates,was wrong.
second,the revaluations did distribute market losses equally among all plan participants,but they did not distribute the losses attributable to chibaro fiduciary breaches equally among all participants.the market losses that occurred after december,to the extent they are traceable to the departing assets,should not have occurred to begin with.those assets should not have been in risky market investments after december,and the losses traceable to them were the direct result of chibaro fiduciary breaches in failing to timely liquidate and segregate plan assets,and to obtain valuations.the effect of revaluation was to put all of the loss caused by these fiduciary breaches on the departing participants.keeping in mind that the plan allowed for extraordinary revaluations only whenever it would be inequitable to do otherwise,equity hardly demanded that this entire loss be put on the departing participants 
not revaluing would simply have left all of the avoidable losses due to chibaro fiduciary breaches on the remaining participants.importantly,the vast majority of the assets that would have been left to absorb the losses from chibaro fiduciary breaches belonged to chibaro himself.it would not have been inequitable for him to bear the brunt of the losses he wrongfully caused 
whatever the force of defendants argument about the clause in the abstract,defendants acted as though it permitted unlimited retention of assets,keeping the assets of departing participants for nearly two years and performing a total of five valuations.the clause may not reasonably be read that way.
attorneys fees and prejudgment interest plaintiff 
janeiro challenges the district court denial of attorneys fees and prejudgment interest.
attorneys fees 
erisa provides that attorneys fees are available in the court discretion.see g.we review the denial of attorneys fees only for abuse of discretion,disturb ing such rulings only if the record persuades us that the trial court indulged a serious lapse in judgment.cottrill sparrow,johnson ursillo,cir quoting texaco,dep t of consumer affairs,cir.we see no abuse of discretion.
we begin by noting that in an erisa case,a prevailing plaintiff does not,merely by prevailing,create a presumption that he or she is entitled to a award.id.at.this is an area of law that should be,and is,flexible.id.at.
although fee awards under erisa are wholly discretionary,this court has listed five factors that ordinarily should guide the district court analysis 
the degree of culpability or bad faith attributable to the losing party the depth of the losing party pocket,his or her capacity to pay an award the extent if at all to which such an award would deter other persons acting under similar circumstances the benefit if any that the successful suit confers on plan participants or beneficiaries generally and the relative merit of the parties positions.
cottrill,at.this list is illustrative,not exhaustive,no single factor is dispositive and indeed,not every factor in the list must be considered in every case.twomey delta airlines pilots pension plan,cir.
as for the first factor,the district court was not obliged to find that defendants acted with an especially high degree of culpability.it was plausible,in evaluating whether to award attorneys fees,to find that chibaro subjectively thought he was entitled to administer the plan as he did.
analyzing the second factor,the district court expressed a legitimate concern that the plan assets were quite modest and were already subject to a benefits award comprising at least,and perhaps as much as,of the total assets 
janeiro adds that even though the district court ruled in favor of uspa and chibaro as to janeiro claims against them,chibaro and the uspa assets should still be fair game for an award of attorneys fees,because they were the key players through which the two plans acted.janeiro cites no authority for treating the uspa and chibaro as losing parties for purposes of attorneys fees on a benefits claim that succeeded only against the plans in any event,no matter whose and how plentiful were the assets available for an award of attorneys fees,this factor would mean little.an inability to afford attorneys fees may counsel against an award,but the capacity to pay,by itself,does not justify an award.cottrill,at citation omitted.
turning to the third factor,the district court determined that the benefits award itself was large enough to deter similar misconduct,and that an award of attorneys fees was unnecessary for that purpose.janeiro argues that denying fees sends the wrong message to the erisa community and invites plan administrators to play fast and loose with plan terms and with departing participants money.the district court,which viewed the evidence in this case,disag
