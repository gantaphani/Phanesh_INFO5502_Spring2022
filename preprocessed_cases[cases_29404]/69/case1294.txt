the main question in this case is whether a debtor may recover damages for emotional distress under h when a creditor violates the automatic stay that follows from the filing of a bankruptcy petition.in a previous opinion,dawson washington mutual bank,cir,withdrawn,cir,we answered that question no.upon reconsideration,however,we are persuaded that we erred and now answer yes.
factual and procedural background 
plaintiffs george and barbara dawson bought a home located at ridgewood way,in richmond,california the property.when they acquired the property in,they obtained from the predecessor of defendant washington mutual bank the bank a loan secured by a first deed of trust.in,plaintiffs executed a second deed of trust,to secure an obligation of,in favor of the dixons,who were friends of plaintiffs.
beginning in,plaintiffs experienced difficulty in making their monthly mortgage payments to the bank.on may,plaintiffs filed a chapter bankruptcy petition and,in october of the same year,the chapter plan was confirmed.
plaintiffs again failed to pay what they owed the bank and,on july,the bank filed a motion for relief from the automatic bankruptcy stay.the bank obtained an adequate protection order providing that the automatic stay would terminate on august,if plaintiffs failed to make certain payments.they did fail to make the required payments accordingly,the stay terminated.a foreclosure sale was scheduled for early but plaintiffs tendered payment to the bank just before the date set for the sale,so the foreclosure proceedings were discontinued.
in plaintiffs made payments to the bank,but for less than the amount due.thus,on october,the bank recorded a notice of default.on january,the bank recorded a notice of sale,stating that a foreclosure sale would take place on february.
meanwhile,in the dixons had recorded a notice of default against the property.on october,a foreclosure sale was conducted.on february,a a trustee deed upon sale,transferring title to the dixons,was recorded,and b the dixons assigned the second deed of trust,transferring their interest,to relatives of plaintiffs,the jamesons.plaintiffs and the jamesons signed an unrecorded agreement entitled agreement re foreclosure on ridgewood way,richmond,california the jameson agreement.the jameson agreement provided that,after the dixons foreclosure of the property was complete and title was vested in the jamesons plaintiffs would cure the foreclosure on the first deed of trust and keep payments current thereafter plaintiffs would arrange for a second loan to be secured by loan officer joan foggy,with the funds to be distributed as follows a to the jamesons,plus fees,expenses,and for their time and effort and b to plaintiff george dawson father,with c any remainder to plaintiffs and when the foregoing conditions were fulfilled,the jamesons would deed the property to plaintiffs.the jameson agreement provided for completion of all conditions within working days from the date of execution.
on february,a grant deed was recorded,transferring the dixons interest in the property to the jamesons.that was the same date set for the foreclosure sale.the sale did occur and the bank took title to the property on february.the bank rescinded the foreclosure sale on august.
just before the sale,on february,plaintiff george dawson had filed a chapter bankruptcy petition.whether or when notice of that petition was provided to the bank was in dispute below,but the bankruptcy court found that the bank had knowledge of it by february,at the latest.on that date the bank served on plaintiffs a notice to quit the premises.
on february,the bank instituted an unlawful detainer action against plaintiffs.the bank lawyer in the unlawful detainer action received notice of the chapter bankruptcy filing on the same day,february.the bank dismissed the unlawful detainer action on march.plaintiff george dawson chapter bankruptcy case was closed on july.
plaintiffs filed the present chapter bankruptcy case on june.the bank filed a proof of claim as to plaintiffs debt,secured by the property.thereafter,plaintiffs filed an adversary complaint,claiming as relevant here emotional distress damages under h for the bank violation of the automatic stay in george dawson chapter proceeding.
the bankruptcy court held,among other things,that the jameson agreement was an option agreement that did not convey any equitable ownership interest in the property to plaintiffs and that the bank february foreclosure sale,therefore,did not violate the automatic stay.because the february foreclosure sale was not wrongful,the bankruptcy court awarded the remedy of rescission and restored the parties to their prior positions as if that sale had never occurred.as part of this remedy,the bankruptcy court held that plaintiffs owed the bank for loan payments that accrued between february and august when the bank rescinded the sale.further,the bankruptcy court held that the bank did violate the stay between february and march,when the bank dismissed the unlawful detainer action.the court nonetheless denied george dawson claim for emotional distress damages on the grounds that the bank violation of the automatic stay was not egregious and that no evidence corroborated the emotional distress claimed.finally,the bankruptcy court awarded plaintiffs attorney fees and costs in the amount of.
the district court affirmed all the bankruptcy court holdings save one.the court held that the jameson agreement was actually a marketing contract that could transfer an equitable interest in the property to plaintiffs.therefore,the bank may have violated the automatic stay with its february foreclosure sale,because plaintiffs may have had an equitable interest in the property at the time.however,whether they actually held such an interest depended on several facts such as whether the jameson agreement requirements had been fulfilled that were in dispute.therefore,the district court remanded the case to the bankruptcy court for further findings on this and related issues.

discussion 
jurisdiction 
as a threshold matter,the bank asserts that we lack jurisdiction because the district court order is not final within the meaning of d and.we have acknowledged that questions regarding finality sometimes arise when,as here,a district court reverses a final order of a bankruptcy court but also remands for further proceedings.slope borough barstow in re of markair,cir.
we resolve such questions of finality through a pragmatic approach a district court decision can be considered final for the purpose of appellate review even when a question has been remanded to the bankruptcy court.
if the matters on remand concern primarily factual issues about which there is no dispute,and the appeal concerns a question of law,then the policies of judicial efficiency and finality are best served by our resolving the question now.on the other hand,if the district court remands for further factual findings related to a central issue raised on appeal,the district court decision is usually not final.
id.citations and internal quotation marks omitted.
at first blush,that passage might appear to suggest that we lack jurisdiction.the district court reversed the bankruptcy on a central issue in the case,whether the jameson agreement transferred equitable title in the property to plaintiffs,and remanded the case for further factual findings.but this appeal concerns primarily a question of law,and indeed a question of first impression in the ninth circuit when,if ever,are damages for emotional distress recoverable under h for a violation of the automatic stay our answer will not obviate the need for all further,but it will materially aid the bankruptcy court in reaching its disposition on remand.see markair,at if the bankruptcy court were to find that the foreclosure sale violated the automatic stay,for example,the question of what damages are available would be amplified.
in the circumstances,we conclude that the district court order is final within the meaning of d and.accordingly,we have jurisdiction and proceed to the merits.
claim for emotional distress damages 
plaintiffs argue that the district court erred in affirming the bankruptcy court refusal to award damages to george dawson for emotional distress allegedly arising out of the unlawful detainer action.they rely on h an individual injured by any willful violation of a stay provided by this section shall recover actual damages,including costs and attorneys fees,and,in appropriate circumstances,may recover punitive damages.emphasis added.see stinson supply,in re stinson,cir.bap holding that emotional distress damages are available under h and following aiello providian fin,cir.
to analyze plaintiffs position we must determine whether congress intended the term actual damages in h to include damages for emotional distress.we begin with the text of the statute,but it does not provide a definition for actual damages.there is a contextual clue,however,that lends support to plaintiffs theoretical position.
congress chose the term individual to describe those who are eligible to claim actual damages under h.the statute allows any individual,including a creditor,to recover damages.so,for example,if a willful violation of the automatic stay damages some portion of the bankruptcy estate,both the debtor and an individual creditor of the now estate may recover actual damages.see johnston envtl.knight in re goodman,cir normally creditors shall recover damages under h for willful violations of the automatic stay.but corporations,whether debtors or creditors,are not individuals for the purposes of this statute.see id.at i ndividual means individual,and not a corporation or other artificial entity.united states arkison in re cascade roads,cir c orporate debtors may not recover sanctions under section h because the statute refers only to individual s.by limiting the availability of actual damages under h to individuals,congress signaled its special interest in redressing harms that are unique to human beings.one such harm is emotional distress,which can be suffered by individuals but not by organizations.
even after examining the text and context of h,however,its meaning remains ambiguous.recourse to legislative history is therefore an appropriate tool in determining congress intent.recording indus.ass of am.diamond multimedia,cir 
through the automatic stay,congress was furthering more than one goal.we have explained that t he purpose of the automatic stay provision is.by halting all collection efforts,it gives the debtor a breathing spell from his creditors during which the debtor can try to reorganize.by preventing creditors from pursuing,to the detriment of others,their own remedies against the debtors property the stay protects creditors.united states dos cabezas,cir alteration and internal quotation marks omitted.under that formulation the stay purpose,is not merely for debtors and creditors the stay also is meant to achieve financial and goals.plainly one aim of the automatic stay is financial the stay gives the debtor time to put finances back in order,offers the debtor an opportunity to reorganize so that creditors can be satisfied to the greatest extent possible,and prevents creditors from racing to devour the debtor estate at the expense of fellow creditors.but another purpose is to create a breathing spell,a phrase suggesting a human side to the bankruptcy process.
our formulation in dos cabezas faithfully reflects the legislative history which,although it focuses mainly on the financial effects of a violation of the automatic stay,also refers to harms that may befall a debtor.the house report for the bankruptcy reform act of explained 
the automatic stay is one of the fundamental debtor protections provided by the bankruptcy laws.it gives the debtor a breathing spell from his creditors.it stops all collection efforts,all harassment,and all foreclosure actions.it permits the debtor to attempt a repayment or reorganization plan,or simply to be relieved of the financial pressures that drove him into bankruptcy.
the automatic stay also provides creditor protection.without it,certain creditors would be able to pursue their own remedies against the debtor property.those who acted first would obtain payment of the claims in preference to and to the detriment of other creditors.bankruptcy is designed to provide an orderly liquidation procedure under which all creditors are treated equally.a race of diligence by creditors for the debtor assets prevents that.
at,reprinted in,see also,at,reprinted in,same first paragraph.the house report went on to say 
the stay is the first part of bankruptcy relief,for it gives the debtor a respite from the forces that led him to bankruptcy.frequently,a consumer debtor is severely harassed by his creditors when he falls behind in payments on loans.the harassment takes the form of abusive phone calls at all hours,including at work,threats of court action,attacks on the debtor reputation,and so on.the automatic stay at the commencement of the case takes the pressure off the debtor.
at,reprinted in,footnote omitted.a footnote to that passage directs the reader to an appendix in which a lawyer for the federal trade commission further detailed abuses to which consumer creditors are frequently subjected 
when a payment is missed,letters and phone calls commence.communications are directed at first to the debtor himself and then frequently to members of the debtor family,friends and neighbors,and to the debtor employer possible use of the wage assignment may be mentioned together with the suggestion that employers do like deadbeats and tend to discharge employees who generate trouble.
at,reprinted in.the appendix continued 
the consumer who seeks the relief of a bankruptcy court is an individual who is in desperate trouble the short term future that he faces can literally destroy the basic integrity of his household.we believe that this individual is entitled to a focused and compassionate effort on the part of the legal system to alleviate otherwise insurmountable social and economic problems.we believe that relief should be provided with fairness to all concerned but with due regard to the dignity of the consumer as an individual who is in need of help.
at,reprinted in.
reading the legislative history as a whole,we are convinced that congress was concerned not only with financial loss,but least in the emotional and psychological toll that a violation of a stay can exact from an individual.because congress meant for the automatic stay to protect more than financial interests,it makes sense to conclude that harm done to those interests by a violation are cognizable as actual damages.we conclude,then,that the actual damages that may be recovered by an individual who is injured by a willful violation of the automatic stay h,include damages for emotional distress.in so holding,we join an emerging consensus recognizing the availability of damages for emotional distress that results specifically from a willful violation of the automatic stay.see mccullough,emotional distress damages should they be permitted under the bankruptcy code for a willful violation of the stay,depaul bus.com.spring collecting cases and citing aiello,and fleet mortgage group,kaneb,cir thurmond bleming,do section h actual damages include emotional distress damages,norton bankruptcy law adviser collecting cases and concluding that a majority of courts include emotional distress damages in actual damages awarded under h only when the debtor meets certain proof requirements,including proof of significant damages and proximate cause.
because we hold that,under h,emotional distress damages are
