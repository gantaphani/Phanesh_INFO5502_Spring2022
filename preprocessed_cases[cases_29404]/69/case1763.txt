like the landmark case of troxel granville,d troxel,this case involves a grandparent,whose adult child has died,seeking visitation with that child minor children over the objection of their surviving parent.
troxel commands the courts to presume that the surviving parent objection to grandparent visitation is in the best interest of the children.however,this does not mean that the surviving parent is free to use the denial of visitation as big bertha in his or her personal war with the grandparent.here,the trial court found that the surviving parent claimed reasons for objecting to visitation were not reasonable and not credible in essence,as he practically admitted on the stand,he objected to visitation mainly to spite the grandparent.moreover,he admitted that grandparent visitation would be in the best interest of the children.thus,the presumption that he was acting in the best interest of his children was overcome,and the trial court constitutionally could and did grant the grandparent visitation petition.
factual background 
a.the scope of the record.
before summarizing the facts,we must explain what sources of facts we are and are not entitled to consider.
several exhibits were mentioned and discussed during trial,but only two of them were actually admitted.moreover,the superior court clerk office no longer has any of the exhibits thus,it has not been able to include them in the clerk transcript or to transmit them to us.the appellant has not moved to augment the record.see cal.rules of court,rule.we therefore can not consider any of the exhibits.
the trial court did take judicial notice of the files in the related divorce and guardianship cases.the appellant has provided us,however,with only a select few of these documents therefore,we can consider only these,subd.b.moreover,we can take judicial notice of the existence and legal effect of these documents,but we can not take judicial notice that any statements in them are true.unruh haxton regents of university of california th.
finally,although the appellant has provided us with reporter transcripts from the guardianship case,these would not have been in the court files when the trial court took judicial notice they were prepared later,at his request,for this appeal.thus,we can not consider them.vons companies,seabest foods,cal th,fn.r eviewing courts generally do not take judicial notice of evidence not presented to the trial court.
the facts,as shown by the testimony at trial and the matters of which we may take judicial notice,were as follows.
b.the facts as shown by the record.
melville diedjomahor the father and kristen hoag the mother were married in.they lived with kristen mother,shannon hoag the grandmother,at her apartment in la habra.in,their first daughter was born.sometime in,they separated.the father went to live in desert hot springs the grandmother,the mother,and the daughter all remained in la habra.in april,however,they reconciled.thus,the mother and the daughter moved into the father apartment in desert hot springs the grandmother moved in along with them.later in,the couple second daughter was born.
in sum,then,the grandmother lived with both of the children from the time they were born.she helped to care for them.she testified that she was like a third parent 
on february,the mother filed for divorce.according to the grandmother,the mother moved out and went to live with her oldest brother the uncle,accompanied by the children and the grandmother.according to the father,however,the mother did not move out she merely went to the uncle house for a weekend visit.
on march,during this stay at the uncle house,the mother died suddenly as a result of previously undiagnosed epilepsy.in the immediate aftermath of her death,the children remained with the grandmother,at the uncle house.the father visited them every couple of days.
on may or,the grandmother told the father that she was going to file a petition for guardianship of the children.he responded by demanding that she return the children to him.she testified that he also told her that it was over for her as far as any contact was concerned 
on may,the grandmother did,in fact,file a guardianship petition.in it,she alleged that the father was unable to care or provide for the children because h e had an accident that left him temporarily disable d from the waist down and he was an undocumented alien subject to deportation.it was true that in february the father had been in an accident as a result,he was confined to a wheelchair for about seven months.it was also true that he was in the united states illegally.however,he had entered the country legally,and he had applied for permanent residency.the mother thwarted his application by refusing to appear at a hearing.at the time of trial,he was still in the process of obtaining permanent residency.
because the grandmother was alleging that the father was unfit,child protective services was required to carry out an investigation,and it did.see,subd.c.however,it found no concern.
according to the grandmother,the father never offered to let her have any visitation that was not.the father testified,however,that he would have been willing to let her visit without a court order.
for a week or so after the grandmother filed the guardianship petition,she was unable to visit the children.on may,the guardianship court ordered the parties to agree to a visitation schedule.the father refused to agree to dates the grandmother requested he offered only dates on which she had to work.as a result,it was three weeks until a visit actually took place.in june,the guardianship court imposed a visitation schedule.
in the course of the guardianship case,the father learned that the uncle had admitted improperly touch ing the mother when she was a minor.he also learned that,in,the grandmother children had been removed from her custody because she was using drugs although the children had been returned to her,and she claimed that she had not used drugs since.
in december,after this case was filed,and after there was a temporary visitation order in effect in this case,the guardianship case was dismissed.
by the time of trial,the grandmother had moved out of the uncle house and into an apartment in the same complex as the father.she had visitation for three hours every wednesday evening and hours every other weekend.she was allowed to phone each child once a day.she wanted the trial court to adopt this as its final visitation schedule.
the father conceded that the children loved the grandmother.he also agreed that she should be allowed to spend time with them he testified that he would allow visitation voluntarily.however,he expressed some opposition to visitation,arising out of the grandmother efforts to obtain custody.for example,he testified that he had concerns about visitation because there was an issue of trust.she broke that trust by pushing me as a parent claiming my children he also testified that he objected to overnight visitation because my has claimed to the court that practically she raise d the children and as a father,to just sit back and watch and go,okay,have it,is not something i can do.those statements ha ve consequences.
the father paid a friend to babysit the children when he was at work.he refused to let the grandmother act as their babysitter,because he no longer trusted her since she had tried to obtain custody of his children.
regarding the visitation schedule,the father objected to the wednesday evening visit because it prevented him from study ing with the children.he objected to any overnight visitation because he believed it would expose the children to the uncle.he also objected to daily phone calls because they interrupted whatever he and the children were doing and because he had to stay home to receive them.
the father wanted the trial court to deny visitation entirely.if it did order visitation,however,he wanted visitation limited to eight hours every other saturday,plus one week during summer vacation during the day only,no sleepovers,plus eight hours on the grandmother birthday he wanted phone calls limited to two per week.
procedural background 
in october,the grandmother filed a petition for visitation.see.
in january,the case went to mediation.the mediator recommended visitation for three hours every wednesday evening and hours every other weekend,plus daily phone calls.the trial court adopted the mediator recommendations as its temporary visitation order.
in march,after a full trial,the trial court granted the visitation petition.at the father request,it provided a statement of decision.it began by acknowledging that section of the family code section is unconstitutional when applied to a surviving parent who is neither unfit nor opposed to occasional visitation.it found overwhelming evidence that the father was a fit parent.however,it further found that he was opposed to any reasonable visitation by the grandmother f ather offers of reasonable visitation are feigned at best and without any substance.his claim regarding an offer of reasonable visitation is not credible.this court does not believe him.his evidence presented,his demeanor,as well as his answers betrayed his position.similarly,it found that his purported concerns about the past history of drug abuse,child neglect,and family sexual abuse were unreasonable and not credible.finally,it found that it is in the children best interests to have visitation with their grandmother.
the trial court ordered the same visitation schedule as the temporary visitation order,with minor changes,including reducing telephone visitation to twice a week.
discussion 
general legal principles.
in troxel,the trial court allowed two grandparents the parents of a deceased parent to have more visitation with their grandchildren than the surviving parent was willing to allow.troxel,supra,at plur.opn.it relied on a state law that authorized it to grant any person visitation,as long as such visitation was in the best interest of the child.id.at.
the plurality opinion,by justice,began by noting that parents have a fundamental right to make decisions concerning the care,custody,and control of their children.troxel,supra,at plur.opn.it concluded that the statute as applied in this case,unconstitutionally infringes on that fundamental parental right id.at,based on the combination of several factors id.at.first,the surviving parent was a fit parent.id.at.t here is a presumption that fit parents act in the best interests of their children.id.at.second,the trial court and the state statute failed to give special weight to the surviving parent determination of the child best interests.id.at see also id.at.third,the surviving parent had never tried to cut off visitation entirely the trial court,however,fail ed to accord significant weight to the fact that she had offered the grandparents meaningful visitation.id.at.significantly,the plurality noted,many other states expressly provide by statute that courts may not award visitation unless a parent has denied or unreasonably denied visitation to the concerned third party.id.at.
the plurality noted that the trial court had based its visitation order on two findings that the grandparents could provide opportunities for the children in the areas of cousins and music,and that t he children would be benefitted from spending quality time with the grandparents.troxel,supra,at plur.opn.it concluded that this case involves nothing more than a simple disagreement between the trial court and the surviving parent concerning her children best interests.ibid.it declared,t he due process clause does not permit a state to infringe on the fundamental right of parents to make childrearing decisions simply because a state judge believes a better decision could be made.id.at.
justice souter concurred in the judgment.troxel,supra,at conc.opn.of souter.he would have held the statute unconstitutional on its face.id.at.justice thomas also concurred in the judgment.id.at conc.opn.of thomas.in his view,under the strict scrutiny test,the state of washington lacks even a legitimate governmental interest to say nothing of a compelling one in a fit parent decision regarding visitation with third parties.ibid.
in california,family code section,subdivision a section,as relevant here,provides if either parent of an unemancipated minor child is deceased,the grandparents of the deceased parent may be granted reasonable visitation with the child during the child minority upon a finding that the visitation would be in the best interest of the minor child.
under troxel,however,section has been held unconstitutional as applied in particular factual circumstances.for example,in zasueta zasueta th,the court held the trial court erred by dismiss ing the surviving parent concerns about visitation which related to the grandparents drinking,swearing,and uncleanliness,as well as the child uneasiness and acting out after visits instead of according them special weight.id.at.
similarly,punsly ho th,disapproved on other grounds in conservatorship of whitley cal th,footnote,held that the trial court erred because it did not apply a presumption that the surviving parent visitation decisions were in the child best interest.id.at.moreover,the trial court erred by dismiss ing her concerns about visitation,including the fact that the grandparents used inappropriate language.id.at.
also in punsly,the grandparents argued that troxel did not apply because the surviving parent had cut off visitation entirely punsly ho,supra,th at only after the grandparents obtained counsel did she offer them a visitation schedule,which they viewed as too restrictive.see also id.at.the court disagreed,stating,we construe troxel emphasis on a parent voluntary efforts for visitation to mean that before a court may intervene,the parent must be given an opportunity to voluntarily negotiate a visitation plan.citation.consequently,it is irrelevant when or why the surviving parent proposed her own visitation schedule.the important consideration here is that she did.id.at.
in kyle donald th,the court noted that the surviving parent was fit,and he was willing to allow grandparent visitation he simply did not want a visitation schedule,so that visits would be spontaneous and would not interfere with the child routine.id.at.it concluded,in light of the fact the surviving parent was a fit parent who had not sought to cut off grandparent visitation completely,and in light of the absence of substantial evidence rebutting the presumption in favor of a fit parent parenting decisions,the application of section to establish a schedule of visitation over the surviving parent objection unduly infringed upon his fundamental parenting right to make decisions about the care,custody,and control of his daughter.citation.id.at.
significantly,however,in fenn sherriff th,the court specifically held that section is not unconstitutional on its face or under all circumstances.fenn,at.giving the parent determination special weight is different than insulating the parent determination from any court intervention whatsoever.troxel does not support defendant suggestion that a fit parent decisions are immune from judicial review.id.at.
in fenn,the surviving parent sought summary judgment denying visitation by the grandparents,on the sole ground that he was fit and he objected to visitation.fenn sherriff,supra,th at see also id.at.in opposition,the grandparents introduced evidence that he had allowed them only extremely restricted visitation among other things,the visitation averaged one hour every two and a half months,it had to be supervised by a person selected by the father,and the grandparents were required to pay various sums connected with the supervised visits amounting to approximately per minute for a one hour visit id.at.
the appellate court held that the father was not entitled to summary judgment,even if we were to take into account the fact that he and his wife have voluntarily provided some visitation to grandparents.citation.it is true that in their analysis of the federal constitutional question presented here,troxel,punsly,and kyle placed significant emphasis on the fact that the fit parents who opposed visitation in those cases had voluntarily allowed some grandparent visitation.citations.it does not follow,ho
