the january,collision 
defendant worked the night shift at a lucky grocery store in vacaville on january.after completing work at the morning of the,defendant telephoned his girlfriend,lori acosta,and informed her he and his friends were going out drinking.when defendant arrived at acosta apartment in woodland later that day,he was loud,obnoxious,and drunk.he continued to drink at her apartment,then went to bed at about 
acosta woke defendant around that same evening because he had to be back at work in vacaville by.she made him take a shower he was out.he was even awake.defendant then left for work,driving acosta red jeep cherokee.there was a storm outside when defendant left,and some roads were flooded.
earlier that day,a county public works official had noticed some flooding on county road just south of county road.county road runs between davis and woodland.the official placed flood warning signs directed at both directions of traffic.the official placed the sign for southbound traffic along county road about feet south of its intersection with county road.the official placed the sign for northbound traffic along county road about of a mile south of the flooded area.
later that evening,jose serrano was driving his family home to woodland.they were returning from san francisco international airport where they had picked up jose brother and his family.the party of eight crowded into jose black cadillac.in the front seat with jose were his wife,teresa his son,christian his,leticia and leticia daughter,alisa.three additional passengers rode in the back seat jose brother,raul raul two and a daughter,carmen and jose daughter,maria.only two people in the car were wearing seat belts jose,the driver and maria,who was strapped into a child car seat.
jose was driving north on county road between davis and woodland.it was dark,and raining hard.jose stopped at a stop sign,continued driving,then decelerated as he approached a sign warning of flooding ahead.he started to accelerate again raul estimated they were traveling between and miles per hour at this time.
suddenly,an oncoming car veered into their lane,going around a pool of water in the southbound lane,and spraying water from the left wheels.jose hit the brakes,exclaiming,son of a bitch,he gon na get us.jose tried steering the car toward the right shoulder to avoid a collision,but the oncoming car was approaching too fast.it struck jose car in the northbound lane.
the impact killed jose immediately.teresa suffered a fractured kneecap.raul fractured his hip.maria sustained a broken arm.christian suffered a concussion.leticia incurred a laceration on her forehead,requiring stitches.alisa had superficial abrasions,and carmen suffered no injuries.
barry wallace was driving northbound on county road at the time.he had driven the road earlier that evening going south.at that time,he had passed a sign near the intersection with county road that read,flooded.he slowed down from to miles per hour to about to miles per hour.when he saw the water in the roadway,he stopped,then drove through it at about five miles per hour because he did not want to drive in the opposite lane of traffic.
returning home and driving north on county road later that evening,wallace saw a black cadillac in the northbound lane that had been in an accident.the cadillac was in the middle of the flooded area.wallace also saw a red jeep cherokee wrapped around a telephone pole.
wallace called and ran to the jeep to assist the driver.defendant was in the jeep driver seat,yelling,get me out.help me.his speech was slurred.police and fire personnel arrived and extracted defendant from the jeep.defendant was combative and smelled of alcohol.his eyes were bloodshot.
defendant was transported to a hospital,where a blood sample was taken at his blood alcohol level was percent.a criminalist testified if defendant consumed his last drink at,his blood alcohol level at the time of the collision could have been as high as percent.
reconstruction of the collision 
california highway patrol officer george reese was the primary accident investigator.when he arrived at the scene at,the rain was pouring.the cadillac had come to stop along the east shoulder of the northbound lane,while the jeep stopped in a pool of water along the west shoulder near a telephone pole.based on the damage to the vehicles and his experience,reese estimated the total impact speed was about miles per hour,with one car traveling between and miles per hour and the other traveling at about miles per hour.
the collision appeared to have been,with the jeep left front headlight colliding with the cadillac left front headlight.relying on the location of debris and witnesses statements,reese concluded the collision occurred in the northbound lane,a few feet from the center line,when the jeep veered into that lane to avoid the flooding in the southbound lane.
reese saw the flood warning signs along county road,and observed both could be read by oncoming traffic about feet away.the sign along the southbound lane in which defendant had driven was about feet before the water in the roadway.reese opined a safe driving speed for county road under rainy conditions that night was miles per hour,and a safe speed after seeing the flood warning signs would have been five miles per hour.
he thus concluded the jeep estimated speed of to miles per hour was unsafe for the conditions that evening.had defendant driven at a safe speed,reese believed there was more than enough time for him to stop before encountering the flooded roadway.reese also concluded defendant was driving under the influence of alcohol,and defendant had violated vehicle code section,subdivision a,by driving on the wrong side of the road.
california highway patrol chp accident reconstruction investigator christopher port testified there were two possible areas of impact,both in the northbound lane.under one scenario,the jeep would have been traveling at miles per hour,while the cadillac would have been traveling at miles per hour.under the other scenario,the jeep would have been traveling at miles per hour,and the cadillac would have been traveling at miles per hour.port opined the collision was,and neither vehicle swerved prior to the collision to avoid impact.
the vehicles were not impounded by the highway patrol and had been destroyed by the time of trial.
defendant prior arrests 
the trial court admitted evidence of two prior incidents where defendant was arrested for driving under the influence of alcohol.the evidence was admitted for the limited purpose of establishing defendant state of mind at the time of the january,fatal accident.
the first arrest resulted in defendant being convicted on may,in placer county for violating vehicle code section,subdivision a.the court placed defendant on three years probation and ordered him to enroll in a program for dui offenders.the program included many hours of instruction and discussion on the dangers of drinking and driving and the medical,emotional and social problems caused by alcohol.defendant successfully completed the program.
the second arrest occurred on december,a mere one month before the accident here at issue.in that case,defendant was driving a ford bronco that crashed into a parked car,causing the parked car to collide with another parked car.a woodland police officer found defendant drunk at acosta apartment.defendant stated he knew why the officer was there i fucked up and hit some cars.defendant failed field sobriety tests.preliminary alcohol screening tests indicated defendant blood alcohol level was at percent and percent.
the officer arrested defendant and took him to the police station.there,breathalyzer tests were administered.they indicated defendant blood alcohol level was percent and percent.after waiving his rights under miranda arizona,d,defendant admitted colliding with the parked car.he left the scene of the accident because he knew he was drunk.he also stated he knew he had an alcohol problem,and he had fucked up bad.
defendant was ultimately convicted of driving under the influence on june.
the defense 
relevant to the arguments raised on appeal was the testimony of philip,a retired california highway patrol accident reconstruction investigator.reviewed the investigation reports,photographs,preliminary hearing transcripts,and the trial testimony of the prosecution reconstruction experts,officer reese and investigator port.based on this review,concluded there was insufficient evidence from the scene to determine either the speed of the vehicles at the time of the collision or the point of impact.he stated even if the cars were still available for inspection,their speeds could not be determined because of the unknown influence of the water on the roadway.
opined the photographs showed the accident was not a total impact,but was a to impact.based on the trial testimony,asserted a belief defendant did not intentionally steer the jeep into the northbound lane.also asserted a belief the jeep hit the water,hydroplaned,and crossed over into the northbound lane.
in opinion,the collision was caused by the placement of the flood warning signs.he stated the placement of the signs violated requirements of the california department of transportation and the united states department of transportation.given the flooded condition of the road,believed the road should have been closed in both directions,or a traffic control system should have been used to allow drivers to circumvent the flooded areas and take turns safely driving in the lane.on,insisted defendant intoxication had nothing to do with the accident.
discussion 
records and testimony of defendant participation in county drinking driver program 
defendant claims the prosecution unlawfully obtained copies of records documenting his participation in a drinking driver program.he also claims the trial court committed prejudicial error by admitting those documents and testimony concerning the documents and the program into evidence.we disagree.
procedural and factual background 
on october,the prosecutor sought a subpoena duces tecum from the trial court to obtain all records relating to the defendant in the custody of the yolo county alcohol,drug and mental health department.a sealed record containing the records arrived at the court on october.on october,defendant trial counsel stipulated the prosecutor could inspect the records on condition copies were provided to him.the prosecutor inspected the records and gave copies to defense counsel.defense counsel later stated that at the time he agreed to the stipulation,he did not intend to waive any rights of confidentiality,he did not know what was in the envelope until he opened it,and he was just trying to expedite things.
prior to trial,the prosecution filed a motion in limine to introduce evidence of defendant and dui convictions and his participation in a yolo county dui education program from may through february.defendant opposed,arguing his dui program records were privileged under health and safety code section.that statute concerns the confidentiality of patient records maintained in connection with any state drug abuse treatment or prevention effort or function health,subd.a.it prohibits the release of such patient records by a court absent a search warrant and appointment of a special master pursuant to penal code section,subdivision c.health,subd.c.
on the first day of trial,the court ruled the prosecution could introduce the fact defendant was convicted of dui in,and the circumstances which led to his arrest for dui in,but not the fact of his conviction for that latter instance.the court also ruled evidence of defendant participation in the dui program was privileged under health and safety code section and thus was not admissible because the prosecution had not laid a proper foundation by complying with the requirements of penal code section,subdivision c however,the court added it would admit the evidence if the prosecution could lay a proper foundation because federal regulations on confidentiality had been satisfied.
two days later,the trial court reconsidered its ruling on the admissibility of the dui program records.upon further review,the court concluded the dui program was not governed by health and safety code section.instead,it was governed by regulations implementing health and safety code sections and.these statutes regulate the licensure and operation of dui programs.regulations implementing these statutes require dui programs to assure the confidentiality of participant records not by complying with penal code section,but rather by complying with code of federal regulations parts through.tit.
however,the court ruled the prosecutor still could not introduce defendant records because the prosecutor had not satisfied the procedures established in the federal regulations for obtaining the documents.those procedures required the requesting party to file an application with the court using a fictitious name to represent the person whose records were being sought the procedures also required the person
