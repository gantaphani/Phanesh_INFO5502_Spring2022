our prior opinion filed on january,and reported at is vacated concurrent with the filing of a new opinion today.
the petition for panel rehearing and the petition for rehearing en banc are denied as moot.the parties may file new petitions for rehearing and rehearing en banc in accordance with the federal rules of appellate procedure.
it is so ordered.
the named appellants in this action appellants are scientists,engineers,and administrative support personnel at the jet propulsion laboratory jpl,a research laboratory run jointly by the national aeronautics and space administration nasa and the california institute of technology caltech.appellants sued nasa,caltech,and the department of commerce collectively appellees,challenging nasa recently adopted requirement that low risk contract employees like themselves submit to background investigations.the district court denied appellants request for a preliminary injunction,finding they were unlikely to succeed on the merits and unable to demonstrate irreparable harm.because appellants raise serious legal and constitutional questions and because the balance of hardships tips sharply in their favor,we reverse and remand.
jpl is located on federally owned land,but operated entirely by caltech pursuant to a contract with nasa.like all jpl personnel,appellants are employed by caltech,not the government.appellants are designated by the government as low risk contract employees.they do not work with classified material.
appellants contest nasa newly instated procedures requiring low risk jpl personnel to yield to broad background investigations as a condition of retaining access to jpl facilities.nasa new policy requires that every jpl employee undergo a national agency check with inquiries naci,the same background investigation required of government civil service employees,before he or she can obtain an identification badge needed for access to jpl facilities.the naci investigation requires the applicant to complete and submit standard form sf,which asks for background information,including residential,educational,employment,and military histories the names of three references that know you well and disclosure of any illegal drug use,possession,supply,or manufacture within the past year,along with the nature and circumstances of any such activities and any treatment or counseling received.this information is then checked against four government databases investigations index the defense clearance and investigation index the fbi name check and the fbi national criminal history fingerprint check.finally,sf requires the applicant to sign an authorization for release of information that authorizes the government to collect any information relating to his or her activities from schools,residential management agents,employers,criminal justice agencies,retail business establishments,or other sources of information.the information sought may include,but is not limited to,the applicant academic,residential,achievement,performance,attendance,disciplinary,employment history,and criminal history record information.the record is vague as to the exact extent to and manner in which the government will seek this information,but it is undisputed that each of the applicants references,employers,and landlords will be sent an investigative request for personal information form,which asks whether the recipient has any reason to question the applicant honesty or trustworthiness or has any adverse information about the applicant employment,residence,or activities concerning violations of law,financial integrity,abuse of alcohol drugs,mental or emotional stability,general behavior or conduct,or other matters.the recipient is asked to explain any adverse information noted on the form.once the information has been collected,nasa and the federal office of personnel management determine whether the employee is suitable for continued access to nasa facilities,though the exact mechanics of this suitability determination are in dispute 
since it was first created in,nasa,like all other federal agencies,has conducted naci investigations of its civil servant employees but not of its contract employees.around the year,however,nasa determined that the incomplete screening of contractor employees posed a security vulnerability for the agency and began to consider requiring naci investigations for contract employees as well.in november,revisions to nasa security program procedural requirements imposed the same baseline naci investigation for all employees,civil servant or contractor.these changes were not made applicable to jpl employees until january,when nasa modified its contract with caltech to include the requirement.caltech vigorously opposed the change,but nasa invoked its contractual right to unilaterally modify the contract and directed caltech to comply immediately with the modifications.caltech subsequently adopted a required by all jpl employees who did not successfully complete the naci process so as to receive a federal identification badge would be deemed to have voluntarily resigned their caltech employment.
on august,appellants filed suit alleging,both individually and on behalf of the class of jpl employees in or low risk positions,that nasa newly imposed background investigations are unlawful.appellants bring three primary claims nasa and the department of commerce collectively federal appellees violated the administrative procedure act apa by acting without statutory authority in imposing the investigations on contract employees the investigations constitute unreasonable searches prohibited by the fourth amendment and the investigations violate their constitutional right to informational privacy.
on september,appellants moved for a preliminary injunction against the new policy on the basis that any jpl worker who failed to submit an sf questionnaire by october,would be summarily terminated.the district court denied appellants request.it divided appellants claims into two challenging the sf questionnaire itself and those challenging the grounds upon which an employee might be deemed found that the challenges to the suitability determination were highly speculative and unripe for judicial review.the court rejected appellants apa claim,finding statutory support for the investigations in the national aeronautics and space act of the space act,a.the court rejected appellants fourth amendment argument,holding that a background investigation was not a search within the meaning of the fourth amendment.finally,the court found that the sf questionnaire implicated the constitutional right to informational privacy but was narrowly tailored to further the government legitimate security interest.after concluding that appellants had little chance of success on the merits,the district court also found that they could not demonstrate irreparable injury because any unlawful denial of access to jpl facilities could be remedied post hoc through compensatory relief.
on appeal,a motions panel of our court granted a temporary injunction pending a merits determination of the denial of the preliminary injunction.nelson nasa,cir.the panel concluded that the information sought by sf and its waiver requirement raised serious privacy issues and questioned whether it was narrowly tailored to meet the government legitimate interest in ascertaining the identity of its employees.id.at.the panel further found that t he balance of hardships tips sharply in favor of a ppellants,who risk losing their jobs pending appeal,whereas there was no exigent reason for performing the naci investigations during the few months pending appeal given that it has been more than three years since the presidential directive upon which the government relies was issued.id.at.
to obtain preliminary injunctive relief,appellants must demonstrate either a likelihood of success on the merits and the possibility of irreparable injury or that serious questions going to the merits were raised and the balance of hardships tips sharply in its favor.walczak epl prolong,cir.the two prongs are not separate tests but rather extremes of a single continuum,so the greater the relative hardship to the party seeking the preliminary injunction,the less probability of success must be shown.id.internal quotation marks omitted.
upon review of the merits of the district court denial of preliminary injunctive relief,we find ourselves in agreement with the motions panel.appellants have demonstrated serious questions as to their informational privacy claim,and the balance of hardships tips sharply in their favor.we therefore conclude that the district court abused its discretion in denying appellants motion for a preliminary injunction,and we reverse and remand.
standing and ripeness 
the district court found that the justiciability doctrines of ripeness and standing precluded consideration of appellants claims,except as they concerned the sf questionnaire and associated waiver.we agree with the district court that appellants claims concerning the suitability determination are unripe and unfit for judicial review however,the district court misconstrued appellants informational privacy claim,viewing it as limited to the sf questionnaire alone.
to enforce article iii limitation of federal jurisdiction to cases and controversies,plaintiffs must demonstrate both standing and ripeness.to demonstrate standing,a plaintiff must have suffered an injury in fact an invasion of a legally protected interest which is a concrete and particularized,and b actual or imminent,not conjectural or hypothetical.lujan defenders of wildlife,d internal citations and quotation marks omitted.the ripeness doctrine similarly serves to prevent the courts,through avoidance of premature adjudication,from entangling themselves in abstract disagreements over administrative policies and requires assessing both the fitness of the issues for judicial decision and the hardship to the parties of withholding court consideration.ass of am.med.colls.united states,cir quoting abbott labs.gardner,d.
in analyzing justiciability,the district court distilled appellants claims into two basic arguments that sf is overly broad and intrusive considering the nature of appellants jobs at jpl and that jpl internal policy,which lists various grounds upon which an employee can be determined unsuitable for employment,is unconstitutional.we agree that challenges to the suitability determination are unripe because the record does not sufficiently establish how the government intends to determine suitability accordingly,any claims are strictly speculative.we also agree that appellants have standing to challenge the sf questionnaire,and because it is undisputed that if appellants do not sign the sf waiver by october,they will be deemed to have voluntarily resigned,there exists a concrete injury that is imminent and not hypothetical and thus ripe for review.
however,the district court overlooked appellants challenges to the government investigation that will result from the sf requirement that the applicant sign an authorization for release of information.on its face,this waiver authorizes the government to collect any information from schools,residential management agents,employers,criminal justice agencies,retail business establishments,or other sources of information includ ing,but not limited to,academic,residential,performance,attendance,disciplinary,employment history,and criminal history record information.emphasis added.it is uncontested that as a result of this authorization,the government office of personnel management will send out investigative request s for personal information,form,to references,employers,and landlords.this form seeks highly personal information using an questioning technique,including asking for any adverse information at all or any additional information which may have a bearing on this person suitability for government employment.any harm that results from form dissemination and the information consequently provided to the government will be concrete and immediate.
because federal appellees freely admit that form will be used in nasa background investigations,appellants have standing to challenge form distribution and solicitation of private information,and the issues raised in these challenges are ripe for review.the district court erred by excluding form claims from its analysis of appellants likelihood of success on the merits.
appellants first claim that federal appellees violated the apa by imposing background investigations on contract employees without any basis in executive order or statute.the district court found that congress gave nasa the authority to conduct such investigations in the space act of,which provides 
the nasa administrator shall establish such security requirements,restrictions,and safeguards as he deems necessary in the interest of the national security.the administrator may arrange with the director of the office of personnel management for the conduct of such security or other personnel investigations of the administration officers,employees,and consultants,and its contractors and subcontractors and their officers and employees,actual or prospective,as he deems appropriate 
appellants argue that the security or other personnel investigations described in the second sentence of a are examples of the security requirements,restrictions,and safeguards described in the first sentence and therefore may only be established as deem ed necessary in the interest of the national security.they then argue that this limiting clause must be read in light of cole young,where the supreme court interpreted a statute giving certain government officials the power to summarily dismiss employees when deemed necessary in the interest of the national security.id.at.internal quotation marks omitted.in cole,the court found it clear that national security was not used in the act in an sense,but was intended to refer only to the protection of sensitive activities and therefore held that an employee can be dismissed in the interest of the national security under the act only if he occupies a sensitive position.id.at.appellants claim that,by using identical limiting language in the space act so soon after cole,congress intended to authorize personnel investigations only of contractors in sensitive positions and not of the low risk contractors at issue in this case.
we need not resolve whether the reference to the interest of the national security in a should be interpreted in light of cole,because we read this limiting language to apply only to the security requirements,restrictions,and safeguards described in the first sentence and not to the personnel investigations described in the second sentence.the second sentence could plausibly be read as an example of the security requirements,restrictions,and safeguards described in the first sentence,but the statute legislative history strongly suggests that it was instead meant to be a separate and distinct authorization of power.the conference report describes the two sentences separately and notes that the senate version of the bill contained the second sentence but not the first.conf,as reprinted in.this suggests that a provides two distinct authorizations,the latter of which allows the nasa administrator to arrange for security and other personnel investigations of contractors as he deems appropriate,regardless of whether these investigations are necessary in the interest of the national security.because the space act appears to grant nasa the statutory authority to require the investigations here at issue,we agree with the district court that appellants are unlikely to succeed on the merits of their apa claim 
fourth amendment claim 
we also agree with the district court conclusion that appellants are unlikely to succeed on their fourth amendment claims,because the government actions are not likely to be deemed searches within the meaning of the amendment.an action to uncover information is generally considered a search if the target of the search has a reasonable expectation of privacy in the information being sought,a term of art meaning a subjective expectation of privacy that society is prepared to recognize as reasonable.united states,cir citing katz united states,d harlan,concurring.one does not have a reasonable expectation of privacy in one information for fourth amendment purposes merely because that information is of a private nature instead,fourth amendment protection can evaporate in any of several ways.see,united states miller,d holding that there is no reasonable expectation of privacy in bank records in part because the information was voluntarily disclosed to the bank.to succeed on their fourth amendment claim,therefore,appellants must demonstrate that either the form inquiries sent to third parties or the sf questionnaire itself violates a reasonable expectation of privacy so as to be considered a search within the meaning of the amendment.
form inquiries 
what a person knowingly exposes to the public is not a subject of fourth amendment protection,katz united states,d however,information does not lose fourth amendment protection simply because it is conveyed to another party.for example,in katz,fbi agents attached an electronic listening device to the outside of a public telephone booth and recorded the defendant transmitting illegal betting information over the telephone.id.at.even though the booth occupant had voluntarily conveyed the information in the conversation to the party on the other end of the line,the court found that he was surely entitled to assume that the words he utters into the mouthpiece w ould not be broadcast to the world,so the covert surveillance was considered a search within the meaning of the amendment.id.at.
on the other hand,in united states white,the supreme court held that the electronic surveillance of a conversation between a defendant and a government informant did not constitute a search for fourth amendment purposes,d plurality.the court acknowledged that,as in katz,the speaker likely expected the content of the conversations to be kept private however,it held as a rule that the fourth amendment affords no protection to a wrongdoer misplaced belief that a person to whom he voluntarily confides his wrongdoing will not reveal it.id.at.quoting hoffa united states,d.in united states miller,d,holding that the government could subpoena private bank records without implicating the fourth amendment,the court extended the rule to all information knowingly revealed to the government by third parties 
t he fourth amendment does not prohibit the obtaining of information revealed to a third party and conveyed by him to government authorities,even if the information is revealed on the assumption that it will be used only for a limited purpose and the confidence placed in the third party will not be betrayed.
in the challenged background investigations,the government will send written form inquiries to the applicant acquaintances.through these inquiries,the third parties may disclose highly personal information about the applicant.as in white and miller,the applicant presumably revealed this information to the third party with the understandable expectation that this information would be kept confidential.nonetheless,these written inquiries appear to fit squarely under miller rule and therefore can not be considered searches under the fourth amendment 
sf questionnaire 
the sf questionnaire required of the applicant is also unlikely to be considered a fourth amendment search.requiring an individual to answer questions may lead to the forced disclosure of information that he or she reasonably expects to keep private.historically,however,when the objective is to obtain testimonial rather than physical evidence,the relevant constitutional amendment is not the fourth but the fifth.greenawalt.dep t of,cir holding that a psychological examination required for continued government employment was not a search under the fourth amendment.
as judge posner notes in greenawalt,direct questioning can potentially lead to a far greater invasion of privacy than many of the physical examinations that have in the past been considered fourth amendment searches.id.at.nonetheless,applying the fourth amendment to such questioning would force the courts to analyze a wide range of novel contexts,courtroom testimony,police witness interviews,credit checks,and,as here,background checks under a complex doctrine,with its cumbersome warrant and probable cause requirements and their myriad exceptions,that was designed with completely different circumstances in mind.id.at.moreover,declining to extend the fourth amendment to direct questioning will by no means leave individuals unprotected,as such contexts will remain governed by traditional fifth and sixth amendment interrogation rights,and the right to informational privacy described below.see id.at.
because neither the written inquiries directed at third parties nor the sf questionnaire directed at the applicants will likely be deemed searches,appellants are unlikely to succeed on their fourth amendment claims.
informational privacy claim 
although the district court correctly found that appellants were unlikely to succeed on their apa and fourth amendment claims,it significantly underestimated the likelihood that appellants would succeed on their informational privacy claim.these constitutional errors stem in large part from the court erroneous ripeness ruling by limiting its analysis to the sf questionnaire,the court failed to consider the most problematic aspect of the government form inquiries.
we have repeatedly acknowledged that the constitution protects an individual interest in avoiding disclosure of personal matters.in re crawford,cir.this interest covers a wide range of personal matters,including sexual activity,thorne city of el segundo,cir holding that questioning police applicant about her prior sexual activity violated her right to informational privacy,medical information,lawrence berkeley,cir the constitutionally protected privacy interest in avoiding disclosure of personal matters clearly encompasses medical information and its confidentiality,and financial matters,crawford,at agreeing that public disclosure of social security numbers may implicate the right to informational privacy in an era of rampant identity theft.if the government actions compel disclosure of private information,it has the burden of showing that its use of the information would advance a legitimate state interest and that its actions are narrowly tailored to meet the legitimate interest.crawford,at internal quotation marks omitted.we must balance the government interest in having or using the information against the individual interest in denying access,doe att y,cir,weighing,among other things 
the type of information requested,the potential for harm in any subsequent nonconsensual disclosure,the adequacy of safeguards to prevent unauthorized disclosure,the degree of need for access,and whether there is an express statutory mandate,articulated public policy,or other recognizable public interest militating towards access.
id.quoting united states westinghouse,cir alteration in original.
both the sf questionnaire and the form written inquiries require the disclosure of personal information and each presents a ripe controversy.therefore,whereas the district court limited its analysis to the sf questionnaire,we consider the constitutionality of both aspects of the investigation in turn.
sf questionnaire 
appellants concede that most of the questions on the sf form are unproblematic and do not implicate the constitutional right to informational privacy.they do however challenge the constitutionality of one group of questions concerning illegal drugs.the questionnaire asks the applicant 
in the last year,have you used,possessed,supplied,or manufactured illegal drugs if you answered yes,provide information relating to the types of substance s,the nature of the activity,and any other details relating to your involvement with illegal drugs.include any treatment or counseling received.
the form indicates that n either your truthful response nor information derived from your response will be used as evidence against you in any subsequent criminal proceeding.the district court concluded that the requested information implicated the right to informational privacy,but found that there were adequate safeguards in place to deal with these sensitive questions.
other courts have been skeptical that questions concerning illegal drug less possession,supply,or even implicate the right to informational privacy.for example,in mangels pena,cir,the tenth circuit held that the disclosure of firefighters past illegal drug use did not violate their informational privacy rights.id.at.the court held that t he possession of contraband drugs does not implicate any aspect of personal identity which,under prevailing precedent,is entitled to constitutional protection validly enacted drug laws put citizens on notice that this realm is not a private one.id.at internal citations omitted.in national treasury employees union department of treasury,cir,the fifth circuit considered a similar form to the sf questionnaire,with almost identical questions concerning illegal drugs,and rejected the applicants informational privacy claims.the court raised similar concerns to the tenth circuit 
today society has made the bold and unequivocal statement that illegal substance abuse will not be tolerated.the government declared an war on illegal drugs more than a decade ago surely anyone who works for the government has a diminished expectation that his drug and alcohol abuse history can be kept secret,given that he works for the very government that has declared war on substance abuse.
id.at.the court also noted that the plaintiffs in that case were all federal employees in either high or moderate risk public trust positions,and were thus acutely aware of their employer elevated expectations in their integrity and performance.id.at.
like the tenth and fifth circuits,we are sensitive to the government interest in uncovering and addressing illegal substance abuse among its employees and contractors,given the public stance it has taken against such abuse.this government interest is undoubtedly relevant to the constitutional balancing inquiry whether the forced disclosure would advance a legitimate state interest and is narrowly tailored to meet the legitimate interest.crawford,at.we are less convinced,however,that the government interest should inform the threshold question of whether requested information is sufficiently personal to invoke the constitutional right to privacy.we doubt that the government can strip personal information of constitutional protection simply by criminalizing the underlying,to force disclosure of personal information,the government must at least demonstrate that the disclosure furthers a legitimate state interest.drug dependance and abuse carries an enormous stigma in our society and is not generally disclosed by individuals to the public.id.at.if we had to reach the issue,therefore,we would be inclined to agree with the district court that sf drug questions reach sensitive issues that implicate the constitutional right to informational privacy.
we do not need to decide this issue,however,because even if the question requiring disclosure of prior drug use,possession,supply,and manufacture does implicate the privacy right,it is narrowly tailored to achieve the government legitimate interest.as our sister circuits have lucidly explained,the federal government has taken a strong stance in its war on illegal drugs,and this stance would be significantly undermined if its own employees and contractors freely ignored its laws.by requiring applicants to disclose whether they have used,possessed,supplied,or manufactured illegal drugs within the past year,and,if so,to explain the nature of the activity and any other details relating to the applicant involvement with illegal drugs,the government has crafted a narrow inquiry designed to limit the disclosure of personal information to that which is necessary to further the government legitimate interest.
the same can not be said,however,for requiring applicants to disclose any treatment or counseling received for their drug problems.information relating to medical treatment and psychological counseling fall squarely within the domain protected by the constitutional right to informational privacy.see,at doe,at.the government has not suggested any legitimate interest in requiring the disclosure of such information indeed,any treatment or counseling received for illegal drug use would presumably lessen the government concerns regarding the underlying activity.because sf appears to compel disclosure of personal medical information for which the government has failed to demonstrate a legitimate state interest,appellants are likely to succeed on of their informational privacy challenge to sf.
form inquiries 
the form written from the district court analysis as a result of its erroneous ripeness much more problematic.form solicits any adverse information concerning financial integrity,abuse of alcohol drugs,mental or emotional stability,general behavior or conduct,and other matters.these questions are designed to elicit a wide range of adverse,private information that is not generally disclosed by individuals to the public and therefore seemingly implicate the right to informational privacy.crawford,at 
the government suggests that even if the information disclosed in the investigation implicates the right to informational privacy,the scheme must be upheld because the government has taken measures to keep the information from being disclosed to the general public.although the risk of public disclosure is undoubtedly an important consideration in our analysis,see planned parenthood of lawall,cir,it is only one of many factors that we should consider,id.at t he right to informational privacy applies both when an individual chooses not to disclose highly sensitive information to the government and when an individual seeks assurance that such information will not be made public,at noting that a government action can violate the right to privacy without disclosure to third parties doe,at listing,as two factors among many,the potential for harm in any subsequent nonconsensual disclosure and the adequacy of safeguards to prevent authorized disclosure.quoting westinghouse,at.therefore,although safeguards exist to help prevent disclosure of the applicants highly sensitive information,federal appellees must still demonstrate that the background investigations are justified by legitimate state interests and that form questions are narrowly tailored to meet those legitimate interests.thorne,at.
we agree with the government that it has several legitimate reasons for investigating its contractors.nasa has an interest in verifying its contractors identities to make sure that they are who they say they are,and it has an interest in ensuring the security of the jpl facility so as not to jeopardize the costly investments housed therein.appellants concede,as they must,that these are legitimate government interests.
the government has failed to demonstrate,however,that form questions are narrowly tailored to meet these legitimate interests.initially,we note that although nasa has a general interest in keeping the jpl facility secure,there is no specific evidence in the record to suggest that any of the low risk jpl personnel pose such a security risk indeed,nasa appears to designate as moderate risk any individual who has the opportunity to cause damage to a significant nasa asset or influence the design or implementation of a security mechanism designed to protect a significant nasa asset.more importantly,form broad,questions appear to range far beyond the scope of the legitimate state interests that the government has proposed.asking for any adverse information about this person employment,residence,or activities may solicit some information relevant to the applicant identity or security risk,but there are no safeguards in place to limit the disclosures to information relevant to these interests.instead,the form invites the recipient to reveal any negative information of which he or she is aware.it is difficult to see how the vague solicitation of derogatory information concerning the applicant general behavior or conduct and other matters could be narrowly tailored to meet any legitimate need,much less the specific interests that feder
