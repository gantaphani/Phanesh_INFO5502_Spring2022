in this interlocutory appeal,both plaintiffs and defendants in protracted litigation over trust accounts held by federal officials on behalf of american indians seek review of orders of the district court.the district court held the department of the interior to be in continuing breach of its duty to account for trust funds and that accounting for the funds was impossible it ordered monetary relief to the members of the plaintiff class.on review,we hold that while the district court analysis of duty and breach are generally correct,the court erred in freeing the department of the interior from its burden to make an accounting.we therefore vacate the district court orders and remand for further proceedings.
background 
in,beneficiaries of individual indian money iim trust accounts brought this class action against the secretary of the interior,the secretary of the treasury,and the assistant secretary of the interior for indian affairs,alleging that those officials had violated their fiduciary duties as trustees acting on behalf of the united states.see cobell babbitt,d,cobell i.the bulk of the trust assets are the proceeds of various transactions in land allotted to individual indians under the general allotment act of,known as the dawes act.cobell norton,cobell xiii citing stat.codified as amended at et repealed.in bringing this action,appellants rely upon the american indian trust fund management reform act of,stat.codified as amended at et id.at act.that statute requires the secretary of the interior to account for the daily and annual balance of all funds held in trust by the united states for the benefit of an individual indian which are deposited or invested pursuant to the act of june.a.the plaintiffs initially sought an accounting of the trust funds but did not seek payment of any money beyond court costs,experts costs,and attorneys fees.cobell i,d at.
plaintiffs and defendants cross appeal from two orders of the district court.the first,cobell kempthorne,d,cobell xx,held that the department of the interior continued to breach its duty to account for trust funds as identified in cobell babbitt,d,cobell v,and affirmed by this court in cobell norton,cobell vi.cobell xx further held that accounting for the funds was impossible as a conclusion of law because the government could not achieve an accounting that passes muster as a trust accounting given inadequate present and likely future funding from congress.supp at.the second order of the district court,cobell kempthorne,d,cobell xxi,granted equitable restitution to the plaintiff class based on the unproven shortfall of the trust actual value as compared with its statistically likely value.the district court stressed that breaching the duty to account did not generate the government financial liability.id.at.rather,the government failure properly to allocate and pay trust funds to beneficiaries gave rise to restitution or disgorgement of the very money that ha d been withheld.id.accordingly,the court awarded to the plaintiff class in what it called a restitutionary award.id.at.
soon after issuing cobell xxi,the district court certified an immediate interlocutory appeal from both decisions under b.order.all plaintiffs and all defendants petitioned for permission to appeal,and this court granted the petitions.orders.
we now hold that the district court correctly held that the act and cobell vi required a full accounting,but erred in holding that an accounting can not be conducted because,in the district court view,congress will never appropriate the funds necessary to conduct such an accounting.the statute gives the plaintiff class a right to an accounting.sitting in equity,the district court has the authority to approve a plan that efficiently uses limited government resources to achieve that goal.it is within the power of the district court to order an accounting without requiring interior to perform analyses the costs of which exceed the benefits payable to individual american indians.it would indeed be nuts to spend billions to recover millions.cobell xx,d at.a court sitting in equity may avoid reaching that absurdity.
as this case enters its thirteenth year,it becomes increasingly difficult to summarize its factual and procedural background.see cobell xx,d at collecting quotations from charles dickens bleak house id.at attempting such a summary.cobell vi contains a general description of how funds came to be deposited in the iim accounts.at.for a summary of their early mismanagement and the government early attempts at reform,see id.at.
since passage of the the filing of this department of the interior has had mixed success in its efforts to account for the trust funds.cobell xx,d at,provides a good summary of the evolution of the current historical accounting project.apart from interior independent efforts,the district court has frequently issued injunctions specifying the terms of an accounting that it held were required by the act.in,the district court issued an injunction declaring the government in violation of the act and in breach of trust.cobell v,d at.the injunction ordered the defendants to provide plaintiffs an accurate accounting of all money in the iim trust held in trust for the benefit of plaintiffs,without regard to when the funds were deposited,and laid out a general plan for compliance.id.we affirmed the district court order in.cobell vi,at.
in,the district court issued a injunction.see cobell norton,d,cobell x.that injunction called for a detailed accounting of all funds deposited or invested in,id.at,or assets held by,the trust since the passage of the general allotment act of,id.at,as well as money held by indian tribes,accounts of deceased beneficiaries,and all property escheated from the trust.id.at.when performing this accounting,interior was prohibited from mak ing use of any statistical sampling.id.at.in cobell xiii,at,we vacated the historical accounting portions of cobell x injunction,relying on the appropriations language of the department of the interior and related agencies appropriations act of,pub,stat.that act,passed by congress in november,conditioned the appropriation of indian trust money on the requirement that nothing in the act,or in any other statute,and no principle of common law,sh ould be construed or applied to require the department of the interior to commence or continue historical accounting activities with respect to the individual indian money trust until a congress amended the act to delineate interior specific historical accounting obligations or b december.stat.at.
after arrived without congressional action,the district court reissued the injunction that had been vacated by cobell xiii.reasoning that december,ha d come and gone with no legislative solution,the district court held itself bound,by its findings of fact and conclusions of law in cobell x,to reissue without modification the historical accounting provisions of its structural injunction.cobell norton,d,cobell xiv.we again vacated the district court injunction.see cobell norton,cobell xvi.we explained that the act general language does support the inherently implausible inference that it intended to order the best imaginable accounting without regard to cost.id.at.because of the unique nature of this trust,we held that the common law of trusts does offer a clear path for resolving the ambiguities involved in setting the parameters of an accounting.id.at.and because congress was,after all,mandating an activity to be funded entirely at the taxpayers expense,we held that the act did not grant courts the same discretion that an equity court would enjoy in dealing with a negligent trustee to order the best imaginable accounting without regard to cost.id.at.congress limited appropriation undercut any mandate to indulge in fact,it suggest ed quite the opposite.id.
when we vacated the district court injunction for abuse of discretion,we noted in particular that the injunction caused the cost to rise by more than an order of magnitude,from million over five years to more than billion.id.at.we then specifically approved the use of statistical sampling on the rationale that for s
