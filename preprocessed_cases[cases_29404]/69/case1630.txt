autoliv asp,autoliv appeals the decision of the united states district court for the eastern district of michigan denying autoliv motion for relief from judgment in favor of venture industries,vemco,patent holding,and larry winget collectively venture,pursuant to federal rule of civil procedure,sections b and b.venture indus.autoliv asp.july,judge avern cohn we conclude that the district court did not err in denying autoliv request under rule b,but that the district court erred in failing to address whether venture use at trial of financial statements containing false information constituted fraud,misrepresentation,or other misconduct warranting relief under rule b.accordingly,we affirm in part,vacate in part,and remand.
background 
this appeal presents the issue of whether the use of falsified information in financial statements by venture damages expert at trial entitles autoliv to relief from judgment under either rule b or b of the federal rules of civil procedure.
as part of the settlement of a patent dispute between venture and autoliv,venture and autoliv executed a supply agreement under the supply agreement,autoliv was obligated to purchase airbag covers from venture so long as venture was capable of filling the order and venture bids were reasonably competitive with the bids of other suppliers.in the period after,autoliv purchased some covers from venture,but also acquired covers from other sources.
on november,venture filed suit against autoliv alleging that autoliv breached the supply agreement with respect to airbag cover projects either by not allowing venture to bid on the projects or by rejecting venture reasonably competitive bids.venture complaint also stated several patent law claims,including claims for correction of inventorship,declaratory judgment of unenforceability of patents autoliv claimed to own,and declaratory judgment of infringement of patents venture claimed to own.these claims were stayed by the district court pending the outcome of arbitration of these claims as required by a agreement,also executed as part of the settlement of the litigation.other claims relating to the supply agreement were either stayed by stipulation of the parties or voluntarily dismissed discovery and other pretrial proceedings took place for the next several years.
discovery proved to be contentious.for this reason,on march,the district court appointed a special master to oversee discovery.on november,autoliv submitted to venture the following request for production of documents 
please produce each and every one of venture monthly,quarterly,and annual internal and external financial statements for the years to the present,whether reviewed,compiled or audited,and all documents relied upon,referred to,consulted or generated in preparing such statements,including your general ledgers,subsidiary ledgers,accounts payable and receivable ledgers,trial balances,accountants work papers,bank statements,check registers and bank records.the term financial statements shall include,but is not limited to your balance sheets,income statements,profit and loss statements,cash flow statements,statements of net worth,statements of retained earnings and all notes to such financial statements.
at.autoliv also requested financial information regarding the relationship between venture and its subsidiaries.venture responded that these requests lack ed foundation in that defendants have never contended plaintiffs financial condition was the basis for withholding the award of any program.at.unsatisfied,autoliv filed a motion to compel further responses on january.on march,the special master denied autoliv motion,concluding that r equests for financial information in this lawsuit are appropriate,but these requests are overbroad.rule b opinion,slip op.at quoting special master report and recommendation.
on april,autoliv,seeking additional financial information,filed a motion to compel the depositions of representatives of venture and two of its subsidiaries pursuant to rule b of the federal rules of civil procedure.on september,the district court orally denied autoliv motion,concluding that a ll of venture financial statements,its annual statements and its quarterly statements and its monthly statements should be produced,but that autoliv proposed deposition topic the basis for the deponent contention that venture bid on each project would have been reasonably competitive with those quotes submitted by others was actually asking for venture position in the litigation.id.at.the district court explained i prefer to wait until the final pretrial statement is prepared and we see which witnesses venture is going to offer and the nature of their testimony and then if there some basis for asking that because you do already have that,that okay id.at.
autoliv did not challenge or seek reconsideration of either the special master or the district court discovery rulings.autoliv also did not submit further requests for the documents or alert the district court to any further problems with the discovery of venture financial information.
on november,trial began in venture action against autoliv for breach of the supply agreement.venture expert witness on damages at trial was aron levko.to calculate venture damages,levko relied on financial information from a manufacturing facility in grand blanc,michigan,operated by a venture subsidiary,vemco,which would have produced the airbag covers for the projects awarded to venture under the supply agreement with autoliv.levko utilized venture actual bids,some third party bids,and two independent production cost studies commissioned by venture in and.the cost estimates in the bids on which levko relied did not separate variable costs,the costs of material and labor from fixed costs,general overhead.levko needed to separate fixed from variable costs for two reasons in addition to claiming lost profits,venture claimed the right to recover the fixed costs attributable to the contracts and levko needed to assign the correct amount of variable costs to the hypothetical bids he constructed for programs where no bid was submitted.to do this,levko used the ratio of fixed to variable costs reflected in grand blanc financial statements.
in order to compute the material cost component of the variable costs,levko needed to calculate the amount of the purchased raw material that would become unusable scrap.to verify the accuracy of the material scrap costs reflected in the bids,levko compared the scrap rate reflected in the bids percent,against the scrap rate discernable from actual production data approximately percent,and the scrap rate reflected in grand blanc financial statements percent.to be conservative,levko used the bid scrap rate of percent in his calculations.based on the bid data,levko calculated a contribution margin of percent.
on december,the jury found that autoliv had breached the supply agreement and awarded venture in damages.the district court entered final judgment against autoliv in the amount of the jury verdict on january,pursuant to rule b of the federal rules of civil procedure.
during the discovery period,venture filed for reorganization under the bankruptcy code.the bankruptcy court appointed doeren mayhew company,doeren mayhew,a forensic accounting firm,to investigate certain aspects of venture financial condition,including,shareholder and related party transactions.rule b opinion,slip op.at 
after the entry of final judgment in this case,on march,doeren mayhew issued a report stating that venture had suffered dollar damages as a result of fraudulent related party transactions.rule b opinion,slip op.at.this conclusion called into question the representations in venture financial statements.
on march,doeren mayhew issued a second report concerning the results of its preliminary investigation of potential accounting irregularities.at.the report focused on vemco and the grand blanc facility as noted,the books and records of that facility had been used by venture damages expert at trial.doeren mayhew discovered questionable accounting procedures and practices,a l ack of proper accounting controls,and potential accounting irregularities and errors,and concluded that grand blanc material cost may have been understated by approximately on a monthly basis during,and that grand blanc had overstated its inventory on its financial records as of december,and by and respectively.at.these misstatements resulted from an employee manipulation of entries in the grand blanc facility computerized accounting system and were reflected in reports generated by that system,including grand blanc financial statements.doeren mayhew second report also called into question venture financial statements,insofar as those statements were based in part on the inaccurate grand blanc financial statements.
on april,venture filed a securities and exchange commission form disclosing the information in the doeren mayhew reports.as to the transactions addressed in the march,doeren mayhew report,the stated that venture had filed a lawsuit seeking r ecovery of payments to one or more of defendants aggregating in excess of,at,and that as a result of the transactions,financial information previously publicly reported by venture holdings as far back as at least is unreliable and should not be relied upon by investors.at.as to the grand blanc accounting issues addressed in the march,doeren mayhew report,the stated that i nvestigation by venture and doeren mayhew disclosed a pparent understatement of payables at the grand blanc facility during fiscal aggregating and o verstatement of inventory at the grand blanc facility during fiscal and in the range of.at.
the doeren mayhew investigation was not immediately called to the district court attention by either party.on april,the district court entered an amended final judgment in the amount of,adding prejudgment interest to the jury award.autoliv appealed to the united states court of appeals for the sixth circuit,which transferred the appeal to this court on july.on october,we stayed the appeal to allow autoliv the opportunity to file with the district court a motion for a new trial pursuant to rule b based on the doeren mayhew reports.autoliv filed its rule b motion on october.autoliv argued that the falsified financial information identified in the doeren mayhew reports constituted newly discovered evidence that could have affected the outcome of the trial,entitling autoliv to a new trial pursuant to rule b and fraud,misrepresentation,or other misconduct of an adverse party during discovery and the trial,entitling autoliv to a new trial under rule b.
after conducting an evidentiary hearing at which levko testified that doeren mayhew conclusions had no effect on his trial testimony,the district court denied autoliv rule b motion.as to rule b,the district court concluded that autoliv failed to prove that the newly discovered financial information would have had an effect on the jury decision on damages.as to rule b,the district court held that venture did not commit discovery misconduct by failing to produce financial information that autoliv alleged would have disclosed the misrepresentations doeren mayhew uncovered in time for use at trial.because the district court had earlier denied autoliv motions to compel such production,and autoliv neither challenged those rulings nor requested further disclosures of internal financial information from venture,the district court concluded that there had been no discovery misconduct.the district court did not address autoliv request for relief under rule b based on levko trial testimony.
autoliv timely appealed from the district court disposition of the rule b issues because venture complaint asserted claims under the patent laws,we have jurisdiction pursuant to a.the ruling of a district court under rule b is final and appealable pursuant to.ashland oil,delta prods.at oral argument,we requested supplemental briefing as to the legal standard applicable to autoliv rule b request.
discussion 
the denial of a motion for a new trial under rule b is reviewed for abuse of discretion.good ohio edison,cir mallory eyrich,cir.an abuse of discretion will be found if the district court relies on clearly erroneous findings of fact,improperly applies the law or uses an erroneous legal standard.united states chambers,cir.
we address autoliv rule b and rule b arguments separately.
as a threshold matter,we reject venture contention that autoliv motion was untimely.rule b provides that motions shall be made within a reasonable time,and for reasons,and not more than one year after the judgment,order,or proceeding was entered or taken.autoliv filed its rule b motion on october,nine months after the entry of judgment on january.though the district court accepted autoliv motion without comment,venture argues here that the delay was unreasonable under rule b.
the sixth circuit has held that whether the time of filing a rule b motion was reasonable is dependent upon the facts in a case,including length and circumstances of delay in filing,prejudice to opposing party by reason of the delay,and circumstances warranting equitable relief.in re,cir here,venture makes no colorable claim that it was prejudiced by autoliv delay.further,venture itself was likely under an obligation to promptly notify the district court of the inaccuracies in levko testimony.see.prof l conduct a,adopted by reference.local b if a lawyer has offered material evidence and comes to know of its falsity,the lawyer shall take reasonable remedial measures.see also schreiber foods,beatrice cheese,once counsel became aware that highly material false statements had been made by a witness,in pleadings submitted to the court and in response to discovery requests schreiber and its counsel were under an obligation to promptly correct the record.
rule b provides,in pertinent part on motion and upon such terms as are just,the court may relieve a party from a final judgment,order,or proceeding for the following reasons newly discovered evidence which by due diligence could not have been discovered in time to move for a new trial under rule b.b west.in order to prevail on a rule b motion,a movant must demonstrate that the evidence is material and controlling and clearly would have produced a different result if presented before the original judgment.good,at internal quotation marks,brackets,and citation omitted.
autoliv argues that the doeren mayhew reports constitute newly discovered evidence that undercut the accuracy of levko testimony,entitling autoliv to a new trial under rule b.at the evidentiary hearing on autoliv motion,levko testified in detail that doeren mayhew findings had no effect on his assessment of venture damages because,in making his calculations,he did not rely primarily on information from the grand blanc facility main accounting system or the financial statements.instead,he relied principally on information from the grand blanc facility bid or quote system.both levko and autoliv expert,glenn sheets,testified that the bid system was separate and independent from the accounting system and that the information from the bid system was not called into question by the doeren mayhew reports.the district court found that autoliv has not made out a case for a finding that had the accounting irregularities described in the march doeren mayhew report been known prior to trial,levko opinion and conclusion on damages would have produced a different result at trial with regard to damages.rule b opinion,slip op.at.
autoliv insists that the district court,in making findings of fact and determinations of the weight and credibility of the evidence,rejected autoliv rule b motion based on the district court own judgment rather than the probable effect of the evidence on the jury.we disagree.the district court expressly assessed the probable effect on the jury,stating it can not be said that if the jury was presented with the doeren mayhew reports its decision on damages would have been any different.id.at.the district court reviewed the factual record in the light of the newly discovered evidence and made findings as to the weight of that evidence to determine what the effect on the jury likely would have been.analysis of the record is necessary to resolve a rule b request 
autoliv also challenges several of the district court specific findings regarding the effect of the accounting irregularities on levko testimony.autoliv questions the bid system information that levko used primarily in calculating venture damages.the bid information was obtained from the grand blanc facility separate bid system.the district court found that this information was separate and independent from the grand blanc facility financial data implicated by the doeren mayhew reports,id.at,and was specific and reliable.id.at.levko relied on venture bids on autoliv projects that were submitted before,whether accepted or not.for projects that venture did not actually bid on,levko created hypothetical bids using data from submitted bids and five bids.
autoliv points out that the erroneous grand blanc financials were the result of a lack of proper accounting controls.at.it argues that because there were errors in the grand blanc facility financial statements for,t he only reasonable inference to be drawn is that venture accounting controls were not appropriate during that earlier time period either.reply br.of autoliv at.autoliv contends that this inference undercuts the reliability of the bid data levko used.the district court concluded,however,that levko opinion on damages was grounded on bids that antedated december,and that t here is no evidence to suggest that the accounting irregularities at the grand blanc facility affected venture financial statements.rule b opinion,slip op.at.we see no clear error in these factual conclusions.
autoliv also contends that a new trial should have been granted because levko relied,in some of his testimony,on the fact that the grand blanc facility financial statements were audited and therefore presumptively reliable.levko testified at trial that the fact that grand blanc had independently certified financial statements tells me that what being reported is fair and that the internal controls are appropriate and adequate rule b opinion,slip op.at.at the rule b hearing,the district court questioned levko about whether having the information in the doeren mayhew reports concerning the grand blanc financial statements would have altered his trial testimony.levko responded i could say that the certified statements were accurate,but it would change my conclusions.at.
autoliv contends that even if levko conclusions would have remained the same,these alterations to levko testimony might have colored the trial.while the district court rule b opinion did not expressly address this possibility,the district court specifically recognized it during the rule b hearing,and we are convinced that the district court considered the question and rejected autoliv contention utilizing the rule b standard for prejudice.we see no error in that conclusion.
although autoliv agrees that the grand blanc accounting system was separate from the bid system,autoliv argues that financial information directly called into question by doeren mayhew was utilized by levko in two respects to determine the ratio of fixed to variable costs and to test the accuracy of the scrap rate reflected in the bids.
as to the first,autoliv contends that levko separation of the fixed and variable costs was affected because doeren mayhew found that inventory was overstated and recommended a downward inventory adjustment.levko explained that a downward inventory adjustment would increase the cost of sales to the grand blanc facility,potentially altering the ratio of fixed and variable production costs.levko stated in an affidavit that doeren mayhew findings did not affect his allocation of fixed and variable costs in the bid data because the inventory adjustment would not materially affect the ratio.the district court explained that of the million inventory adjustment,consisted of bag inventory which had no effect on the cost of sales related to air bag covers.of the million dollar balance,approximately could be attributed to the cost of sales of air bag cover products.rule b opinion,slip op.at.the district court concluded that,while levko determined the cost ratio from grand blanc financial statements,any change in the financial statements as a consequence of the doeren mayhew reports did not affect the allocation.id.at.we see no error in this conclusion.
as to the scrap rate,levko used a scrap rate of percent in his calculations.he derived that scrap rate from the bid information.levko checked the scrap rate against the scrap rate reported in grand blanc financial statements.that figure was percent.he nevertheless used the percent rate from the bids in order to make his calculations conservative.autoliv relies on the affidavit of kevin dages,an accounting consultant,to argue that the inventory adjustments recommended by the doeren mayhew reports would have resulted in increased scrap rates for and.levko testified,however,that even assuming the inventory adjustment,the scrap rate only partially attributable to airbag cover production would increase to percent,still well below the percent rate levko used.the district court explained in detail that it rejected dages analysis on the basis of several methodological flaws,including dages calculation of increases in p roduction costs based on financial data which does not particularize air bag production costs.rule b opinion,slip op.at.the district court found that even after making the inventory adjustment called for by the doeren mayhew reports,the scrap rate would be,still below the rate levko used,id.at,and thus concluded that the doeren mayhew reports effect on the scrap rate would not have altered the jury decision.we find no clear error in this determination.the district court also did not err in failing to consider the totality of the allegedly prejudicial evidence.
clear error only exists if we are left with a definite and firm conviction that a mistake has been committed.united states monumental life ins,cir quoting alexander local,laborers int l union of,cir.here,we are left with no such conviction.we conclude that the district court did not abuse its discretion in denying autoliv motion for a new trial pursuant to rule b.
we now address autoliv rule b motion.rule b provides on motion and upon such terms as are just,the court may relieve a party from a final judgment,order,or proceeding for the following reasons fraud whether heretofore denominated intrinsic or extrinsic,misrepresentation,or other misconduct of an adverse party 
autoliv argues that venture engaged in discovery misconduct by withholding venture financial data that ultimately disclosed venture fraud.autoliv rule b motion at.autoliv contends that venture should have disclosed the information in response to autoliv requests and through the deposition testimony of representatives of venture and pertinent venture subsidiaries.in particular,autoliv contends that it was denied the opportunity to depose the controller at the grand blanc facility who,according to doeren mayhew,manipulated the accounting system to cause the misrepresentations in the financial statements.
failure to produce material in response to legitimate discovery requests can constitute misconduct under rule b.abrahamsen express,cir however,the question is not whether venture failed to comply with autoliv initial discovery requests it is whether venture complied with autoliv requests as limited by the special master and the district court.there is no contention that venture failed to comply with the discovery ordered by the district court.as the district court stated,autoliv had ample opportunity to ask the court to require further of venture if it felt that its discovery requests were not being met.rule b opinion,slip op.at.autoliv did not request further action from the district court in this regard.we conclude that the district court did not abuse its discretion in holding that venture did not engage in discovery misconduct within the meaning of rule b 
we now turn to autoliv contention that reliance on the financial statements by venture damages expert warrants relief under rule b.as a threshold matter,venture insists that autoliv failed to raise this ground before the
