in this false claims act fca appeal,relator mary cafasso challenges orders of the district court dismissing her qui tam complaint,rejecting her proposed amended pleading,granting summary judgment on remaining claims,and awarding attorneys fees we have jurisdiction pursuant to,and we affirm.
cafasso alleges that her former employer general dynamics systems,a technology company that services the military,defrauded the government by withholding disclosure of new inventions which,had agreed by contract,the government had rights to use and license.cafasso discovered the alleged fraud,according to her complaint,and made repeated inquiries and requests for internal audits.she claims that as a result of her activities in that regard,retaliated against her by eliminating her department and position.denies those allegations.
after learning that her job would be terminated but before leaving,cafasso copied almost eleven gigabytes of data from company computers in anticipation of bringing a qui tam action.within days of her departure,realized that she had taken thousands of its internal documents.filed suit in state court seeking to recover documents that it believed cafasso took in violation of a confidentiality agreement that she executed when her employment began.the state court issued a temporary restraining order tro that required cafasso to return the electronic files that she removed from.
two days later,cafasso filed this qui tam action in federal district court with a conclusory complaint.the complaint alleged fca violations and retaliation.the district judge,at cafasso request,issued orders sealing the case and permitting cafasso to inform the state court of the pendency of the qui tam action.with the orders and sealed complaint,cafasso presented the state court with an ex parte request to lift the tro,which the state court granted.the state court also stayed the state action in its entirety,although the arizona court of appeals later reversed both orders.when the district court learned that cafasso had used its orders to disrupt the state court suit,it vacated the orders that it had issued.was then served with the complaint and filed an answer and counterclaim.that counterclaim alleged,among other things,that cafasso appropriation of electronic files breached her confidentiality agreement with the company.
continuing prosecution of the qui tam action,cafasso lodged more specific allegations against in an amended complaint.in response to objections about privileged information contained in that amended pleading,cafasso filed a substitute amended complaint that struck the objectionable language.around the same time,the united states announced that it would decline to intervene in the fca action.cafasso continued to litigate the matter in her own name.
the parties then began an acrimonious period of discovery.the district court november,order recites numerous discovery abuses by cafasso.specifically,cafasso refused to identify which documents,of the thousands she had appropriated,actually supported her claim or were privileged.further,cafasso sought discovery into inventions that were not mentioned in her complaint,which the court prohibited.asked by interrogatory that cafasso i dentify each specific provision of a of the false claims act fca that you allege in paragraph of the substitute amended complaint that defendant knowingly violated in response,cafasso stated that she has not made a claim as described in this interrogatory,nor does the law require that she claim such to have been the case.because cafasso answer to this interrogatory appeared to abandon her qui tam allegations,promptly filed a motion for judgment on the pleadings pursuant to federal rule of civil procedure c.thereafter,cafasso sought to file a second amended complaint,which the district court rejected for failing to state a short and plain statement of the claim,as required by federal rule of civil procedure a.the district court granted motion for judgment on the pleadings.it then denied cafasso subsequent motion to amend her pleading.
both parties moved for summary judgment on the remaining claims cafasso retaliation claim against,and counterclaims against cafasso.prevailed on both motions,and the district court entered judgment and a permanent injunction against cafasso.then moved for an award of attorneys fees,which the district court granted in part.
this appeal followed.
we first address the district court dismissal of cafasso qui tam claim pursuant to federal rule of civil procedure c.our review is de novo.fleming pickard,cir.when considering a rule c dismissal,we must accept the facts as pled by the nonmovant,here,cafasso.see also jenkins mckeithen,for the purposes of a motion to dismiss,the material allegations of the complaint are taken as admitted.we caution that the facts set forth below have not been determined judicially,but are rather what we think to be a fair summary of the complaint allegations.
cafasso worked as the chief at,a technology company that services the military,and was so employed at the that was acquired by general dynamics in.as a participant in the advanced telecommunications information distribution research program atirp,had contracted with the army to assign to the united states certain rights to subject inventions developed in performance of military contracts.specifically,atirp gives the government license to practice or have practiced for or on behalf of the united states the subject invention throughout the world,and the right to require to license the invention to anyone upon terms that are reasonable under the circumstances.in other words,atirp grants the government the right to use or have used on its behalf subject inventions,as well as the right to require to license the inventions to another party such as a competing contractor on reasonable terms.
atirp also requires timely disclosure of applicable new inventions to the government.once it discloses a new invention,may opt to retain title to the invention,subject to the government right to use or have used on its behalf,and to require licensing of,the invention.if chooses not to retain title to the invention,the government may assume title.cafasso worked in the office that identified,documented,and protected intellectual property.her responsibilities included ensuring that complied with atirp requirements by,among other things,disclosing new inventions to the army.
in early,cafasso became aware of what she believed was a scheme to deprive the united states of its atirp rights to a new invention.had applied for a patent for an invention known as,but the united states patent and trademark office had preliminarily rejected that application subject to a response from.rather than responding to the patent telling the government so that it could protect its rights in the invention by preparing its own instead opted to abandon the patent application and,according to cafasso,delayed before notifying the government in order to deprive it of the opportunity to prepare a response.
cafasso alleges that by refusing to prosecute its patent application,had claim ed ownership of the new technology as its own trade secret,and had denied the united states an opportunity to protect its interest in the invention.further,because had not disclosed its newly invented technology to the government,competing contractors would not know to ask the government for permission to use the technology when bidding on later contracts.according to cafasso,the government might therefore pay or another contractor to invent technologies like that either already had been invented or with respect to which the government already had the right to authorize its contractors to use free of charge.in other words,cafasso alleges that the united states could potentially pay twice for the same technologies.
cafasso reported her discovery about to her supervisor and others in her office,but no corrective action was taken.cafasso asked for an audit or internal review.no audit occurred.thereafter eliminated the office in which cafasso worked and terminated her employment,as well as that of her supervisor maintains that this occurred as part of a routine corporate reorganization.cafasso disputes this account,alleging that her termination was retaliatory.
after cafasso was told that her position had been eliminated but before leaving,she was tasked with performing due diligence in closing out the atirp contract.in performing this function,she contends,she discovered a number of other instances where new inventions had either not been properly disclosed to the united states,or where had abandoned prosecution of its patent applications to the detriment of the government rights to the invention.cafasso claims that continues to deprive the united states of its rights to new inventions.she alleges that t he scheme is implemented in two ways.for some inventions,the disclosure to the government is made,but it is sketchy and insufficient.in other cases,apparently has stopped submitting notification to the government altogether.
in reviewing the dismissal of a complaint,we inquire whether the complaint factual allegations,together with all reasonable inferences,state a plausible claim for relief.ashcroft iqbal,the heightened pleading standard of rule b governs fca claims.california,cir.rule b provides that i n alleging fraud or mistake,a party must state with particularity the circumstances constituting fraud or mistake.b.to satisfy rule b,a pleading must identify the who,what,when,where,and how of the misconduct charged,as well as what is false or misleading about the purportedly fraudulent statement,and why it is false.ebeid ex rel.united states lungwitz,cir internal quotation marks and citations omitted.
until now,we have not had occasion explicitly to confirm that iqbal plausibility requirement applies to claims subject to rule b.we have,however,said that complaints alleging fraud must comply with both federal rules of civil procedure a and b.wagh metris direct,cir,overruled on other grounds by odom microsoft,cir en banc.because rule a requires the pleading of a plausible claim,iqbal.at,we hold that claims of fraud or fca,in addition to pleading with particularity,also plead plausible allegations that is,the pleading must state enough fact s to raise a reasonable expectation that discovery will reveal evidence of the misconduct alleged.bell atlantic twombly,
we next consider whether the qui tam claim stated in cafasso complaint is sufficiently particularized and plausible to avert dismissal.it seems to be a fairly obvious notion that a false claims act suit ought to require a false claim.united states ex rel.aflatooni kitsap physicians,cir.t he fca attaches liability,not to the underlying fraudulent activity or to the government wrongful payment,but to the claim for payment.united states rivera,cir.as we have said,a n actual false claim is the sine qua non of a n fca violation.aflatooni,at quoting united states ex rel.clausen lab.of,cir 
false claims contemplated by the fca take many forms.of seven types of actionable conduct listed in the fca,only three require that the misconduct involve an actual demand for payment.a.in the remaining categories,the false claim lies in the fraudulent use of a receipt,a,unauthorized purchase of government property,a,or use of a false record or statement to avoid payment to the government,a.we recently held that a request for reimbursement that falsely implied compliance with federal rules could constitute a false claim.ebeid,at.but to commit conduct actionable under the fca,one must,in some way,falsely assert entitlement to obtain or retain government money or property 
section a of the reverse false claims not say otherwise.it makes actionable the knowing use of a false record or statement to conceal,avoid,or decrease an obligation to transmit money or property to the government.a.this provision attempts to provide that fraudulently reducing the amount owed to the government constitutes a false claim.john boese,civil false claims qui tam actions,k at ed.in united states pemco aeroplex,for example,the defendant,under an obligation to account for government property in its possession,purposely misidentified airplane parts worth more than two million dollars as scrap metal worth only,cir en banc.in reliance upon the misrepresentation,the united states allowed the defendant to purchase the parts for that deflated sum.id.the false claim in pemco was the inventory document fraudulently accounting for the value of government property.the reverse false claims provision does not eliminate or supplant the fca false claim requirement it rather expands the meaning of a false claim to include statements to avoid paying a debt or returning property to the united states.
cafasso complaint alleges no false claim.while her pleading alleges that of new inventions deprived the united states of services by entities,it does not allege that falsely asserted an entitlement to obtain or retain government money or property.it does not allege that made a demand for payment,fraudulently used a receipt,participated in an unauthorized purchase of government property,or used a false record or statement.
we consider whether,in the absence of pleading false claims,the complaint warrants an inference that false claims were part of the scheme alleged.ebeid,at.in assessing the plausibility of an inference,we draw on our judicial experience and common sense,iqbal.at,and consider obvious alternative explanation s,id.at quoting twombly,at.according to her complaint,cafasso had worked in the office tasked with ensuring atirp compliance since the acquisition in.even after she began to suspect fraud,she was responsible for reviewing documents to conclude participation in the contract.despite access to records,as detailed in her complaint,she does not identify a single false or fraudulent claim for payment,a,false record or statement,a,document certifying receipt of property,a,or any other qualifying false claim.assuming the truth of cafasso factual averments,an obvious alternative explanation of conduct is that it withheld disclosure of new inventions so it could continue to use them as trade secrets,which might be a breach of contract but not a fraudulent claim in light of cafasso failure to identify any particular false claims or their attendant circumstances,as well as the obvious alternative explanation that no false claims occurred,we will not draw the unwarranted and implausible inference that discovery will reveal evidence of such false claims.
cafasso tries to save her complaint by arguing that may have charged the government directly for use of intellectual property that the government already had the right to use free of charge.but cafasso pleading contains none of the circumstances attendant to this alleged fraudulent conduct.b.as the district court correctly observed,the pleading does not allege when charged the government for technology,which contracts the charges related to,whether the reuse of technology actually inflated the charge,or if the government even paid the charges.indeed,the pleading does not point to a single invention for the use of which charged the united states.
this type of allegation,which identifies a general sort of fraudulent conduct but specifies no particular circumstances of any discrete fraudulent statement,is precisely what rule b aims to preclude.see,at rule b serves not only to give notice to defendants of the specific fraudulent conduct against which they must defend,but also to deter the filing of complaints as a pretext for the discovery of unknown wrongs,to protect defendants from the harm that comes from being subject to fraud charges,and to prohibit plaintiffs from unilaterally imposing upon the court,the parties and society enormous social and economic costs absent some factual basis.internal quotation and alterations omitted.
none of the remaining qui tam allegations levied in cafasso complaint are cognizable under the fca.cafasso allegations that did not comply with atirp disclosure requirements,and that received payment from the united states pursuant to atirp,in essence fault for allegedly breaching its contractual obligations.but breach of contract claims are not the same as fraudulent conduct claims,and the normal run of contractual disputes are not cognizable under the fca.united states ex rel.wilson kellogg brown root,cir.to be sure,cafasso complaint alleges unsavory conduct.but unsavory conduct is not,without more,actionable under the fca.see aflatooni,at it is not enough to describe a fraudulent scheme in detail but then to allege simply and without any stated reason that claims requesting illegal payments must have been submitted.quoting clausen,at hopper,at it is not the case that any breach of contract,or violation of regulations or law,or receipt of money from the government where one is not entitled to receive the money,automatically gives rise to a claim under the fca.quoting the district court given cafasso failure to plead a false claim,we affirm the district court dismissal of cafasso complaint.
we next consider the district court denial of cafasso motion for leave to amend her complaint.our review is for abuse of discretion.united states ex rel.lee smithkline beecham,cir.
brought its rule c motion after nearly two years of discovery.given that late stage of litigation,the district court suggested that cafasso,rather than opposing the motion,instead seek to amend her pleading to cure the deficiencies identified in the motion.acting on this suggestion,cafasso moved to amend and tendered a proposed amended complaint.the district court denied cafasso motion for failure to comply with rule a,among other deficiencies.
normally,when a viable case may be pled,a district court should freely grant leave to amend.lipton pathogenesis,cir.however,liberality in granting leave to amend is subject to several limitations.ascon,mobil oil,cir citing dcd programs,leighton,cir.those limitations include undue prejudice to the opposing party,bad faith by the movant,futility,and undue delay.id.further,t he district court discretion to deny leave to amend is particularly broad where plaintiff has previously amended the complaint.id.citing leighton,at mir.fosburg,cir.
the district court was well within its discretion to deny leave to amend for several reasons.first,amendment would have been futile considering the proposed pleading extraordinary prolixity.rule a requires that a complaint contain a short and plain statement of the claim showing that the pleader is entitled to relief.a.although normally verbosity or length is not by itself a basis for dismissing a complaint,hearns san bernardino police dep t,cir,we have never we know of no authority supporting the a pleading may be of unlimited length and opacity.our cases instruct otherwise.see,mchenry renne,cir upholding a rule a dismissal of a complaint that was argumentative,prolix,replete with redundancy,and largely irrelevant hatch reliance ins,cir upholding a rule a dismissal of a complaint that exceeded pages in length,and was confusing and conclusory nevijel north coast life ins,cir holding that rule a is violated when a complaint is excessively verbose,confusing and almost entirely conclusory schmidt herrmann,cir upholding a rule a dismissal of confusing,distracting,ambiguous,and unintelligible pleadings.while the proper length and level of clarity for a pleading can not be defined with any great precision,rule a has been held to be violated by a pleading that was needlessly long,or a complaint that was highly repetitious,or confused,or consisted of incomprehensible rambling.charles wright arthur miller,federal practice procedure ed.our district courts are busy enough without having to penetrate a tome approaching the magnitude of war and peace to discern a plaintiff claims and allegations.
second,a pleading prejudices the opposing party and may show bad faith of the movant,both valid grounds to deny leave to amend.see ascon,at.rather than straightforwardly stating her claims and allegations,cafasso would burden her adversary with the onerous task of combing through a pleading just to prepare an answer that admits or denies such allegations,and to determine what claims and allegations must be defended or otherwise litigated.see mchenry,at t he very prolixity of the complaint ma kes it difficult to determine just what circumstances were supposed to have given rise to the various causes of action.mendez draham,d,only through superhuman patience,effort,and insight,could any attorney review the allegations of the complaint and make responses.as we have said,
prolix,confusing complaints impose unfair burdens on litigants and judges defendants are put at risk that plaintiffs will surprise them with something new at trial which they reasonably did not understand to be in the case at all,and that res judicata effects of settlement or judgment will be different from what they reasonably expected the judge wastes half a day in chambers preparing the short and plain statement which rule obligated plaintiffs to submit.he then must manage the litigation without knowing what claims are made against whom.this leads to discovery disputes and lengthy trials,prejudicing litigants in other case who follow the rules,as well as defendants in the case in which the prolix pleading is filed.
mchenry,at.further,cafasso proposed amendment sought to circumvent the district court discovery order limiting her qui tam claim to allegations relating to the inventions identified in her complaint.
citing our prior holding in hearns,at,cafasso argues that rule a dismissals for excessive length are disfavored.at issue in hearns was an complaint that,while excessive in detail,was written with sufficient clarity and organization such that the defendants would have no difficulty in responding to the claims.id.at.this case,however,is distinguishable.cafasso proposed complaint was more than nine times longer than the one before us in hearns.under these extraordinary circumstances,a district court has ample discretion to deny amendment.we affirm the district court denial of cafasso motion to amend.
the district court granted summary judgment in favor of on cafasso claim that her employment was terminated in retaliation for her investigation of fraud at the company.united states ex rel.cafasso dynamics,wl,at.may.we review a grant of summary judgment de novo.universal health,thompson,cir.
the fca protects employees from being discharged,demoted,or in any other manner discriminated against in the terms and conditions of employment because of lawful acts done by the employee in furtherance of an fca action,including investigation for,initiation of,testimony for,or assistance in an fca action h.an fca retaliation claim requires proof of three elements the employee must have been engaging in conduct protected under the act the employer must have known that the employee was engaging in such conduct and the employer must have discriminated against the employee because of her protected conduct.hopper,at.
cafasso complaint alleges that dismantled the office in which she worked,causing her termination,in retaliation for her inquiries regarding the fraud that she suspected,on the other hand,maintains that it eliminated cafasso department and position as part of a corporate reorganization unrelated to cafasso conduct,and that the official who decided to eliminate cafasso department and position did not know about her inquiries.
cafasso protected conduct giving rise to her claim for retaliation is,according to her complaint,a series of inquiries and requests for an audit or internal review occurring in and allegedly discriminatory acts,according to the complaint,took place in early the decision to eliminate cafasso department was announced in early january,and cafasso was informed that her employment would be terminated the following month but cafasso has adduced no evidence that these acts were causally related to her inquiries and requests.christopher marzilli,the official who eliminated cafasso department and position,testified that he did not know of her inquiries and requests at the time of his allegedly retaliatory decision.and cafasso admitted in deposition that she had no reason to disbelieve marzilli account.
cafasso defends her retaliation claim by speculating that other officials who did know of her protected conduct may have poisoned marzilli ag
