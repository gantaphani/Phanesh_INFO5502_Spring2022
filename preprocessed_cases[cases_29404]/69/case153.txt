police officers currently or formerly employed by the marlborough police department plaintiffs filed suit on april,against the city of marlborough,massachusetts,and its police department collectively referred to as the city,alleging that the city had operated an unlawful comp time compensatory time,or paid time off system that violated section o of the fair labor standards act flsa,et.this system had been agreed to in the collective bargaining agreement cba between the police union and the department and the relevant terms had been in effect since.
before trial,the city conceded that the comp time plan was in violation of the flsa and admitted liability.it also argued that any remedy should take into account the fact that almost all of the comp time had been given to the officers in the form of paid time off rather than cash payment.the plaintiffs theory was that compensatory damages should equal the dollar value of the total amount of flsa overtime accrued in the relevant liability period,regardless of whether any such overtime was paid out in the form of comp time.the district court rejected the plaintiffs theory,holding that,for remedial purposes,the plaintiffs compensatory damages under the flsa were limited to the dollar value of banked or unused comp time then existing approximately as of november.the court left for trial the issue of whether the plaintiffs were entitled to liquidated damages under the flsa.
the parties then stipulated that liquidated damages would be of the amount of compensatory damages.the parties further stipulated that if the legal principle underlying the court compensatory damages ruling were not upheld on appeal,the issue of liquidated damages may be.the district court entered judgment incorporating the parties stipulations on january,and the plaintiffs timely appealed.we affirm.
the comp time system at issue in this case was established by the cba between the city of marlborough and the union representing the marlborough police officers,the international brotherhood of police officers,local.the cba provides that 
police officers may accept compensatory time off in lieu of monetary compensation for overtime service.compensatory time shall be earned at the rate of hours compensatory time for every overtime hour worked.compensatory time off may not be taken without prior written approval of the chief or his designee sic such approval shall not be arbitrarily or capriciously denied.
the granting and use of compensatory time off shall conform to the following guidelines 
it may be granted and used only in one,two or three hour increments 
under any circumstances,its granting or use shall not cause overtime 
it shall not be granted prior to the day of use 
if granted,it may be revoked,based on staffing levels 
once granted,it shall,for the purpose of granting or allowing the use of personal or vacation days by other officers,be considered the same as a personal or vacation day.
the relevant portion of the cba remained unchanged for the and contracts.
despite the cba,many officers wanted more flexibility in how the comp time policy was administered.they took the issue to arbitration,but lost in august of.
they then tried a different tack.on april,some current and former patrol officers of the marlborough police department filed a complaint in federal court against the city for violating the flsa.specifically,the officers alleged that they had accrued comp time in lieu of cash overtime compensation,that the city had denied the plaintiffs the opportunity to use the accrued comp time even though such use would not create an undue disruption,and that as such,the comp time agreement was in violation of the requirements of o.the basic dispute was over whether this comp time scheme qualified under the exception in the flsa which permitted public agency employers to give time off rather than cash payment for overtime work.the plaintiffs sought declaratory judgment,compensatory and liquidated damages as provided in b,and attorney fees and costs.
after reviewing the matter,on october,the city filed a motion for entry of judgment in which it admitted liability under the flsa in the same motion,the city sought a protective order from the plaintiffs discovery requests,arguing that discovery in light of the city admission of liability would be moot.the court accepted the city admission of liability,stayed discovery,and set a deadline for briefing on the issue of the remedy owing the plaintiffs.
the plaintiffs advanced a theory for computing the city compensatory damages under the flsa that essentially disregarded the value of any comp time which was accrued by an officer for overtime but which was not actually used until after the workweek in which such comp time was earned.section o of the flsa allows public agencies to use comp time as a substitute for cash overtime compensation pursuant to a collective bargaining agreement if certain conditions are met.see o.
because the city has conceded that the comp time system established by the cba does not qualify under the conditions set by section o of the flsa,the city use of comp time in lieu of cash payment for overtime work violated the flsa and made the city liable for the unpaid overtime compensation.b.the statute requires that any employer who violates the provisions of section of this title shall be liable to the employee or employees affected in the amount of their unpaid minimum wages,or their unpaid overtime compensation,as the case may be,and in an additional equal amount as liquidated damages.id.
the plaintiffs argued that the computation of the amount of unpaid overtime compensation depended on answers to only two questions outlined in the federal regulations whether the overtime wages were due based on a calculation of flsa hours worked,and whether the overtime wages were paid by the first pay date after the workweek in which the overtime liability was incurred.see the flsa takes a single workweek as its standard and does not permit averaging of hours over or more weeks.the general rule is that overtime compensation earned in a particular workweek must be paid on the regular pay day for the period in which such workweek ends.applying these two factors to this case,the plaintiffs argued that back wages should be calculated using a cash only system and allowing no offset for compensatory time taken outside the individual workweek in which the overtime compensation is due.the plaintiffs also contended that they were entitled to liquidated damages,see b,and that the damages should be computed under the statute of limitations applicable to willful violations of the flsa.see a.
the city vociferously objected to the plaintiffs theory of damages.it argued that t he statutory and regulatory scheme obviously contemplates that the accrual of comp time at a rate of hours for each hour of overtime worked,and then the subsequent use of the comp time for paid time off,is the equivalent of being paid the overtime in the first place.the city argued that although the comp time scheme in this case was unlawful,the officers,when they took paid time off,were paid according to the principle in the statutory scheme.as a result,the proper measure of compensatory damages under section b is the amount of unused comp time which remained banked by the plaintiffs amounting to approximately.the city noted that following the plaintiffs theory of damages would give the plaintiffs a gigantic windfall.
the district court issued its memorandum and order on february.the district court rejected the plaintiffs theory of damages,characterizing the plaintiffs argument as entailing the result that individuals should receive payment at overtime rates for every overtime hour worked in the relevant liability period in addition to the comp time they have already received.such a result,the court held,derives support neither from the statute nor from sound public policy.citing this court decision in roman maietta,cir,the district court determined that paid comp time could be deducted from an award of back pay under the flsa,and that the plaintiffs compensatory damages should be limited to the value of the unpaid
