in response to a judgment entered pursuant to,defendant kathleen alexander,former city solicitor of pittsfield,massachusetts,appeals from the district court punitive damages award against her.first,alexander argues that the court specific factual determinations underlying the award of punitive damages are clearly erroneous and that the evidence in its totality does not meet the legal standard for such an award.second,alexander argues that punitive damages are unavailable against her in any event because neither powell complaint nor the course of subsequent proceedings adequately put her on notice that she was being sued in her individual capacity and was therefore subject to personal liability for punitive damages.
after considering the general principles authorizing punitive damages in a case,we reject alexander argument that the district court award was incompatible with those principles.we next consider a circuit split on the appropriate test for determining adequate notice of the capacity in which a governmental official is sued,and join the majority of circuits in adopting the course of proceedings test.applying that test,we reject alexander lack of notice claim and affirm the district court award of punitive damages against her.
in,walter powell,an police officer,filed several state and federal actions against the city of pittsfield,the acting chief of police,and the former mayor,among others,for impermissible race discrimination leading to his termination from the police force.in september,city solicitor kathleen alexander entered into a settlement agreement on the city behalf.the city agreed to pay powell and to reinstate him as a police officer conditioned upon his fulfillment of certain requirements,including and undergoing a complete physical examination.in return,powell agreed to dismiss the actions,which had generated negative publicity for the city and fomented discord among members of the police department.
instead of closing the book on a contentious period in city affairs,the signing of the settlement agreement marked the beginning of a new and even longer dispute.indeed,nearly three years would pass before powell returned to active duty as a pittsfield police officer.as a result of that protracted struggle for the reinstatement contemplated by the settlement agreement,powell filed the instant suit in federal district court in september against city solicitor alexander,the mayor,the chief of police,the city physician,and the city of pittsfield for impeding and conspiring to impede his reinstatement to the city police force in retaliation for his exercise of his constitutional right to petition the courts for redress powell alleged that,far from cooperating with his efforts at reinstatement,the defendants had engaged in a concerted campaign to prevent or stall his return to the police by exploiting the possibility that his health was impaired by hepatitis c infection,and then by selectively and belatedly enforcing a local ordinance barring police officers from holding outside employment because he had filed the civil rights actions.
after a bench trial,the district court awarded judgment for powell on all counts in an written decision containing separately detailed findings of fact the district court found that,f ollowing the settlement,the defendants began a campaign of obstruction,choreographed by the city solicitor,designed to pressure or manipulate powell into abandoning his plan to return to the police force.powell city of pittsfield,d.moreover,the court stated that while alexander may have seen herself as a vigorous advocate representing the interests of the pittsfield police department,her actions were especially unworthy of a city solicitor.id.at.the court awarded punitive damages in the amount of against alexander,who now challenges that award on appeal.

a.the district court factual findings supporting punitive damages 
three letters and two notes 
alexander challenges as clearly erroneous the factual determinations underpinning the district court conclusion that her course of conduct in delaying powell reinstatement was,taken as a whole,both outrageous and reprehensible,powell,d at.she also challenges any finding that her conduct was motivated by wrongful intent or involved reckless or callous indifference,smith wade,d,to plaintiff federal rights.crucial to the court characterization of alexander course of behavior were three letters and two notes to which the district court adverted in its explanation of its assessment of punitive damages.we briefly describe here the relevant pieces of correspondence,the notes,and their context.
bird december,letter 
because he had been off the police force for three years following his termination and during settlement negotiations,powell was required as a condition of reinstatement to undergo a routine physical examination and to attend the police academy as though he were a new recruit.in october,a physical examination by the city physician,bird,indicated that while powell was outwardly physically fit and healthy,he had slightly abnormal liver function.later tests revealed that powell had hepatitis c,which may cause no physical symptoms and has a low risk of transmissibility through casual contact,but which can lead to serious liver disease.
on december,bird wrote a letter to the city personnel department and sent a copy to powell in which he gave his opinion on powell physical fitness for reinstatement.the letter stated 
after review of all of powell currently available laboratory work,his consultation with a specialist,and the physical standards for public safety positions used by the city,i feel that powell has a condition which would disqualify him for appointment to a public safety position.listed as a disqualifying condition is active hepatitis.as it is my feeling,and that of the consultant,that powell has chronic active hepatitis,i feel he would currently be disqualified.
the standards for appointment to a public safety position to which bird referred were state guidelines used to determine candidates eligibility for admission to police officer training programs,namely,the police academy.bird apparently assumed that the police academy admission guidelines also governed qualification for employment to the police force bird letter concluded if the city concurs in this disqualification,i understand that powell has the right of appeal to a medical review board.other options would be at the discretion of the appointing authority.
alexander received a copy of bird letter from personnel department staff.instead of either concurring in or overriding bird determination that powell could not return to work,she requested that powell undergo a liver biopsy before a final reinstatement decision could be made.
alexander may,letter 
although powell initially disputed that he had hepatitis c,he did have a liver biopsy in march at a veterans affairs medical center in new york.in may his attorney forwarded a letter from powell physician to alexander,which stated that despite some laboratory evidence of mild liver function test abnormality,powell was looking healthy and fit for his job as a police officer and was totally asymptomatic for acute or chronic liver disease.
on may,alexander responded by letter to powell attorney that the city needed more information so that bird could review the biopsy results independently.alexander wrote 
i f the city p hysician is satisfied that powell may safely return to work and perform his duties based upon the additional biopsy data,the mayor will then,assuming all other conditions are met,make a determination,with the chief of police,in regard to reinstatement.
powell promptly signed a release allowing the biopsy results to be transferred from the veterans affairs medical center to bird for analysis.
bird july,letter 
on july,bird wrote a letter to alexander,which the court found to constitute,perhaps,the most significant piece of evidence in this case.powell,d at.the letter began i stated in a letter that i felt powell would be disqualified due to the presence of chronic active hepatitis.bird then gave a detailed description of the liver biopsy results sent to him by powell doctor.bird next related that he had consulted medical experts at the university of massachusetts and the centers for disease control,seeking any information on guidelines for this condition,and discovered that no existing guidelines barred a person infected with hepatitis c from working as a police officer.bird stated the consensus was,given powell current state of health,that there would be currently no reason to limit his physical activity.bird letter concluded now that the exact nature and stage of powell chronic liver disease is known,i feel that he does not have a condition which would disqualify him from returning to the police force.bird copy of the letter,which he kept in his business files,was accompanied by a sticky note that read,confidential per request of alexander.powell remained unaware of the letter existence until it surfaced during discovery in the instant lawsuit.at trial,alexander denied that she had ever instructed bird to suppress the letter.
alexander handwritten notes 
as part of her routine business practice,alexander kept handwritten,contemporaneous notes of her telephone conversations with various individuals involved in powell reinstatement,including the mayor,bird,and powell attorneys.on april,alexander consulted a colleague versed in civil service law.her notes of that phone conversation contain references to the ada,referring to the americans with disabilities act of,stat.ada the possibility of a major ada problem and the availability of punitive dmgs,meaning punitive damages a later note dated may,two days before alexander wrote her letter of may,to powell attorney,refers to the ada requirement of reasonable accommodations to qualified individuals with disabilities the district court treated these notes as evidence of alexander awareness that her conduct in delaying powell reinstatement would violate federal law 
factual findings on alexander particularly egregious misconduct 
in light of this chronology of events and after assessing the credibility of the witnesses who testified at trial,the court determined that alexander persisted in particularly egregious misconduct,powell,d at,and that she engaged in a course of behavior that the court deem ed to be outrageous and worthy of condemnation.id.at citation omitted.the court then listed several examples of alexander egregious acts and omissions,to name just a few,each of which alexander alleges was a clearly erroneous factual determination.we also examine whether the findings,if supportable,amount to outrageous conduct in their cumulative effect.
alexander failure to forward bird original report of december,to the medical review board 
the district court found that alexander failed to send bird first letter,which refers to a medical review board,to that board,in violation of her legal duties.id.the medical review board,a body of the massachusetts criminal justice training council,was authorized to grant exceptions allowing candidates with medical conditions to enroll in the police academy alexander argues that she had no such legal duties because the city personnel department handled all such matters.
the court stated that pittsfield personnel department was unstaffed,and alexander was fulfilling its responsibilities with regard to powell.id.at.alexander counters that the department was staffed and operating at the time powell sought reinstatement.the record shows that the personnel department was staffed but that it had no director at the relevant times.personnel staff apparently gave alexander a copy of bird letter because she was overseeing powell reinstatement under the settlement agreement.
this single misstatement by the district court that the personnel department was unstaffed is immaterial to the court conclusion that alexander should have referred powell case to the medical review board.alexander undertook to coordinate powell reinstatement under the terms of the settlement,as evidenced by the voluminous correspondence documenting her central role in communicating various conditions of reinstatement to powell attorneys.the court was entitled to infer that alexander had indeed taken control of the reinstatement process instead of leaving powell reinstatement for the city personnel staff to handle according to routine procedures.
although bird forwarded to alexander a copy of the police academy admission guidelines,including information about the medical review board,she stated at trial that she did not familiarize herself with them.alexander asserts that,in contrast to bird,she never viewed powell eligibility for admission to the police academy as determinative of his eligibility for reinstatement to the police force.rather,active hepatitis might or might not be a bar to employment as a police officer,depending on the circumstances.thus,alexander maintains,any action by the medical review board permitting powell admission to the academy still would not have assuaged the city independent concerns about his qualification for reinstatement only the liver biopsy could have provided the information required to assess powell ability to return to the police force 
regardless of the city ultimate decision under its own medical standards,the court found that alexander failure to submit the necessary documentation to the medical review board deprived powell of the opportunity to obtain an exception for admission to the police academy,which in view of his robust health and lack of symptoms he would very probably have received.id.at.alexander inaction left powell in limbo.id.instead of being allowed to satisfy one of the prerequisites for his return to the police force even as his biopsy and the city final determination on reinstatement were pending,powell continued in his ambiguous status,neither qualified nor disqualified for reinstatement,until.id.the court committed no clear error in determining that alexander should have ensured that powell case reached the medical review board.
alexander deliberate suppression of bird july,letter and pressure on bird to suppress its contents 
the court found that alexander deliberately hid bird second letter of july,which cleared powell to go back to work,and pressured bird to the point where he declined to communicate candidly with a patient of his who was suffering from a serious disease.id.at.based on testimony by the mayor,bird,and one of powell former attorneys the court found that the letter existence was known only to bird and to alexander until its compelled disclosure during discovery.the court also credited bird testimony at trial that alexander had told him to keep the letter confidential and to avoid communicating directly with powell.although alexander denied ever asking bird to keep the letter confidential,the court found that she had testified without credibility and had conceded that she never told anyone else about the letter.id.at.
alexander stresses that she did not forward bird july,letter to the mayor or to anyone else because she did not consider the letter to be a report reflecting the city p hysician satisf action that powell may safely return to work and perform his duties as required by her may,letter to powell attorney.she argues that bird second letter did not,in fact,clear powell to go back to work.rather,alexander interprets bird second letter as merely reflecting his own realization that powell disqualification for admission to the police academy did not automatically bar him from eventual employment as a police officer after all,a conclusion alexander had reached long before in refusing to declare powell qualified or disqualified for reinstatement regardless of his eligibility for police academy admission until he had a liver biopsy.
the court found alexander interpretation of bird july,letter untenable and her testimony that she did not view the letter as significant because in her mind,it was a report lacking in credibility.id.instead,after analyzing the text of both of bird letters and the trial testimony about the circumstances in which those letters were written,the court permissibly concluded that bird july,letter was indeed a report,that it provided all the information alexander purported to require in her may,letter,and that it should have cleared the way for powell reinstatement as early as july.
the district court had more than sufficient evidence before it from which to infer not only that alexander idiosyncratic interpretation of bird letter was objectively unreasonable,but also that she obviously repressed the letter as part of the effort to forestall powell reinstatement and to avoid performing on her promise to permit reinstatement if the city p hysician is satisfied.id.this finding was not clearly erroneous.
alexander efforts to mask her interference and the alleged agreement to hold off on bird report 
the district court found that alexander methodically kept a stream of letters going to powell and his counsel in an effort to mask her interference with his reinstatement,and went so far as to manufacture a nonexistent agreement that bird hold off on his report on powell health.id.at.alexander maintains that powell attorney told her in a phone conversation on july,shortly after her receipt of bird july,letter,that powell was now seeking disability retirement instead of reinstatement and that bird could therefore hold off on writing a report based on the biopsy results regarding powell fitness for reinstatement.alexander asserts that bird was free at any time to send a copy of his july,letter which she did not consider to be a report to powell,and that bird misunderstood her direction to hold off on writing a true report while powell pursued disability retirement as a direction to keep the letter under wraps.at trial,powell former attorney denied that he agreed to delay bird report and testified that it was alexander who suggested that powell apply for disability retirement.the court did not credit alexander testimony to the contrary.
in july,unaware that bird had just written to alexander to state that he felt that powell does not have a condition which would disqualify him from returning to the police force,powell sought bird signature on his application for disability retirement,based on bird original december,opinion that powell was disqualified from employment on the police force.on july,bird wrote to powell,declining to sign the form and stating that powell treating physician should sign the form instead.in november,after powell approached him a second time to sign his disability form,bird wrote to powell that a fter discussion of your request with the city solicitor,i have been advised that it would be ethically inappropriate as the city physician for me to give you directly any statement of disability or complete the application because you are not under my professional care,nor have i been treating you.bird testified that he would also have told powell that he did not consider him to be disabled if he had not been told to keep the information secret.powell application for disability retirement eventually stalled because he had not accrued the necessary number of service years on the police force.
during this same period,from september to january,alexander wrote monthly letters to powell attorneys seeking information on the status of his application for disability retirement and to discern what,if anything,the city could do to help with closure of this matter.each of these letters fails to mention bird change of opinion regarding powell fitness to work.the court specifically rejected the credibility of alexander trial testimony on that it never occurred to her that powell might have abandoned his disability retirement application if he had been aware of bird conclusions about his ability to return to the police force as stated in the july,letter.
the court also found that alexander september,letter to powell attorney,the first in a stream of letters regarding powell disability retirement application status,contained 
what can only be characterized as the outrageously misleading statement that at the time of settlement,no one anticipated that powell would have a health problem which would impede the reinstatement.this statement was made at a time when alexander was perfectly aware of the unanimous medical opinion,including the considered view of the city own physician,that no health problem impeded powell reinstatement.
id.at first alteration in original.in later correspondence with powell attorneys throughout the next year,alexander continued to treat his medical condition as an unresolved issue.
given this evidence,the court committed no clear error in concluding that 
alexander failure to disclose to powell attorney in her conversations with him that,as of july,she had in her possession unambiguous documentation of the city physician opinion that powell was fit to return to work constitutes egregious misconduct and reflects the defendants level of determination to retaliate against powell for his earlier lawsuit by blocking his reinstatement by whatever means.
omission of the letter from submissions to the court and efforts to involve bird in those omissions 
the district court found that alexander intentionally omitted any reference to bird july,letter from the affidavits and numerous exhibits she submitted to the court in in response to powell motion to vacate the settlement agreement.worse,the court found,alexander forced a kind of fraud upon bird when she left any reference to the letter out of his affidavit,which she drafted.id.at.as a result,the letter existence remained unknown to anyone except alexander and bird until it materialized more than one year later during discovery in powell lawsuit.the court thus found that alexander deliberate suppression of the letter distorted the record submitted to the court in an effort to avoid disclosure of the defendants bad faith.id.at.
alexander argues that she submitted the affidavits merely to document the city timely responses to powell reinstatement requests and to show that any delay in powell reinstatement was not attributable to the city lack of diligence but was the result of powell own equivocation about whether to pursue disability retirement instead.bird july,letter was,in her view,irrelevant to that showing.yet bird affidavit describes his review of powell health status,including the biopsy results,in such detail that the absence of any reference to the july,letter in which he reported his conclusions based on that same review is striking.
alexander reiterates that she simply did not view the july,letter or its contents as material to bird affidavit because it did not relate to the legitimate reasons for the delay in powell reinstatement,namely,powell own failure to satisfy the city conditions by refusing to have a liver biopsy and by deciding to petition for disability retirement and expand his business instead.the court refused to credit this argument in light of alexander professional experience as a litigation attorney engaged in a dispute about powell employment qualifications.instead,the court found that 
a ny fair presentation of the documents pertinent to the dispute about reinstatement and the settlement agreement generally must necessarily have included the july letter,which would have confirmed the absence for nearly two years of any impediment to powell reinstatement.
id.the court did not err in determining that the effort required to exclude a single letter from a list of notes and other proof of the communications between alexander and bird in his affidavit constituted circumstantial evidence of deliberate omission.
the court also credited bird testimony that he himself viewed the omission from the affidavit as unusual,although he made no effort to correct it.alexander argues that she should not be charged with controlling bird submission to the court in the form of his affidavit merely because he misunderstood her directive to hold off on a report as meaning that he should keep his july,letter confidential.she maintains that bird could easily have overridden her judgment that the letter had no bearing on powell fulfillment of the settlement agreement reinstatement conditions and that he could have made the appropriate additions to his own affidavit we find no clear error in the court conclusion,based on bird testimony and other evidence,that bird deferred to alexander legal expertise,as he expected her to defer to his medical opinions.
as for alexander own affidavit,accompanied by exhibits,in which she documented her efforts to cooperate with powell attorneys in his reinstatement effort,the court again was not clearly erroneous in finding that her decision to exclude the july,letter of bird from the court filing was deliberate,as was her decision in not to pass the letter on to powell attorney in the first place.
in short,after a careful review of the evidence of alexander overall course of behavior,we find nothing clearly erroneous in the findings of the district court that,cumulatively,alexander engaged in particularly egregious misconduct,id.at,that was outrageous and worthy of condemnation.id.at internal quotation marks omitted.
availability of punitive damages under 
general principles 
alexander argues that the evidence before the trial court,and the court factual findings thereon,failed to meet the legal standard for an award of punitive damages while punitive damages are available in a proper action,smith wade,d citation omitted such damages are not favored in the law and are allowed only with caution and within normal limits,mckinnon kwong wah,cir whether a particular case arising under is a proper case for an award of punitive damages is a question of law subject to de novo review.see pueblo int l,cir.
punitive damages may be awarded under only where the defendant conduct is shown to be motivated by evil motive or intent,or when it involves reckless or callous indifference to the federally protected rights of others.smith,at.the supreme court has stated that the requisite intent at a minimum is recklessness in its subjective form.kolstad am.dental ass n,d thus,the inquiry should focus on the acting party state of mind,romano int l,cir,and the central question is whether the defendant acted in the face of a perceived risk that her actions would violate federal law,kolstad,at.see also cabanillas,cir.
we have interpreted kolstad as distinguishing between a defendant intent to do an act and her intent to effect a civil rights violation as a consequence of that act.iacobucci boulter,cir citation omitted.the kolstad court described several situations in the employment discrimination context in which punitive damages may be inappropriate even though a defendant has engaged in intentional acts of discrimination 
in some instances,an employer may simply be unaware of the relevant federal prohibition.there will be cases,moreover,in which the employer discriminates with the distinct belief that its discrimination is lawful.the underlying theory of discrimination may be novel or otherwise poorly recognized,or an employer may reasonably believe that its discrimination satisfies a bona fide occupational qualification defense or other statutory exception to liability.
id.at.where the underlying liability for deprivation of a federally protected right under rests on a finding of intentional conduct,then,the state of mind requirement for the availability of punitive damages limits those damages to that subset of cases,id.at,in which a plaintiff also adduces evidence that permits an inference that the defendant was aware of the risk that those intentional acts would violate federal law.
powell constitutionally protected right to petition the courts for redress of grievances 
as the district court recognized,o ur constitutional system gives every citizen the right to seek redress in the courts without fear that recourse to the law will make that citizen a target for retaliation.powell,d at.the first amendment to the constitution provides,in relevant part congress shall make no law abridging the freedom of speech,or of the press or the right of the people peaceably to assemble,and to petition the government for a redress of grievances.for decades,the supreme court has consistently recognized the right to petition all branches of the government,including the courts,cal.motor transp.trucking,d,for redress of grievances as among the most precious of the liberties safeguarded by the bill of rights.united mine workers,dist.state bar ass n,d the supreme court has also identified the purpose behind the bill of rights,and of the first amendment in particular to protect unpopular individuals from their ideas from the hand of an intolerant society.mcintyre ohio elections comm n,d.
claims of retaliation for the exercise of first amendment rights are cognizable under.see,healthy city sch.dist.bd.of educ.doyle,d school board refusal to renew untenured teacher contract in retaliation for exercise of right to free speech actionable.retaliation,though it is not expressly referred to in the constitution,is nonetheless actionable because retaliatory actions may tend to chill individuals exercise of constitutional rights.aclu of,wicomico county,cir.retaliation for the exercise of the right to petition the courts for redress may take many forms,ranging from potential negative treatment for the mere threat to file suit in the future,see,poole county of otero,cir recognizing retaliatory prosecution claim where police instituted criminal charges after receiving indication of plaintiff intent to file civil suit,to actual economic injury following the filing or pursuit of grievances,see,collins nuzzo,cir treating claim that license application was denied because of applicant exercise of right to appeal prior denial of license renewal as an ordinary claim of unconstitutional retaliation for protected speech in violation of the first amendment fishman clancy,cir attempts to terminate public school teacher who had filed more grievances than any other teacher had ever filed and who had engaged in other first amendment activities cognizable under.
in order to prevail on a claim of retaliation for first amendment activity under the legal standard enunciated in healthy,a plaintiff must first show that his conduct was constitutionally protected,and that this conduct was a substantial factor or a motivating factor for the defendant retaliatory decision.at.the defendant may then avoid a finding of liability by showing that it would have reached the same decision even in the absence of the protected conduct.id 
in this case,the district court concluded 
there is no question that powell engaged in constitutionally protected conduct by filing the lawsuit against pittsfield,its officials,and police officers.defendants have not alleged that powell litigation was baseless and therefore not within the shelter of the first amendment,see bill johnson restaurants,d,or otherwise unprotected.connick myers,d right to protest racial discrimination is a matter inherently of public concern.given the substantial settlement obtained by the plaintiff in,any argument that the lawsuit was baseless would be frivolous.
powell,d at.the court found that powell lawsuit alleging racial discrimination created hostility in the police department,id.at,which alexander represented as city solicitor,and that she was aware that his return to the police force would cause friction.id.the district court then concluded that,more likely than not,alexander and the mayor retaliated against powell for his constitutionally protected conduct because they knew that if he was reinstated and thereafter filed another lawsuit,they would have to deal with it.id.at 
the district court punitive damages analysis 
in its richly detailed and carefully crafted opinion,the court devoted slightly less than two pages at the end of the opinion to its punitive damages analysis.this observation is not a criticism.rather,we make that observation to make the important point that the relatively brief punitive damages analysis at the end of the opinion unmistakably draws upon the compendious factfinding and legal analysis on the claim for compensatory damages that precedes it.
based on alexander handwritten notes documenting her phone conversation with a colleague about the ada,the district court concluded in part that punitive damages were authorized in this case because alexander notes reflect that she was aware that her actions violated federal law,and thus she acted in the face of a perceived risk that her actions would lead to that result.id.at quoting kolstad,at.alteration in original however,the federal law to which alexander notes refer the ada was not in fact the same federal law that the court found alexander to have violated the first amendment right to seek redress in the courts as protected by.indeed,powell brought no claim under the ada against any of the defendants,and only the city of pittsfield was subject to his claim under the related rehabilitation act id.at.
in order to recover punitive damages,a plaintiff ordinarily must establish liability for either compensatory or nominal damages.am.airlines,cir plaintiff must make a timely request for nominal damages.given the absence of a claim by powell that alexander violated his rights under the ada,her subjective awareness of the risk that she might violate powell rights under the ada with her retaliatory conduct is irrelevant to the propriety of an award of punitive damages for a violation of a first amendment right.see iacobucci,at evidence tending to show that defendant was aware of the risk of violating plaintiff right to be free from excessive force during arrest had no bearing on defendant subjective intent towards plaintiff right to be free from arrest without probable cause,the right defendant actually violated under.the court determination that alexander perceived the risk that her actions would violate powell federally protected rights under the ada,therefore,does not support an award of punitive damages for alexander violation of powell first amendment right to petition the courts for redress.instead,the court had to find,explicitly or implicitly,that alexander retaliatory actions manifested at least reckless or callous indifference to powell first amendment right.smith,at.for the reasons we now set forth,we are satisfied that the court implicitly made such a finding,and that this finding is legally and factually supportable.
in its punitive damages analysis,the district court also justified its award of punitive damages because alexander actions in this case were both outrageous and reprehensible.powell,d at.the court then provided a list of examples of her acts and omissions,discussed in detail above in part,underlying that determination.in short,the district court concluded,alexander engaged in a course of behavior that this court deems to be outrageous and worthy of condemnation.id.internal quotation marks omitted.
while the supreme court decision in kolstad clarified that the presence or absence of egregious or outrageous acts does not in itself determine the propriety or lack of propriety of punitive damages in a given case,iacobucci,at citation omitted,such damages remain available where a defendant egregious intentional conduct itself demonstrates her perception of a risk that her actions would violate federal law.kolstad,at.to be sure,egregious or outrageous acts may serve as evidence supporting an inference of the requisite evil motive.id.at.indeed,c onduct warranting punitive awards has been characterized as egregious because of the defendant mental state.id.
we have described the plaintiff obligation to demonstrate a defendant state of mind regarding the consequences of her intentional acts as a heightened burden.zimmerman direct fed.credit union,cir distinguishing state law standard for punitive damages from that imposed by.this description merely reflects the dual purposes that a plaintiff evidence must serve in a case where punitive damages are sought it does not preclude evidence of egregious misconduct from serving,in appropriate circumstances,both as evidence of the alleged violation of a federal right and as evidence of the defendant awareness of the risk that her actions would violate that federal right.
indeed,in cases involving retaliation,a defendant actions and the effect of those actions are closely connected in a way not necessarily present in other types of cases.che.bay transp,cir remanding for jury trial on punitive damages where employer engaged in intentional discriminatory retaliation.the legal standard for a finding of liability for retaliation the underlying liability claim in a case such as this already entails an inquiry into a defendant motive as well as into the legally protected nature of the plaintiff conduct.see healthy,at.plaintiff must show that his conduct was constitutionally protected,and that this conduct was a substantial factor or a motivating factor for the defendant retaliatory decision to shift burden to defendant.where a defendant engages in particularly outrageous acts of retaliation and where the right whose exercise triggers those retaliatory acts is a constitutional right,a factfinder could,but need not,fairly infer that the defendant harbored malice or reckless indifference towards that federal right.che,at.
although the specific intent to violate a plaintiff federally protected right will support a punitive damages award,reckless indifference towards a plaintiff federally protected right also suffices to authorize liability for punitive damages under see,at finding no abuse of discretion in award of punitive damages where t he extent of federal statutory and constitutional law preventing discrimination on the basis of ethnicity or race suggests that defendants had to know that such discrimination was illegal,and that defendants discriminatory conduct exhibited reckless and callous indifference to plaintiff federal rights,if not evil intent.citation omitted rubinstein adm rs of tulane educ.fund,cir evidence that defendant agent retaliated against plaintiff because he hauled colleagues into court to try to resolve differences indicates a healthy disdain for plaintiff rights to seek redress in the courts for perceived wrongs and was adequate to meet the standard of reckless indifference at least,if not outright animus,towards those rights.
as noted,the court found that alexander retaliatory actions were especially unworthy of a city solicitor.powell,d at.in our judgment,this focus by the court on conduct unworthy of an attorney reflects the district court implicit finding that alexander,as a former general litigator,as city solicitor however overburdened and inexperienced in municipal law and as the attorney who negotiated the settlement agreement,recognized and acted with reckless or callous indifference towards powell constitutional right to petition the courts for redress.smith,at.in other words,as an attorney,alexander surely understood that powell filing of his lawsuit was an exercise of his first amendment right to petition the government for redress,and that in retaliating against him for the filing of that lawsuit she risked violating his right under the constitution.her conduct was particularly unworthy of a city solicitor because of her callous indifference to powell exercise of that right.indeed,alexander never argued at trial or on appeal that powell filing of his lawsuit was not protected by the first amendment or that she was unaware that retaliation against powell could violate his first amendment right to seek redress in the courts.moreover,there is substantial evidence in this record of alexander consciousness of wrongdoing,mckinnon,at,in the form of her elaborate efforts to prevent bird critical july,letter which the court found cleared powell to go back to work,powell d at,from coming to light.
we conclude,therefore,that the district court detailed factual analysis of alexander conduct,including the examples it specifically identified as outrageous and reprehensible and especially unworthy of a city solicitor,powell,d at,supports its implied finding that alexander acted in the face of a perceived risk that her actions would violate federal law powell first amendment right under,kolstad,at,and thus with sufficient evil motive or reckless or callous indifference to the federally protected rights of others,smith,at,to meet the legal standard for punitive damages under.
we turn to alexander argument,raised for the first time on appeal,that she is not subject to punitive damages because she did not have proper notice that she was being sued in her individual capacity both powell complaint and amended complaint were silent on the capacity in which he sought to sue alexander,whom the complaints identified as a natural person who at all times pertinent to this complaint was the city solicitor for the defendant city of pittsfield.
per se approach or course of proceedings 
alexander invites us to adopt a,or per se,approach to resolving a complaint ambiguity or silence on the issue of capacity,such as that employed by the eighth circuit.under this approach,a defendant governmental official is presumed to be sued solely in his or her official capacity unless the complaint specifically states otherwise.see,johnson outboard marine,cir o nly an express statement that governmental officials are being sued in their individual capacity will suffice to give proper notice to the defendants egerdahl hibbing cmty,cir p laintiff complaint must contain a clear statement of her wish to sue defendants in their personal capacities.in nix norman,cir,the eighth circuit emphasized the importance of giving governmental officials clear notice of the capacity in which they are being sued at the outset of the complaint itself.early and explicit notice permits governmental official defendants who are subject to personal liability for monetary damages to assess matters crucial to their litigation strategy,including the propriety of raising particular defenses available only to governmental officials sued in a particular capacity.for example,while an defendant may raise the defense of sovereign immunity,a defendant may assert objectively reasonable reliance on existing law,a defense not available to defendants.see kentucky graham,d setting forth defenses to liability under to illustrate the basic distinction between personal and actions.defendants with early notice of potential personal liability may also assess the availability of insurance coverage and whether there are potential conflicts of interest that might require separate representation of defendants.charron picano.
notwithstanding the concerns reflected in the eighth circuit analysis,the other circuits have,with virtual unanimity,adopted the course of proceedings test as the better approach the supreme court has also acknowledged that 
in many cases,the complaint will not clearly specify whether officials are sued personally,in their official capacity,or both.the course of proceedings in such cases typically will indicate the nature of the liability sought to be imposed.
graham,at.quoting brandon holt,d.we now join the multitude of circuits employing the course of proceedings test,which appropriately balances a defendant need for fair notice of potential personal liability against a plaintiff need for the flexibility to develop his or her case as the unfolding events of litigation warrant.in doing so,we decline to adopt a formalistic test requiring a plaintiff to use specific words in his or her complaint in order to pursue a particular defendant in a particular capacity.however,we do not encourage the filing of complaints which do not clearly specify that a defendant is sued in an individual capacity.to the contrary,it is a far better practice for the allegations in the complaint to be specific.a plaintiff who leaves the issue murky in the complaint runs considerable risks under the doctrine we adopt today.
under the course of proceedings test,courts are not limited by the presence or absence of language identifying capacity to suit on the face of the complaint alone.rather,courts may examine the substance of the pleadings and the course of proceedings in order to determine whether the suit is for individual or official liability.pride does,cir.factors relevant to this analysis include the nature of the plaintiff claims,requests for compensatory or punitive damages,and the nature of any defenses raised in response to the complaint,particularly claims of qualified immunity.moore city of harriman,cir see also biggs meadows,cir.a court may also take into consideration whether the parties are still in the early stages of litigation,moore,at,including whether amendment of the complaint may be appropriate.no single factor is dispositive in an assessment of the course of proceedings.throughout,the underlying inquiry remains whether the plaintiff intention to hold a defendant personally liable can be ascertained fairly.biggs,at.
b.the course of proceedings here 
in this case,the course of proceedings gave alexander fair notice that she was being sued in her individual capacity.first,powell complaint and amended complaint contained a prayer for punitive damages.the prayer for punitive damages could only be brought against defendant governmental officials who were sued in their individual capacities.claims for punitive damages are not available against a municipality,such as the city of pittsfield,under.city of newport fact concerts,d.because bringing suit against a governmental official in his or her official capacity is tantamount to bringing suit against the official office,will.dep t of state police,d,it follows that punitive damages are not available against governmental officials sued in their official capacities.see biggs,at.recognizing these legal principles,alexander filed a joint answer on behalf of all the defendants named in powell complaint,raising,among other affirmative defenses,a qualified immunity defense.t he assertion of that defense indicates that the defendant interpreted the plaintiff action as being against her personally.biggs,at.
alexander argues that both powell claim for punitive damages and her assertion of a qualified immunity defense were merely perfunctory pleadings and should not be taken as notice of the capacity in which she was sued.yet the assertion of qualified immunity provides some indication that alexander is not prejudiced by our treating the complaint as one brought against her in her personal capacit y.id.according less weight to raising of qualified immunity defense where defendants also raised sovereign immunity.
alexander also argues that subsequent indications of the capacity in which she was sued came too late in the litigation to provide her with adequate notice.for example,the magistrate judge conclusion that alexander was being sued in her individual capacity emerged only in a report and recommendation regarding summary judgment,more than three years after the litigation inception.see powell city of pittsfield,d,adopting magistrate judge report and recommendation discussing availability of suit against defendants in their individual capacity under various statutes.however,the relevant time frame of the course of proceedings varies for each individual case and may include events occurring after the initial pleadings.see,moore,at subsequent filings in a case,including responses to motions to dismiss for failure to state a claim or to motions for summary judgment,may rectify deficiencies in the initial pleadings.houston reich,cir pleadings,order,and jury instructions ma d e it clear that defendants were being sued in both official and individual capacities.here,alexander reiterated her early assertion of qualified immunity as an affirmative defense in her individual motion for summary judgment.
alexander makes much of the fact that powell complaint identified her as a natural person who at all times pertinent was the city solicitor for the defendant city of pittsfield,that is,as a municipal governmental official.she asserts that this lang
