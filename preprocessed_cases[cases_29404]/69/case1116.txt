petitioner appellants richard gray,gray investment partners,and cumberland hill capital fund,collectively gray appeal the district court order dismissing their petition to adjudicate property interests in forfeited property.we have jurisdiction pursuant to,and we reverse and remand.
stefan wilson operated a fraudulent investment fund.his ponzi scheme took almost million from over investors.gray was among the investors.
by january,the government had been investigating wilson for some time.unaware of the investigation,gray executed a standard subscription agreement in wilson fund on january.gray wired a total of million to wilson account at washington mutual bank on february.
on february and february,wilson transferred the entirety of gray funds to an ameritrade brokerage account,which wilson had been using to carry out his fraud.prior to the transfer of gray funds,the account balance was allegedly.
on february,an fbi agent met with nell johnson,another victim of the ponzi scheme.following the interview,johnson demanded that wilson return her investment.wilson transferred from the ameritrade account to an account held by johnson.
on february,wilson was arrested,and the balance of the ameritrade account was seized.the government also seized the that wilson had transferred to johnson.wilson was indicted on march,and entered into a plea agreement with the government.
gray argues that he can trace all of the that ended up in johnson account to his investment.gray further argues that all but of the funds seized from the ameritrade account are traceable to gray investment.
the remainder of gray investment was diffused via lulling payments,trading losses,and margin calls during the two weeks that wilson held the investment.
pursuant to the plea agreement,the district court entered its preliminary order of forfeiture on april,forfeiting to the government the balance in the ameritrade account and the in johnson account.gray filed his petition on june.
gray petition,filed under n,alleged that gray had an interest in of the forfeited funds,and that his interest was superior to that of wilson and that of the government.
the government filed a motion to dismiss the petition,and,after the issue was fully briefed and a hearing was held,the district court granted the motion to dismiss.
in its published order,the district court began by reviewing the applicable standards in forfeiture proceedings.the district court stated that p ersons who have been convicted of specified crimes must forfeit to the government property derived from or obtained as a result of the crime or used to commit or facilitate the crime.united states wilson,d.the district court noted that under c,the government interest in the property vests at the moment the crime occurs.id.the district court explained that certain narrow classes of owners of the property have interests in the property superior to the government.such asserted interests are adjudicated at a hearing,which the statute describes,as well as when a interest is superior to that of the government.id.citation omitted.
the district court started its analysis by examining whether a constructive trust arose upon gray transfer of funds to wilson.the district court and the parties assumed that california law applied to this question.
the district court explained that in united states boylan,cir,we held unequivocally that under california law a constructive trust arises by operation of law as soon as the fraudster obtains the victim property.wilson,d at.
the district court noted,though,that in davies krasna,cal d,the california supreme court adopted the view that constructive trusts had to be created by a court.wilson,d at.
the district court aired its misgivings about boylan fidelity to california law,but recognized that it had to follow the precedent of this court.the district court found that gray,pursuant to boylan,obtained a constructive trust in the property that was the subject of the defendant fraud by operation of law at the moment the fraud occurred.id.
after reviewing gray claim against the property under n,the district court found that w hile it seems clear that under boylan the gray petitioners do have an interest superior to the defendant it also appears that interest is not superior to the government.id.at.
next,the district court examined the case of united states hooper,cir,where the wives of two drug dealers tried to lay claim against forfeited drug proceeds under the theory that,pursuant to california law,they had an automatic community property interest in these proceeds.the district court noted that,in hooper,we held that the government has interest in the property,except where a third party was a bona fide purchaser of the property or the interest antedated the crime.wilson,d at.
the district court stated that although gray had an interest in the funds prior to the crime,that interest ceased when the funds were transferred to wilson.id.at.the district court noted that a new interest was formed at the time of the transfer,but that gray new interest arose simultaneously to the creation of government interest.id.the district court held that gray interest was inferior to the government interest.
finally,the district court concluded that the petitioners lack prudential standing.the district court noted that the government briefing on that point was a recitation of the magistrate judge findings and recommendations in a related case,united states real property located at glen mady way,d,civil in rem forfeiture proceeding against defendant wilson house.wilson,d at.
the district court briefly summarized a few key points that the magistrate judge made in glen mady way congress has created a statutory structure for victims to receive restitution and that the interests of crime victims in receiving restitution are not in the zone of interests implicated in the statute governing the forfeiture hearing.wilson,d at.
the district court concluded by stating the following for the same reasons that the court adopted the magistrate judge findings in united states real property located at glen mady way,the petitioners appear to lack prudential standing in this action.id.
in a case involving n,we review the district court findings of fact for clear error and its legal conclusions de novo.united states nava,cir.the facts alleged in gray petition are assumed to be true.see.c a in the ancillary proceeding,the court may,on motion,dismiss the petition for lack of standing,for failure to state a claim,or for any other lawful reason.for purposes of the motion,the facts set forth in the petition are assumed to be true.
the district court erred in holding that gray lacks prudential standing.the supreme court has stated that b eyond the constitutional requirements,the federal judiciary has also adhered to a set of prudential principles that bear on the question of standing.valley forge christian coll.ams.united for separation of church state,d.congress legislates against the background of our prudential standing doctrine,which applies unless it is expressly negated.bennett spear,d.
in this case,the district court raised the issue of prudential standing under the zone of interests test.in order for a litigant to have prudential standing under the zone of interests test,the litigant claim must fall within the zone of interests protected by the law invoked.elk grove unified sch.dist.newdow,d.
however,there are situations where the zone of interests test does not apply to a statute,because congress has negated that test.see bennett,at.when congress broadly opens the remedy to any person,without qualification,the zone of interests test does not apply.id.
here,the forfeiture statute provides 
any person,other than the defendant,asserting a legal interest in property which has been ordered forfeited to the united states pursuant to this section may,within thirty days of the final publication of notice or his receipt of notice under paragraph,whichever is earlier,petition the court for a hearing to adjudicate the validity of his alleged interest in the property.the hearing shall be held before the court alone,without a jury.
