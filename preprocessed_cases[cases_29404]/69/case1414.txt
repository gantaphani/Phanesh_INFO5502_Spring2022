introduction 
appellees brought a class action lawsuit against appellants,officials of the state of utah hereinafter utah,alleging federal constitutional and statutory violations in the operation of utah child welfare system.after the district court extended the deadline for answering the complaint,the parties were involved in settlement negotiations for a full year.the parties eventually entered into a settlement agreement the agreement which imposed numerous obligations on utah,including,inter alia,obligations to investigate reports of child abuse or neglect within specific deadlines provide placement support services for foster parents and ensure that foster children attend school and receive medical and dental treatment.the agreement was incorporated into a final order signed by the district court on august,the consent decree,and its provisions became binding on the parties.
by its terms,the agreement was to terminate four years after it was approved by the district court.at the end of the period,however,utah was not in compliance with the terms of the agreement.appellees filed a motion pursuant to rule b of the federal rules of civil procedure seeking relief from the termination provision.the district court granted the relief requested and utah appealed.exercising jurisdiction pursuant to a,we affirm.
ii.factual background 
as a means to cure the constitutional and statutory violations alleged by appellees,utah agreed to implement substantive provisions contained in the agreement.in addition to delineating the obligations assumed by utah,the agreement contained procedures designed to ensure compliance with those obligations.one provision established a panel the monitoring panel and charged this panel with the task of evaluating utah compliance.the monitoring panel was empowered to make findings of compliance or with each provision of the agreement.if the monitoring panel made a finding of,it was directed to develop a corrective action plan which utah was obligated to implement within a specified period of time.under the agreement,a party could challenge the findings of the monitoring panel.the district court would then enter its own finding of compliance or after reviewing the evidence de novo.
the agreement also contained a provision entitled enforcement of the agreement the enforcement provision.this provision stated,in part,
the court shall retain jurisdiction over these claims solely for the purpose of enforcement of the agreement.if is not resolved through the corrective action process,as described above,the court may enter any necessary orders to enforce the agreement.
another provision,entitled termination of the agreement provided,the agreement shall terminate in months from the date it is given final approval by the court.
two years after the agreement was approved by the district court,appellees,alleging utah was either unable or unwilling to fulfill the obligations it undertook pursuant to the terms of the agreement,filed a motion to enforce settlement agreement and appoint receiver.in support of their motion,appellees relied on three monitoring panel reports,each of which found utah in with a majority of the provisions in the agreement.additionally,appellees argued that utah had not been remedied through the corrective action process and alleged that utah was engaged in a attempt to try and outlast the term of the agreement.
on march,the district court entered an order granting appellees motion in part and denying it in part.after independently reviewing the reports submitted by the monitoring panel and related information,the court found utah in with the agreement and,thus,in with the consent decree.after concluding that the corrective action process set forth in the agreement had failed,the court ordered the parties to bypass the corrective action process and further ordered the monitoring panel to prepare a new plan for correcting any the comprehensive plan.utah was ordered to implement the comprehensive plan.the court,however,denied appellees request to appoint a receiver to oversee the division of child and family services.
on may,appellees filed a motion to extend the term of the settlement agreement.appellees conceded in their motion that the agreement was set to expire by its own terms on august.appellees argued,however,that the enforcement provision gave the court the authority to enter all necessary enforcement orders,including the authority to enter an order extending the term of the agreement to ensure compliance with its terms.in the alternative,appellees argued that the district court possessed the inherent equitable power to modify the agreement by extending the term of the agreement and the court jurisdiction over it.although the district court concluded that it possessed the equitable power to modify the agreement,it also concluded that without some additional proposal for reforming the system so that it will work,the plaintiff class would not benefit from an extension of the term of the agreement.the court thus declined to exercise its equitable power and denied appellees motion.the court stated,however,if the parties are able to negotiate a new settlement agreement that incorporates the lessons acquired in the last four years,this court will certainly give a hard look at such a proposal.
on august,two weeks before the agreement was set to expire,the comprehensive plan was filed with the court.appellees immediately filed a motion to enforce the comprehensive plan.in their brief to the court in support of their motion,appellees characterized the comprehensive plan as a specific proposal that would replace procedural mechanisms of the agreement that had proved ineffective.appellees requested that the district court retain jurisdiction until utah had fully implemented the comprehensive plan.the district court took appellees motion under advisement and ordered utah to refine the comprehensive plan.utah was ordered to submit the completed comprehensive plan to the court for purposes of supplementing the record.
the revised comprehensive plan was filed in may.the district court,after reviewing the revised comprehensive plan,granted appellees motion,extended the term of the agreement,and retained jurisdiction over the implementation of the comprehensive plan.utah then brought this appeal.
iii.discussion 
standard of review 
the parties first disagree on whether the district court inherent equitable power to modify the agreement encompassed the power to alter the termination provision this question involves the scope of the district court authority and thus is a question of law which this court reviews de novo.see firefighters local union stotts,d hull united states,cir the scope of the district court authority to specify the form of an award of damages is a question of law.assuming the court possessed such power,the parties also disagree on whether the court properly exercised that power in this case.this question is reviewed under the abuse of discretion standard.see eeoc safeway stores,cir.the district court factual findings are reviewed for clear error.see manning united states,cir.
b.the scope of the district court equitable modification power 
utah concedes that courts possess the equitable power to modify consent decrees when changed circumstances support modification.utah argues,however,that the court modification power is circumscribed and can not be exercised to substantially alter an unambiguous provision that is material to the parties agreement.utah contends that the termination provision is not properly subject to equitable modification because it is both unambiguous and a material provision that lies at the very heart of the parties deal settling this lawsuit without going to trial.
utah position that courts have no equitable power to modify material provisions is foreclosed by rufo inmates of the suffolk county jail,d.in rufo,the district court refused to order modification of a consent decree,in part,because the provision was an important element perhaps even the most important element of the decree.see inmates of the suffolk county jail kearney.the supreme court,however,specifically addressed
