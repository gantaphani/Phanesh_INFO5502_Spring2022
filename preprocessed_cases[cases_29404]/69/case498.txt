donald cromer appeals the district court denial of his rule b motion,as well as an order imposing upon him a prefiling injunction and finding him in criminal and civil contempt.we affirm the rule b ruling,but vacate the prefiling injunction and contempt findings,and remand for further proceedings consistent with this opinion.
after cromer filed an employment discrimination action against his,kraft foods,the parties agreed to proceed before a united states magistrate judge and further agreed that the matter was appropriate for mediation.on october,following mediation at which each side was represented by counsel,the parties entered into a settlement agreement.
two days later,cromer filed a motion to dismiss that agreement in a december,order,the magistrate judge denied cromer motion and ordered the parties to comply with the settlement agreement.cromer appealed this order.
while his appeal was pending,cromer filed a motion for relief from judgment entered.on february,the magistrate judge denied this motion,calling it largely incomprehensible,and ordered cromer to cease filing motions or other documents in this case in this court.the judge also warned cromer that further filing of motions or documents in this case,after being directed to cease filing may subject you to financial or other sanctions.in spite of this warning,cromer filed a rule b motion contesting the magistrate december,and february,orders.on may,the magistrate judge denied the rule b motion and again cautioned cromer that the filing of frivolous motions in this court may result in the imposition of monetary other sanctions.cromer promptly noted an appeal of that order.on august,after consolidating this appeal with his earlier appeal,we affirmed in both cases.cromer kraft foods,table,wl cir per curiam unpublished.
on february,the magistrate judge denied a set of motions that cromer had filed over a year before.the magistrate judge explained that he had overlooked these motions,and for this reason,failed to rule on them,but that they were no more meritorious than previous ones in this matter.the magistrate judge denied cromer motion to reconsider this ruling cromer appealed,and on october,we affirmed.cromer kraft foods,wl cir per curiam unpublished.
on march,cromer filed a motion for relief from judgment entered pursuant to rule b and.on april,the magistrate judge denied this motion,warning cromer that the filing of any further frivolous motions will result in the imposition of sanctions.four days later,on april,cromer filed a motion for reconsideration of the april order,as well as motions for change of venue,disqualification of the magistrate judge,and clarification of the april order.
on may,the magistrate judge denied these motions and ordered cromer to appear on june,to show cause why he should not be held in contempt.the judge warned cromer that he should be prepared to pay a civil sanction or criminal fine up to,and,that if found guilty of criminal contempt,he could be incarcerated for up to days.
cromer appeared as directed before the magistrate judge.cromer protested his good faith and emphasized his status as a pro se litigant.he told the magistrate judge that,at some point after having been warned by the judge not to file additional motions,he asked a clerk of this court if he could file an additional motion in the district court and was informed that,unless enjoined from doing so,he could.although the magistrate judge apparently gave some credence to this account,the judge nonetheless found cromer in contempt for his knowing and continued disobedience.
the magistrate judge then imposed criminal sanctions in the form of incarceration for the remainder of the day of the hearing which amounted to approximately minutes imprisonment,a fine of,and a special assessment of a civil sanction in the form of for defendant attorneys fees and a prefiling injunction enjoining cromer from making any and all filings in this case and any filing in any other,unrelated case in the united states district court for the western district of north carolina unless he first obtain ed permission to so file from the magistrate judge.
cromer timely appealed this order,as well as the orders denying his rule b motion we consolidated these cases for consideration on appeal.
we first address the magistrate judge denial of cromer rule b motion.rule b provides in relevant part on motion and upon such terms as are just,the court may relieve a party from a final judgment,order,or proceeding for the following reasons the judgment is void or any other reason justifying relief from the operation of the judgment.b.cromer sought relief under both subsections b and b.
a judgment is not void under rule b merely because it is erroneous.it is void only if the court that rendered it lacked jurisdiction of the subject matter,or of the parties,or if it acted in a manner inconsistent with due process of law.schwartz united states,cir internal quotation marks and citation omitted.cromer does not proffer in his motion anything that would entitle him to relief under that standard.similarly,cromer does not offer any other reason in his motion that merits relief under rule b or warrants reopening a settlement agreement that he entered into,with the aid of counsel,more than five years ago.
rather,in his motion,cromer simply argues once again that the magistrate judge incorrectly enforced the settlement agreement.this provides no basis for rule b relief.accordingly,we affirm the order denying cromer rule b motion.
the imposition of the prefiling injunction,which we review for abuse of discretion,de long hennessey,cir,presents more difficult questions.undoubtedly,the all writs act,a,grants federal courts the authority to limit access to the courts by vexatious and repetitive litigants like cromer,in re packer,cir see also wright,miller cooper,federal practice and procedure,at ed.basic power to protect the preclusive effects of a federal judgment by injunction may well inhere in the very existence of federal courts.if a more definite grant of general authority is needed,it can be found in the all writs act.
such a drastic remedy must be used sparingly,however,consistent with constitutional guarantees of due process of law and access to the courts.const.amend.xiv.these rights are longstanding and of fundamental importance in our legal system.the due process clause requires that every man shall have the protection of his day in court.truax corrigan.and,the supreme court has explained that the particular constitutional protection afforded by access to the courts is the right conservative of all other rights,and lies at the foundation of orderly government.chambers baltimore ohio.
thus,a judge should not in any way limit a litigant access to the courts absent exigent circumstances,such as a litigant continuous abuse of the judicial process by filing meritless and repetitive actions.brow farrelly,cir.indeed,use of such measures against a pro se plaintiff should be approached with particular caution and should remain very much the exception to the general rule of free access to the courts.pavilonis king,cir.
in determining whether a prefiling injunction is substantively warranted,a court must weigh all the relevant circumstances,including the party history of litigation,in particular whether he has filed vexatious,harassing,or duplicative lawsuits whether the party had a good faith basis for pursuing the litigation,or simply intended to harass the extent of the burden on the courts and other parties resulting from the party filings and the adequacy of alternative sanctions.see,safir united states lines,cir green warden,united states penitentiary,cir pavilonis,at.
in this case,the magistrate judge did not enumerate or discuss these factors.but the judge appears to have considered some of them.he seems to have concluded that the first and third factors weighed against cromer,finding cromer filings frivolous,tiresome,wasteful of the court time,and wasteful of the defendant resources.conversely,the magistrate judge suggested that the second factor might weigh in cromer favor,noting that given cromer conversation with a clerk of thi
