a amendment to penal code section requires local law enforcement officers to participate in two hours of domestic violence training.the issue on appeal is whether this amendment resulted in a reimbursable program within the meaning of article xiii b,section of the california constitution for the time spent by local law enforcement officers in such domestic violence training,although such officers were already required to spend hours in continuing education training and the domestic violence training could be included within this total.
this administrative mandamus proceeding was commenced by the county of los angeles county on a test claim filed with and denied by the commission on state mandates commission for the county costs incurred pursuant to section.the trial court found that california constitution article xiii b,section required the state to reimburse the county for domestic violence training because the county needs and priorities might be detrimentally affected when the state took away two hours of training by mandating that two specific hours of training occur.the trial court remanded the proceedings to the commission to determine the amount of costs actually incurred by the county.we reverse.
factual background and procedural history 
article xiii b,section of the california constitution provides whenever the legislature or any state agency mandates a new program or higher level of service on any local government,the state shall provide a subvention of funds to reimburse such local government for the costs of such program or increased level of service cal,art.xiii b.the commission is charged with hearing and deciding local agency claims of entitlement to reimbursement under article xiii b,section,subd.a.pursuit of such a claim is the exclusive remedy for this purpose,but the commission decisions are subject to review by administrative mandamus,under code of civil procedure section,subd.b.a test claim is the first claim,including claims joined or consolidated with the first claim,filed with the commission alleging that a particular statute or executive order imposes costs mandated by the state,see also kinlaw state of california cal d.
in,section,subdivision e was amended to provide e each law enforcement officer below the rank of supervisor who is assigned to patrol duties and would normally respond to domestic violence calls or incidents of domestic violence shall complete,every two years,an updated course of instruction on domestic violence that is developed according to the standards and guidelines developed pursuant to subdivision d.the instruction required pursuant to this subdivision shall be funded from existing resources available for the training required pursuant to this section.it is the intent of the legislature not to increase the annual training costs of local government.
penal code section et requires the state commission on peace officer standards and training post to promulgate regulations establishing minimum state standards relating to physical,mental,and moral fitness,and minimum training standards for law enforcement officers.compliance with post requirements is voluntary,et post has a certification program for peace officers specified in sections and and for the california highway patrol,subds.a c.
on or about december,the county filed a test claim pursuant to government code section with the commission the test claim alleged that neither local police officers nor their agencies were given any choice with respect to compliance with section.however,in order to implement the training,the county was required to redirect its officers from their normal work in order to attend the domestic violence training.the county alleged this substitution of the work agenda of the state for that of the local government violated california constitution article xiii b,section.furthermore,the county pointed to language in penal code section,subdivision e,providing that,the instruction required pursuant to this subdivision shall be funded from existing resources available for the training required pursuant to this section.it is the intent of the legislature not to increase the annual training costs of local government entities.
the test claim alleged that although post bore the cost of producing telecourses on domestic violence,post did not provide for any local law enforcement salary reimbursement for attendance at any type of training,including the costs for domestic violence training.adherence to post standards is voluntary by local law enforcement agencies,but post requires a minimum of hours of training every two years,to be chosen from a menu of available courses.post does not dictate the courses that must be taken.post courses include training in,among other things interviewing techniques for detectives,defensive weapons,cpr,conflict resolution,bicycle patrol,ritual crime and hate group offenders,vehicle pullover and approach,confessions,courtroom demeanor,electronic vehicle recovery systems,vehicle theft investigation,and cultural awareness.
the post program gives local law enforcement agencies flexibility in choosing training programs to meet their differing needs.in addition to domestic violence training,certain other programs are legislatively mandated dealing with the developmentally ill training implemented july high speed vehicle pursuits implemented november first a initial course,with a refresher course every three years missing persons implemented january racial and cultural diversity implemented august sexual harassment implemented november and sudden infant death syndrome implemented july.the time requirements for these other required courses vary.some elective courses require hours to complete.
however,the county alleged because there were no existing resources available for the domestic violence training,the annual training costs of the county were increased as a result of section.the county sheriff department incurred costs of for domestic violence training for the fiscal year.
in support of its test claim,the county submitted legislative materials relating to section.these included a july,memorandum in which the assembly committee on appropriations stated that senate bill,proposing the changes to,understood the training requirement could have significant costs to local law enforcement in terms of expense and public safety,as most departments will be forced to backfill for offices while the officers are being trained or will have to forego the backfilling and have fewer offices on patrol.any monetary costs incurred by local law enforcement for the officer backfilling would be.the committee noted that,although this bill states that the costs of the additional domestic violence training be absorbed by post within existing resources,the reality is that this bill would create additional costs to post since post will be unable to exclude one type of training in favor of the domestic violence training,and instead will have to add this training to their current curriculum.the current curriculum of post training is just as important to the maintaining of public safety as is the additional domestic violence training.
in addition,the department of finance recognized the fiscal impact of section on local law enforcement agencies,and opposed the adoption of senate bill.diane cummins,deputy director of the state department of finance,wrote to senator diane watson on april,that,this bill also specifies that training required pursuant to this measure shall be funded from existing resources,as specified.in so specifying,this bill would also require law enforcement agencies to modify existing training programs by increasing training requirements.finance believes this bill contains a local mandate without providing necessary funding,thereby being in conflict with the california constitution,which requires the state to fund local mandate costs.although there is no specific information available regarding the level of additional costs which would be imposed on law enforcement agencies,the department of finance is opposed to legislation which would result in additional general fund expenditures,given the state ongoing fiscal constraints.the department of finance recognized that,adding mandatory domestic violence training requirement would result in an additional unknown cost for specified state and local law enforcement agencies 
furthermore,gretchen fretter,chair of the california academy directors association an organization of training center directors and police academy managers throughout the state wrote senator watson on march,to express the association concerns with senate bill.fretter analysis indicated that the mandate would incur a price tag for each training cycle.the california state sheriffs association also wrote to express concerns about senate bill,including that post estimated the domestic violence training would add costs to local agencies of at least per year.glen fine,the deputy executive director of post,on july,wrote to the department of finance to inform it that post understood that the author of senate bill was aware of post training requirements of hours every two years,and it was the author intent that domestic violence update training become a statutorily required priority for inclusion within this hours of training every two years.
post issued a bulletin in february advising local law enforcement agencies of the new domestic violence training requirement.
the department of finance contended that the legislature intended the domestic violence continuing education and training to be funded from existing resources.the department also contended that post,which was charged with developing training standards for local law enforcement agencies,provided over million in existing state funds for domestic violence training.post pointed out that the drafter of the statute recognized the hours of continuing education every two years,and intended the domestic violence training to be a priority to be included within this requirement.
at the hearing before the commission on the test claim,representatives of the county testified that post refused to pay for the programs,putting the burdens on local governments,and post itself had estimated the annual cost of the program at.a representative of the sheriff department captain dennis wilson testified that of the hours required,any combination of courses could be used to meet the requirement.however,inclusion of the domestic violence training would take away two of those hours of training,resulting in only hours.the sheriff department would conduct domestic violence training even in the absence of the mandate indeed the sheriff department actually conducted about hours of training per officer per year.there was no funding for any of this training.the sheriff department has sworn officers,and two hours of training per officer adds up to hours,which translates to officers for a year.without funding for the domestic violence training,the sheriff department therefore would lose the time equivalent of officers for a year.taking officers off the street impacts upon crime.
martha zavala testified on behalf of the county that the domestic violence training could not merely be subsumed within the hours already required.with the training mandates already required by post which exceed the minimum,adding the domestic violence training only further exceeds the minimum hours.there is no room to carve it out.meeting post requirements is not really an option.thus,both the sheriff department and the county agree they are seeking reimbursement of the costs of the training and the cost of replacing the officers on the street while in training.
a representative of post testified that what post provides in reimbursement to local law enforcement agencies is a small percentage of the real costs incurred.where the training involved is through a telecourse,post provides no reimbursement.there has been no increase in post budget since the amendment to section.about of the courses provided by post are mandated training.
a representative of the department of finance testified that the department believed section did not create reimbursable program because the legislation indicated it was the legislature intent not increase the training costs of local government,and the training could be fit within the existing requirements.
the commission staff prepared an analysis in advance of the hearing which found against the county.the staff analysis pointed out that section was originally added by chapter,statutes of originally,the statute required that post develop and implement a basic course of instruction for the training of law enforcement officers in the handling of domestic violence complaints,with local law enforcement agencies encouraged,but not required,to provide updates.these provisions of the version were the subject of a test claim filed by the city of pasadena in.that claim was denied because the original statute did not require local agencies to implement or pay for a domestic violence training program,did not increase the minimum basic training course hours or advanced officer training hours,and did not require local agencies to provide domestic violence training pursuant to the post skills and knowledge standards.
legally,the staff analysis pointed out that in order for a statute to impose a reimbursable program,the statutory language must direct or obligate an activity or task upon local government entities,and the required activity or task must be new or it must create an increased or higher level of service over the former required level of service.see,county of los angeles state of california cal d.the staff analysis concluded that section did impose a new activity or program upon local law enforcement agencies.however,because the language of the statute requiring that the instruction be funded from existing resources,it was an open question whether the program imposed mandated costs.because post minimum requirements remained at hours before and after enactment of section,there were no increased training hours and costs associated with the domestic violence training course.instead,the course should be accommodated or absorbed by local law enforcement agencies within their existing resources available for training.thus,the staff analysis recommended denial of the test claim.
after the public hearings were held,the commission adopted the findings of the staff analysis.the commission issued its own statement of decision which substantially adopted the findings of the staff analysis.
subsequently,the county filed a petition for writ of mandate with the trial court,seeking vacation of the commission decision.the county argued that the domestic violence training constituted a reimbursable program because it was mandatory,while the post certification training was optional and the only way local agencies could avoid the costs of the new program would be to redirect their efforts from the training they were already providing as part of post training,thereby losing flexibility to design programs to suit their own needs.
the commission argued that the county focus on redirected manpower costs was misplaced.instead,the focus should be on whether the local law enforcement agencies actually experience increased expenditure of their tax revenues.see,county of sonoma commission on state mandates th,d.in county of sonoma,the court stated that california constitution article xiii b,section was designed to prevent the state from forcing programs on local governments,and such a forced program is one which results in increased actual expenditures of limited tax proceeds that are counted against the local government spending limit.section,located within a measure aimed at limiting expenditures,is expressly concerned with costs incurred by local governments as a result of programs,particularly when the costs of compliance with a new program restrict local spending in other areas.county of sonoma,at,d.because section did not require the county to incur actual increased costs because the domestic violence training could be subsumed within the post training requirement,no state reimbursement was required.
the commission also argued the state had not required the county to incur increased training costs for salaries of officers to receive the training.post requirements did not change as a result of section,and indeed,shortly after the enactment of section,post forwarded a bulletin to local law enforcement agencies suggesting they include domestic violence training within the continuing training requirement.
the trial court heard argument,after which the trial court adopted its tentative statement of decision in which it noted that,although it may be reasonable in some or even most cases for a deputy to eliminate an unrequired elective in favor of the required domestic violence instruction,what about cases where the county needs and priorities would be affected detrimentally,if two hours of electives were taken away at what point would additional mandated courses result in increased costs the record also shows that,for some deputies,other training already amounts to hours or more per period.for these deputies,the two hours of mandated domestic violence training can not be accommodated by giving up other training but must be added on,for added cost.it appears that,if domestic violence instruction is to be funded from existing resources on a basis,the county clearly does incur increased costs.the trial court granted the petition,and remanded the matter for consideration of the exact amount of increased costs.
discussion 
standard of review.
the determination whether the statute here at issue established a mandate under california constitution article xiii b,section,is a question of law.county of san diego state of california cal th,d.under government code section administrative mandamus is the exclusive means to challenge a decision of the commission on a subvention claim.redevelopment agency commission on state mandates th,d.government code section governs the proceeding below and requires that the trial court review the decision of the commission under the substantial evidence standard.where the substantial evidence test is applied by the trial court,we are generally confined to inquiring whether substantial evidence supports the court findings and judgment.citation.however,we independently review the superior court legal conclusions about the meaning and effect of constitutional and statutory provisions.citation.city of san jose state of california th,d.
ii.section imposition of a domestic violence training court is not a program within the meaning of constitution article xiii b,section because it does not constitute an increased level of service.
the commission essentially makes two arguments.first,it contends that the county did not incur increased costs.reimbursement to the county under constitution article xiii b,section is not required unless there is a showing of actual increased costs mandated by the state.see,county of los angeles state of california,supra,cal d at,city of sacramento state of california cal d.in city of sacramento,the court explained that the statutory concept of costs mandated by the state and the constitutional concept of article xiii b,section,are identical.city of sacramento state of california,supra,cal d at,fn.because of this limited,rather than broad definition,of costs mandated by the state,article xiii b,section does not provide reimbursement for every single increased cost.thus,the trial court finding that reimbursement was required where a statute results in a redirection of local effort or a detrimental change in a local agency needs and priorities is not supported by the law.rather,it constitutes an inappropriate injection of an equitable standard into the analysis.
secondly,the commission argues that no mandate exists.to the contrary,substantial evidence supports its finding that section does not result in increased costs because nothing in the statute requires the county,or any other local law enforcement agency,to incur actual increased costs.the total number of hours required the minimum hours of post training did not increase because of the domestic violence training rather,post still requires hours and in fact after the passage of section,post forwarded a bulletin to law enforcement agencies recommending that they include domestic violence training within the continuing professional training requirement.because the post standards are voluntary,if a local law enforcement agencies adds two hours of domestic violence training to either the post requirement or its own requirements,it is doing so at its own discretion.
in response,the county points out that the commission conclusion is based upon the erroneous premise that local law enforcement agencies could escape increased costs simply by dropping two hours of their existing post training and substituting the new domestic violence training.however,the evidence in the legislative history indicates that this was not the intent of the legislature when it was considering section,nor was it the position of the department of finance.the county also contends that local law enforcement agencies incur costs when they sacrifice their existing training programs for the new domestic violence training.although post does not dictate those courses for which a local law enforcement agency must offer training and post does pay for much of the training material,most of the cost of post training is borne by the local law enforcement agencies in the form of personnel costs while deputies spend hours of work time receiving training.furthermore,if a mere legislative directive to fund a new program with existing resources would let the state off the hook for reimbursement,then the constitutional rule of mandate reimbursement would be a nullity any new state mandate can be funded by canceling other services.because california constitution article xiii b,section was designed to prevent the elimination of the fiscal freedom of local governmental agencies to expend their limited available resources without being straightjacketed by programs,the commission within existing resources rule would circumvent the purposes of article xiii b,section.
a.the purposes of california constitution article xiii b,section guide our analysis.

california constitution article xiii b,section,provides in relevant part whenever the legislature or any state agency mandates a new program or higher level of service on any local government,the state shall provide a subvention of funds to reimburse such local government for the costs of such program or increased level of service.article xiii b,section,prevents the state from shifting financial responsibility for carrying out governmental functions to local agencies,which are ill equipped to assume increased financial responsibilities because of the taxing and spending limitations of articles xiii a and xiii county of fresno state of california,supra,cal d at.section thus requires the state to pay for any new governmental programs,or for higher levels of service under existing programs,that it imposes upon local governmental agencies.citation.hayes commission on state mandates th,d.
