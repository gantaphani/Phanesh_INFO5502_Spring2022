iii.discussion 
prerequisites to a takings claim 
in williamson county regional planning commission hamilton bank,the supreme court outlined two prerequisites to a federal suit alleging a fifth amendment taking of a property interest,d.a federal suit is not timely until a plaintiff demonstrates that a the government entity charged with implementing the regulations has reached a final decision regarding the application of the regulations to the property at issue,the final decision requirement and b the plaintiff sought and was denied just compensation by means of an adequate state procedure the state action requirement id.at.williamson county stands for the proposition that there is no uncompensated is,nothing to litigate under the state has established a what it has taken,and b its refusal to pay just compensation.sgb fin,consol.city of county,cir.
although williamson county was a regulatory taking case,a modified verison of its timeliness analysis applies to physical taking cases.daniel county of santa barbara,cir.the present case concerns a potential physical taking,based on the intrusion onto pascoag property or the acquisition of rights in that property in a physical taking case,the final decision requirement is relieved or assumed because w here there has been a physical invasion,the taking occurs at once,and nothing the governmental actor can do or say after that point will change that fact.hall city of santa barbara,cir arnett myers,cir finding final decision requirement satisfied because decision maker arrived at a definitive position inflicting an actual,concrete injury when its agents removed and destroyed plaintiff alleged property forseth village of sussex,cir finding physical taking claim subject only to williamson county state action requirement.however,the state action requirement remains in physical taking cases c ompensation must first be sought from the state if adequate procedures are available.sinaloa lake owners ass city of simi valley,cir,overruled on other grounds by armendariz penman,cir en banc.
state action requirement 
here,if rhode island provides an adequate process for obtaining compensation,and resort to that process holds out some realistic promise of yielding just compensation,pascoag may not seek compensation in federal court for an alleged taking without first resorting to the state process.gilbert city of cambridge,cir accord williamson county,at.i f a state provides an adequate procedure for seeking just compensation,the property owner can not claim a violation of the just compensation clause until it has used the procedure and been denied just compensation.b ecause the fifth amendment proscribes takings without just compensation,no constitutional violation occurs until just compensation has been denied.gilbert,at quoting williamson county,at.accord gamble eau claire county,cir stating that a litigant must exhaust his remedies for obtaining a compensation award or equivalent relief from the state because the right protected by the duty of just compensation is not to the land or its use but merely to the market value of what is taken.thus,the state action is not complete until the state fails to provide adequate compensation for the taking.williamson county,at.
pascoag did not seek compensation through the state court.pascoag burden is to show that one of the narrow exceptions to the state action requirement applies.the supreme court in williamson county identified two state remedies were unavailable or inadequate.at.accord deniz municipality of guaynabo,cir gilbert,at.some courts have also recognized an exception where state remedies are futile.see,daniels,at.
