background 
in august and september of,the rat creek wildfire burned about acres in the national forest in montana.on july,almost two years later,the chief forester of the forest service made an emergency situation determination for the rat creek salvage project the project.the emergency situation determination permitted the immediate commencement of the project logging without any of the delays that might have resulted from the forest service administrative appeals process.
the project permits salvage logging of trees on approximately of the acres that were burned.the logging will take place and to some degree has already taken place on units of land ranging from to acres in size.the forest service describes the purpose of the project as follows 
to recover and utilize timber from trees that are dead or dying as a result of the rat creek wildfire or forest insects and disease and reforest the harvested units with healthy trees appropriate for the site.the trees would supply wood to the forest products industry.
a further purpose is to cut trees infested with dwarf mistletoe to prevent transmission to new trees.
trees to be cut are those from to inches in diameter at breast height dbh that have died or are likely to die as a direct result of fire or insect attack.the forest service has provided guidelines for determining likelihood of mortality.for example,trees from to inches dbh are to be logged if less than of the live crown remains.other conifers are to be logged if less than of the live crown remains.the severity of insect attacks is to be determined by examining trees for signs such as pitch tubes or boring dust.
trees that survived the fire but are infected with dwarf mistletoe are to be cut,regardless of size,unless doing so would reduce the number of live trees below the forest service wildlife habitat standard.uninfested live trees,including those with a dbh larger than inches,are to be cut only if required by safety concerns.
the project requires construction of miles of temporary roads and reconditioning of about miles of existing roads.after completion of the project,the temporary roads will be obliterated,and the existing roads will be returned to their current uses,if any.
in april,the forest service released an environmental assessment ea of the project for public comment.
on june,the acting forest supervisor for the national forest wrote to the regional forester requesting that the chief forester make an emergency situation determination esd in connection with the rat creek project.the esd request stated that the emergency resulted from rapid deterioration and decay of trees proposed for salvage harvest,noting that t rees that have died or are dying from secondary fire effects are rapidly losing their value and merchantable volume.the request stated that immediate commencement of logging would prevent substantial economic loss to the federal government.the sites to be logged are typically accessible to loggers for only four to five months out of the year due to heavy snowfalls.the request stated that the logging needed to commence immediately so that it could be completed before winter arrived.
the request stated further 
an objective for recovering the value of the trees is to respond to local,regional,and national needs for commercial timber products.local economies in southwest montana have developed with natural resource utilization as the foundation.this economic structure continues today and is becoming stressed and increasingly unstable due to higher energy prices,and reduced supply of timber from national forest system lands.as markets decline and harvest activities on private lands decrease,the timber industry in montana increasingly depends on national forest system timber supply as an essential element to keep their mills operational.
on june,the regional forester forwarded the request for an esd to the chief forester,noting that a delay in implementation of activities included in the request would result in substantial loss of economic value to the federal government.on july,the chief forester granted the request for an esd.she wrote 
a delay to implementing the project until after any administrative appeals have been reviewed and answered will result in a substantial loss of economic value to the government.such a delay would push the award of timber sale contracts for the hazard tree and other salvage back to late october,with winter access limitations delaying most operations until summer of.by that time further deterioration of the affected trees will have resulted in a projected loss of receipts to the government of as much as and significantly increased the likelihood of receiving no bids.an absence of bids would push the potential loss to the government to and eliminate an opportunity to accomplish planting and dwarf mistletoe control objectives.
in evaluating whether an emergency situation exists with this project,i also took note of the importance this project has to the local economy of southwest montana.i understand the wood products yielded by this project will be a critical contributor to helping keep local mills operational.
on july,the forest service issued the final environmental assessment ea and a decision notice and finding of no significant impact.the forest service concluded that the project would not have a significant effect on the quality of the human environment and that an environmental impact statement eis was therefore not required.the forest service then initiated a bidding process for the project.on july,barry smith logging was declared the highest bidder.
plaintiff awr filed suit in federal district court alleging violations of the appeals reform act ara,the national forest management act nfma,and the national environmental protection act nepa.in a brief order entered on august,the district court denied awr request for a preliminary injunction.after quoting winter,the court wrote,after reviewing the parties filings,the court is convinced plaintiffs do not show a likelihood of success on the merits,nor that irreparable injury is likely in the absence of an injunction.this determination prevents the issuance of a preliminary injunction at this stage of the proceedings.the court did not describe or analyze the merits of awr claims and did not describe or analyze the harm alleged by awr.the court denied awr motion for a stay and injunction pending appeal to this court.
barry smith logging began work on the project on august.the parties indicated at oral argument that approximately of the planned logging was completed before winter conditions halted operations.
awr timely appealed the district court denial of its request for a preliminary injunction.because a significant amount of the project remains to be completed,this appeal is not moot.

iii.discussion 
sliding scale and serious questions after winter 
in winter,the supreme court disagreed with one aspect of this circuit approach to preliminary injunctions.we had held that the possibility of irreparable harm was sufficient,in some circumstances,to justify a preliminary injunction.winter explicitly rejected that approach.winter.at.under winter,plaintiffs must establish that irreparable harm is likely,not just possible,in order to obtain a preliminary injunction.id.the court wrote,a plaintiff seeking a preliminary injunction must establish that he is likely to succeed on the merits,that he is likely to suffer irreparable harm in the absence of preliminary relief,that the balance of equities tips in his favor,and that an injunction is in the public interest.id.at.a preliminary injunction is an extraordinary remedy never awarded as of right.id.at.
the majority opinion in winter did not,however,explicitly discuss the continuing validity of the sliding scale approach to preliminary injunctions employed by this circuit and others.under this approach,the elements of the preliminary injunction test are balanced,so that a stronger showing of one element may offset a weaker showing of another.for example,a stronger showing of irreparable harm to plaintiff might offset a lesser showing of likelihood of success on the merits.see,clear channel outdoor,city of los angeles,cir.this circuit has adopted and applied a version of the sliding scale approach under which a preliminary injunction could issue where the likelihood of success is such that serious questions going to the merits were raised and the balance of hardships tips sharply in plaintiff favor.id.that test was described in this circuit as one alternative on a continuum.see,lands council,at.the test at issue here has often been referred to as the serious questions test.we will so refer to it as well.
the parties in this case have devoted substantial portions of their argument to the question of the continuing validity of the serious questions approach to preliminary injunctions after winter.for the reasons that follow,we hold that the serious questions approach survives winter when applied as part of the winter test.in other words,serious questions going to the merits and a hardship balance that tips sharply toward the plaintiff can support issuance of an injunction,assuming the other two elements of the winter test are also met.
justice ginsburg explicitly noted in her dissent in winter that the court has never rejected the sliding scale formulation,and i do not believe it does so today.winter.at ginsburg,dissenting.justice ginsburg emphasized the importance of the sliding scale approach,writing f lexibility is the hallmark of equity jurisdiction.id.at.as justice ginsburg noted,the majority opinion in winter did not disapprove the sliding scale approach.indeed,some of its language suggests that the approach survives.for example,the court implied that balancing is appropriate when it indicated that particular regard should be paid to the public consequences in employing the extraordinary remedy of injunction.winter.at.
our circuit has not yet directly discussed in a published opinion the viability of the sliding scale approach.in our first opinion,we recited the winter test and then wrote,to the extent that our cases have suggested a lesser standard,they are no longer controlling,or even viable.am.trucking ass ns,city of los angeles,cir.we discussed the holding of winter that a preliminary injunction requires a showing of likely irreparable injury,but we did not discuss whether some version of the sliding scale test survived.see also stormans,selecky,cir in winter,the supreme court definitively refuted our possibility of irreparable injury standard mcdermott ampersand publ g,llc,cir ultimately applying a more stringent standard in light of first amendment interests.in national meat association brown,cir,we wrote,the district court applied our sliding scale approach,which required only a possibility of irreparable injury if plaintiff is likely to succeed on the merits.we then held that,although such an error might warrant remand,it was unnecessary in that case because all elements of the winter test had been met.id.
in johnson couturier,cir,the district court had applied the serious questions test and held that there are serious questions on the merits and the balance of hardships tips sharply in favor of plaintiff.the defendant objected that the district court had failed to consider the element of irreparable harm.id.we noted that the district court approach was questionable,but affirmed because the record supported a finding of a likelihood of irreparable harm,id.at.
our other published opinions are largely unilluminating on the question now before us.some address wholly separate aspects of winter.see,sierra forest legacy rey,cir emphasizing that winter requires consideration of narrow injunctive relief.others simply recite the winter test without elaboration.see,fork band council of shoshone of dep t of interior,cir klein city of san clemente,cir.
three other circuits have directly confronted the question whether some version of a sliding scale test has survived winter.they have split.the fourth circuit has held that the sliding scale approach is now invalid.real truth about obama,fed.election comm n,cir holding that the circuit prior test,which permitted flexible interplay among the elements,may no longer be applied after winter,vacated on other grounds.the seventh and second circuits have held to the contrary.
the seventh circuit was the first to hold that the sliding scale test survives winter,and that a weaker claim on the merits can still justify a preliminary injunction depending on the amount of net harm that could be prevented by the injunction.citing winter,judge easterbrook wrote 
irreparable injury is not enough to support equitable relief.there also must be a plausible claim on the merits,and the injunction must do more good than harm which is to say that the balance of equities favors the plaintiff.how strong a claim on the merits is enough depends on the balance of harms the more net harm an injunction can prevent,the weaker the plaintiff claim on the merits can be while still supporting some preliminary relief.

the second circuit decision came down after the supreme court had decided two cases,munaf geren,and nken holder.prior to winter,the second circuit had employed a serious questions sliding scale test 
for the last five decades,this circuit has required a party seeking a preliminary injunction to show a irreparable harm and b either likelihood of success on the merits or sufficiently serious questions going to the merits to make them a fair ground for litigation and balance of hardships tipping decidedly toward the party requesting the preliminary relief.

judge walker explained why the second circuit serious questions test survived winter 
the value of this circuit approach to assessing the merits of a claim at the preliminary injunction stage lies in its flexibility in the face of varying factual scenarios and the greater uncertainties inherent at the outset of particularly complex litigation.
the supreme court recent opinions have not undermined its approval of the more flexible approach none of the three cases comments at all,much less negatively,upon the application of a preliminary injunction standard that softens a strict likelihood of success requirement in cases that warrant it.
if the supreme court had meant for munaf,winter,or nken to abrogate the more flexible standard for a preliminary injunction,one would expect some reference to the considerable history of the flexible standards applied in this circuit,seven of our sister circuits,and in the supreme court itself we have found no command from the supreme court that would foreclose the application of our established serious questions standard as a means of assessing a movant likelihood of success on the merits thus,we hold that our venerable standard for assessing a movant probability of success on the merits remains valid 
dicta in two other circuits suggests that they will follow the seventh and second circuits in preserving the flexibility of the sliding scale approach.the tenth circuit has a modified test,similar to the serious questions test,under which a movant need only show questions going to the merits so serious,substantial,difficult and doubtful,as to make the issues ripe for litigation and deserving of more deliberate investigation.roda drilling siegal,cir quoting walmer dep t of,cir.since winter,the tenth circuit has mentioned its modified test but indicated that it was not applicable to the case before the court.id.the circuit has touched upon this issue,noting that winter does not squarely discuss whether the four factors are to be balanced on a sliding scale.davis pension benefit guar.
district courts in our circuit have grappled with the question of the sliding scale approach validity after winter.district judge alsup analysis bears repeating 
winter concerned the end of the sliding scale where the weaker factor involves injury,not the end of the scale where the weaker factor involves the merits but the injury is clear and the equities tip in favor of relief.winter can,however,be construed to hold that the moving party must always show a probability of success on the merits as well as a probability of injury.
it would be most unfortunate if the supreme court or the ninth circuit had eliminated the longstanding discretion of a district judge to preserve the status quo with provisional relief until the merits could be sorted out in cases where clear irreparable injury would otherwise result and at least serious questions going to the merits are raised 
can it possibly be that the supreme court and ninth circuit have taken away the ability of district judges to preserve the status quo pending at least some discovery and further hearing on the merits in such cases this would be such a dramatic reversal in the law that it should be very clearly indicated by appellate courts before a district court concludes that it has no such power.
save strawberry canyon dep t of energy,no.c wha,wl,at,citing three other district court cases in the ninth circuit with similar holdings.
for the reasons identified by our sister circuits and our district courts,we join the seventh and the second circuits in concluding that the serious questions version of the sliding scale test for preliminary injunctions remains viable after the supreme court decision in winter.in this circuit,the test has been formulated as follows 
a preliminary injunction is appropriate when a plaintiff demonstrates that serious questions going to the merits were raised and the balance of hardships tips sharply in the plaintiff favor.
lands council,at internal quotations and modification omitted.of course,plaintiffs must also satisfy the other winter factors,including the likelihood of irreparable harm.
preliminary injunction 
because it did not apply the serious questions test,the district court made an error of law in denying the preliminary injunction sought by awr.we conclude that awr has shown that there is a likelihood of irreparable harm that there are at least serious questions on the merits concerning the validity of the forest service emergency situation determination that the balance of hardships tips sharply in its favor and that the public interest favors a preliminary injunction.
likelihood of irreparable harm 
winter tells us that plaintiffs may not obtain a preliminary injunction unless they can show that irreparable harm is likely to result in the absence of the injunction.awr members use the national forest,including the areas subject to logging under the project,for work and recreational purposes,such as hunting,fishing,hiking,horseback riding,and skiing.awr asserts that its members interests will be irreparably harmed by the rat creek project.in particular,awr asserts that the project will harm its members ability to view,experience,and utilize the areas in their undisturbed state.
the forest service responds that the project areas represent only six percent of the acreage damaged by fire.it argues that because awr members can view,experience,and utilize other areas of the forest,including other areas that are not part of the project,they are not harmed by logging in the project.
this argument proves too much.its logical extension is that a plaintiff can never suffer irreparable injury resulting from environmental harm in a forest area as long as there are other areas of the forest that are not harmed.the project will prevent the use and enjoyment by awr members of acres of the forest.this is hardly a de minimus injury.
t he supreme court has instructed us that e nvironmental injury,by its nature,can seldom be adequately remedied by money damages and is often permanent or at least of long duration,irreparable.lands council,at.of course,this does not mean that any potential environmental injury warrants an injunction.id.but actual and irreparable injury,such as awr articulates here,satisfies the likelihood of irreparable injury requirement articulated in winter.
likelihood of success on the merits 
awr strongest argument on the merits is that the forest service has violated the appeals reform act ara and its implementing regulations by granting the emergency situation designation esd.regulations promulgated under the ara provide that most forest service decisions are appealable through an administrative process.see et seq forest service decisionmaking and appeals reform act,title iii,stat.the administrative appeals process would ordinarily be available for the project at issue in this case.a including as appealable decisions those for projects and activities implementing land and resource management plans documented in a record of decision rod or decision notice dn.if the forest service decision had been appealed administratively,there would have been an opportunity for members of the public,including plaintiffs,to object to the project on various grounds.implementation would then have been delayed until at least the business day following the date of appeal disposition.b.
the regulations provide an exception to the appeals process when the forest service makes an esd.an esd allows work to begin on a project as soon as notice of the otherwise appealable project decision is appropriately published.c.the regulations define an emergency situation as a situation on national forest system nfs lands for which immediate implementation of all or part of a decision is necessary for relief from hazards threatening human health and safety or natural resources on those nfs or adjacent lands or that would result in substantial loss of economic value to the federal government if implementation of the decision were delayed.
in granting the esd for this project,the chief forester considered three factors the loss of receipts to the government due to delayed commencement of the project the potential loss of an opportunity to accomplish planting and dwarf mistletoe control objectives and the importance this project has to the local economy of southwest montana.we hold that,at a minimum,there are serious questions on the merits whether these three factors are sufficient to justify the esd.we consider in turn the three factors upon which the chief forester relied.
first,the potential loss of receipts to the government resulting from the delay inherent in the appeals process was not great.the chief forester wrote that a delay of the commencement of the project until the summer of would result in a projected loss of receipts to the government of as much as.the chief forester wrote,in addition,that if the commencement of the project were delayed until,this would significantly increase the likelihood of receiving no bids.an absence of bids would push the potential loss to the government to.with all due respect to the budgetary concerns of the forest service,a loss of anticipated revenues to the government of as much as,or even a potential loss of in the event of no bids,is likely not a substantial loss to the federal government.
