robert racicky,debra racicky,greg racicky and joyce racicky racickys operate a commercial dairy farm in nebraska and brought a negligence action against farmland industries,farmland,a kansas corporation with its principal place of business in missouri.the racickys alleged farmland negligent feed ration advice injured their dairy cows.a jury found for the racickys and calculated their damages in the amount of,but also found the racickys to be at fault.denying farmland motion for judgment as a matter of law or,in the alternative,a new trial,the district court entered judgment for the racickys in the amount of,plus costs and interest.on appeal,farmland contends the racickys failed to produce sufficient evidence on the issues of agency,standard of care,proximate cause and lost profits.we conclude the evidence supports the jury findings on liability and on lost market value damages,but does not support a jury award for lost profits.
background 
the racickys operate elk creek dairy,an commercial holstein dairy farm in central nebraska.greg sherwood sherwood,a sales and marketing manager and a dairy specialist with the aurora,nebraska,cooperative elevator company,approached the racickys in april about providing them feed rations and ration advice to increase milk production for their herd thereafter,the racickys used sherwood for ration advice.the racickys claim they hired sherwood for his access to farmland technical support.during the relationship,sherwood used farmland employees,information,advice,and computer software to prepare rations for the racickys.sherwood also provided the racickys with farmland brochures,literature and joint advertising.in,after sherwood nominated the racickys for a farmland dairy award,farmland flew robert and debra racicky to kansas city to receive the farmland award.
the racickys had never purchased farmland or corn for their rations until august,at which time they bought corn from sherwood.the record reveals this new corn was finely ground.after eating the rations with the new corn,the racickys cows experienced rumenal acidosis the racickys claim this condition was caused by the new rations,specifically,the fine ground corn which was too hot and fermented too fast in the cow rumen out of a herd of cows,fifteen of the racickys cows died and became very ill after eating the new rations.some of the sick cows were kept as cull cows to produce offspring and others were sold.after august,the racickys suffered a decrease in milk production,from approximately pounds of milk per cow per year to approximately pounds of milk per cow per year.because all four issues in this case are,we will discuss additional facts as necessary to resolve each issue.
ii.discussion 
standard of review 
we review de novo the district court denial of farmland motion for judgment as a matter of law.bass gmc,cir.we must decide whether the record contains sufficient evidence to support the jury verdict.id.in doing so,we must examine the sufficiency of the evidence in the light most favorable to the racickys and view all inferences in their favor.id.we must remain mindful that j udgment as a matter of law is appropriate only when all of the evidence points one way and is susceptible of no reasonable inference sustaining the racickys position.id.citations and quotations omitted.as this is a diversity action,we must apply nebraska negligence law.jordan nucor,cir.
farmland argues the racickys failed to prove sherwood was farmland apparent agent.according to the nebraska supreme court,apparent authority to act as another agent may only be conferred if the alleged principal affirmatively,intentionally,or by lack of ordinary care causes third persons to act upon the apparent authority.franksen crossroads joint venture.the apparent authority or agency for which a principal may be liable must be traceable to the principal and can not be established by the acts,declaration,or conduct of the agent.id.furthermore,o ne who is placed on inquiry as to an agent or employee authority,and who has reasonable means of making inquiry,occupies the same position in law as if he had actual knowledge of the employee lack of authority,because he is charged with knowledge of the facts which the inquiry would have developed.id.
acknowledging the closeness of the apparent agency issue,we find the record contains sufficient evidence to support the district court decision to submit the agency question to the jury.although farmland makes a compelling argument that the record does not support a finding of apparent agency,this argument was for the jury,who rejected it.
sherwood first visited the racickys farm in april,and gave them his business card.at times two others,jeff wheeler wheeler and vaughn studer studer,visited racickys farm with sherwood,their business cards showed they were farmland employees.after the racickys hired sherwood,they only paid the for materials and services,and did not establish a financial relationship with farmland.this evidence tends to negate an inference of apparent agency.
the record also contains evidence supporting the racickys claim that sherwood was farmland agent.sherwood,studer,and wheeler each gave farmland brochures to the racickys.sherwood nominated the racickys for a farmland dairy award,which farmland presented to the racickys in.farmland provided robert and debra racicky an paid trip to kansas city to receive their award at a farmland banquet.at this event,farmland gave the racickys information and gifts.the racickys could have reasonably inferred farmland was bestowing gifts and awards to them based on sherwood recommendation.
the was a farmland associated,authorized to use farmland logos,brand name,advertisements and literature.farmland also developed joint advertisements for the to use.a farmland advertisement included the following words technical are our most valuable resource.under this heading,farmland listed a number of positions,including local retail sales specialists contact the nearest vip account.the aurora was considered a farmland vip account.
sherwood used farmland on a regular basis to create,modify and build rations.sherwood sometimes submitted his rations directly to farmland for advice and other times he would just talk to farmland on the telephone.in building the racickys rations,sherwood used the brill computer program acquired from farmland,and he had unlimited access to farmland technical support regarding the computer program.when sherwood designed a ration using the computer program,the printouts he gave to the racickys were entitled farmland industries suggested batch sheet and farmland summary of suggested rations.
farmland assisted sherwood by giving him direct access to its veterinarians and its research and feed consultants,which robert racicky testified was important and induced him to hire sherwood.sherwood consistently availed himself of farmland services,which cemented the racickys belief that sherwood was farmland agent sherwood also visited the racickys farm with farmland employees,whom sherwood consulted before giving his ration advice to the racickys.
when asked whether his decision to use sherwood was based on anything farmland did,robert racicky said,i went with sherwood because,you know,i wanted all this experience that was behind aurora with farmland.when asked whether sherwood was from the,robert said,not necessarily mean,how do you look at aurora and farmland they are both the same thing.
viewing the evidence in the racickys favor and giving them the benefit of all reasonable inferences,a jury could reasonably infer the racickys used sherwood because they believed he was farmland agent.whether farmland led the racickys to believe sherwood was farmland agent was properly submitted to the jury.
negligence 
standard of care 
in a negligence case involving an alleged who possesses special knowledge,skill,training,or experience,the standard of care is not that of a reasonably prudent person,but that of a person with specialized knowledge,skill,and other qualities.cerny cedar bluffs pub.farmland argues sherwood ration advice in august regarding fine ground corn did not breach the applicable standard of care.the racickys counter that sherwood controlled the rations,which rations were too hot because of a high concentrate level based on the fine ground grain.under nebraska law,the applicable standard of care for sherwood ration advice was whether a reasonable dairy feed specialist,with specialized knowledge,skill,training and experience,would have recommended using rations with the size of grain particles actually fed to the racickys dairy herd in august.
negligence and the standard of care do not exist in the abstract,but must be measured against a particular set of facts and circumstances.id.the must determine what conduct the standard of care would require under the particular circumstances presented by the evidence and whether the conduct of the alleged conformed with the standard.id.at.whenever specialized knowledge,skill,or training is involved,expert testimony may be necessary to determine what standard of care is required under the particular circumstances involved.id.
farmland contends the only evidence on this issue establishes that the use of fine ground corn in august was reasonable.both sherwood and paul johnson johnson,a veterinarian called by farmland,testified to that effect.however,viewing the evidence in the light most favorable to the racickys,the record contains sufficient evidence that sherwood recommended use of fine ground corn breached the standard of care.
several witnesses testified to the corn size.wallace wass wass,a veterinarian,saw corn at the racicky farm that looked like swine feed,which is more finely ground than cow feed.robert racicky,who had been farming for forty years,testified the corn used in the rations in august looked like corn meal.furthermore,he testified that,once he used the new ration with the new farmland corn in august,disaster struck.greg racicky testified the corn the supplied in the summer of was different from the corn the racickys had been feeding their cows theirs looked like soy bean meal or just a little bit coarser probably just a little bit larger texture than corn meal.these three witnesses showed clear surprise at how finely ground the corn was.
doug weich weich,an independent dairy nutritionist,said,i felt that the cause in feeding rations that were,in the industry,that we consider to be too hot,high concentrate level.randall pedersen pedersen,a veterinarian working with nutritionists in his practice and having extensive knowledge of cows nutrition,testified that nutrition is the basis for livestock production,noting he evaluates feed from a livestock or feedbunk perspective.pedersen explained a cow diet and the forage to concentrate ratio,noting specifically how fine ground corn was used in the racickys rations received from farmland.when considering the cause of the health problems the racickys herd was experiencing in,pedersen consulted weich,and also observed the cows and the rations.pedersen opined the herd health problems were caused by s ubacute rumenal acidosis due to improperly put together ration.he concluded the problem with the ration was that i t was very fine and the corn in it was fine.
sherwood rations contained fine ground corn,which farmland produced and the delivered.relying on sherwood ration advice,the racickys fed these rations to their herd and cows either died or became sick.given the combined testimony of wass,pedersen,weich and the racickys,the standard of care became a disputed fact issue,and the jury measured the standard of care against a particular set of facts and circumstances.
proximate cause 
farmland contends the record contains insufficient evidence to show sherwood ration advice proximately caused injury to the racickys herd.a proximate cause is a cause that produces a result in a natural and continuous sequence and without which the result would not have occurred.meyer state.the issue of proximate cause,in the face of conflicting evidence,is ordinarily a question for the trier of fact.world radio,coopers lybrand.farmland makes a argument that the evidence shows the rations not the corn the health problems.farmland also points to conflicting testimony as to when the health problems began,noting the did not deliver farmland corn until august.
johnson testified that fine ground corn and rations with fine ground corn did not cause acidosis.pedersen,on the other hand,considered potential causes and eliminated all causes except one subacute rumenal acidosis due to improperly put together ration.randall anderson anderson,a nebraska veterinarian,testified pedersen probably sees more cows than any other veterinarian in the state of nebraska,so i knew he was perfectly capable of handling the situation.weich,the nutritionist,testified he believed the health problems were caused by the feeding rations.wass testified the cause of the acidosis absolutely had to be related to feeding a very high energy ration in a form that was finely divided,very finely ground that obviously did provide enough roughage effect to prevent the acidosis that developed in these animals.greg and robert racicky testified their cows had no health problems when the racickys were grinding their own corn,but the herd began experiencing health problems when they started using the fine ground corn from farmland.
the jury answered the proximate cause question.based on this record,we will not question the jury answer.
once the racickys proved sherwood negligent ration advice caused damage to the herd,the racickys were entitled to damages.for personal property that can not be restored to substantially its prior condition,the measure of damages is the lost market value plus the reasonable value of the loss of use of the property for the reasonable amount of time required to obtain a suitable replacement.chlopek schmall.where property used for commercial or business purposes can not be rented,then loss of profits may establish the reasonable value of the loss of use.id.the district court instructed the jury that the racickys were entitled to lost market value damages and temporary loss of use or lost profits damages,if proven.
the jury found the racickys damages to be,but the jury was not asked to separate its findings on damages.thus,we do not know how much the jury awarded for lost market value and for lost profits.the parties seem to agree on the lost market value portion of the damages award.farmland appeal concerns only the lost profits aspect of the jury award.
lost market value 
lost market value is the difference in the market value of the property immediately before and after the injury.shotkoski standard chem.the racickys claim the jury found their lost market value damages to be farmland does not dispute this calculation.farmland asks this court to modify the district court judgment by reducing the racickys damages to only those for direct injury to the cows,reduced by the fault assessed to plaintiffs.because sufficient evidence exists on lost market value damages,the district court properly submitted this element of damages to the jury.
lost profits 
the nebraska supreme court explains when lost profits may be recovered 
a claim for lost profits must be supported by some financial data which permit an estimate of the actual loss to be made with reasonable certitude and exactness.uncertainty as to the fact of whether damages were sustained at all is fatal to recovery,but uncertainty as to amount is not if the evidence furnishes a reasonably certain factual basis for computation of the probable loss.loss of prospective profits may be recovered if the evidence shows with reasonable certainty both its occurrence and the extent thereof.
world radio,at citations omitted see evergreen farms first bank trust,lost profits need not be proved with mathematical certainty,but can not be based on evidence which is speculative and conjectural.the certainty requirement for the recovery of lost profits balances the defendant right to avoid liability out of proportion to its culpability against the plaintiff right to full compensation.triple r,century lubricating oils,cir.the law generally is unfavorable to the recovery of losses of profits in tort actions.id.quoting k r,crete storage
