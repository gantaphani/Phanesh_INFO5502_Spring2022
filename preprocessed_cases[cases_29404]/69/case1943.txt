defendants jon prun and linda prun appeal from a judgment requiring them to reduce the height of or move a gate and a fence in the front of their residence that violates the height and setback requirements in the covenants,conditions,and restrictions and architectural guidelines adopted by plaintiff pacific hills homeowners association.they contend the action was not subject to a statute of limitations in code of civil procedure section,subdivision b all further statutory references are to this code unless otherwise noted as the court determined but was barred by the statute of limitations in section.
they also assert that,in any event,the action was barred by laches and waiver,and the court erroneously excluded certain evidence of other nonconforming use.we disagree with each contention.
plaintiff filed a claiming that portion of the judgment requiring it to pay for of the cost of relocation of defendants gate upon satisfaction of certain conditions was erroneous.it did not address the substance of that issue,however,arguing that because defendants had not satisfied the conditions,its own appeal was moot.we decline plaintiff request to clarify the effect of that part of the judgment.
thus,we affirm the judgment.
defendants home is located in a planned community subject to a declaration of covenants,conditions and restrictions cc r and governed by plaintiff.the cc r allow plaintiff to adopt reasonable rules and incorporate them into the cc r.the cc r require the prior written approval of the architectural committee committee before construction of any improvement,including a fence or wall and also mandate submission of plans to the committee and its approval before construction can begin.plaintiff also adopted architectural guidelines guidelines that limit fences to feet in height unless they are within feet of the front property line,in which case the maximum height is feet.
in late defendants decided to erect a mechanical gate,connected to a fence and pilasters,across their driveway.jon testified they reviewed the copy of the cc r and guidelines they received when they purchased the home and found no mention of setbacks.jon also testified that after this action was filed he noticed that the copy of the guidelines they received upon purchase of their home contained only pages they were missing the page containing the setback requirements.we note that the guidelines and amended guidelines in the record show the setback requirement was on pages.
after reviewing those documents,jon then called the property management company and asked about setbacks.jon testified that bill scales,the architectural administrator,told him that neither plaintiff nor the city of mission viejo had setback requirements.according to jon,scales only said that color was critical and the gate should be of high quality.scales assured him there wo be any problem or there should be any problem after jon told him a professional contractor was installing the gate.jon also testified scales said he would fax the forms defendants needed for plaintiff approval and that permission should take only a couple of weeks.jon testified he understood the approval was basically a formality.
scales testified he did not remember the call and would not have checked a city setback requirement for a homeowner because he had no copy of those codes.
in the meantime defendants started building the gate.when scales learned of it he sent a letter informing them construction violated the cc r because prior approval was required he asked for plans to be submitted.in late november jon completed the forms he had received from scales and sent them both to him and to the committee he did not enclose plans.
in january,plaintiff sent a letter to defendants asking for plans.defendants their application with a drawing that did not show the specifics of the gate as required by the cc r.consequently,plaintiff returned it stamped,disapproved as submitted capitalization omitted with another request for defendants to s ubmit clear drawings defendants then did so,showing the gate within three feet of the front property line.in the committee denied approval of defendants proposed fence and gate because it did not comply with the setback requirements.but defendants had already completed the gate.
in late july and august plaintiff sent letters to defendants,first asking them to comply with the cc r and then inviting them to attend a board meeting in october.thereafter plaintiff sent a letter giving defendants a november deadline for them to move the gate to comply with the setback requirements and advising it would assess a fine if they did not plaintiff also invited them to a meeting in december to discuss the situation.
at some point plaintiff contacted the city of mission viejo advising it of the situation.in may,the city sent written notice to defendants that their gate violated its setback requirements.between november and january,plaintiff sent four more letters assessing fines and inviting defendants to meetings,which they attended.
in march,plaintiff lawyer sent a letter to defendants,stating it was plaintiff last effort to resolve th e matter and insisting that the gate be moved back.it gave defendants days to advise whether or not they intended to comply if not plaintiff would take legal action.jon testified he called the lawyer and explained defendants side of the story.he also testified plaintiff counsel told him he thought that sounded logical and plausible he wanted to research the matter and said if he did not get back to defendants,they should consider the matter closed.
thirteen months later in april a different lawyer sent a letter to defendants inviting them to submit the matter to alternative dispute resolution and advising that if they did not respond in days,plaintiff may authorize filing of a lawsuit.when jon called that lawyer he was told,we going to make you move the gate.nothing happened until almost one year later,in march,when plaintiff lawyer sent another letter suggesting mediation.
when defendants did not mediate,in april plaintiff filed this action for breach of the cc r,nuisance,and declaratory and injunctive relief.the injunction sought was based on violation of the setback requirements,not defendants failure to obtain prior approval of the project.the case went to trial only on the injunction cause of action.
the court found in favor of plaintiff.it ruled,in part,that the statute of limitations in section,subdivision b applied and thus the action was filed timely.the court also found defendants had not proven their other affirmative defenses of estoppel,laches,or waiver.
the judgment ordered defendants to lower their fence,gates,and pilasters to a maximum of feet,or,in the alternative,to set them back to at least feet from the front property line.in that case,the height could be up to six feet.if defendants chose the latter alternative and gave plaintiff timely written notice of their decision,plaintiff would be required to pay of the cost of the relocation.if defendants did not timely give notice,they had to pay the entire cost of the ordered corrections.if defendants gave such notice and plaintiff did not agree in writing to pay of the cost,the injunction would dissolve and defendants would be allowed to keep the gates and fence as built.
discussion 
applicable statute of limitations 
plaintiff filed this action more than four years but less than five years after defendants erected the gate.defendants contend that section,subdivision b,which is a statute of limitations,applies only to recorded documents,in this case,cc r,and not to unrecorded rules and regulations or guidelines of homeowners associations such as are at issue here.we disagree.
section,subdivision b provides for a statute of limitations for a n action for violation of a restriction,as defined in section of the civil code.civil code section states,restriction,when used in a statute that incorporates this section by reference,means a limitation on,or provision affecting,the use of real property in a deed,declaration,or other instrument,whether in the form of a covenant,equitable servitude,condition subsequent,neg
