plaintiffs bobby bailey and robert smith,both,were dock workers and truck drivers for defendant usf holland.after making numerous complaints over the course of several years regarding their coworkers habit of referring to them as boy,hey boy,or damn it boy,and subjecting them to other forms of racial harassment,plaintiffs sued defendant for violation of title vii of the civil rights act of and the tennessee human rights act.following a trial,the district court ruled for plaintiffs and awarded damages.we affirm.
plaintiff bailey began working for usf holland in.he started as a dock worker and eventually became a driver responsible for delivering freight throughout nashville and the surrounding counties.plaintiff smith began work for defendant as a dock worker in.
much of the harassment surrounds the persistent taunting of bailey and smith with the word boy.the honorable aleta trauger explained the facts surrounding this harassment 
in,usf holland opened a new,larger terminal,requiring the hiring of new workers,and it was in that new environment that bailey coworkers started to call him boy.bailey would tell those employees not to call him boy,but the employees would respond that they did not mean anything by the term and would continue to use it.bailey was aware that the term was also being used to address smith and another black employee,jimmy bolden.at some point in,bailey and smith complained about being addressed as boy at the terminal to tim kircher,the operation manager,and rich powers,another supervisor.bolden also complained to kircher about the use of the term nigger in.however,no action was taken as a result of those conversations.
in,bailey complained to tommy barnes,the union job steward,that his coworkers continued to call him boy.barnes told a manager,who then held a series of meetings about roughhousing at the terminal,but did not specifically mention the use of the word boy.
as the district court explained,the situation became worse 
in one incident,a white employee,bubba ridings,addressed bailey as baby boy.when bailey told ridings that he preferred not to be called boy,ridings next said that the only thing he could think of in response to bailey request was damn it boy.
in,bailey discovered a noose hanging in the dock area.he did not report the noose to any supervisors because he thought it was located such that the supervisors could see it.several years later,bailey discussed the noose with terminal manager julie jones and with investigator brian cave.
bailey continued to complain about being called boy.the district court found that these complaints inspired his coworkers to call him boy with greater frequency.daniel calvo,bailey immediate supervisor,repeatedly addressed him as boy and damn it boy,and responded to bailey complaints by telling him not to take things so personally.bailey,understandably,came to believe that his coworkers were intentionally trying to bait him with the word.he believed that they would start conversations with him solely in order to bobby boy or damn it boy him.in several instances,immediately following bailey negative reaction to being called boy,his coworkers responded with damn it boy.
when julie jones became the terminal manager in,bailey,smith,and another employee complained to her about the racially charged environment.she informed steve blubaugh,the vice president of human resources.blubaugh then conducted sensitivity training at the terminal and specifically addressed the use of the term boy,noting that it was a racial epithet used during slavery.during the sensitivity training,several white employees voiced resistance to the idea that it was wrong to refer to men as hey boy or damn it boy.one white employee,fred connor,told jones that the word boy was a southern thing and that he would continue to use it regardless of company policy,informing her that because of his insistence on using the word,you are probably going to have to fire me one day.the behavior continued,and bailey coworkers took what the district court described as more dangerous,hostile actions toward him 
for instance,bailey was vandalized,resulting in substantial damage.the word boy appeared on the trailer walls and trailer doors,and in the locker rooms it appeared etched into restroom walls located in the terminal and it was written in the dust that collected on the dock surfaces.the words fuck boy were written on a fuel pump.although the defendant took action to remove the graffiti,it returned and persisted past the time that the plaintiffs filed this suit.
in,gary brown,a white employee,told bailey that there were two kinds of and colored boys.this caused bailey and brown to get into a heated argument and,shortly thereafter,a flyer appeared in the break room depicting a white person and a black person wrestling for a basketball.on the white player was written gary brown and on the black player,the boy.during that time a different flyer appeared in the break room,again with a white person and black person playing basketball.in a cartoon bubble emanating from the white player mouth were the words,give it to me,boy.in the calendar posted in the break room,bailey discovered the word boy written in the square for the martin luther king holiday.
the district court found that this conduct affected bailey at work and at home bailey suffered emotional pain,exhaustion,loss of interest in his hobbies,and the stress adversely affected his relationships with his wife and his children.
plaintiff smith was subjected to similar racial harassment involving the use of the word boy.for example,in as smith was backing out of a trailer in his forklift,james goodman,a fellow employee,blocked him and shouted,h ey boy,what you doing,boy do you hear me,boy where you going,boy afterwards,smith told goodman not to call him boy.smith complained to kircher,the operation manager,but kircher took no action.
judge trauger found that,as with bailey,smith also had to endure more heinous conduct 
in another incident,in,ron bruce,a white coworker,approached smith as he conversed with another white coworker,john brasswell.ron bruce said to john brasswell that he liked smith because he could call smith a dirty nigger and that smith would not do anything about it.
the district court determined that bailey and smith were each generally aware of the conduct exhibited towards each other.both of them noticed the noose hanging in the dock area after loveless held the meeting about roughhousing in the terminal.
smith was aware of the graffiti that began to appear at the terminal.in one incident,the word boy was on the side of a dock door where smith was working.a week later,one of the supervisors over the word,but the graffiti continued.for example,the word boy was written in black marker in the locker room and other graffiti appeared on the dock doors,in the restrooms,and on a fuel featuring the word boy.
the harassment caused smith to take time off from work due to stress.the district court found that smith suffered embarrassment from these incidents and felt ostracized at work 
he has experienced stress,anxiety,depression and trouble sleeping.his mind stays focused on these incidents while at work and at home,and he has trouble focusing on other things.these incidents have made it difficult for smith to interact with white people outside of work,although he does continue to socialize with white people.the stress involved has caused smith to be listless and tired at home.
in november,attorney allen cave,a member of a law firm employed by defendant,spent three days at the nashville terminal investigating bailey,smith,and bolden complaints.in his report,cave stated,in part,that,while the environment likely is not racially hostile,it is certainly one in which more sensitive employees can feel uncomfortable.cave concluded that raw racial attitudes,combined with the rough manner in which the employees engage each other could,if left unchecked,create a more legally objectionable situation in the future.
after receiving cave report,blubaugh wrote each of the plaintiffs and stated that,regarding the issues of nooses and racial slurs not including the word boy,the
