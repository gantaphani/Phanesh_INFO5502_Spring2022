this case involves a rent control board decision on reconsideration,based on a trial court peremptory writ,of a general rent increase application by a mobilehome park owner.the trial court judgment and writ rejecting the board initial decision required the board to apply an analysis or methodology that gives due consideration to debt service costs mortgage interest in calculating a fair return on the owner investment.the board did not appeal the trial court judgment.instead,it conducted a new hearing and received new evidence as required by the writ.however,the methodology it ultimately employed excluded debt service costs in calculating a fair return to the park owner.the park owner moved for an order further enforcing the original judgment.the trial court granted the motion,finding that the board decision was not in compliance with the judgment and writ because it employed a methodology that excluded debt service costs.the trial court declared the board decision null and void,and set the rent increase based on a methodology the board had considered and rejected,concluding there was no evidence in the record of any alternative methodology which would comply with the requirements of the writ.
we reverse the trial court order.while the rent control board failed to comply with the trial court judgment and peremptory writ,the trial court exceeded its authority by setting the amount of the rent increase instead of again remanding the matter to the board for the exercise of the discretion legally vested in the board.
legal,factual and procedural background 
we describe first the city of carson mobilehome space rent control ordinance,and then turn to the particulars of this case.
a.the applicable ordinance.
the city of carson has a rent control ordinance applicable to mobilehome parks,known as the mobilehome space rent control ordinance,art.iv,ch.under the ordinance,the city mobilehome park rental review board board hears and determines rent adjustment applications.the board is authorized to grant such rent increases as it determines to be fair,just and reasonable,subd.g.a rent increase is fair,just and reasonable if it protects homeowners from excessive rent increases and allows a fair return on investment to the park owner.in making its determinations,the board is required to consider factors specified in the ordinance and any guidelines adopted by the city council,as well as any other relevant factors,and no one factor shall be determinative.ibid.the factors the board must consider include changes in the consumer price index cpi the rent for comparable mobilehome spaces in the city and changes in reasonable operating and maintenance expenses the guidelines the board is required to consider provide,inter alia,the following 
the ordinance does not mandate the use of any formula or guarantee increases equal to the increase in the cpi,or any percentage of the cpi.
debt service incurred to purchase a park may be an allowable operating expense if the purchase price paid was reasonable in light of the rents allowed under the ordinance and involved prudent and customary financing practices.
in evaluating a rent increase application,the board may consider,in addition to the factors specified in g of the ordinance,a gross profits maintenance analysis,which compares the gross profit level expected from the last rent increase granted to the park prior to the current application target profit to the gross profit shown by the current application.this analysis will be included in the staff report to the board in addition to analysis concerning the eleven factors 
the gross profits maintenance analysis is intended to provide an estimate of whether a park is earning the profit estimated to provide a fair return,as established by the immediately prior rent increase,with some adjustment to reflect any increase in the cpi.the analysis is an aid to assist the board in applying the factors in the ordinance and is to be considered together with the factors in g,other relevant evidence presented and the purposes of the ordinance.the analysis is not intended to create any entitlement to any particular rent increase.
b.the carson gardens rent increase application round one.
carson gardens,purchased a mobilehome park in the city in october on october,three years after acquiring the park,carson gardens filed a written application for a rent increase in the amount of per space per month this application was the first rent increase application filed since.carson gardens based its proposed rent increase on gross profits maintenance analysis,a method utilized by the board for many years in analyzing rent increase applications.this methodology compares the gross profit level expected from the last rent increase granted to the park here,in june to the gross profit shown in the current application in this case,principally because the prior owner had no debt service costs,the gross profit for the park was much higher in than in the last full year of financial information available for the comparison.the difference between the amount required to maintain gross profits at the level with cpi adjustments and the actual gross profit in,divided by the number of spaces in the park,resulted in the requested rent increase of.had the rent increase application been granted,rent levels would have increased to a range of to per space,an increase of percent to percent for each rental space.
the board resolution.
the board,in a resolution adopted august,granted a rent increase of percent,ranging from to per space.the board found this increase,which equaled percent of the increase in the cpi since the rent increase or percent of the increase in the cpi since carson gardens purchased the park in,would be fair,just and reasonable.the board stated 
t he comparison provided by the gross profits maintenance analysis would not be meaningful because the estimated gross profit target for the park set by the rent increase was based on the absence of debt service and much lower property taxes.carson gardens who purchased the park with notice of the rents allowed by the ordinance at the time of purchase and the limitations on rent increases provided by the ordinance and who incurred such a large amount of debt could not reasonably expect to earn the same profit as the prior owner.therefore,it is more appropriate to increase rents by a percentage of the increase in the cpi since the last rent increase granted for the park.further,because a substantial portion of the large increase in the cpi since the former owner last obtained a rent increase is due to the increase in the cpi before carson gardens purchased the park,it would be reasonable to consider only the increase in the cpi since carson gardens purchased the park.further,in these circumstances and considering the rents charged by the comparable parks it would not be fair to base an increase in existing rents on or of the increase in the cpi since the last hearing on the park rent application.
trial court proceedings.
carson gardens petitioned for administrative mandamus,and later moved for a writ of mandate.on april,the trial court issued a peremptory writ directing the board to set aside its resolution and to conduct a new hearing.the board was specifically ordered to 
reconsider its decision on the carson gardens rent increase application in light of all relevant evidence offered at the new hearing,including new evidence,if any,not offered at its prior hearing and 
t o apply the gross profits maintenance analysis discussed in the guidelines or another reasonable analysis or methodology that gives due consideration to the park actual reasonable operating expenses,including actual reasonable expenses incurred in acquiring the park,and comports with the requirements of the ordinance and the guidelines 
a final judgment was entered the same day in favor of carson gardens,ordering issuance of a peremptory writ of mandate remanding the action for further administrative proceedings as set forth in the writ.the board did not appeal the judgment.
c.the carson gardens rent increase application round two.
consonant with the trial court judgment and writ,the board conducted a new hearing at which it received further evidence.however,contrary to the trial court writ,the board did not apply the gross profits maintenance analysis,and it did not apply another methodology that gives due consideration to actual reasonable expenses incurred in acquiring the park instead,the board engaged the services of kenneth baar,an expert on fair return cases,who utilizes the maintenance of net operating income mnoi methodology for calculating a fair return on investment to a landlord.the mnoi methodology for determining a fair return on investment,found in other cases to be a fairly constructed formula rainbow disposal escondido mobilehome rent review bd.th,d,excludes consideration of mortgage interest as an operating expense.under the mnoi methodology,the park owner is entitled to pass through operating cost increases exclusive of mortgage interest between the base year and the current year,and to obtain an increase in net operating income based on the percentage increase in the cpi.the resulting net operating income is available for the payment of debt service and to provide cash return on investment.
the board resolution.
the board concluded a rent increase of would be fair,just and reasonable.the board found,inter alia 
the cpi had increased percent since the last rent increase.a percent increase in the base rent would result in an average increase of per space,per month.
the rents at carson gardens were below one of the comparable mobilehome parks,and below the other comparable park,or below the average for the two parks.
as for changes in reasonable operating and maintenance expenses,the board calculated operating cost increases without taking into account the increase in the park owner debt service.the board found 
the prior owner of the park did not have any mortgage obligation in,the interest payments on the owners mortgage were per month per mobilehome space.the board finds that it would be more consistent with the intent of this ordinance and prevailing judicial fair return doctrine to provide for an increase in net operating income which reflects the inflation which occurred during this period.
under a gross profits maintenance analysis,carson gardens would be entitled to a rent increase of the board pointed out,however,that under the guidelines a gross profits maintenance analysis may be considered,but is not intended to create any entitlement to any particular rent increase,and under the guidelines debt service to purchase a park may be an allowable operating expense.
a based on the amount of the mortgage interest cost increase would not be reasonable.allowing a of the debt service increase would result in an overall rent increase of percent,far above the increase between the cpi between the base year and the current year.such an increase would create a windfall for the current park owner based on the fact that the prior park owner did not have a mortgage.
a rent increase of would be fair,just,reasonable and consistent with the intent of the carson ordinance,considering that 
the relevant increase in the cpi would justify an increase of 
an increase of would raise the rent to the level of comparable parks and 
an increase of under the mnoi standard would meet constitutional fair return standards.
trial court proceedings.
carson gardens sought further enforcement of the trial court april,judgment.specifically,carson gardens requested an order directing the board to grant a rent increase of requiring the board to grant an additional increase to compensate it for income lost based on the wrongful denial of a rent increase as of august and imposing a civil fine of upon each of the respondents who knowingly and willfully disregarded the judgment and writ 
the trial court declared the board resolution authorizing a rent increase null and void,and granted carson gardens a rent increase of retroactive to august.the trial court stated,inter alia 
the court issued the april,writ based on its conclusion that 
the board had historically acted to account for and was required by its own process to utilize a methodology for reviewing discretionary rent increase applications which gives due consideration to the park actual reasonable operating expenses,including any financing costs associated with ownership and acquisition of a park.
the board resolution was not in compliance with the april,judgment or writ in that it fails to consider all of the park actual reasonable operating expenses and,in particular,adopted,for the first time,a maintenance of net operating income methodology because that methodology would allow the board to exclude financing costs as an operating expense.
no evidence was presented by the board of an alternative methodology which would comply with the requirements of the writ.
i t is plain from the record that the methodology utilized to adopt resolution was chosen for the purpose of deleting certain costs from the process.
the board was required to either adopt the gross profits maintenance methodology or such other methodology as would actually comply with the judgment and writ.
based on the board own calculations,the proper application of the gross profits maintenance methodology mandates a rent increase of per space,per month.
at the hearing,the court repeatedly expressed reservations about the size of the increase.thus 
you know,i would have hoped that the city could have come up with or could have applied the method in a way where they maybe do have to allow the whole.that is a huge increase,and that may or may not be necessary for the fair return on investment.but i really ca tell at this point because the city did not use that approach at all.maybe allowing fifty percent of that would amount to a fair return.but i ca tell because the city did not use that method.
i just would have liked to have seen this thing resolved in some kind of reasonable way without the increase unless it is shown that that is,indeed,a fair return,and i have really no way of telling here on this record something.but what i have does not comply with what the court ordered.
i do have a problem with the plus everything else that you want,given that there ca tell that that needed for a fair return.
i f the board had used that method gross profits maintenance and would have come to some conclusion that not all of it would be passed because it is too excessive and fifty percent would be fair to add,that one thing.but that not what was done here.i not going to send it back a second time.i think it is time we need an appellate ruling here.
the trial court order granting a increase,styled judgment on motion for supplemental writ,was entered december,and the board filed this appeal.
on may,this court denied a motion by carson gardens to dismiss the appeal,ruling that the order of december,was appealable,but that the board had waived any right to raise any issues arising out of the april,judgment.
discussion 
if we were writing on the proverbial clean slate,our analysis of the propriety of the trial court order would first require an assessment of a fundamental,controlling issue the meaning of the carson ordinance,including whether carson gardens was entitled to rely on the board use of gross profits maintenance methodology in determining a fair return.if the trial court correctly determined that the carson ordinance required,or created a reasonable expectation of,the use of gross profits maintenance methodology,then this court would affirm the trial court order,because the board did not do so,and did not comply with the trial court order to do so.on the other hand,if the ordinance does not require use of that methodology,and does not require the board to include debt service costs in operating expenses,then the board was free to use some other method of determining the amount of a rent increase that would provide a fair return.see carson mobilehome park owners city of carson cal d,rent control agencies are not obliged by the state or federal constitution to fix rents by application of any particular method or formula.
we are not,however,writing on a clean slate.as our own order denying carson gardens motion to dis
