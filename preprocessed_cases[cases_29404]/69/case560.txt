eight african american employees of kansas city southern railway company kcsr,or kcs sued the company in district court for creating an environment hostile to race.a jury found the company liable and awarded no compensatory damages,but awarded each plaintiff in punitive damages.the district court entered judgment on the verdict,adding in nominal damages.kcsr timely appealed.
this is a discrimination case under title vii of the civil rights act of,et and.eight plaintiffs,employees of kcsr,alleged that kcsr subjected them to a hostile work environment.plaintiffs alleged that they encountered repeated instances of racially derogatory acts in kcsr diesel shop in shreveport,louisiana,including,inter alia,a wire hanging near the workshop that allegedly had been bent to form the shape of a noose racial graffiti on the workshop walls racially derogatory comments and threats,both spoken and written and transfers to unwanted night and weekend shifts when employees objected to these comments and to other racially motivated activity.
a first trial ended in a mistrial when the jury failed to reach a verdict.at the second trial,a jury found that defendant had created a hostile work environment and failed to show by a preponderance of the evidence that it had corrected the racially derogatory behavior.it awarded no compensatory damages but awarded in punitive damages to each plaintiff.the district court judgment incorporated the jury award and additionally awarded each plaintiff in nominal damages.the court denied defendant motion for judgment as a matter of law and alternative motion for new trial.
we are urged to upset the judgment entered upon the jury verdict of punitive damages awarded under title vii and because there was no award of compensatory damages.we will turn to this contention,but there is a potentially dispositive and hence antecedent there was a constitutional which case a sole award of punitive damages is permissible if there was no constitutional violation the question becomes more difficult.if we conclude that the punitive damages need not be accompanied by an award of compensatory damages,we must determine whether the amount awarded denies kcsr the due process secured by the fourteenth amendment.
we review the district court ruling on a motion for judgment as a matter of law de novo and a denial of a motion for new trial for an abuse of discretion 
the jury was asked,do you find by a preponderance of evidence that plaintiff was subjected to a hostile working environment as defined in instruction number the jury answered yes for each plaintiff.the jury answered no to the question,do you find by a preponderance of evidence that kcs exercised reasonable care to prevent and promptly correct any racially harassing behavior the court instructed the jury,in relevant part 
it is unlawful for an employer to discriminate against an employee because of the employee race.racial discrimination includes harassment based upon race.in order for kcs to be found liable,the conduct complained of must have been sufficiently severe or pervasive to alter the terms or conditions of that plaintiff employment and to have created a hostile or abusive work environment a hostile work environment claim may consist of a series of separate acts that collectively constitute one unlawful employment practice.
the court did not instruct the jury to address whether a constitutional violation occurred.
the supreme court has held that congress has been given the unique constitutional power of legislating to enforce the provisions of the thirteenth,fourteenth,and fifteenth amendments and that congress enactment of pursuant to its powers under the thirteenth amendment provides to all persons a federal remedy for racial discrimination in private employment.this power arises because section of the thirteenth amendment,which abolished slavery,provides that congress shall have power to enforce this article by appropriate legislation.furthermore,we have found that title vii legislation is supportable under the enabling clause of the thirteenth amendment to the same extent that,as the first justice harlan said,the civil rights act of is supported by the thirteenth amendment.
a constitutional grant of power to congress in enacting a statute does not require that a statute directly incorporate a constitutional principle.we have distinguished between constitutional and statutory claims in cases where plaintiffs bring their claims under and the thirteenth amendment similarly,the eleventh circuit has specifically defined some title vii claims as involving a violation of purely statutory rights,and the supreme court has found that a plaintiff bringing a title vii claim without an accompanying claim under the constitution does not advance a constitutional claim.although and title vii more generally arise from the powers granted to congress by the thirteenth amendment and embody its principles,the jury finding pursuant to these statutes and its instructions do not sum to a finding of a constitutional wrong.so we must decide whether the punitive damages award coupled with the district judge grant of in nominal damages can stand alone.
leblanc observed that a lthough the goal of a federal common law of damages is to produce uniform results,so far the federal judiciary has not succeeded in this endeavor.we further recognized our own mixed case law on the issue but attempted to add clarity by concluding that generally,we only allow independent awards of punitive damages upon a finding of a constitutional violation by a defendant here,however,we recognize another class of cases not fully addressed in those involving statutes with caps on punitive damages 
we have upheld jury awards of punitive damages without a finding of a constitutional violation or accompanying compensatory damages,while skirting the underlying constitutional question of whether such awards are permissible.in lewis parish of terrebonne we affirmed a jury verdict for punitive damages of funeral costs without compensatory damages but remanded the case for the district court to make a finding regarding compensatory damages similarly,in dunn denk an excessive force case,we permitted a jury award of punitive damages accompanied by a district court award of in nominal damages but also granted a partial new trial,wherein compensatory damages would potentially be awarded in du pont de nemours we addressed the first impression issue of whether punitive damages awarded without compensatory damages under were permissible and concluded that they were in that case,however,we affirmed a jury award of backpay damages in addition to punitive damages for title vii cases not involving backpay,frontpay,or compensatory damages,our district courts have upheld lone punitive damages awards,accompanied by nominal damages of.these courts have relied on our leblanc case finding that there is no established federal common law rule that precludes the award of punitive damages in the absence of an award of compensatory damages and on the holding in carey piphus that under,even absent a showing of actual injury a plaintiff may receive nominal damages,awarded by the judge,not to exceed one dollar.
other circuits have explicitly upheld punitive damages awards without an accompanying award of compensatory damages or backpay in title vii cases in so doing,these circuits have found that i n title vii cases the statutory maxima capping punitive damage awards strongly undermine the concerns that underlie the reluctance to award punitive damages without proof of actual harm.additionally,our sister circuits have relied on a textual reading of title vii,finding that nothing in the plain language of conditions an award of punitive damages on an underlying award of compensatory damages requirements for recovery should not be invented.furthermore,the first and third circuits,similar to the supreme court decision in carey,have approved the award of nominal damages under where deprivations of constitutional rights are not shown to have caused actual injury.although in leblanc we have,unlike other circuits,expressly disallowed an award of punitive damages without accompanying compensatory damages we have since emphasized that our determination in leblanc was limited to the context of damages awarded under the fair housing act we have also emphasized that our holding in leblanc does not cover all civil rights cases in this circuit.at least one other circuit,however,has denied jury awards of punitive damages without accompanying compensatory or nominal damages under title vii and 
we agree with the conclusion of several of our sister circuits that a punitive damages award under title vii and need not be accompanied by compensatory damages.we base our holding on the language of the statute,its provision of a cap,and the purpose of punitive damages under title vii.
unlike the fair housing act,which as a matter of the federal common law we have read to require that actual damages accompany an award of punitive damages title vii specifically provides for punitive damages and for a cap on these damages.a states,in an action brought by a complaining party under section or of the civil rights act of against a respondent who engaged in unlawful intentional discrimination prohibited under section,or of the act the complaining party may recover compensatory and punitive damages as allowed in subsection b,in addition to any relief authorized by section g of the civil rights act of from the respondent,while b provides 
a complaining party may recover punitive damages under this section against a respondent other than a government,government agency or political subdivision if the complaining party demonstrates that the respondent engaged in a discriminatory practice or discriminatory practices with malice or with reckless indifference to the federally protected rights of an aggrieved individual the sum of the amount of compensatory damages awarded under this section for future pecuniary losses,emotional pain,suffering,inconvenience,mental anguish,loss of enjoyment of life,and other nonpecuniary losses,and the amount of punitive damages awarded under this section,shall not exceed,for each complaining party,depending on the number of employees that work for respondent.
that congress anticipated the award of punitive damages under title vii,as it clearly did,does not alone answer the question of how much of the federal common law of punitive damages came into the statutory,whether congress anticipated whether an award must be accompanied by actual damages.
title vii plain language points to congressional acceptance of independent awards of punitive damages in title vii actions.it contains a clause determination of punitive damages providing,a complaining party may recover punitive damages under this section against a respondent if that party proves certain discrimination with malice or with reckless indifference to federal rights n othing in the text of the statute limits an award of punitive damages to cases in which the plaintiff also receives compensatory damages.c states,if a complaining party seeks compensatory or punitive damages under this section any party may demand a trial by jury and the court shall not inform the jury of the limitations described in subsection b.
legislative history provides additional guidance but does not clarify congressional purpose regarding the necessity of compensatory damages attending punitive damages.it shows that congress intended to increase the remedies available to complainants in title vii cases in its effort to prevent discrimination in the workplace.senate bill enacted as the civil rights act of,was enacted,inter alia,to amend the civil rights act of to strengthen and improve federal civil rights laws and to provide for damages in cases of intentional employment discrimination congress found that additional remedies under federal law are needed to deter unlawful harassment and intentional discrimination in the workplace and that a recent supreme court decision had weakened the strength of the act,thus requiring legislation to provide additional protections against unlawful discrimination in employment.in senate floor debate over the bill,senator kennedy argued,
the act provides meaningful remedies,granting victims of intentional sex and religious discrimination the right to recover compensatory damages,and,in particularly sic,flagrant cases,punitive damages as well.this is the same remedy already available under section of the civil rights act of to victims of intentional racial discrimination 
perhaps by the as well language senator kennedy anticipated that punitive damages were only to be awarded in addition to compensatory damages.perhaps he contemplated that punitive damages are available as an alternative to compensatory damages in the most egregious of cases.but perhaps offers little assistance when we must choose one 
in sum,the text of title vii,as amended in,and its history demonstrate that congress did not require actual damages to accompany punitive damages in title vii actions.but the text does not show whether congress anticipated that punitive damages would be awarded independently.unable to glean further guidance on this issue from the statutory language,we look to the common law.
as we have explained,disallowing independent awards of punitive damages responds to concern that jury consideration of punitive damages ought not to be unbounded nor lack of measured proportion to the injury.unbounded awards ill serve the statute deterrent purpose yet,a measure of discretion is essential to this tailoring.indeed,the federal common law recognizes the importance of jury discretion to award punitive damages the tension is that jury unlimited judicial discretion for that the fixing of punitive damages may invite extreme results that jar one constitutional sensibilities.with similar concern,when looking to state tort law we have found,for example,
texas courts will overturn an award of damages that is so excessive as to be manifestly unjust.to prevent an excessive award of punitive damages,texas courts require punitive damages to be reasonably proportioned to actual damages.this proportionality requirement is simply a tool to help texas courts determine when an exemplary damage award is the product of the jury passion rather than its reason 
here the statute offers assistance.congress has set a cap on the sum of compensatory and punitive damages.that cap cabins discretion in the amount of the award in the most direct manner caps the award.the claims under title vii and here are virtually the same.while the verdict forms did not disclose which statute formed the basis of the jury finding of liability,the district court instructed the jury regarding punitive damages pursuant to the language of title vii.the instruction allowed the jury to award punitive damages,if that plaintiff has proved that kcs acted with malice or willfulness or with callous and reckless indifference to the rights of the plaintiffs to be free from discrimination based upon race.this closely tracks requirement that the complaining party demonstrate that the respondent engaged in a discriminatory practice or discriminatory practices with malice or with reckless indifference to the federally protected rights of an aggrieved individual.the court also properly instructed the jury regarding agency principles required for a finding of vicarious punitive damages under title vii stating,ksc is only liable for punitive damages in this case if the acts of harassment were committed by a supervisory employee with immediate,or successively higher authority over the plaintiff,and that conduct was contrary to kcs good faith effort to comply with the law.
the grounding of punitive damages between the high threshold of culpability for an award and a cap of the amount in any event upholds congress purpose in enacting the amendments to title provide additional remedies,in the form of damages,to prevent discrimination in the workplace while mitigating the risk of disproportionate awards injury that results from discrimination under title vii is often difficult to quantify in physical terms preventing juries from awarding punitive damages when an employer engaged in reprehensible discrimination without inflicting easily quantifiable physical and monetary harm would quell the deterrence that congress intended in the most egregious discrimination cases under title vii.indeed,
there is some unseemliness for a defendant who engages in malicious or reckless violations of legal duty to escape either the punitive or deterrent goal of punitive damages merely because either good fortune or a plaintiff unusual strength or resilience protected the plaintiff from suffering harm 
kcsr argues that the jury award of punitive damages violates due process and fails to withstand the supreme court test in bmw of north america for determining the constitutionality of punitive damages awards.kcsr,in its renewed motion for judgment as a matter of law and alternative motion for a new trial,similarly argued that the punitive damage award is unreasonable,unconstitutional,and grossly excessive because the district court denied this motion,we presume that in so doing,it implicitly found the award to be constitutional,thus requiring us to review de novo the court decision 
as we see it,the combination of the statutory cap and high threshold of culpability for any award confines the amount of the award to a level tolerated by due process.given that congress has effectively set the tolerable proportion,the gore analysis is relevant only if the statutory cap itself offends due process.it does not and,as we have found in punitive damages cases with accompanying nominal damages,a inquiry becomes irrelevant accepting this analysis makes the sufficiency of evidence to support the statutory threshold a determinant of constitutional validity.we turn to that task.
here,plaintiffs,supervisors,and other witnesses testified to incidents of racially discriminatory behavior that occurred within the time frame of evidence permitted by the court elgie abner testified about picking up a toolbox on which someone had written,you lazy ni s and that,when he presented the box to a supervisor,the supervisor laughed.he also testified that a cement pillar in the workshop contained a large marking of kkk for a number of years,as did the fuel tanks and roofs of many locomotives in the shop,and that in may of,abner is a lazy racist was written on the walls in the bathroom of the workshop.ni r go home and lazy ni s were also written on the walls.harry brooks testified that foreman gary moore would,on the night shift,wait until a large thunderstorm came and then,laughing,send the workers out in the storm he also testified that an electrical wire in the form of a noose was hanging outside of the workshop,that there was graffiti in the workshop bathrooms that said,ni s stink and ni s go home,and that supervisors knew of the graffiti and the noose.napoleon player testified that a supervisor called him boy in and that gary moore referred to him as a ethiopian and said that he was going to run two black a es off.in,moore also allegedly referred to napoleon player shift as the c n shift.napoleon player also testified that he did not recall receiving any racial harassment training prior to retiring in june of.odom similarly testified that the first racial harassment policy i got was if i not mistaken,august.donald harville testified that a company surgeon told him,when he arrived late for work in november of,that it for you and your ni buddies.this and other evidence supports the jury conclusion that kcsr supervisors caused failed to properly respond to numerous instances of racially derogatory behavior in the workplace.
looking to our awards of punitive damages in similar cases involving discrimination is also instructive in this case.where punitive damages of were awarded in a racial discrimination case under the fair housing act,we reduced the damages to the statutory maximum penalty allowed under the fair housing act for a first time offense looking to a quantity most closely analogous to a cap under the fha.in an american with disabilities act case,where a jury awarded equitable wage loss but no compensatory damages and awarded million in punitive damages,which the district judge reduced to pursuant to the title vii cap,we upheld the award we similarly refuse to strike down the jury award here,as it fell well below the cap,and there is no indication that it resulted from jury bias or insufficient evidence of malice.
with respect to the district court award of nominal damages of to each plaintiff,we find such formalities to be unnecessary.we have required a district court to grant a plaintiff in nominal damages when her constitutional rights were violated other circuits,however,have found that a jury verdict of liability under title vii did not require a court to award a nominal damages award in the absence of a request that the jury determine nominal damages or a request for additur by the judge because the award of actual or punitive damages is capped under title vii,we do not require a ceremonial anchor of nominal damages to tie to a punitive damages award.
we therefore uphold the district court judgment granting in punitive damages to each plaintiff.
defendant asserts that the district court erred in adopting a rule,which permitted the plaintiffs to testify about incidents contributing to a hostile workplace as far back as ten years.defendant argues that plaintiffs failed to establish evidence of a continuing violation,and that the court allowance of evidence that reached beyond the statutory period violated the rules in national railroad passenger and celestine petroleos de venezuella sa kcsr further asserts that the district court allowed plaintiffs to testify outside of the permitted window.neither the court imposition of the period,nor the court admission of plaintiffs testimony outside of the period,caused prejudicial error.
a hostile work environment claim necessarily involves the cumulative e ffect of individual acts,and evidence presented in support of these claims may fall outside of the statutory period.for example,the supreme court has found,for hostile work environment claims under in the context of timely filing,
it does not matter,for purposes of the statute title vii,that some of the component acts of the hostile work environment fall outside the statutory time period.provided that an act contributing to the claim occurs within the filing period,the entire time period of the hostile environment may be considered by a court for the purposes of determining liability 
moreover,the supreme court has emphasized that hostile work environment claims are different in kind from discrete acts.their very nature involves repeated conduct.the unlawful employment practice therefore can not be said to occur on any particular day.it occurs over a series of days or perhaps years although in morgan the court recognized that its findings did not allow admission of discrete evidence the court has also recognized that courts may waive or equitably toll a statute of limitations,as well as other requirements under title vii 
the district court allowed plaintiffs to testify within an approximate window of conduct,finding that plaintiffs could reach beyond the limitations period to for t hose acts contributing to the alleged hostile work environment.defendant argues that plaintiffs failed to follow this limitation because they did not identify with any specificity the time period in which they allegedly witnessed graffiti and testified similarly with regard to having heard racially derogatory language in their workplace and having seen what they believed to be nooses in and around the diesel shop plaintiffs sat back and relied on their general testimony.
the court sustained defendant objections when plaintiffs attempted to present testimony outside of the designated time frame furthermore,the court allowance of testimony regarding events that occurred at an unspecified time within the period,and some events that occurred during a specific year within that period,by no means placed the events outside of that time frame.nor was any lack of individualized assessment as to each event relation to the hostile work environment clearly erroneous.much of the evidence presented from within the period related directly to the
