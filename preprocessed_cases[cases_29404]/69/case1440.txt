colin thomas thomas appeals the district court grant of summary judgment against his claim that attorney charles michael hartz and the law firm,george,hartz,lundeen,fulmer,johnstone,king and stevens,collectively,hartz violated the driver privacy protection act dppa by wrongfully obtaining and using personal information contained in driver license records.we affirm.
background 
on march,hartz purchased from the florida department of highway safety and motor vehicles the registration information of all individuals in county who registered both new and used motor vehicles from january,through march.on november,hartz purchased the same information for the period april,through november.in total,hartz accumulated driving records of florida residents.since thomas had purchased and registered a chevrolet impala in june,his name and address was included in the information obtained by hartz.thomas brought suit under the dppa seeking in statutory liquidated damages equitable relief for the destruction of illegally obtained records and certification of a class of consumers.
ii.discussion 
thomas challenges two orders of the district court the grant of summary judgment in favor of hartz and the denial of thomas motion to compel the production of discovery.
a.the district court summary judgment order 
we review the district court grant of summary judgment de novo.holloman,cir.
the dppa regulates the disclosure of personal information contained in the records of state motor vehicle departments dmvs.reno condon,d.one section of the dppa prohibits disclosures of personal information by a state department of motor vehicles and any officer,employee,or contractor thereof,see a,while a separate section provides a private cause of action against persons who knowingly obtain,disclose,or use personal information from a motor vehicle record,see a.
despite these prohibitions,congress made clear that not all obtainment,disclosure,or use of personal information from motor vehicle records is wrongful.in b,the dppa provides fourteen permissible uses,one of which allows for the information to be used in connection with investigation in anticipation of litigation hereafter,the litigation clause 
for use in connection with any civil,criminal,administrative,or arbitral proceeding in any federal,state,or local court or agency or before any body,including the service of process,investigation in anticipation of litigation,and the execution or enforcement of judgments and orders,or pursuant to an order of a federal,state,or local court.
b emphasis added.
hartz asserted below that it obtained and used the vehicle records for the purpose of identifying potential witnesses to testify in lawsuits against automobile dealerships.at summary judgment,the district court held that thomas failed to raise an issue of material fact as to the inapplicability of the litigation clause and failed to raise sufficient evidence as to any alleged impermissible obtainment or use.thomas contends that the court erroneously placed the burden on thomas to show a purpose not permitted under a and improperly weighed the summary judgment evidence.as set forth below,neither of these arguments has merit.
burden of proof under a 
thomas asserts that the litigation clause in b constitutes an affirmative defense for which the defendant carries the burden of proof.whether the permissible uses listed in b constitute affirmative defenses for which defendants carry the burden of proof is a matter of first impression for this circuit and has not been addressed by our sister circuits.
the touchstone for determining the burden of proof under a statutory cause of action is the statute itself.schaffer weast,d.when a statute is silent as to who bears the burden of proof,we resort to the ordinary default rule that plaintiffs bear the risk of failing to prove their claims.id.
the ordinary default rule,however,admits of exceptions.id.at.at.one such exception is that certain elements of a plaintiff claim may be shifted to defendants,when such elements can fairly be characterized as affirmative defenses or exemptions.accord fed.trade comm morton salt.t he general rule of statutory construction that the burden of proving justification or exemption under a special exception to the prohibitions of a statute generally rests on one who claims its benefits,requires that respondent undertake this proof internal footnote omitted.
another exception is that courts will not place the burden upon a litigant of establishing facts peculiarly within the knowledge of his adversary.schaffer,at.at internal quotation marks omitted.this exception,however,is far from being universal,and has many qualifications upon its application.id.internal quotation marks omitted.
while there have been some circumstances where the supreme court has placed the burden of persuasion over an entire claim on the defendant at the outset of a proceeding,see id.at.at citing alaska dep t of envtl.conservation epa,d,such instances are extremely rare.at.
in examining the statute,we first turn to the dppa provision for a civil cause of action 
a who knowingly obtains,discloses or uses personal information,from a motor vehicle record,for a purpose not permitted under this chapter shall be liable to the individual to whom the information pertains,who may bring a civil action in a united states district court.
in a straightforward fashion,section a sets forth three elements giving rise to liability,that a defendant knowingly obtained,disclosed or used personal information,from a motor vehicle record,for a purpose not permitted.the plain meaning of the third factor is that it is only satisfied if shown that obtainment,disclosure,or use was not for a purpose enumerated under b.section b provides in full 
b permissible information referred to in subsection a shall be disclosed for use in connection with matters of motor vehicle or driver safety and theft,motor vehicle emissions,motor vehicle product alterations,recalls,or advisories,performance monitoring of motor vehicles and dealers by motor vehicle manufacturers,and removal of records from the original owner records of motor vehicle manufacturers to carry out the purposes of titles i and iv of the anti car theft act of,the automobile information disclosure act et,the clean air act et,and chapters,and of title,and,subject to subsection a,may be disclosed as follows 
for use by any government agency,including any court or law enforcement agency,in carrying out its functions,or any private person or entity acting on behalf of a federal,state,or local agency in carrying out its functions.
for use in connection with matters of motor vehicle or driver safety and theft motor vehicle emissions motor vehicle product alterations,recalls,or advisories performance monitoring of motor vehicles,motor vehicle parts and dealers motor vehicle market research activities,including survey research and removal of records from the original owner records of motor vehicle manufacturers.
for use in the normal course of business by a legitimate business or its agents,employees,or contractors,but only 
a to verify the accuracy of personal information submitted by the individual to the business or its agents,employees,or contractors and 
b if such information as so submitted is not correct or is no longer correct,to obtain the correct information,but only for the purposes of preventing fraud by,pursuing legal remedies against,or recovering on a debt or security interest against,the individual.
for use in connection with any civil,criminal,administrative,or arbitral proceeding in any federal,state,or local court or agency or before any body,including the service of process,investigation in anticipation of litigation,and the execution or enforcement of judgments and orders,or pursuant to an order of a federal,state,or local court.
for use in research activities,and for use in producing statistical reports,so long as the personal information is not published,redisclosed,or used to contact individuals.
for use by any insurer or insurance support organization,or by a entity,or its agents,employees,or contractors,in connection with claims investigation activities,antifraud activities,rating or underwriting.
for use in providing notice to the owners of towed or impounded vehicles.
for use by any licensed private investigative agency or licensed security service for any purpose permitted under this subsection.
for use by an employer or its agent or insurer to obtain or verify information relating to a holder of a commercial driver license that is required under chapter of title.
for use in connection with the operation of private toll transportation facilities.
for any other use in response to requests for individual motor vehicle records if the state has obtained the express consent of the person to whom such personal information pertains.
for bulk distribution for surveys,marketing or solicitations if the state has obtained the express consent of the person to whom such personal information pertains.
for use by any requester,if the requester demonstrates it has obtained the written consent of the individual to whom the information pertains.
for any other use specifically authorized under the law of the state that holds the record,if such use is related to the operation of a motor vehicle or public safety.
in reading a and b together,we conclude that the dppa is silent on which party carries the burden of proof and,as such,the burden is properly upon the plaintiff.thomas argues that the permissible uses listed in b function as statutory exceptions and,therefore,the defendants should carry the burden of proof to secure entitlement of such exceptions.
we disagree.the dppa plainly sets forth three elements giving rise to liability,the third of which is whether the subject act was for a purpose not permitted.a emphasis added.the emphasized language does not frame the b enumerations as exceptions to a general norm.that is,congress could have said,for example a person who knowingly obtains,discloses,or uses personal information,from a motor vehicle record,shall be liable to the individual to whom the information pertains,except as provided in b.but congress did not so draft a,and if we read it as such,we place the burden of proving a b enumeration upon the defendant when congress has not instructed us to do so.just as we will not write words into a statute to provide a different,or more preferable meaning,see,badaracco comm r of internal revenue,d courts are not authorized to rewrite a statute because they might deem its effects susceptible of improvement,so,too,will we not alter statutory structure and language for the purpose of triggering application of a rule of construction.see dorelien att y,cir en banc our role is not to congress drafting choices.rather,our function is to apply statutes,to carry out the expression of the legislative will that is embodied in them,not to improve statutes by altering them.internal quotation marks and alterations omitted.
congress is adept at drafting general norms that provide for exceptions,and frequently does so indeed,it did just this with the dppa in a in both subparts of a,congress explicitly excepted the b enumerations 
a in state department of motor vehicles,and any officer,employee,or contractor thereof,shall not knowingly disclose or otherwise make available to any person or entity 
personal information,as defined in,about any individual obtained by the department in connection with a motor vehicle record,except as provided in subsection b of this section or 
highly restricted personal information,as defined in,about any individual obtained by the department in connection with a motor vehicle record,without the express consent of the person to whom such information applies,except uses permitted in subsections b,b,b,and b provided,that subsection a shall not in any way affect the use of organ donation information on an individual driver license or affect the administration of organ donation initiatives in the states.
a emphasis added.
section a plainly sets up the enumerations in b as exceptions,whereas a plainly does not.we do not believe that this difference in language is meaningless.see russello united states,d w here congress includes particular language in one section of a statute but omits it in another section of the same act,it is generally presumed that congress acts intentionally and purposely in the disparate inclusion or exclusion.internal quotation marks omitted 
thomas also argues that the burden to show for a purpose not permitted should be allocated to defendants because the factual presence of any one permissible purpose in b is peculiarly within the knowledge of the defendant.schaffer,at.at internal quotation marks omitted.from the outset,we recognize that the supreme court is cautious in its application of this rule.id.stating that the rule is far from being universal and has many qualifications upon its application.quoting greenleaf lessee birth,pet.citing strong,mccormick on evidence,ed.very often one must plead and prove matters as to which his adversary has superior access to the proof.we have previously applied this rule where a plaintiff would be unreasonably required to speculate whether defendants intend to assert a statutory defense and could result in unfair surprise at trial.jackson seaboard coast line,cir.in this instance,we are unconvinced that facts giving rise the b enumerations are so peculiarly within the knowledge of the defendant as to cause a shifting of the burden of proof.
many of the b enumerations are tied to a particular occupation or organization and its corresponding lawful need for the information.see b government agency b legal investigation,service,proceedings,and enforcement b researchers b insurance b towed or impounded vehicle b private investigative agency or security service b private toll transportation facilities.other b enumerations point to a particularized purpose.see b safety,theft,emissions,product alteration,performance monitoring,parts and dealers,research,updating of records b verification of individual submission of information b employer verification of employee information b state authorized use related to operation of vehicle or public safety.finally,the remaining three enumerations only apply when the plaintiff has provided consent.see b.
thus,for example,if a plaintiff names a law firm as here or an insurance agency as the defendant,there is a high probability that subsection b is at issue in the former and b in the latter.similarly,if a plaintiff is a recipient of a mass marketing letter,it is no secret that b is at issue,which allows for bulk distribution of solicitations only if express consent is obtained.upon close examination of b,we conclude that plaintiffs will not typically be left in the dark as to which b enumeration,if any,will be asserted as applicable by the defendant.we are confident that proper use of discovery tools,such as interrogatories,requests for admissions,and depositions,will reveal which enumerations may apply and where a plaintiff must accordingly aim its argument.
in the end,where congress does not squarely address the question,where the statute structure and language do not suggest a shift of the burden to the defendant through use of statutory exceptions,for example,and where plaintiffs are not peculiarly at a disadvantage in the discovery of necessary facts,we will not shift the burden or proof,or any element thereof,to the defendant.
whether the district court improperly weighed the summary judgment evidence 
upon hartz motion for summary judgment,the district court recognized the evidence showing that obtainment of the information was for the purpose of hartz investigation in anticipation of litigation.at.specifically,in his affidavit,charles michael hartz averred that he requested the information because the automobile dealers he was litigating against were asserting that plaintiffs needed to plead and prove multiple acts of deceptive and unfair trade practices to state a deceptive and unfair trade practice claim under florida law.at appx.b.thomas does not contend that this was a meritless or even mistaken view of the law at the time the court next recognized that the deposition testimony submitted by hartz showed that the information was used
