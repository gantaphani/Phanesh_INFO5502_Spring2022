an american airlines jet aircraft,being operated as flight from worth to little rock,crashed into a approach light stanchion after touching down,broke apart,and caught fire.eleven people died and more than eighty were injured as a result of the accident.
various federal lawsuits relating to the crash were filed they were consolidated by the judicial panel on litigation and transferred to the united states district court for the eastern district of arkansas.a plaintiffs steering committee psc was appointed to be responsible for the litigation of questions of fact and law that were common to all cases.the compensatory damages claims were separated from the punitive damages claims,and the cases at issue in this appeal were tried to a jury on the issue of compensatory damages.the district court then granted american airlines motion for summary judgment dismissing the plaintiffs claims for punitive damages.see in re aircraft accident at little rock,june,d.the sole issue in this appeal is whether the district court erred in granting that motion.
we review the district court grant of summary judgment de novo.crumley city of paul,cir.we view the evidence and the inferences that may be reasonably drawn from it in a light most favorable to the psc.see lambert city of dumas,cir.summary judgment was properly granted only if the evidence was such that no reasonable jury could have found grounds for awarding punitive damages under the standard established by arkansas law.see id.at.
according to the psc,the conduct justifying punitive damages was committed by the two members of the flight crew,captain richard buschmann and first officer michael origel.while the defendant in this case is american airlines,under arkansas law a corporation is liable for punitive damages for such acts of its agents acting within the scope of their employment as would render the agents themselves liable for such damages.see miller blanton.the parties agree that captain buschmann and first officer origel were acting within the scope of their employment on the night of the crash,and the issue is thus whether the behavior of these men leading up to and resulting in the crash could justify an award of punitive damages.
because punitive damages are not a favorite of the law in arkansas,diamond shamrock phillips,internal quotations omitted,significant limits are placed on their award.as relevant here,punitive damages may be imposed only if a defendant acts with a sufficient degree of willfulness,wantonness,or conscious indifference to consequences that malice can be inferred.it is clear that negligence alone,however gross,is not sufficient to sustain a punitive damages award.see louisiana and north west willis.the arkansas supreme court has used varying language to describe the required disposition or state of mind.each party here emphasizes distinct formulations from different arkansas cases.american airlines contends that evidence of even a scintilla of care exhibited by the flight crew necessarily defeats a punitive damages claim,but the psc contends that punitive damages may be awarded even when there was not an absence of all care.
the arkansas supreme court,in const.foster,wl,recently explained the standard for determining the propriety of a punitive damages award as follows 
this court has said that an award of punitive damages is justified only where the evidence indicates that the defendant acted wantonly in causing the injury or with such a conscious indifference to the consequences that malice may be inferred.in other words,in order to superadd this element of damages by way of punishment,it must appear that the negligent party knew,or had reason to believe,that his act of negligence was about to inflict injury,and that he continued in his course with a conscious indifference to the consequences,from which malice may be inferred.in order to warrant a submission of the question of punitive damages,there must be an element of willfulness or such reckless conduct on the part of the defendant as is equivalent thereto.
citations omitted.later in the opinion,the court summarized the standard slightly differently,stating 
evidence is sufficient to support punitive damages if the party against whom such damages may be assessed,knew or ought to have known,in light of the surrounding circumstances,that the party conduct would naturally and probably result in injury and that party continued such conduct in reckless disregard of the circumstances from which malice may be inferred.
american airlines contends that one of the requirements for submitting a punitive damages claim to a jury is that the defendant acted with an absence of all care.the arkansas supreme court has indeed used this language in two cases holding that punitive damages were not justified.in national,searcy house moving,which is cited in,the arkansas supreme court,vacating an award of punitive damages,stated that a n award of punitive damages is justified only where the evidence indicates that the defendant acted wantonly in causing the injury or with such a conscious indifference to the consequences that malice may be inferred,and immediately thereafter provided the following definition of wantonness and conscious indifference to the consequences 
wantonness is essentially an attitude of mind and imparts to an act of misconduct a tortious character,such conduct as manifests a disposition of perversity.such a disposition or mental state is shown by a person,when,notwithstanding his conscious and timely knowledge of an approach to an unusual danger and of common probability of injury to others,he proceeds into the presence of danger,with indifference to consequences and with absence of all care it is not necessary to prove that the defendant deliberately intended to injure the plaintiff.it is enough if it is shown that,indifferent to consequences,the defendant intentionally acted in such a way that the natural and probable consequence of his act was injury to the plaintiff.
id.at,at emphasis added quoting ellis ferguson,internal quotations omitted.the arkansas supreme court quoted and applied this passage later the same year in alpha zeta chapter of pi kappa alpha fraternity sullivan,which held that the defendant driver of a truck was not guilty of such willful and wanton disregard for his passengers safety as to warrant a punitive damages award.
the psc contends that the discussion of an absence of all care in these two cases is aberrational,or is merely dictum or constitutes a caveat,and notes that the phrase has not been used by the arkansas supreme court since it appeared in these two cases in,and that it does not appear in arkansas model jury instructions.the psc contends that recent arkansas cases have found punitive damages to be justified despite the existence of evidence that the defendants exhibited at least some care.
it is unclear to us whether the passage appearing in national and sullivan means that the requirement in that a defendant have acted wantonly in causing the injury or with such a conscious indifference to the consequences that malice may be inferred is necessarily inconsistent with evidence that a defendant exhibited some minimal degree of care.either wantonness or conscious indifference to the consequences is sufficient to grant an award of punitive damages under the standard,but we are uncertain whether the arkansas supreme court earlier references to an absence of all care related to wantonness,conscious indifference to the consequences,both,or some other mental state that is no longer part of the punitive damages inquiry.in addition,neither national nor sullivan clarifies whether acting with an absence of all care is merely an illustrative example of the requisite disposition or whether an absence of all care is a requirement for awarding punitive damages.the language associating an absence of all care with wantonness and conscious indifference to the consequences has neither been expressly repudiated by arkansas courts nor has it appeared in the arkansas supreme court most recent discussion of the requirements for awarding punitive damages.
we assume for the sake of argument that a d
