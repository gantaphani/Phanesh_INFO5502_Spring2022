appellant tannislado alvarado alvarado filed a retaliation claim pursuant to the americans with disabilities act ada alleging that appellee cajun operating cajun retaliated against him for complaining that his manager had discriminated against him based on his disability.
alvarado challenges the district court grant of cajun motion in limine barring alvarado from seeking punitive and compensatory damages for his ada retaliation claim.alvarado also contends that the district court erred in holding that,because ada retaliation claims are limited to equitable relief,alvarado was not entitled to a jury trial on his retaliation claim.we agree with the district court resolution of these issues,and affirm the judgment.
background 
at the age of,alvarado was hired by jesus tapia tapia,the store manager of a church chicken church in tucson,arizona,to perform maintenance work.alvarado eventually became a cook at church.the cook position required the performance of various duties,including cleaning the refrigerator.
for approximately three and years,alvarado performed satisfactorily according to job evaluations from tapia and his successor,tina montague montague.that all changed when alvarado called church hotline to complain that montague had made inappropriate comments about his age.when confronted,montague denied any wrongdoing.however,three days later she gave alvarado his first performance counseling record counseling record delineating alvarado asserted failure to complete his daily duties,such as panning and rotating chicken,battering chicken,and cleaning the refrigerator.olivia martinez martinez,an assistant manager,gave alvarado two additional counseling records for similar derelictions.martinez subsequently stated that she only wrote the counseling records because montague told her to do so.according to martinez,alvarado did not deserve the counseling records.however,over the next nine months,alvarado received four more similar counseling records from assistant store manager don magel.
in response to the counseling reports,alvarado called the hotline a second time,accusing montague of retaliation against him for making the first hotline call.alvarado also complained to montague about the pain in his hands when he worked in the refrigerator.montague referred alvarado to robert johnson,who cleared alvarado to return to work the same day after noting that alvarado suffered only from arthritis,a condition common among people his age.
after alvarado was terminated,he filed a lawsuit against cajun alleging employment discrimination in violation of title i of the ada,age discrimination in violation of race and national origin discrimination in violation of and employment discrimination and retaliation claims pursuant to a and 
cajun filed a motion in limine to bar alvarado from seeking punitive and compensatory damages for his ada retaliation claim.cajun also asserted that,because only equitable relief was available,alvarado did not have a right to a jury trial on his retaliation claim.
the district court granted cajun motion in limine,concluding that the plain language of a precluded compensatory damages,punitive damages,and trial by jury.
the district court certified an interlocutory appeal on these issues,and we granted permission to appeal the district court interlocutory order.
ii.standard of review 
we review a district court decision involving interpretation of a federal statute de novo.in re digimarc.derivative,cir citation omitted.
iii.discussion 
alvarado maintains that the district court erred in interpreting the ada to limit his remedies to those available in equity.alvarado posits that remedies provided under the ada are coextensive with remedies available under the civil rights acts of and.more specifically,alvarado contends that because compensatory and punitive damages are available under the civil rights acts,compensatory and punitive damages are available for ada retaliation claims.
under the ada,a,the provision,provides 
no person shall discriminate against any individual because such individual has opposed any act or practice made unlawful by this chapter or because such individual made a charge,testified,assisted,or participated in any manner in an investigation,proceeding,or hearing under this chapter.
a.instead of delineating specific remedies available for retaliation claims,section c references the remedies and procedures available pursuant to,and.see c.in turn,references remedies provided by through.see a.
section g provides 
if the court finds that the respondent has intentionally engaged in or is intentionally engaging in an unlawful employment practice charged in the complaint,the court may enjoin the respondent from engaging in such unlawful employment practice,and order such affirmative action as may be appropriate,which may include,but is not limited to,reinstatement or hiring of employees,with or without back pay payable by the employer,employment agency,or labor organization,as the case may be,responsible for the unlawful employment practice,or any other equitable relief as the court deems appropriate.back pay liability shall not accrue from a date more than two years prior to the filing of a charge with the commission.interim earnings or amounts earnable with reasonable diligence by the person or persons discriminated against shall operate to reduce the back pay otherwise allowable.
expanded the remedies available pursuant to by providing for punitive and compensatory damages for specified disability claims.section a states 
in an action brought by a complaining party under the powers,remedies,and procedures set forth in section or of the civil rights act of or as provided in section a of the americans with disabilities act of a,and section a of title,respectively against a respondent who engaged in unlawful intentional discrimination not an employment practice that is unlawful because of its disparate impact under section of title and the regulations implementing section of title,or who violated the requirements of section of title or the regulations implementing section of title concerning the provision of a reasonable accommodation,or section of the americans with disabilities act of,or committed a violation of section b of the act,against an individual,the complaining party may recover compensatory and punitive damages as allowed in subsection b of this section,in addition to any relief authorized by section g of the civil rights act of,from the respondent.
a emphasis added.noticeably absent is any reference to,the ada retaliation provision.
although we have not resolved whether compensatory and punitive damages are available for ada retaliation claims other courts have applied divergent approaches to interpret the ada remedial provisions.in kramer banc of am,cir,cert.denied,d,the seventh circuit held that punitive and compensatory damages were not available for ada retaliation claims.the seventh circuit opined 
we thus conclude that the civil rights act does not expand the remedies available to a party bringing an ada retaliation claim against an employer and therefore compensatory and punitive damages are not available.a close reading of the plain language of a makes it clear that the statute does not contemplate compensatory and punitive damages for a retaliation claim under the ada.section a permits recovery of compensatory and punitive damages and thus expands the remedies available under g only for those claims listed therein.with respect to the ada,a only lists claims brought under or b.because claims of retaliation under the ada are not listed,compensatory and punitive damages are not available for such claims.instead,the remedies available for ada retaliation claims against an employer are limited to the remedies set forth in g.
kramer,at citation omitted.the seventh circuit,therefore,held that b ecause the plain language of a limits its application to specific claims,it is inappropriate to expand the scope of the statute in reliance on legislative history to include claims for retaliation by an employer under the ada.id.at see also david powers homes,d,faurecia exhaust,d,sabbrese lowe home,d,john
