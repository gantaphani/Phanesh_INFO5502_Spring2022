a school district terminates a construction contract when the contractor,four and a half months after the promised due date,still has not finished the project.the contractor bonding company then hires another firm to complete the project,but it suspends then later reduces the amount of bonding for the contractor.the latter successfully sues the school district for breach of contract,recovering in damages some million for potentially lost profits,which the contractor claimed it would have earned on prospective construction contracts it never won because of its impaired bonding capacity.the court of appeal concluded that those potential profits were a proper item of general damages in this action for breach of contract.we disagree.
in,the pomona unified school district district solicited bids for building improvements at vejar elementary school.the district awarded the contract to lewis jorge construction management,lewis jorge,the low bidder at.although the contract originally provided for completion in december of,heavy rains delayed work,and the parties agreed to a revised completion date of january.that date came and went,but the project remained unfinished.
the district withheld payments to lewis jorge for work completed in april and may.on june,the district terminated the contract with lewis jorge and made a demand on the contractor surety to finish the project under the performance bond the surety had provided for lewis jorge.the surety then hired another contractor to complete the school project for.that contractor completed the project between early july and.
lewis jorge sued the district,alleging it breached the contract by declaring lewis jorge in default and terminating it from the construction project.the complaint sought damages and alleged six causes of action.the first,alleging breach of contract,and the second,alleging breach of an implied warranty of sufficiency of the plans and specifications for the project,are both contractual claims naming the district as a defendant.causes of action three through nondisclosure of material facts,inducing breach of contract,and a district employee as a defendant.the sixth cause of action sought equitable indemnity against both the district and the employee for claims against lewis jorge by its surety and its unpaid subcontractors.lewis jorge did not plead as special damages the profits it claimed to have lost on future contracts.
lewis jorge,in turn,was sued by a number of its subcontractors for nonpayment of their past due bills.
at trial,lewis jorge presented evidence from its bonding agent that in june it had a bonding limit of million per project,with an aggregate limit of million for all work in progress.by,the only sureties willing to provide lewis jorge with bonding imposed a limit of million per project,with an aggregate limit of million,a reduction of its bonding capacity to the level its surety had imposed in the early.sometime in,lewis jorge ceased bidding altogether and eventually closed down.
lewis jorge sought to prove the extent of its lost future profits on unidentified construction projects,using as the relevant period the date of the district breach to the date of trial,and relying on its profitability during the four years preceding the breach.robert knudsen,a financial analyst who specialized in calculating lost profits claims,projected that lewis jorge had lost million in gross revenue for future contracts that,based on its past history,it would likely have been awarded.historically,lewis jorge had realized a profit of about percent of revenue.knudsen calculated lost profits on unidentified projects at,which discounted to present value came to.
the jury returned special verdicts in favor of lewis jorge,finding the district liable for owed on the school construction contract,of which was attributable to the district breach of warranty as to the fitness of its plans or specification the complaint second cause of action.it awarded in profits lewis jorge did not realize due to the loss or reduction of its bonding capacity.having found the district employee negligent,the jury found him and the district jointly and severally liable for.
the district and its employee appealed.lewis jorge also appealed,raising issues that are not material here and were rejected by the court of appeal.although the court of appeal reversed the judgment against the district employee,and reversed awards against the district for prejudgment interest and contractual attorney fees,it rejected the district claim that the award to lewis jorge of for potential profits on future projects was an improper component of general damages for breach of contract.the court of appeal granted the district petition for rehearing on that question after receiving additional briefing,it concluded that the lost profit damages sought by lewis jorge were in the nature of general damages,not special damages as claimed by the district.
we granted the district petition for review to resolve whether general damages for breach of a construction contract include potential profits lost on future contracts that a contractor does not win when,as a consequence of the property owner breach,the contractor surety reduces the contractor bonding capacity we later solicited and received briefing from the parties on the related issue of whether an award of lost potential profits would have been proper here as special damages.

general damages 
general damages are often characterized as those that flow directly and necessarily from a breach of contract,or that are a natural result of a breach,damages which,in the ordinary course of things,would be likely to result from breach mitchell clarke cal,general damages are those that naturally and necessarily result from breach.because general damages are a natural and necessary consequence of a contract breach,they are often said to be within the contemplation of the parties,meaning that because their occurrence is sufficiently predictable the parties at the time of contracting are deemed to have contemplated them.calamari perillo,the law of contracts ed,hunt.san lorenzo water cal,parties need not actually have contemplated the very consequence that occurred,but they would have supposed such a consequence was likely to follow a breach.
special damages 
unlike general damages,special damages are those losses that do not arise directly and inevitably from any similar breach of any similar agreement.instead,they are secondary or derivative losses arising from circumstances that are particular to the contract or to the parties.special damages are recoverable if the special or particular circumstances from which they arise were actually communicated to or known by the breaching party a subjective test or were matters of which the breaching party should have been aware at the time of contracting an objective test.mitchell clarke,supra,cal.at,witkin,summary of cal.law,supra.special damages will not be presumed from the mere breach but represent loss that occurred by reason of injuries following from the breach.mitchell clarke,supra,cal.at.special damages are among the losses that are foreseeable and proximately caused by the breach of a contract.
california follows the common law rule that an english court articulated some years ago in hadley baxendale.after hadley mill shut down because of a broken crankshaft,he entered into a contract to have a new one built.when the builder asked hadley to send him the broken shaft to use as a model,hadley took it to baxendale,a common carrier,for delivery to the builder.baxendale did not deliver until seven days later.hadley then sued baxendale for lost profits for that period.hadley lost profits,the court held,were not recoverable,because he had failed to inform the carrier that the mill would be shut down until delivery of the new shaft.id.at.because the special mill inoperability without a mill not communicated to baxendale,he did not assume the risk of compensating hadley for mill profits lost as a resulting of baxendale late delivery of the mill shaft.
hadley did not expressly distinguish between general and special damages.but such a distinction flows naturally from that case hence the rule that a party assumes the risk of special damages liability for unusual losses arising from special circumstances only if it was advised of the facts concerning special harm which might result from is not deemed to have assumed such additional risk,however,simply by entering into the contract.witkin,summary of cal.law,supra,mitchell clarke,supra,cal.at.

here,the court of appeal affirmed the jury award to lewis jorge of in general damages,based on profits lewis jorge did not earn on future unidentified contracts because its surety had reduced its bonding capacity after the district termination of the construction contract.the court of appeal concluded that such potential profits were recoverable as general damages because they followed from the breach in the ordinary course of events and were a natural and probable consequence.the court of appeal found it significant,as did the trial court,that the contract at issue,like much of lewis jorge business,was a public contract that required bonding.
the court of appeal reasoned when the contract was formed,the district knew of its own bond requirements,and it knew that public works contractors must provide bonds to secure their performance.because impaired bonding capacity has long been recognized as a direct consequence of an owner breach of a construction contract,the court of appeal concluded that the district should have known that breaching the contract and resorting to the surety to complete the project could impair lewis jorge ability to obtain bonds without which it could not bid on other public contracts.accordingly,the court of appeal held that the potential profits lewis jorge lost on contracts it did not win after the district termination of the school construction contract were general damages attributable to the district breach 
the court of appeal,however,failed to consider a threshold inquiry.if the purpose of contractual damages is to give the nonbreaching party the benefit of its contractual bargain,then the first question is what performance did the parties bargain for general damages for breach of a contract are based on the value of the performance itself,not on the value of some consequence that performance may produce.dobbs,law of remedies,supra.profits which are the direct and immediate fruits of the contract are part and parcel of the contract itself,entering into and constituting a portion of its very elements something stipulated for,the right to the enjoyment of which is just as clear and plain as to the fulfillment of any other stipulation.shoemaker acker cal.
unearned profits can sometimes be used as the measure of general damages for breach of contract.damages measured by lost profits have been upheld for breach of a construction contract when the breaching party conduct prevented the other side from undertaking performance.stark shaw d,contractor delay in building subdivision prevented roofing subcontractor from performing de flavio estell d,lost profit damages below contractor estimated profit upheld when owner repudiated contract.the profits involved in stark and de flavio,however,were purely profits unearned on the very contract that was breached.
lost profits from collateral transactions as a measure of general damages for breach of contract typically arise when the contract involves crops,goods intended for resale,or an agreement creating an exclusive sales agency.nelson reisner cal d,lessor breach of lease precluded sharecropping farmer from raising crops and realizing profit on their sale morello growers grape prod.d,disappointed purchaser of brandy who intended to bottle and resell it brunvold johnson d,termination of exclusive agent for sale of rope and twine products tahoe ice union ice cal,termination of supply contract by ice retailer grupe glick cal d,defective oil refining machines purchased for resale by exclusive agent see also brandon tibbs george kevorkian accountancy,supra,d at.where parties conceded that lost profits were the measure of damages for breach,the breach of a joint venture to expand accounting practice by acquiring an existing practice in another city supported an award of unearned profits as component of general damages for breach of contract.the likelihood of lost profits from related or derivative transactions is so obvious in these situations that the breaching party must be deemed to have contemplated them at the inception of the contract.
we are not aware of any california authority involving a construction contract that has upheld an award of general damages against a breaching owner for profits unearned on unidentified contracts the contractor did not get when its bonding was impaired as a result of the contract breach.lewis jorge,nevertheless,urges us to permit such recovery,citing a montana decision,laas.hwy.comm et al.in that case the plaintiff highway contractor,who had been in business for years and had made a profit on every construction project,claimed three years of profits lost or for projects he was unable to win when his bonding capacity was reduced after the state breached the construction contract.the montana supreme court affirmed a jury award of in lost profits.id.at.it did so without reference to the construction context,by simply applying rules for profits lost to an established business.but five years later,in zook brothers constr.state,another ca
