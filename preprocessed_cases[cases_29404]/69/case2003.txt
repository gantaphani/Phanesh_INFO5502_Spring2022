a piece of machinery fell off a dump truck while in the process of being transported as freight from one place to another.the owner,who was operating the device,was injured.we conclude that proposition,does not limit the owner right to compensation for noneconomic damages.
factual and procedural summary 
the underlying facts are essentially undisputed,although there are sharp differences in the inferences and legal conclusions to be drawn from those facts.following is a summary of what happened,as described by both sides in briefing before the trial court and this court.
the petitioner,juan garcia,owned a snorkel international snorkelift articulating telescoping boom,which all parties and we refer to as a snorkelift.the device is used to access places that are otherwise difficult to reach,such as a ceiling light bulb that is beyond reach of a ladder.it is mounted on four wheels,battery driven,and can reach a speed of four and miles per hour.it is not designed for highway use.garcia had the device at his home,in pomona,parked on the street.he advertised it for sale.robert weinberger,a principal in weinberger construction company,saw the ad and came to garcia residence to inspect it.he brought a flatbed dump truck owned by his construction company,with which he planned to haul off the snorkelift if he succeeded in buying it from garcia.apparently,weinberger liked what he saw.he and garcia agreed on a price,and weinberger and two of his employees walter moran and jose orosco tried to winch the snorkelift onto the truck.the effort failed when a winch cable broke.
the solution was to hire a truck and driver to come to the scene and assist in loading the snorkelift onto the truck.garcia telephoned gilberto molina,the owner and operator of a flatbed tow truck with a,and asked him to come to the residence with the truck.the plan was to pull the snorkelift to the level of the tow truck bed,back up the dump truck so that it articulated with the bed of the tow truck,then move the snorkelift from the tow truck onto the dump truck.weinberger had to leave on other business,so he left the tow truck operator and his employees to handle the job,with garcia help.garcia agreed to drive the snorkelift from the tow truck onto the dump truck.
orosco backed up the dump truck so that the rear of its flatbed contacted the bed of the tow truck,creating a path along which the snorkelift could be driven onto the dump truck.he then turned off the ignition and exited the dump truck.unfortunately,the brakes allegedly were not set.as garcia proceeded to drive the snorkelift from the tow truck onto the dump truck,the dump truck rolled forward,creating an opening.the snorkelift and garcia fell into this opening onto the street,to the distress of both.garcia suffered physical injury as a result,and sued weinberger and weinberger construction company the weinberger defendants,as well as the other individuals involved molina,orosco,and moran.the defendants filed answers and the issues were joined in the trial court proceedings.
garcia did not have liability insurance with respect to the snorkelift.the weinberger defendants,together with orosco and moran,filed a motion in limine to preclude garcia from claiming noneconomic damages.molina joined in the motion.the motion was based on proposition,adopted at the general election,and civil code section,which it enacted.we refer to that statute simply as section.garcia raised procedural objections to the motion and,later,substantive objections.further papers were filed by both sides.the court granted the in limine motion,ruling that the snorkelift was a motor vehicle within the meaning of the vehicle code.the court set the case for jury trial.
garcia then filed a petition with this court seeking a writ of mandate to overturn the trial court ruling that noneconomic damages are precluded by section.we issued an alternative writ,calling on real parties in interest to file opposition and affording garcia an opportunity to file a response.they have done so.we shall issue the requested writ commanding the trial court to set aside the in limine ruling.
discussion 
as pertinent to this case,section,part of the personal responsibility act of,provides 
a except as provided in subdivision c,in any action to recover damages arising out of the operation and use of a motor vehicle,a person shall not recover losses to compensate for pain,suffering,inconvenience,physical impairment,disfigurement,and other nonpecuniary damages if any of the following applies 
the injured person was the owner of a vehicle involved in the accident and the vehicle was not insured as required by the financial responsibility laws of this state.
the injured person was the operator of a vehicle involved in an accident and the operator can not establish his or her financial responsibility as required by the financial responsibility laws of this state.
b except as provided in subdivision c,an insurer shall not be liable,directly or indirectly,under a policy of liability or uninsured motorist insurance to indemnify for losses of a person injured as described in subdivision a.
subdivisions a and c are applicable to persons who are injured while operating a vehicle in violation of the drunk driving laws,and who are convicted of that crime.they are not at issue in this case.
the initiative statute utilizes the common statutory mechanism of borrowing from another statute,in this case the financial responsibility law.the latter is found in article,chapter of division of the vehicle code,beginning with section.all further code citations,other than to section,are to the vehicle code unless another is indicated.the key provision is section,which,with exceptions not germane here,requires every driver and every owner of a motor vehicle to be able to establish financial responsibility and to carry evidence of financial responsibility in the form specified in the statute.in effect,the law requires that motorists and owners of vehicles involved in accidents that are within the scope of the statute be insured or permissibly.the minimum amounts of the required coverage are specified in section.no issue is raised over these provisions the questions before us arise from the reporting requirements,into which the other provisions are tied.
the principal reporting provision is section.as pertinent here,subdivision a requires t he driver of every motor vehicle who is in any manner involved in an accident originating from the operation of a motor vehicle on any street or highway or any reportable accident,as defined in section involving property damage over,death or personal injury in any amount,to report the accident as specified in the statute.
other provisions of the vehicle code define who is a driver or owner,and what is a motor vehicle,street,highway,and vehicle.
it is not disputed that the snorkelift was uninsured and that it satisfies the definition of vehicle,since it is a device by which a person or property may be propelled or moved on a highway,and that it is a motor vehicle because it is.even though it is not designed for use on a public street or highway,and is not a device required to be registered with the department of motor vehicles,we shall assume that it is a motor vehicle for purpose of section and the financial responsibility law.the parties dispute whether the vehicle code or insurance code section governs the definition of motor vehicle for purposes of our decision,it does not matter.although the issue is disputed,we also shall assume without deciding that garcia was the owner of the snorkelift at the time of the accident.
garcia has raised a procedural issue as to whether the recovery of noneconomic damages is cognizable in an in limine motion.we see no reason why it is not.see clemens american warranty d.motion lies to exclude any kind of evidence which could be objected to at trial,either as irrelevant or subject to discretionary exclusion as unduly prejudicial see generally wegner,et,cal.practice guide civil trials and evidence the rutter group et,et and see yoshioka superior court th,d,and goodson perfect fit enterprises,th,d,in which the procedure was used in secti
