john abuan brought this employment discrimination suit under,et.title vii,and the age discrimination in employment act,et.adea against his former employer,level communications.abuan,who is of hispanic and filipino heritage and was over fifty years of age at the time of the alleged discriminatory acts,asserted that he was subjected to national origin discrimination and retaliation in violation of title vii and age discrimination in violation of the adea.the case was tried to a jury,which found in his favor and awarded back pay along with compensatory and punitive damages.on level motion,the district court reduced the back pay and damages but awarded front pay.both sides appeal.we affirm in part,reverse in part,and remand for further proceedings on the amount of front pay and appellate attorney fees.
background 
in reviewing a jury decision,we view the record in the light most favorable to the prevailing party and give that party the benefit of all reasonable inferences to be drawn from the evidence.webco,thermatool,cir.read in that light,the record reflects the following facts.
level is a telecommunications company that began operations around the time abuan commenced working there on december.abuan had previously been employed with pacific bell for over years,acquiring experience in telecommunications,strategic and practical planning,project management,and network and data center operations.he was one of the first people hired at level.he was given the position of team leader and project manager directing the development of the netexpert network management system.his compensation was determined by his band level,a classification used by the company to determine salary range,bonus percentage,and the ability to acquire stock in the company.abuan was placed in band,and his initial salary was a year.he was also eligible for a bonus of percent upon achievement of target goals and stock options that would become valuable only if level capital stock outperformed standard poor stock index.
abuan presented testimony at trial from other employees who had worked with him on the netexpert project and who had the technical ability to evaluate his performance.these witnesses testified that abuan work was exemplary,that there had never been any criticism of the project,and that the project had been implemented unusually quickly due in large part to the work of abuan.the project was scheduled for completion in september,and abuan presented evidence that all goals were met on schedule.at the end of,abuan performance was rated as completely satisfactory,resulting in a large salary increase and a percent bonus.mike jones,the company chief information officer,reviewed and praised the team work in front of the entire information technology department,describing netexpert as an exemplar in information technology.
in march,abuan was informed by rob hagens,his new supervisor,that he was being removed from his position as team leader of the netexpert project and given the lower title of individual contributor on a new and different project.abuan presented evidence that his demotion under these circumstances was unusual and possibly unique.the managers responsible for making the decision to demote and move abuan originally told him and others who questioned the decision that it was not.
witnesses testified that abuan duties on netexpert had to be divided up because no one person was able to replace him.the netexpert position was originally filled by tom hoople and jonathan mitchell,both of whom had credentials inferior to those of abuan.mitchell had previously been abuan peer and was then years of age,while hoople,who had been working under abuan,was.the workforce at level was primarily under forty.one witness stated it is a young company with a lot of kids,a lot of smart kids running around here with not a lot of senior direction.vol.ii,at.
after abuan was assigned to his new position,he was excluded from meetings at which his presence was necessary to enable him to perform his job.when he questioned his immediate supervisor,mitchell,about the situation,mitchell took his duties away from him without explanation and suggested that abuan begin looking for another job in the company.in may,hagens informed abuan that as a result of his demotion he would be rebanded,and that his salary,bonus,and stock options could be reduced.when abuan asked if the issue was his performance,hagens assured him that it was not and that he was valuable to the company.abuan subsequently discovered that while his salary remained the same,his stock options and bonus percentage had been reduced.
at this point abuan decided that if perceived problems with his performance were not the reason for his demotion and the reduction in his compensation,discrimination may have played a part in his treatment.accordingly,he first sent a memo to the human resources department on july,stating his belief that he had been treated differently and requesting that his treatment be investigated.he followed up with a memo on july asserting that he had been the victim of discrimination and requesting an investigation.abuan testified that the news of his internal discrimination complaint,which was supposed to be kept confidential by human resources personnel,was disseminated throughout the company within a week.hagens testified that he received a copy of the discrimination complaint the third week in july and also heard about it from human resources.hagens discussed the matter with a variety of individuals.they included jack waters,to whom hagens answered mitchell,who answered to hagens douglas leas,who was a peer of hagens various people in human resources dan caruso,the company vice president over abuan unit and brent bourne,who subsequently became abuan supervisor.in conversations with leas,darrell gallo of human resources,mitchell,and waters,hagens criticized the fact that abuan had filed the complaint.
abuan never received a report from human resources on the results of the investigation into his discrimination complaint.gallo,who was in charge of the investigation,testified that he spoke with level vice president van macatee,who stated that abuan performance was the reason for his removal as team leader of the netexpert project.however,gallo did not speak with any of the people whose names were provided by abuan and who were in a position to evaluate his work on the project.moreover,notes of an interview gallo had with hagens on july indicate that hagens told gallo the netexpert problems were nothing regarding john perf.aplt.add.of,doc,at.
on july,abuan received a memo directing him and other company employees to report to the provisioning department for a temporary assignment filling orders to activate service.it is undisputed that the provisioning department needed help in reducing its backlog and in bringing in the revenue generated by service activation,and that other employees with experience comparable to that of abuan were also sent to help out.abuan first supervisor in provisioning,shelli hurd,who managed abuan work for three or four weeks,testified that after the backlog problem had been remedied,she spoke to the senior director,deniece stacy,about returning abuan to his permanent position.hurd suggested he should be the first to return because he had more experience than others and was higher up in the company.stacy said no.when hurd asked why,stacy got very angry with her and said it was none of her business.hurd also told hagens that abuan should go back to his original job.stacy subsequently transferred abuan to a different manager,christi dalitz,who assigned him to filing.abuan remained in the provisioning department and was one of the last employees to be returned to his permanent position.shortly after abuan left provisioning,the contents of the file cabinets he had been filling were loaded into bags and shredded.
abuan also presented the testimony of leas,who developed a high opinion of abuan based on abuan work as the netexpert team leader.leas testified that the vice president to whom abuan originally reported as team leader,paul roberts,also had a very high opinion of abuan and the two had discussed abuan demotion.roberts,who left the company,told leas that a good part of the reason he was resigning was the unethical treatment of abuan.leas further testified that in late july,after abuan filed his discrimination charge with human resources,leas had a discussion with hagens to try to resolve the matter,requesting that abuan be assigned to work for him.leas testified that hagens was very agitated,mad,said to me that john had claimed discrimination and said,we are going to make an example of john for claiming discrimination,then he said we probably should be talking about this,so that the end of the discussion.vol.iii,at.
abuan filed a federal eeo charge of discrimination,and the company received notice of the charge on september.toward the end of september,while abuan was still in provisioning,he was assigned to report to brent bourne,the subordinate of abuan prior supervisor,mitchell.abuan returned from provisioning october.bourne had no prior exposure to abuan work and supervised him for about two months before giving abuan a performance review on december,in which bourne evaluated abuan work for the entire previous year and gave him a poor rating.bourne testified that his performance rating was based primarily on the prior quarter and reflected only input from mitchell,who had allegedly received it from the provisioning department.bourne did not discuss abuan performance with anyone in provisioning,nor did he discuss with anyone abuan work on the netexpert project.as a result of his poor rating,abuan received a smaller raise for the year,less than percent of his bonus,and reduced stock options.the rating also froze abuan employee status,preventing him from taking another job within the company.
hans zeschin,who had worked under abuan on the netexpert project,was promoted in december to a senior management position and given his own group.after learning of abuan negative evaluation,zeschin requested that abuan be moved into his group.he subsequently observed abuan work for several months and described it as same excellent work as always.superior.vol.ii,at.he further stated 
john is very much of a coach and level is very young,right,so there is a lot of young smart kids like me 
john has the ability to bring people together,consolidate ideas and lead.the architecture that he puts forth allows,you to think about the problems in a broader sense i t having someone to unify the division and architect it out and bring these different pieces together that allows us to succeed 
abuan works to resolve issues 
john is someone that very easygoing,always wants to find out what the best thing for the company.has always been about what best for level.
zeschin had occasion to evaluate abuan performance and rated him as consistently exceeding objectives.he submitted the review to his superior,mitchell,for final approval.mitchell called zeschin into his office and said he did not like the evaluation.although mitchell had not observed abuan performance or interacted with him and did not have the expertise to evaluate his work,he overrode zeschin evaluation and reduced abuan bonus and stock options by seventy percent.when zeschin told mitchell that he thought the override was inappropriate,mitchell said he would handle it.
after abuan received this performance review,a new vice president,denzel samuels,took over zeschin area.samuels reviewed abuan file and placed him in a supervisory role in disaster recovery and business continuity,the position abuan held at the time of trial.
abuan presented evidence that as a result of this course of events,he was denied several promotions and the increased compensation packages that would have gone with them.as a result,at the time of trial abuan was at a lower position and compensation level than he should have been.
the jury found in favor of abuan on his age discrimination and retaliation claims,and determined the age discrimination to be willful.it awarded abuan in back pay,in compensatory damages,and in punitive damages.in a post trial order,the district court held the jury award of in back pay to be against the weight of the evidence and remitted the amount to,remitted the liquidated damages under the adea to the same amount,and applied the cap on punitive and compensatory damages imposed by the civil rights act of,b,in the case of a defendant who,as here,has more than employees.the result was a total award of.the district court subsequently awarded abuan front pay for two years in the amount of.
on appeal,level contends the evidence was insufficient to support the finding of age discrimination,the award of liquidated damages on that claim was improper,the court committed prejudicial error in allowing the admission of a hearsay statement,the court erred in failing to give two jury instructions,abuan closing argument improperly prejudiced the jury,and the court erred in awarding front pay.level also objects to the court injunction directing level to refrain from retaliating against any witness who testified in the case.in his,abuan argues the court erred in determining that the general layoff in which abuan ultimately lost his job was not discriminatory,in concluding that abuan had rejected a job offer,and in calculating his front pay.we address each issue in turn.
sufficiency of evidence 
level contends it was entitled to judgment as a matter of law and that the evidence is legally insufficient to support the jury finding of age discrimination.in assessing whether the district court erred in denying level motion for judgment as a matter of law on this issue,we do not weigh the evidence,evaluate the credibility of witnesses,or substitute our conclusions for those of the jury.see medlock ortho biotech,cir.we may reverse a jury determination only if the evidence points but one way and is not susceptible to any reasonable inferences supporting the nonmoving party.id.
in making its argument,level focuses only on abuan demotion from team leader on the netexpert program it argues that abuan failed in his burden of proof because he was not replaced,his former responsibilities in that position were divided among existing employees,and no single person took over the duties.in support of this assertion,level cites furr seagate technology,cir,and barnes gencorp,cir.for the following reasons,we conclude these cases are inapposite because they address the particular circumstances,not present here,that arise from a company decision to institute a reduction in its workforce rif.
the supreme court made clear in reeves sanderson plumbing products,d,that a district court need not grant judgment as a matter of law in favor of the defendant when the plaintiff case consists exclusively of a prima facie case of discrimination and sufficient evidence for the trier of fact to disbelieve the defendant legitimate,nondiscriminatory explanation for its action.id.at.reeves undermines level argument that it was entitled to judgment as a matter of law.
asserting abuan failed to make a prima facie case of discrimination,level urges the insufficiency of abuan evidence requires reversal of the jury verdict.the jury,of course,does not apply the mcdonnell douglas framework in arriving at its verdict.rather,the issue before the jury is discrimination vel non.postal serv.bd.of governors aikens,d reeves,at.quoting aikens.in aikens,the supreme court explained that an appellate court determination that a plaintiff failed to establish a prima facie case is not grounds for reversing a jury verdict in the plaintiff favor.thus,even if level were correct in asserting abuan was not replaced and,as a result,can not make a prima facie case of discrimination,we would not be bound to reverse the jury finding that discrimination occurred.level would still be required to convince this court that,giving abuan the benefit of all evidentiary inferences,abuan failed to prove the ultimate issue of discrimination vel non.
we must thus assess the evidence to determine whether it was sufficient to establish that level discriminated against abuan on the basis of his age.in making this assessment,we are unpersuaded by level argument that no inference of discrimination can be made where abuan position was eliminated and its duties divided among younger employees.in the rif cases upon which level relies for this proposition,the defendant generally offers as a legitimate business reason for its action the need to eliminate the plaintiff position as part of its.see,barnes,at.the plaintiff then bears the burden of establishing that the reason given was a pretext for discrimination.ingels thiokol,cir.one way a rif plaintiff may show pretext is to present evidence that,in fact,his job was not eliminated but remained a single,distinct position.furr,at.whether a position has been eliminated is relevant to the issue of discrimination in a rif case because it bears on whether the defendant proffered justification is pretextual.
the instant case does not involve a reduction in force.level asserted throughout the district court proceedings that the only reason for its decision to demote abuan from his position as netexpert team leader was his poor performance.level did not assert that abuan position was eliminated through a workforce reduction.nor could it have done so.the evidence is undisputed that at the time of abuan demotion,level had grown from a handful of employees to about,and by the time of trial the company had grown to over.level was actively recruiting new employees during the entire period relevant to abuan claim.
abuan presented evidence that he was qualified for the position of team leader of the netexpert program,and that after he was demoted he was replaced by mitchell,who was about years of age.see.vol.ii,at.evidence also tended to show that because mitchell did not have the technical expertise required for the position,some of abuan work had to be assigned to another employee,tom hoople,who was.id.at.hoople ultimately split his functions with his younger brother.id.at.this showing is more than adequate to raise an inference that abuan demotion was discriminatory,even though his prior work was divided up among three younger workers instead of being performed by a single replacement.this record as a whole is clearly sufficient to support the jury determination that abuan demotion was the product of illegal age discrimination 
liquidated damages 
under the adea,an employee may recover liquidated damages where his or her employer violation of the statute is willful.b.level raises two challenges to the award of liquidated damages on abuan age discrimination claim.first,the company argues that because the discriminatory demotion claim fails as a matter of law,the liquidated damages stemming from this claim must likewise be reversed.in view of our determination in part ii that level is not entitled to judgment as a matter of law on this claim,we reject this contention out of hand.second,level argues that because liquidated damages are punitive in nature,they are duplicative of the punitive damages awarded to abuan on his retaliation claim under title vii.for the reasons set out below,however,this issue has become moot.
in denying level motion to reduce damages based on the alleged duplicative nature of the punitive and liquidated damages,the district court explained that title vii statutory cap on compensatory damages rendered level argument irrelevant.the jury awarded abuan dollars in compensatory damages for his title vii retaliation over the statutory cap of dollars.if the district court had agreed that the jury additional award of punitive damages under title vii were duplicative of abuan liquidated damages award under adea,it would have eliminated the title vii punitives.but abuan would still be entitled to the statutory maximum for compensatory damages under title vii,as well as back pay and liquidated damages under adea.the reduced award would thus mirror the award abuan actually received.level argument that the district court analysis renders title vii statutory cap meaningless ignores the fact that the cap applies only to the title vii award.regardless of the court disposition of level contention as to,abuan is entitled to the statutory maximum on his title vii claim for compensatory damages plus back pay and liquidated damages under adea.
evidentiary ruling 
level contends the district court committed prejudicial error in permitting abuan witness,douglas leas,to testify to statements made by paul roberts,abuan supervisor on the netexpert program and a corporate vice president.leas testified that roberts said a substantial reason for his resignation was the unethical treatment of abuan.roberts made his remarks at his luncheon,while he was still employed at level.
the bench conference on level motion to exclude these statements indicates the district court believed they were admissible under,which provides an exception to the hearsay rule for business records.on appeal,level maintains this evidence is not admissible under that rule because the evidence consists of oral statements.abuan,on the other hand,asserts the statements are not hearsay at all under rule d d,which defines as a statement by the party agent or servant concerning a matter within the scope of the agency or employment,made during the existence of the relationship.d d.
evidentiary rulings are reviewed for abuse of discretion.united states knox,cir.appellate review is especially deferential with respect to rulings on the admission of hearsay evidence.id.see also boren sable,cir.moreover,this court may affirm the admission of statements improperly characterized by the district court as an exception to the hearsay rule where the record indicates the evidence was actually admissible for its truth.see knox,at citing cases 
abuan contends the statements fall within rule d d because roberts was a high corporate officer,the remarks were within the scope of his own employment while discussing the treatment of his subordinate,and they were made while roberts was still an agent or employee of the company.level argues that the law defines scope of employment strictly,and that the statement was not within the scope of roberts employment because he did not participate in the employment decision at issue.level does not cite any tenth circuit authority in support of its argument.
the admission of this evidence is controlled by our analysis in rainbow travel service hilton hotels,cir.the plaintiff in that case was a travel service that had arranged for clients to stay at the fontainebleau hotel in miami beach.it sued the hotel chain owning the fontainebleau for breach of contract and fraud when the fontainebleau was overbooked and the chain had to accommodate the clients at a less desirable hotel.the district court allowed testimony of some of the clients,who recited statements made by a shuttle bus driver employed by the hotel to shuttle customers from the fontainebleau to the other hotel.the driver told the customers his job was to transport guests who had been bumped from the fontainebleau and to try to keep them happy.id.at.the defendant objected on the ground that the bus driver was not qualified to make statements concerning the hotel reservation practices.the district court ruled the testimony was admissible under rule d d because it was a statement by a party agent concerning a matter within the scope of his agency.id.this court upheld the admission,pointing out the statements were all related to the scope of his employment with the hotel.id.
given our ruling in rainbow travel that a shuttle bus driver statements concerning hotel reservation practices fall within rule d d,so does a vice president statements concerning his company unethical treatment of a direct subordinate.the admission of these statements is not grounds for reversal.
jury instructions 
level argues that the district court erred in failing to give the jury two instructions,one describing the conduct qualifying as an adverse employment action and one telling the jury the legal standard applicable to conflicting testimony on abuan performance.abuan counters that level neither objected at the conference on jury instructions nor timely proffered the instructions it claims were erroneously omitted,and that the omission does not constitute plain error.
no party may assign as error the failure to give an instruction unless that party objects thereto before the jury retires to consider its verdict,stating distinctly the matter objected to and the grounds of the objection.in this circuit,to comply with rule a party must both proffer an instruction and make a timely objection to the refusal to give a requested instruction.giron corr.of america,cir.a party does not satisfy the requirements for rule by merely submitting to the court a proposed instruction that differs from the instruction ultimately given to the jury.id.at internal quotation omitted.
the record does contain level second submission of proposed jury instructions,see.vol.i,doc,which includes the proposed instructions at issue,see id.at the record is clear,however,that level did not proffer these instructions at the instruction conference or object at that time to the district court failure to include them.level maintains this failure does not constitute a waiver because it had previously raised the issues in a motion for summary judgment and the district court rejected its position.in so doing,level attempts to invoke the futility exception to rule,under which a litigant is excused from complying with the strict objection requirement of rule if the district court is aware of the party position and it is plain that further objection would be futile,where the litigant position was clearly made to the district court.ecolab paraclipse,quoting james moore et,moore federal practice a,at to ed,and citing charles alan wright arthur miller,federal practice procedure,at ed internal quotations omitted.
this court applied the futility exception in asbill housing authority of the choctaw nation of oklahoma,cir.in that case,although the party had not voiced during the instruction conference the specific objection he was raising on appeal,we did not consider the matter waived.in so holding,we pointed out that the party did not raise the issue at the conference out of knowledge that the court had previously rejected its position at least four times before and during trial.id.at.we concluded under these circumstances that the party position had been made clear to the court and further objection would have been futile.
the record in this case reveals no such circumstances.level contends it made known to the court in its summary judgment materials its position that the two instructions were required.in those pleadings,level asserted abuan had failed to establish a prima facie case of title vii retaliation because he did not present any evidence he had suffered an adverse employment action.in denying summary judgment,the district court pointed to evidence that abuan was demoted when he was assigned to report to bourne and when he was assigned to perform menial clerical duties,and concluded that genuine issues of material fact precluded the grant of summary judgment for level.the summary judgment proceedings thus dealt only with whether level treatment of abuan was or was not adverse employment action as a matter of law.as such,they did not clearly inform the court of level position that its jury instruction defining adverse employment action was necessary.the court ruling denying summary judgment can not,in these circumstances,be construed as making plain its position rejecting the need for such an instruction.
in support of its summary judgment motion level also argued that 
where poor job performance is the reason cited by the defendant for its actions,the plaintiff can not rebut that as a legitimate,nondiscriminatory reason with only evidence of his own belief that his work was satisfactory.for,i t is the manager perception of the employee performance that is relevant,not plaintiffs subjective evaluation of her own relative performance.
aplt,doc,at citation omitted.in so doing,level claimed a plaintiff mere conjecture that an employer explanation is a pretext for intentional discrimination is an insufficient basis for denial of summary judgment.the district court rejected this argument,stating its belief that fact issues existed as to whether abuan reassignments during three years at level constituted demotions motivated by discriminatory animus.vol.i,doc,at.level assertion that the evidence of pretext was insufficient as a matter of law can not be construed as giving the court clear notice of its position that an instruction on evaluating evidence of abuan performance was necessary.and,of course,the court denial of summary judgment is not a plain indication that it would not give a jury instruction on the issue.accordingly,we conclude that the futility exception,a rarely applied narrow exception to rule should not be employed in this case.cadena v.the pacesetter,cir citing glasscock wilson constructors,cir.
we therefore review only for plain error the court failure to give the two instructions at issue.under this standard,level must show an error,that is plain,which means clear or obvious under current law,and that affects substantial rights.beaudry corrs.of america,cir per curiam.we may only reverse in an exceptional circumstance,where the error was patently erroneous and prejudicial and where fundamental injustice would otherwise occur.barber williamson,cir.
level proposed instruction on evaluating abuan performance states,ungrammatically,as follows in order to find that plaintiff was discriminated against because of an unfavorable personnel evaluation,you must consider only plaintiff managers perception of the employee performance.neither plaintiff of his own performance nor any evaluations of plaintiff performance by his.vol.i,doc,at.the proposed instruction is drawn from furr,at,but it misstates the holding in that case.furr addressed only the plaintiff subjective evaluation of his own performance relative to that of other employees who were not eliminated in the rif.id.furr does not support the notion that evidence from abuan as to his performance is irrelevant.level is correct to assert that the ultimate issue before the jury was abuan supervisors appraisal of his performance.abuan assessment of his work,however,is clearly probative of pretext.yet under level proposed instruction most evidence of pretext would become irrelevant once a defendant has stated that its action was based on its own evaluation of the plaintiff performance.this result is legally insupportable.because this instruction was an incorrect statement of the applicable law,the failure to give it was not error at all.
we likewise see no merit in level argument that the failure to give an instruction defining adverse employment action is grounds for reversal.the proposed instruction stated that an adverse employment action is one in which a manager took action against plaintiff in a way that affected his compensation or job duties.vol.i,doc,at.in this circuit,conduct constitutes adverse employment action when it results in a significant change in employment status,such as hiring,firing,failing to promote,reassignment with significantly different responsibilities,or a decision causing a significant change in benefits.garcia pueblo country club,cir.this court,in recognition of the remedial nature of title vii,employs a liberal definition of adverse employment action and a approach stinnett safeway,cir.even if we held the failure to instruct on the definition of adverse employment action was error,and further held the error was plain and prejudicial,level would still shoulder the heavy burden of demonstrating fundamental injustice.cadena,at quoting medlock,at.upon a thorough review of the record,particularly the evidence set out elsewhere in this opinion,we are convinced the district court failure to define adverse employment action for the jury did not result in fundamental injustice.see id.accordingly,reversal is not warranted.
closing argument 
level asserts that reversal is required because of improper closing argument by abuan counsel.level emphasizes that counsel referred to level failure to respond to the eeoc charge and appealed to the jury sympathy,invoking issues of poverty and race.level also cites numerous instances in which counsel allegedly misstated the evidence,argued inferences not supported by the evidence,and misstated the law.but level made only two objections to the closing argument an objection to counsel reference to his own humble beginnings and an objection to counsel statements of personal belief which level does not address on appeal.the district court sustained both objections.
the decision on whether counsel misconduct at trial was so egregious as to require retrial is left largely to the discretion of the district court.mason,at.we reverse only upon a clear abuse of that discretion.id.a new trial may be required only if the moving party shows that it was prejudiced by the attorney misconduct.id.
the only allegation of counsel misconduct to which level objected at trial was counsel reference to his own early days of poverty.in denying level motion for a new trial on this ground,the district court reviewed the closing arguments and found that the asserted impropriety was not a significant portion of counsel closing argument,and that the jury was properly instructed that the arguments of counsel were not to be considered as evidence.vol.iii,doc,at.the court accordingly concluded that level was not prejudiced by the remark.we find no abuse of discretion here.as the district court pointed out,we presume the jury followed the instruction cautioning that counsels arguments are not evidence.gardner chrysler,cir.moreover,upon objection the court cautioned the jury that there was no evidence to support counsel argument.the timely objection and the sustaining of the objection certainly detracts from a conclusion of prejudice.united states preston,cir.
after abuan filed his discrimination charge with eeoc,eeoc requested a response from level.level failed to reply.counsel referenced this failure in closing argument,and level did not object in denying level motion for a new trial on the ground of attorney misconduct,the district court rejected level argument that it was entitled to a new trial because counsel had violated the court motion in limine with respect to the eeoc charge.in so doing,the court observed that 
a ny prejudice incurred by the defendant was surely the result of its own maneuvers.defendant would have been better off to let the issue lie as directed by the court order on defendant motion in limine.accordingly,the defendant opened the door to the testimony about which it now complains.
vol.iii,doc,at.the record supports the district court assessment of the circumstances.level moved for the admission of plaintiff exhibits which contained two documents pertaining to the eeoc proceedings.id.abuan alleged,and the district court apparently concluded,level motion was an attempt to create the impression it fully cooperated with the eeoc investigation.id.we see no ground for reversal in counsel reference in closing argument to evidence that level did not cooperate.in any event,level has not demonstrated substantial injustice,a showing mandated by its failure to make a timely objection.
finally,we turn to level remaining list of alleged improprieties.our review of the record indicates that counsel misconduct was not as pervasive or as alarming as level contends.instead,as in other jury trials,counsel closing argument played a small role in a trial with many legitimate disputes between counsel over the relevance of several factual matters and the boundaries of orders in limine.mason,at.moreover,the evidence supporting the jury determinations was substantial and in some instances quite powerful.under these circumstances we have no reason to believe that a different result would have occurred in the absence of the misconduct.id.accordingly,a new trial is not warranted.
shortly after the trial of this case,abuan was laid off and he asked the district court to award him front pay as a result.after a hearing,the court awarded abuan front pay,covering a period beginning with his november and continuing two years thereafter,in an amount based on the salary he was earning at the time he lost his job.level challenges the district court award,contending abuan is not entitled to front pay as a matter of law because he rejected the company offer of a position substantially equivalent to the one he was denied or lost and because he was subsequently laid off for nondiscriminatory reasons.abuan maintains the district court award was supported by evidence showing that the hostility generated by the lawsuit made reinstatement infeasible and that he was made vulnerable to layoff,when he otherwise would not have been,by the company earlier adverse actions in demoting him.
f ront pay is simply money awarded for lost compensation during the period between judgment and reinstatement or in lieu of reinstatement.pollard du pont de nemours,d.front pay is an appropriate remedy under both the adea,see anderson phillips petroleum,cir,and title vii,see pollard,at.although reinstatement is the preferred remedy and should be ordered whenever it is appropriate,it is not always a viable option.in cases in which reinstatement is not viable because of continuing hostility between the plaintiff and the employer or its workers,or because of psychological injuries suffered by the plaintiff as a result of the discrimination,courts have ordered front pay as a substitute for reinstatement.id.at.in such cases an award of front pay as a substitute for reinstatement is a necessary part of the make whole relief mandated by congress id.at.
this court has recognized that front pay may be appropriate where an employer extreme hostility renders a productive and amicable working relationship impossible,or if the relationship has been irreparably damaged by animosity caused by the lawsuit.anderson,at.under such circumstances,an award of future damages in lieu of reinstatement furthers the remedial purposes of the adea by assuring that the aggrieved party is returned as nearly as possible to the economic situation he would have enjoyed but for the defendant illegal conduct.eeoc prudential fed.sav.loan ass n,cir.if this were not the case,an employer could avoid the purpose of the act simply by making reinstatement so unattractive and infeasible that the wronged employee would not want to return.id.
whether reinstatement or front pay is the appropriate remedy for employment discrimination is a matter committed to the discretion of the district court.see james sears,roebuck,cir.in determining whether,and how much,front pay is appropriate,the district court must attempt to make the plaintiff whole,yet the court must avoid granting the plaintiff a windfall.mason,at internal quotation omitted.because determining a front pay award requires the district court to predict future events and consider many complicated and interlocking factors,we review such awards with considerable deference,reversing only for an abuse of discretion.id.
at the time of trial in june,abuan was still employed at level as a supervisor,although he presented evidence that,due to his earlier failure to receive promotions,he was at a lower position and salary level than he would have been absent level alleged illegal acts.level economic situation was deteriorating in june,however,and the company instituted a layoff that month in which it determined abuan position to be extraneous and eliminated it.after beginning to implement abuan termination,the company decided instead to retain him in order to avoid conflict with the court order enjoining retaliatory discharges.level financial circumstances continued to decline and in november the company again instituted a layoff as part of a downsizing,this time eliminating abuan position.
the month before abuan was laid off,level offered him a new position through a vice president,elbert davis.at the hearing on front pay,level presented evidence that davis was hired to build a network management system to monitor network operations.davis testified that as of the front pay hearing,people had transferred into his organization,two new people had been hired,and he expected to hire six more.davis had interviewed abuan,discussed a possible position for him in the organization,and made him an offer.at a second meeting,abuan and davis discussed th
