this case arises out of a wage dispute between howard university and its campus security personnel.current and former howard security officers filed a complaint in the united states district court for the district of columbia alleging that the university had failed to compensate them for work performed during their meal breaks and before and after their scheduled shifts.howard and the plaintiffs ultimately entered into a settlement agreement,and a magistrate judge issued a consent decree enforcing that agreement.
after entering into the settlement,howard learned that the plaintiffs had previously filed a complaint in the superior court of the district of columbia arising out of the same facts,and that they had failed to advise howard of that second suit.following this discovery,howard moved to vacate the consent decree and underlying settlement agreement.the magistrate denied howard motion and subsequently issued orders adopting the damages and fees calculations made by a special master who had been appointed pursuant to the agreement.the superior court complaint was later dismissed.
howard now appeals from,inter alia,the denial of its motion to vacate and the adoption of the special master calculations.we conclude that the magistrate judge did not abuse his discretion with respect to the former and that there was no clear error with respect to the latter.
the plaintiffs original district court complaint,filed november,alleged that howard had failed to pay them for work performed during their meal breaks,in violation of the fair labor standards act flsa,et,and in breach of the collective bargaining agreement cba between howard and the plaintiffs union.the complaint was amended in may to add additional claims under the flsa and the cba for work performed by the plaintiffs without compensation both before and after their scheduled shifts,and was amended again in may to add a claim under the minimum wage act,et,for howard failure to compensate the plaintiffs for the same work alleged in the original and amended complaints.hereinafter,we refer to this amended action as summers

on june,the plaintiffs filed a second complaint against howard for failing to compensate them for work performed during meal breaks and before and after their shifts.plaintiffs filed this complaint,which we hereinafter refer to as summers ii,in the superior court of the district of columbia.the complaint alleged a breach of the cba,a claim facially identical to one the district court had dismissed in december,and also alleged that howard failure to compensate the plaintiffs violated the university employee handbook and thus constituted a breach of contract.the plaintiffs did not serve howard with this complaint and took steps to ensure that the university would not receive notice of the lawsuit through the usual superior court procedures.in addition,the plaintiffs did not supplement their responses to interrogatory to account for the filing of summers ii.
on december,howard and the plaintiffs reached a settlement in summers howard agreed to pay the flsa claims in full,the amount of the payment including back pay and liquidated damages to be resolved by a special master pursuant to rule of the federal rules of civil procedure.settlement agreement at app.howard also agreed to pay reasonable attorneys fees as determined by the special master.the settlement agreement provided that its terms would be embodied in a consent decree and entered by the court.on february,the magistrate judge issued an order consent decree that referenced the terms of the summers i settlement agreement,appointed a special master to make the findings required by that agreement,and directed howard to pay the special master fees and costs pursuant to rule a.summers howard,order.

howard now appeals from the magistrate order denying the university motion to vacate the consent decree and the underlying settlement agreement,as well as from his order adopting the findings of the special master we address these appeals in parts ii and iii below.
we begin with the magistrate order denying howard motion to vacate the consent decree pursuant to federal rule of civil procedure b.an appellate court may overturn such an order only for abuse of discretion.see computer prof ls for social responsibility united states secret,twelve john does district of columbia.rule b permits a court to relieve a party from a final judgment because of fraud whether heretofore denominated intrinsic or extrinsic,misrepresentation,or other misconduct of an adverse party.b.howard argues that the plaintiffs conduct comes within the scope of the rule,and that the magistrate abused his discretion in denying howard relief.
the magistrate judge denied howard motion on the ground that the university had failed to prove either fraud or affirmative misrepresentation.although howard disputes that conclusion,it correctly notes that rule b provides a third ground for vacatur that the magistrate failed to consider namely,other misconduct of an adverse party.see anderson cryovac,cir holding that,for the term misconduct to have meaning in the rule b context,it must differ from both fraud and misrepresentation.and it contends that the plaintiffs failure to supplement their interrogatory responses to disclose the existence of summers ii,coupled with their affirmative efforts to prevent notice of the suit from being given in superior court,constituted such misconduct.
