this appeal arises from a title vii claim brought by civil engineer geneva brown against her employer,the alabama department of transportation the department brown claimed that the department denied her nine separate promotions on account of her race,or for retaliatory reasons,between and.following a trial,a jury sitting in the northern district of alabama entered a verdict in brown favor as to her claims of discrimination and retaliation,and awarded her backpay on the basis of each of the nine challenged promotions.
on appeal,the department argues that the district court erred in denying its motion for judgment as a matter of law and remittitur.it claims that the evidence of discrimination and retaliation was insufficient with respect to all of the promotions,and that even if the evidence was sufficient as to some,the backpay award was excessive insofar as it took each of the promotions into account.the department also challenges the terms of the district court permanent injunction,which ordered that brown be promoted to the position of division engineer for the third division and provided for other interim relief.the department claims that the injunction failed adequately to specify the position that brown would hold pending her promotion to the third division engineer position,exceeded the scope of the district court remedial powers under title vii,and required the department to violate alabama law by placing brown in a position for which she was legally unqualified.
after thorough review,we conclude that the evidence of discrimination and retaliation was sufficient to support only three of the nine challenged promotional decisions,and that the backpay award therefore must be recalculated.we also hold that the injunction,while clear in most respects,failed to specify adequately the interim position that brown was to hold pending a vacancy in the third division engineer position.accordingly,we affirm in part,reverse in part,and remand for further proceedings consistent with this opinion.
the relevant history of this case begins long before the promotional decisions challenged here by geneva brown,and even considerably before brown joined the ranks of the alabama department of transportation in.it stretches back to at least june,when the united states commenced a large civil rights action known as the frazer litigation against six alabama state agencies.see united states ex.rel.mitchell frazer frazer i.although not one of the original defendants,the department of transportation then the state highway department,see.was joined not long after the initial filing,along with every other state agency in alabama save for the department of public safety.see united states frazer frazer ii,civ,wl.
as a prelude to frazer,federal officials repeatedly but unsuccessfully had urged alabama to adopt a regulation expressly prohibiting discrimination on the basis of race.frazer i.at.alabama had fallen behind other states in doing so,id.at,and indeed,its hiring and promotion system vested in the appointing officer the right to reject an applicant because of his race.id.with little appreciable progress in addressing discrimination,the federal government filed suit.
after reviewing a substantial corpus of evidence,the district court in frazer found that the six state agencies named as defendants in the original complaint had engaged in extensive workplace discrimination against candidates on the basis of their race.id.at.the district court identified,inter alia,the following discriminatory practices repeatedly passing over candidates for open positions,usually without ever contacting or interviewing them,while giving white applicants with equal or inferior qualifications numerous contacts,interviews,and job offers,id.at placing candidates on the inactive part of the employment register from which candidates were drawn,without ever giving them notice of such placement or ever again certifying them for vacant positions,id.at enforcing a policy of keeping all employees within certain clerical classifications,id.at and recruiting almost entirely from predominantly white high schools and colleges,to the exclusion of all but a few predominantly black institutions,id.at.
the result of these practices,the district court found,was a staggeringly low number of in the ranks of the six defendant agencies.only one out of a thousand of the defendants clerical employees was an abundance of qualified candidates and a pressing need to fill clerical only of professional or employees were.id.at.with the goal of remedying the disproportionately low numbers of in the civil service ranks,the district court entered a broad injunction targeting each of the identified discriminatory practices.id.at.
six years later,following the joinder of nearly every state agency in alabama,the district court reviewed additional evidence of evidence from the department of well as indications that all of the defendants were violating the earlier injunction.frazer ii,wl,at.this time,the district court found that systematic discrimination against black citizens of alabama ha d been as extensive among the new defendants as it had been among the original defendants.id.it also found that the state use of employment tests bearing a questionable relationship to job qualifications had severely prejudiced employees,and that the new defendant state agencies ha d generally avoided compliance with the decrees in this case by examining job registers maintained by the personnel department of the state of alabama and by requesting certificates of eligibility only at times when no blacks were available for certification.id.at.on august,the district court entered a second sweeping injunction targeting the discriminatory practices identified in both the first case and its successor.id.at.
around this time,geneva brown was a student in the civil engineering program at the university of alabama,where she eventually completed three and a half years towards her civil engineering degree before quitting the program when her mother became ill and died she was hired by the department of transportation in,directly on the heels of the second frazier injunction.with the help of the frazer orders,she became among the first in the civil engineering.throughout her long tenure at the department,she rose through all levels of the engineering assistant classification series and ultimately to the position of civil engineer in,and of civil engineer manager in.but the discrimination that drove the frazer litigation did not end with her hiring,and instead continued to severely hamper her efforts at promotion.
brown became a class member in a second discrimination lawsuit filed in by johnny reynolds and other alleging that the department of transportation continued to discriminate on the basis of race,in violation of the frazer orders.she was an active and vocal participant in the reynolds litigation,testifying in various proceedings on at least four occasions between and.in,the parties in reynolds reached a partial settlement and entered into a consent decree providing for extensive injunctive relief brown,however,continued to experience difficulties in her effort to advance to positions in two engineering civil engineer administrator cea and civil engineer senior administrator cesa.she filed the title vii discrimination and retaliation action underlying this appeal in,and the cause was tried to a jury over three days in september.beyond the essential background to brown claims,which included much of the history of the frazer and reynolds litigation,the following relevant facts emerged at trial.
at least on paper,promotion at the department follows a series of mandatory steps,essentially all of which were in place at the time of the events in question here.to fill vacancies within various employment classifications,the alabama state personnel department spd maintains registers of employees who have demonstrated their qualification for the position,typically in the form of a qualifying test score.from the appropriate register,spd draws a list known as a certificate of eligibles certificate,which contains the top ten candidates ranked either in bands of similar scores or from the highest score to the lowest.the certificate is sent to the department,whose choice of candidates is limited to those listed on the certificate.the department must then constitute a interviewing team,send letters of availability to each applicant on the certificate,interview each interested candidate by asking the same set of questions and rating the answers,and recommend a candidate to the appropriate bureau chief or division engineer for approval.the department compliance section verifies the implementation of these safeguards.
brown claimed that three primary forms of discrimination nonetheless ensured that she was repeatedly passed over in favor of white applicants.first,she claimed that the department,through the spd,manipulated the registers of qualified candidates in order to prevent black candidates from being hired.she testified generally at trial that employees names were known to disappear from and reappear on the registers,and specifically that her name was removed from the cea register in late,despite her repeated efforts to ensure that her availability remain listed essentially as statewide.although brown name reappeared on the register in,the department had filled the assistant bureau chief position that she sought during the period when her name had been removed from the list,despite her request to suspend the hiring process and investigate the unexplained disappearance of her name.as brown reminded the jury in connection with this incident,the department had been found in frazer to have generally avoided compliance with the frazer decrees by examining job registers and requesting certificates of eligibility only at times when no blacks were available for certification,id.at,and it remained subject to an injunction specifically prohibiting that practice.
second,brown claimed that the department manipulated seemingly legitimate test scores and employee qualifications by placing favored white employees in acting or assignments,giving them experience that boosted their scores and made them appear better qualified when interviewed department witness and chief engineer donald vaughn conceded that the experience gained through an acting position is perhaps the best training an employee can receive,both in terms of test scores the tests are designed to measure the skills performed on the job and the appearance of qualification.moreover,vaughn himself could not recall any instance in which an employee who had been assigned on an acting basis was not later appointed permanently.notably,brown was never given the benefit of any experience or training.
finally,brown testified that the department permitted outright discrimination or retaliation in employment decisions.she claimed that following an interview for one position in late,she was taken aside by a department manager by the name of camp,who suggested that she would not receive the subject any other the division engineer for one of the divisions to which she was applying did not want her there,the other divisions had been instructed to get the minorities off of th e register,and,her participation in reynolds had caused her to be labeled as a troublemaker.the department called no witnesses to undermine this testimony.
brown also testified that she was discouraged,to the extent of being harassed,from accepting a promotion to the position of pavement management engineer,a cea position that she was offered in early in the materials and tests bureau,and that even after she accepted the position,further harassment caused her to rescind her acceptance.the record showed that the position in question had been kept open for nearly two years after the vacancy had been created,during which time it was held by scott george on an acting,basis.when the vacancy was to be filled on a permanent basis,brown name appeared on the certificate,almost certainly above that of george.brown testified that under the frazer rule,she would have to decline the position before the department could offer it to a white candidate 
brown was offered the job,but she then received a phone call on february,from bureau chief larry lockett,who,in brown words,set about trying to discourage me.lockett reminded brown that she would not have any training,would be on her own,and from day one when she walked in that office,would be expected to know everything that was needed for that position.lockett further said that he had a preference for scott george,who m he wanted to fill that position,that he was considered a mean supervisor,and that brown would be starting her career all over when she should be ending it.brown initially was not discouraged,and she accepted the position on february.nonetheless,because of the claimed intimidation,the potential for hostility on the job,and lockett expressed preference for george,brown rescinded her acceptance just two weeks later.at that point,lockett was free to hire another candidate off of the certificate,and scott george ultimately was appointed to the pavement management engineer position.
brown also presented general evidence indicating that racial bias influenced the department hiring processes during the relevant period.thus,for example,there was testimony suggesting that the department was hostile towards who sought to advance their careers under the protection of the reynolds consent decree.around the time a new transportation director,joe mcinnes,was appointed in,executive assistant transportation director ron green was effectively replaced by a newly hired white employee,dan morris,who had no history at the department.also around that time,at least three of the other six bureau chiefs were removed from their positions,including curtis pierce from the professional engineering education and development bureau,alvena williams from the internal audits bureau,and brown roslyn from the training bureau.the evidence established that the net result was a significant reduction in the number of black employees in the department upper ranks,and that those who still held as green and jeffrey considerably reduced duties and staff.
brown claimed that some combination of the forms of discrimination she outlined led to her being denied nine different promotions on the basis of her race.the of them going to white as follows 
dee rowe promotion as division engineer for the fifth division on march,
randall estes promotion as division engineer for the sixth division on may,
robin rhoden promotion as assistant division engineer for the fifth division on december,
willis reynolds promotion as assistant division engineer for the fifth division on december,
charles tolbert promotion as county transportation engineer for the ninth division on december,
mike mahaffey promotion as assistant division engineer for the third division on march,
stacy glass promotion as assistant bureau chief in the maintenance bureau on march,
ronnie baldwin promotion as bureau chief for the bureau of office engineer on march,and 
brian davis promotion as division engineer for the third division on september.
at the close of all of the evidence,the department moved for judgment as a matter of law.the district court summarily denied the motion,and the jury was asked to answer the following questions 
do you find that the defendants probably denied promotion s to the plaintiff geneva brown because of her race 
do you find that the defendants probably retaliated against plaintiff geneva brown because of her engagement in protected activities 
what compensatory damages is plaintiff geneva brown entitled to 
verdict form,at.the jury answered the first two general questions in the affirmative,and determined that brown was entitled to in backpay and for mental anguish.for backpay,the jury adopted the figure provided in brown backpay table,which represented the period from may,to september.
the department renewed its motion for judgment as a matter of law and moved to vacate or remit the backpay award.the district court denied the motions without opinion.it entered a permanent injunction effectuating the jury backpay award and ordering that brown be given a comparable position pending her permanent promotion to the position of division engineer for the third division.the department in turn moved for relief from the judgment,arguing that the district court injunction did not adequately explain the meaning of the interim comparable position that brown was to receive,granted relief not authorized pursuant to title vii,and required the department to violate alabama law by promoting brown to a position for which she was supposedly unqualified as a matter of law.the district court denied this motion,too,and the department presented this timely appeal.
the department first contends that the evidence did not support a finding of discrimination or retaliation as to any of the nine promotions that brown claims to have been denied,and that the backpay award was therefore unsupported.more particularly,the department claims that the district court erred in denying its motion for judgment as a matter of law with respect to the verdicts and for vacation or remittitur of the backpay award.

brown claimed that the department denial of the nine identified promotions was discriminatory and violated title vii,which makes it unlawful for an employer to discriminate against any individual with respect to his compensation,terms,conditions,or privileges of employment,because of such individual race.a a plaintiff bears the burden of establishing a prima facie case of discrimination in title vii cases that are supported by circumstantial evidence.wilson aerospace,cir.in the context,the prima facie case consists of showing these elements that the plaintiff belongs to a protected class that she applied for and was qualified for a promotion that she was rejected despite her qualifications and that other equally or employees outside her class were promoted.id.at.the comparators for the fourth prong must be similarly situated in all relevant respects.holifield reno,cir.
if a plaintiff makes the requisite showing,the burden of production shifts to the employer to articulate a legitimate,nondiscriminatory reason for its actions.see rojas florida,cir citing mcdonnell douglas green,d.the employer need not persuade the court that it was actually motivated by the proffered reasons.dep t of cmty.affairs burdine,d.rather,if the employer articulat es one or more reasons,then the presumption of discrimination is rebutted,and the burden of production shifts to the plaintiff to offer evidence that the alleged reason of the employer is a pretext for illegal discrimination.wilson,at.
the defendant department of transportation says that the evidence was insufficient as to each of the promotions that brown was denied,and that even if it was sufficient as to some,the backpay award still could not be supported because it was an aggregate figure demonstrably reflecting all nine of the promotions.we agree that although the verdict was a general asked only whether the department had denied promotion s to brown because of her race the sufficiency of the evidence as to each individual promotion affects the viability of the aggregate amount of brown backpay award.we therefore examine each promotion separately,and,after thorough review of this record,conclude that only three of the nine alleged violations were supported by substantial evidence.we begin with them.
brown established a prima facie case of discrimination concerning the promotion of mike mahaffey,a white male,to the position of assistant division engineer for the third division on march.the plaintiff passed the civil engineer administrator test,was placed on the relevant register and on the certificate of eligibles as a qualified candidate,but was not promoted once certified for the position.as a reason for hiring mahaffey and not brown,the department claimed that mahaffey was more qualified.the jury,however,was entitled to reject the department proffered reason.
in the first place,the jury could have found on this record that the department proffered reason was not credible.brown had extensive experience as a civil engineer,having served in that position from to,and as a civil engineer manager from through the time the cea vacancy was filled by the third division.while the department successfully demonstrated at trial that brown did not have mahaffey precise qualifications years in construction,years in maintenance,years in materials and tests and year in it did not even attempt to explain why those particular qualifications were superior to brown thus,although the department at this stage was not required to persuade the fact finder that it was actually motivated by the proffered reasons,only to show a genuine issue of fact as to whether it discriminated against the plaintiff,texas dep t of cmty.affairs burdine,d,the jury could have found that the department reasons failed to show any such issue.
second,there was ample evidence of racial discrimination specific to the mahaffey promotion,suggesting that the department proffered reasons were pretextual.in late,not long before she interviewed for the position given to mahaffey,brown also interviewed for a county transportation engineer position in the ninth division.she testified that immediately after the interview,she was approached by a manager by the name of camp.camp asked if he was speaking with geneva brown after being told that he was,he asked for a word with her.brown testified that camp took her into his office and,for her own good,explained why she likely would not receive any promotions.notably,the division engineer for the third division,james horsley,had instructed the eighth division engineer to get the minorities off of that register so that the third division,the ninth division and all the other divisions could fill their positions with who m they wanted.and,the ninth division did not want her because of her participation in the lawsuit,the reynolds case.horsley,who apparently had held the third division engineer position open for a year or more while mahaffey gained experience and training on an basis,was on the interview team that selected mahaffey over brown,giving the jury substantial reason to reject the department proffered explanation.
stacey glass,a white male,and not the plaintiff brown,was promoted to the position of assistant bureau chief of the maintenance bureau on march.the department challenges brown claim of discrimination as to this promotion on the ground that her absence from the relevant certificate of eligibles prevents her from establishing a prima facie case and provides a reason for hiring glass.brown argued at trial,however,that the department manipulated the registers to avoid promoting her.we think that the evidence before the jury adequately supported this claim.
while an employee must meet the employer objective promotion criteria,vessels atlanta indep.sch,cir,such as scoring high enough to appear on a certificate of eligibles,brown demonstrated that her test score was high enough to have placed her on the certificate for the assistant bureau chief position.the department requested the certificate on january,and received it on january.yet,while the certificate did contain ten names drawn from the correct register,neither brown name nor that of any other black candidate appeared on it.the overwhelming inference,brown suggested,was that the department had manipulated the registers.
the department countered that brown name did not appear on the january certificate because she had limited her availability to tuscaloosa and jefferson counties.the evidence,however,showed that the register reflected brown availability through,and that brown had taken many steps during this period to ensure that her availability remained listed as statewide,with the exception only of clarke county.specifically,after her discussion with camp in november,brown wrote to the state personnel department on november,asking it to ensure that her name remain ed on the civil engineering administrator register and to provide her with written confirmation of this.she received confirmation on november,that her name w ould remain active on this list of eligibles to be considered for future vacancies.still concerned,however,brown wrote again on november and still again on december,noting specifically in the second communication that she was unavailable for appointment in clarke county only at this time but was available in all other divisions now.brown copied department officials,such as the eighth division engineer,on her december request that she be listed as available everywhere but in clarke county.on january,the department had received the certificate,but well before it made any hiring sent yet another communication,albeit to the certification section of the state personnel department,asking that her name remain on the register for all counties except clarke.
the department contends that this exchange is immaterial because it lacks the ability to influence register listings maintained by the personnel department and may only hire from the certificate that the personnel department provides.these contentions do not carry the day for two reasons.first,despite the department disclaimer of any influence over the registers,other testimony revealed that the department,not spd,furnished the information used to justify removal of an employee from the registers.it was therefore reasonable for the jury to infer that the department was responsible for the unexplained disappearance of brown name from the list,less than two months before the department obtained a certificate that contained no black candidates.indeed,as the jury heard,the department was prohibited by the frazer injunction from intentionally requesting certificates at times when no black candidates appeared on them,as it was found to have done.second,brown had notified the department of her improper removal from the cea register and requested an investigation well before the department filled the subject vacancy.yet despite notice of brown situation,the department filled the position from the original certificate.from this evidence,the jury was free to it undoubtedly the department manipulated the hiring system,either by affirmatively seeking brown removal from the cea register,or by waiting to request a certificate until,for whatever reason,no black candidates appeared on it.
the plaintiff brown also claimed that she was improperly denied a promotion to the position of division engineer for the third division,which was filled on an basis by a white engineer,brian davis,in august,and then permanently by davis on september.as with the promotion of glass,the department claims that brown absence from the relevant certificate of eligibles prevents her from establishing a prima facie case and,alternatively,provides the department with a legitimate,reason for hiring davis.but the davis promotion differs from the glass promotion in one important respect.here,brown did not and could not claim that she should have appeared on the certificate of eligibles,since it was drawn from a register on which brown name did not appear at all.we,therefore,must first decide whether brown could have established that she was qualified for the subject position despite her absence from both the certificate and the register from which it was drawn.
while an employee must satisfy the employer objective promotion criteria,that requirement extends only to criteria that are valid.see,miller.dep t of,cir noting,in ada context,that criteria defining qualification must be valid.the department traditionally used the cesa register to fill division engineer positions,but with the davis promotion,it used a new register known as the professional civil engineer iii pce iii.brown essentially claims that the pce iii register was not a valid qualification,and we agree that the jury at least could have reasonably so found.
at trial,but notably not before,the department purported to justify use of the pce iii register on the basis of a state licensing law that required certain applicants to have an engineer license.no witness testified that the requirement of an engineer the sole justification for the pce iii previously applied to department employees,and the only testimony on the subject was that the law did require an engineer license prior to.although chief engineer donald vaughn stated that this was because the reynolds court asked the department to delay the implementation of the requirement to have a license until,i believe,it was june of,he offered no explanation for the existence of the purported requirement,and the jury,faced with considerable evidence of discrimination,was entitled to disbelieve him.
the department counters that even disregarding the pce iii register and using brown preferred measure of cesa still failed to establish a prima facie case.specifically,although brown scored ranks above davis on the cesa register,there were over sixty applicants above brown on that list,making it extremely unlikely that she would have appeared on a certificate drawn from that register.the jury was free,however,to look past any plausibly invalid promotional criteria,such as the pce iii register,and to ask whether brown was as qualified as davis,whom the department apparently did consider qualified insofar as it hired him.in evaluating whether brown was as qualified as davis,the best indicator was the register for the civil engineer senior administrator,from which the division engineer position had previously been filled.since brown appeared well above davis on that register,the jury properly could have found her qualified.
the department nonetheless insists that there is no taint of discrimination here,and that it did not hire brown because she lacked an engineer license.donald vaughn testified that,whatever the official status of the license requirement,the department nonetheless ensured that a ll of its division engineers had a license.once again,we think the jury was free to reject this explanation.as an initial matter,the jury could have found that the use of this unspoken objective criterion was unacceptable and itself discriminatory.objective e mployment tests can be an important part of a neutral selection system that safeguards against the very racial animosities title vii was intended to prevent.ricci destefano,d.in other words,such tests may help fulfill t he purpose of title vii,which is to promote hiring on the basis of job qualifications,rather than on the basis of race or color.id.at quoting griggs duke power,d.
but tests also create legitimate expectations on the part of those who took them.as is the case with any promotion exam,some such individuals will have invested substantial time,money,and personal commitment in preparing for the tests.id.at.thus,while an employer may use testing to ensure that all groups have a fair opportunity to apply for promotions and to participate in the process by which promotions will be made,the employer may not,once that process has been established and the selection criteria made known,invalidate the test results,id.at,by uniformly applying an unofficial and unstated selection criterion.the cesa examination was established after rigorous analysis as the qualification for division engineers,and the agency announcement for that position was silent about any licensing requirement.under the circumstances,the jury could have rejected the department attempt to justify hiring davis rather than brown on the basis of a uniformly applied but unofficial licensing requirement.
in any event,given the surrounding evidence of discrimination in the third division and the department questionable use of a new register to impose a licensing requirement in that supposedly had been enacted in,the jury was by no means required to credit vaughn testimony,even though it was unrebutted on the particular point.the immediate context of the promotion,which suggested a substantial measure of pretext,supported the jury verdict as to this promotion as well.
the appointment of dee rowe as division engineer for the fifth division brings us to the first of six promotions for which we can not discern sufficient evidence of discrimination to support the jury verdict.the department does not dispute that brown established a prima facie case of discrimination with respect to rowe promotion on march,brown clearly did.the sole question is whether the department provided a legitimate,reason for hiring rowe.the evidence showed that rowe was appointed through a backlog process pursuant to reynolds.as brown acknowledged,backlog appointments required that everybody,plaintiffs,intervenors,and the state,had to all agree to the appointment.in fact,the very attorneys representing brown in this case agreed to rowe appointment.plainly,the use of the backlog process was a explanation for the promotion of rowe.brown failed to carry her burden of demonstrating pretext she presented no further evidence specific to this promotion.
randall estes was appointed as division engineer for the sixth division on may.the department argues that brown failed to establish a prima facie case with respect to estes because he was not promoted but merely given a lateral transfer,and because brown was neither objectively qualified nor as or more qualified than estes.as a preliminary matter,it is doubtful whether brown,who did not have cesa status at the time,could have been objectively qualified for this position more importantly,however,there was undisputed evidence that estes was not promoted.
in a case,the plaintiff must show that other employees of similar qualifications who were not members of the protected group were indeed promoted at the time the plaintiff request for promotion was denied.powell,emphasis added citation omitted.but estes was moved from one division engineer position to another,retained the same job classification,and received no pay increase.there was no promotion.while brown attorneys suggested that estes transfer nonetheless was invalid in that it amounted to a mere reshuffling of white employees who had benefitted from past discrimination,there was no evidence that brown even was seeking the particular position that estes received,or that the transfer of estes from one division to another reduced brown chances of receiving a promotion.the evidence therefore did not support a claim of discrimination with respect to the promotion of estes.
willis reynolds was promoted to the position of division engineer for the fifth division on december.the department argues that brown failed to establish a prima facie case or,alternatively,to rebut the department evidence of a legitimate,motive with respect to the promotion of reynolds.we agree that brown failed to establish a prima facie case.she did not appear on the certificate of eligibles used to fill the position,as explained by the fact that her score on the civil engineer senior administrator examination was,while the lowest score on the certificate from which reynolds was selected was.brown was required to satisfy the department objective criteria,vessels,at,and there was no evidence that the use of this particular certificate was invalid or otherwise improper.brown thus failed to show that she was qualified for the promotion given to reynolds.
in any event,the department proffered legitimate,reasons for hiring reynolds he appeared at the top of the certificate,with a score of and,the assistant transportation director ronald green,who is,stated in writing that reynolds was being selected over other candidates,including someone with veteran points,because he was better suited for the position.brown failed to show any pretext.she suggested that the reynolds promotion was tainted by the improper use of acting placements,but the record did not support this suggestion.while the position filled by reynolds previously had been occupied by an employee acting out of classification,there was no evidence that reynolds had received any such favorable treatment.
robin rhoden was promoted from the same certificate used to promote reynolds,and the facts surrounding the two promotions are virtually identical,except insofar as rhoden was listed third,not first,on the certificate.brown was not and could not have been on the certificate,and therefore failed to establish a prima facie case.and,once again,brown absence from the certificate also provided a legitimate,reason for the promotion of rhoden.further,rhoden had a number of specific qualifications listed on a form memorializing her promotion,including experience in construction and as a district engineer,a working knowledge of materials issues,and a degree in civil engineering technology.brown,who had largely completed the requirements for a degree in civil engineering,had never obtained one.in addition,rhoden appointment was approved expressly by brown supervisor ron green.green,as a member of the interview team,found rhoden better suited than the other applicants.finally,as with reynolds,there is no evidence that the department provided rhoden with an unfair competitive advantage through assignments to the position she ultimately filled.
charles tolbert was promoted to the position of county transportation engineer for the ninth division on december.this promotion poses a peculiar question,namely,whether brown sufficiently informed the jury of her claim relative to this promotion,such that a reviewing court could assume that the jury even considered any supportive evidence.the sole testimony offered to the jury on the subject of tolbert promotion was brown concessions on that she did testify on the subject of that promotion and did not provide evidence regarding that promotion to the jury at trial did not know whether she was on the certificate of eligibles for the position did not interview for the position and did not know whether tolbert or someone else got the promotion.brown herself drew no connection between the discussion with camp and the tolbert promotion.in all,the jury heard nothing on the subject of the tolbert promotion from any witness.we can not fairly ascribe the jury findings of discrimination to the tolbert promotion,when the jury had no reason to know that the promotion was even at issue.
the facts before the jury on the subject of ronald baldwin promotion to the cesa position of bureau chief for the office engineer bureau on march,were few,and they do not support a finding of discrimination.brown was not on the certificate used to fill the position given to baldwin,offered no specific evidence with respect to her efforts to obtain the job or her qualifications relative to baldwin,and provided no reason why the department reliance on the certificate was pretextual.brown did not,for example,claim that the department used rotations to favor baldwin over herself,or that she had been removed improperly from the register from which the certificate was generated.in short,there were no facts supporting a finding in brown favor with respect to baldwin promotion.
brown also claimed that she was denied each of the nine promotions as a form of retaliation for her outspoken opposition to discrimination,and specifically for her testimony on at least four occasions between and in the reynolds litigation.we need not address whether the evidence supported a claim of retaliation with respect to the promotions of mahaffey,glass,or estes,having already concluded that there was sufficient evidence to support a jury finding of discrimination in the failure to promote the plaintiff.and the remedy for the retaliatory claims would be exactly the same.we do,however,examine the sufficiency of the evidence concerning the plaintiff claims of retaliation as to the remaining six of rowe,estes,reynolds,rhoden,tolbert,and baldwin.these retaliatory claims fail for insufficient evidence.
the mcdonnell douglas analysis applies in cases of retaliation relying on circumstantial evidence,such as this one.bryant jones,cir.as we recently explained,the prima facie case for retaliation requires the employee to show that 
he engaged in a statutorily protected activity he suffered an adverse employment action and he established a causal link between the protected activity and the adverse action.these three elements create a presumption that the adverse action was the product of an intent to retaliate.once a plaintiff establishes a prima facie case of retaliation,the burden of production shifts to the defendant to rebut the presumption by articulating a legitimate,reason for the adverse employment action.if the defendant carries this burden of production,the presumption raised by the prima facie case is rebutted and drops from the case.after the defendant makes this showing,the plaintiff has a full and fair opportunity to demonstrate that the defendant proffered reason was merely a pretext to mask discriminatory actions.

there is no dispute here that brown engaged in protected testimony and general involvement in the reynolds discrimination class action against the department,see a crawford carroll,cir and that she suffered a series of adverse employment actions.the disputed question is whether the evidence sufficiently established,with respect to any of the promotions that brown allegedly was denied,a causal connection between the two foregoing facts.to show causation,a plaintiff in a retaliation case need prove only that retaliatory animus was one factor in the adverse employment decision.see,terry ashcroft,cir.
the department noted that the only specific times brown claims to have testified in reynolds were in,and again in december,and that the closest promotion in time to those dates that of baldwin on march,was three months removed.it also claims that no decisionmakers at the department were shown to have had knowledge of brown participation or testimony in reynolds,as required by our case law.see gupta.bd.of regents,cir requiring plaintiff to show that decisionmaker knew of her participation in a protected activity.
the department takes too narrow a view of brown involvement in the reynolds lawsuit,and of the evidence of retaliatory animus presented at trial.the specific dates or periods when brown recalls testifying are not the only dates relevant here.in addition to testifying in and again in,brown also testified on at least two occasions between and,although she did not recall when,specifically.brown undisputed testimony also was that she was an active member of the reynolds class,and that when she was not testifying,she was on the witness list to testify,and was a very vocal participant.as brown argues on appeal,the potential significance of the protected activity must be taken into account in assessing how strictly the rule of temporal proximity should be applied.a single statement that injures or offends the employer is different from vocal participation in a contentious,class action that makes major inroads in upsetting systemic racial discrimination,answering,at,which is an apt characterization of the reynolds litigation.
that said,we agree with the department that this is not a case where temporal proximity alone is sufficient to establish an inference of retaliation.to do so,the temporal relationship between the protected activity and the adverse employment action must be very close.thomas cooper lighting,cir quoting clark county sch.dist.breeden,d.even a interval between the protected expression and the employment briefest interval we face too long.id.citing richmond oneok,cir.thus,in the absence of other evidence tending to show causation,if there is a substantial delay between the protected expression and the adverse action,the complaint of retaliation fails as a matter of law.id.
here,brown offered no additional evidence of retaliation except for her testimony concerning the interaction with camp.this evidence,at least with respect to retaliation,was wholly generalized and plainly insufficient to establish liability without something more.but because brown did not offer anything more as to the promotions or transfers of rowe,estes,reynolds,rhoden,tolbert,and,she offered nothing at all on the subject of the tolbert failed to establish a claim of retaliation concerning those promotions.
on balance,there are only three of mahaffey,glass,and yield an inference of either discrimination or retaliation.as a result,backpay was permissible only as for those three promotions.
the jury awarded backpay to brown in the amount of,the precise amount proposed in brown backpay table.the table reflected a backpay period running from may,to september,and spanning all nine promotions,and was generally calibrated to account for the pay increases that brown would have received from the first date she was denied a promotion to a particular salary level.for a number of reasons,the department argues that the backpay award should have been vacated or remitted.
a district court may order a remittitur to reduce an excessive verdict under several circumstances,including where the court can identify an error that caused the jury to include in the verdict a quantifiable amount that should be stricken.kirsch fleet street,cir citation omitted see also united states ex rel.a homecare,medshares mgmt.group,cir citation omitted.
the department first argues that brown failed at trial to disclose the basis for her backpay particular,the specific comparators she used in her table to establish the level of pay she should have received.we are unpersuaded.brown disclosed the bases for the table to defense counsel prior to trial,and counsel fully the preparer of the table without suggesting that the table was inaccurate in any way.under these circumstances,the jury was free to accept the table at face value.
the department next argues that brown backpay should have been cut off by her rejection of several offers of promotion in late and early.this is a mitigation argument on which the department bears the burden of proof.nord steel,cir marks prattco,cir the department is correct that absent special circumstances,the rejection of an employer unconditional job offer ends the accrual of potential backpay liability.ford motor eeoc,d.but special circumstances include situations in which the employer offer is not made in good faith,or where the employee rejection of the offer is reasonable.stanfield answering,cir.
the department brown on the only two identified instances in which she declined a promotion.brown first testified in detail about the campaign of harassment directed at her by her supervisor as she considered whether to accept one such position in the materials bureau ultimately given to scott george.she then testified that she declined a position in the eighth division because of a racially hostile work environment.specifically,brown testified that her former freddie golthy,an who participated with brown in the reynolds litigation,was murdered on the eighth division premises by a white employee,that the homicide was racially motivated,and that the area was known for its prevalent racism.the jury was entitled to credit brown account of her decisions to reject the offers of promotion over the department account.
the department third claim is that brown backpay award must be reduced because she failed to prove that any discriminatory or retaliatory denial of a promotion occurred before may,the beginning of the backpay period.we agree with this argument.brown failed to present sufficient evidence to support her claims with respect to the promotions or transfers of rowe,estes,reynolds,rhoden,tolbert,and baldwin.because she made a series of separate claim s of discrimination on the part of the department for which she can not recover absent proof that the promotions were denied on the basis of race,robinson city of fairfield,cir,the backpay award must be recalculated.accordingly,we vacate the award and remand with instructions that the district court determine an amount of backpay that will,to the extent reasonably possible and consistent with this opinion,make brown whole for injuries she suffered on account of the department unlawful employment discrimination.albemarle paper moody,d.
although the seventh amendment ordinarily requires that an order of remittitur be accompanied by an offer for a new trial,there is no such need under the peculiar circumstances of this case.backpay in this circuit is considered equitable relief,whether granted under title vii,which provides solely for equitable remedies,or and,which provide for legal remedies as well.whiting jackson state,cir see also johnson chapel hill indep.sch,cir.the determination of backpay under any of these provisions therefore entails no rights under the seventh amendment.lincoln bd.of regents of.of,cir.
of course,when legal and equitable issues are tried together and overlap factually,the seventh amendment requires that all findings necessarily made by the jury in awarding a verdict to a party on legal claims are binding on the trial court when it sits in equity.williams city of valdosta,cir here,there was an evident factual overlap between brown legal claim for mental anguish damages and her equitable claim for backpay.critically,however,the jury did not necessarily make any findings with respect to the availability of any legal relief.the jury found only that the department denied promotions to brown on the basis of her race or for retaliatory reasons,and it awarded her mental anguish damages on the basis of one or more unspecified instances of discrimination or retaliation.thus,there were no findings as to any legal claim that would merit deference in scrutinizing the facts underlying the purely equitable backpay award.
based on the jury findings,the district court entered a permanent injunction,the relevant portions of which required the department to immediately transfer plaintiff geneva brown in a comparable position nearest her residence in the third or fifth division promote her to fill the next vacancy in the position of division engineer in the third division and compensate her at a rate not less than that of the incumbent brian davis.final judgment and permanent injunction,at.
the department challenges the injunction on three grounds.first,it claims that the term comparable,as used to describe the interim position that brown shall receive in the third or fifth divisions,is not sufficiently definite.second,it says that the district court lacked the authority to order specifically that brown be instated in the third division,near her residence,rather than in the first available position to which she claims to have been denied a promotion,wherever that vacancy may arise.finally,the department contends that it is prohibited by alabama law from placing brown in a division engineer position,inasmuch as brown does not hold an engineering license purportedly required by state law.
although the grant of permanent injunctive relief is generally reviewed for an abuse of discretion,if the trial court misapplies the law we will review and correct the error without deference to that court determination.hughey jms development,cir quotation marks and citation omitted see also guaranty fin,ryan,cir.
like unclear legislation,a vague injunction may trap the innocent by not providing fair warning of what is prohibited.grayned city of rockford,d.not surprisingly,federal rule of civil procedure d requires that injunctive orders state their terms specifically and describe in reasonable detail the act or acts restrained.in other words,to comply with the requirements of rule d,an injunction must be specific and definite enough to apprise those within its scope of the conduct that is being proscribed.in re,cir.
while the district court injunction unambiguously requires that brown be placed in the next vacancy in the position of division engineer in the third division,it does not define with adequate specificity the comparable position that brown is to hold pending a vacancy in the third division engineer position.the term comparable might brown comparable to those that brown claims to have been improperly denied.yet,even ignoring the inherent lack of clarity in that designation most of the subject promotions were to positions,but one as to which we discern sufficient not,the injunction could also reasonably designate positions comparable to brown current position at the civil engineer administrator level.the latter interpretation is plausible for two reasons.
first,in ordering brown roslyn reinstated and promoted to the next vacancy in the sixth division engineer position,the district court provided that interim position would be either her former or a comparable position.the court clearly tied the interim position to position,not the position to which she would be promoted.the only meaningful difference in the clause governing brown instatement level is that brown was never terminated.plainly,then,the comparable position language could refer to brown current position.second,while the district court remedy might have appeared incomplete if brown and had been left for some indefinite period in positions comparable to their former incompleteness suggesting that the injunction could only be read as brown reads district court required that both plaintiffs receive pay at the division engineer level pending promotion,meaning that a reading contrary to brown would be consistent with both the letter and the spirit of the injunction.
notably,the injunction also fails to specify what the department must do if the subject comparable position however not available.unlike the command that brown must be given the next vacancy in the third division engineer position,the comparable position clause does not disclaim a requirement that the department bump a current occupant,nor state whether the department is expected to create a vacancy if one is not currently available.
although brown understandably complains that the department has made no effort to identify a job it proposes as comparable or to otherwise consult with plaintiff to determine if there is a genuine controversy about whether it is comparable,answering,at,the injunction itself still must be clear enough so that the enjoined party can comply without fear of contempt.state org.for women terry,cir rule d was intended to prevent an uncertain or vague decree from becoming the basis for a contempt citation.and,while the department did not preserve this issue in the district court by seeking clarification,we may nonetheless address the issue if its proper resolution is beyond any doubt.narey dean,cir listing five exclusive exceptions to ban on appellate review of issues not raised in the district court.we think it beyond any doubt that the comparable position clause fails the standard enunciated by rule d.we therefore direct the district court to redraft that clause on remand with the clarity and specificity required by the federal rules.see pmc,cir remanding to district court for redrafting of insufficiently definite injunction.
the department next argues that nothing in title vii entitles brown to a position near her residence.it claims that brown should have been ordered promoted to whatever vacancy became available among the positions to which she claims to have been denied a promotion.title vii provides broadly that
