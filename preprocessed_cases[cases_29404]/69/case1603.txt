teva pharmaceuticals teva appeals from the dismissal of its declaratory judgment action by the united states district court for the district of new jersey.the district court,relying on our declaratory judgment test for patent as modified by our recent decision in teva pharmaceuticals usa,pfizer,pfizer,found that teva failed to establish a reasonable apprehension of imminent suit and that it therefore lacked jurisdiction over the declaratory judgment action.in light of the supreme court recent decision in medimmune,genentech,d,which finds that our declaratory judgment test for or invalidity conflicts with its precedent,we reverse.
background 
novartis holds a new drug application nda for three strengths of the drug famvir.upon filing its famvir nda,novartis listed five patents in the food and drug administration fda orange book,each of which covers and is directed to various aspects of famvir,including patent nos patent patent patent patent and patent.the patent is directed to the active ingredient in famvir,famciclovir,while the remaining orange book patents are directed to methods of therapeutic use method patents of famvir.the patent expires in,but the related therapeutic use patents do not expire until.
in,teva filed an abbreviated new drug application anda with the fda for generic famciclovir tablets in which teva certified under paragraph iv of j a vii that its drug did not infringe any of the five novartis famvir orange book patents or that the patents were invalid.teva paragraph iv certifications constitute technical infringement under e.accordingly,novartis had days to sue on these patents in order to invoke a statutorily mandated stay to delay immediate fda approval of teva famciclovir anda.see j b iii.
novartis brought an infringement suit against teva on the patent alone and did not include in the action the related therapeutic use patents.the infringement suit is pending in the united states district court for the district of new jersey.novartis pharm.teva pharm.usa,wl.
after novartis filed suit,teva brought this declaratory judgment action on the four remaining method patents under j c and e to establish patent certainty.title j c is a amendment to the anda statute entitled civil action to obtain patent certainty.under this provision,if the patentee or nda holder does not bring an infringement suit within days after receiving notice of a paragraph iv certification,the anda applicant may bring a civil action for a declaratory judgment that the patent at issue is invalid or will not be infringed by the drug for which the anda was submitted.id.title e is a amendment to the patent statute that works in conjunction with the amendment to the anda statute to provide that in a civil action to obtain patent certainty,federal courts shall,to the extent consistent with the constitution,have subject matter jurisdiction in any action brought under of title for a declaratory judgment that such patent is invalid or not infringed.teva argues that by bringing suit on the patent alone in the first instance,novartis has sought to put teva to the hard choice of either launching at risk of massive liability for patent infringement when the patent expires or teva prevails in the pending infringement action,or foregoing that opportunity and thereby effectively extending the term of the patent.appellant br.footnotes omitted.
novartis moved to dismiss for lack of subject matter jurisdiction,arguing that teva had no reasonable apprehension that it would be sued by novartis for infringing the four method patents.in response,teva argued that novartis had already sued teva on the underlying composition patent listing patents in the orange book established infringement as a matter of law novartis had a history of aggressively suing generic drug companies and novartis had declined to give teva a covenant not to sue.
the district court dismissed teva declaratory judgment action requesting patent certainty on the four method patents.teva,usa,novartis pharm,slip op.at,wl.in so doing,the district court applied our two prong test from pfizer at.after comparing the facts of this case to those in pfizer,the district court found that teva had failed to establish a reasonable apprehension of imminent suit and that the district court therefore lacked jurisdiction over the declaratory judgment action.teva,slip op.at.teva timely appealed to this court.we have jurisdiction under a.
the district court dismissal of teva declaratory judgment action for lack of jurisdiction presents a question of law that we review without deference.see pfizer,at citing vysis.the determination of whether an actual controversy exists under the declaratory judgment act in a patent case is a question of law that we review de novo.bp chems.union carbide.the district court factual findings supporting its determination are reviewed for clear error.id.
ii.analysis 
our starting point in analyzing teva appeal is the declaratory judgment act,a under which teva filed this suit.the relevant text of the act reads 
in a case of actual controversy within its jurisdiction any court of the united states,upon the filing of an appropriate pleading,may declare the rights and other legal relations of any interested party seeking such declaration,whether or not further relief is or could be sought.
in the anda context,congress explicitly extended federal court declaratory judgment jurisdiction under to anda paragraph iv disputes such as teva and did so to the extent consistent with the constitution.e 
the supreme court recently that the act actual controversy requirement refers to the type of cases and controversies that are justiciable under article iii.medimmune.at t he phrase case of actual controversy in the act refers to the type of cases and controversies that are justiciable under article iii.citing aetna life ins.haworth.
in medimmune,the court found that its precedent did not draw the brightest of lines between those actions that satisfy the requirement and those that do not.id.instead of applying a bright line,the court stated that its decisions required 
that the dispute be definite and concrete,touching the legal relations of the parties having adverse legal interests and that it be real and substantial and admi t of specific relief through a decree of a conclusive character,as distinguished from an opinion advising what the law would be upon a hypothetical state of facts.
id.citing aetna life ins,at.
previously,the court held that the difference between an abstract question and a controversy contemplated by the declaratory judgment act is necessarily one of degree,and it would be difficult,if it would be possible,to fashion a precise test for determining in every case whether there is such a controversy.cas.pac.coal oil.in medimmune,the court the correct standard for determining a justiciable declaratory judgment action basically,the question in each case is whether the facts alleged,under all the circumstances,show that there is a substantial controversy,between the parties having adverse legal interests,of sufficient immediacy and reality to warrant the issuance of a declaratory judgment.id.citing.cas,at.
thus,medimmune teaches that in a declaratory judgment action,all the circumstances must demonstrate that a justiciable article iii controversy exists.a justiciable article iii controversy requires the party instituting the action to have standing and the issue presented to the court to be ripe.lujan defenders of wildlife,d.
article iii standing requires a plaintiff to allege personal injury fairly traceable to the defendant allegedly unlawful conduct and likely to be redressed by the requested relief.allen wright,d.of the three standing requirements,is the most determinative w hatever else the case or controversy requirement embodie s,its essence is a requirement of injury in fact.schlesinger reservists comm.to stop the war,d citing ass of data processing serv,camp,d.an must be personal,concrete and particularized,and actual or imminent.lujan,at.warth seldin,d.
under the declaratory judgment standard,all the circumstances must demonstrate the article iii justiciability requirement that the case be ripe for judicial review.abbott labs.gardner,d.the doctrine of ripeness focuses on the conduct of the defendant to determine whether the defendants actions have harmed,are harming,or are about to harm the plaintiff.ripeness can be an issue in obtaining anticipatory relief like declaratory judgments.id.at.a controversy is ripe if the question presented is fit for judicial review,meaning it is entirely or substantially a question of law and postponing a decision would work a substantial hardship on the challenging party.id.at.applying the test and holding that a regulation requiring drug manufacturers to change labeling was ripe for review before it was enforced because the regulation had an immediate and expensive impact on the plaintiffs operations and plaintiffs risked a substantial sanction for.
similar to the ripeness doctrine and based on the same constitutional controversy requirement is the court prohibition against advisory opinions.under this doctrine,federal courts are to decide only actual controversies by judgment which can be carried into effect,and not to give opinions upon moot questions or abstract propositions,or to declare principles or rules of law which can not affect the matter in the case before it.local,oil,chem.atomic workers int l union missouri,d.although there can be a fine line between declaratory judgments and advisory opinions,the supreme court maintains the necessity of avoiding issuing advisory opinions based upon hypothetical facts.bond share sec.exch.comm n.
notwithstanding the court justiciability precedent,it is well established that congress by legislation may expand standing to the full extent permitted by a rticle iii of the constitution,thus permitting litigation by one who otherwise would be barred.gladstone realtors vill.of bellwood,d.congress,however,can not expand standing beyond the article iii jurisdiction of federal courts.id.thus,as long as congress remains within constitutional limits,it may enact statutes creating legal rights,the invasion of which creates standing,even though no injury would exist without the statute.linda richard,d citing trafficante metro.life ins,d white,concurring.
the declaratory judgment act and e are examples of legislation that expand standing to constitutional limits and provide a way for plaintiffs to bring actions in federal court when they might otherwise be barred.the sole requirement for federal court jurisdiction under both provisions is an actual controversy,a,which is the same as an article iii case or controversy.see aetna life,at.this means that under both provisions,a declaratory judgment plaintiff is only required to satisfy article iii,which includes standing and ripeness,by showing under all the circumstances an actual or imminent injury caused by the defendant that can be redressed by judicial relief and that is of sufficient immediacy and reality to warrant the issuance of a declaratory judgment.medimmune.at internal citations omitted 
in the instant case,we follow the court analysis in medimmune in determining whether teva has a justiciable controversy within the meaning of article iii.id.by following medimmune,we recognize that we are not relying on our test.see,pfizer,at.this court respects the principle of stare decisis and follows its own precedential decisions unless the decisions are overruled by the court en banc,or by other controlling authority such as an intervening supreme court decision.am.oil dep t of energy,en banc.
under our patent jurisprudence,we developed a test to determine if an actual controversy exists in a general declaratory judgment action for patent or invalidity.see,pfizer,at.this test requires both an explicit threat or other action by the patentee,which creates a reasonable apprehension on the part of the declaratory plaintiff that it will face an infringement suit and present activity which could constitute infringement or concrete steps taken with the intent to conduct such an activity.see,id.
in medimmune,the supreme court in a detailed footnote stated that our reasonable apprehension of suit test conflicts and would contradict several cases in which the supreme court found that a declaratory judgment plaintiff had a justiciable controversy.at.in medimmune,the court disagreed with our reasonable apprehension of imminent suit test and that the actual controversy requirement in the declaratory judgment act is the same as the cases and controversies requirement in article iii.id.at.the court further that an actual controversy requires only that a dispute be definite and concrete,touching the legal relations of parties having adverse legal interests and that it be real and substantial and admi t of specific relief through a decree of a conclusive character,as distinguished from an opinion advising what the law would be upon a hypothetical set of facts.id.quoting aetna life ins,at.the court summarized the declaratory judgment actual controversy requirement by quoting the all the circumstances test from maryland casualty.id.thus,because the supreme court in medimmune cautioned that our declaratory judgment test contradict s and conflicts with its precedent,these federal circuit tests have been overruled by an intervening supreme court decision.am.oil,at see also,sandisk stmicroelectronics.therefore,we follow medimmune teaching to look at all the circumstances under maryland casualty to determine whether teva has a justiciable article iii controversy.
the district court was bound by our precedent in pfizer to apply the test to teva declaratory judgment action.teva,slip op.at,wl.in applying this test,the district court considered teva standing and concluded that teva had failed to establish the type of that we required in pfizer because teva could not show a reasonable apprehension of imminent suit.teva,slip op.at,wl see pfizer,at requiring a showing of imminent suit.the district court found that because teva could not establish an article iii controversy under our precedent,it did not have jurisdiction and dismissed teva declaratory judgment action.
we hold that medimmune applies to teva declaratory judgment action and takes precedence over the district court application of pfizer,which required teva to show a single type of article iii,a reasonable apprehension of imminent suit.at.the question in this case is whether teva has a justiciable controversy within article iii,which is the only limitation on our jurisdiction under the declaratory judgment act.see.an article iii controversy is found where a plaintiff has demonstrated an caused by the defendant that can be redressed by the court.see steel,at.in the present case,only the concrete requirement under article iii is in dispute.
we hold that under all the circumstances as found in this case,teva has an and therefore has a justiciable article iii controversy.here,novartis argues that there is no actual controversy between it and teva on the four method patents in spite of teva paragraph iv certifications of the four method patents because novartis has not filed suit nor threatened to sue teva on the method patents.moreover,novartis contends that the suit on the patent is an entirely different controversy.novartis is incorrect.there is no question that novartis has already filed suit based on teva act of infringement in submitting the anda.under e a,submitting an anda,regardless of how many paragraph iv certifications it may contain,is a single act of infringement it shall be an act of infringement to anda application for a drug claimed in a patent or for the use of which is claimed in a patent.emphasis added.while it is true that the suit on the patent is a different case than teva declaratory judgment action,novartis created a present and actual controversy by choosing to sue under e a on teva single act of infringement,thereby placing into actual dispute the soundness of teva anda and teva ability to secure approval of the anda.thus,while teva declaratory judgment action and the pending suit are different cases,they arise from the same controversy created when novartis listed its famvir patents in the orange book,teva submitted its anda certifying all five famvir patents under paragraph iv,and novartis sued teva challenging the submission of teva anda 
novartis conduct raises the questions of if and how e applies to multiple suits between the same parties on the submission of a single anda with more than one paragraph iv certification.it is clear from the statutory language that recovering damages for a e a infringement action is only time barred by the statutory statute of limitations.see n o recovery shall be had for any infringement committed more than six years prior to the filing of the complaint or counterclaim for infringement in the action.see also,aukerman chaides const,explaining that is not a statute of limitations in the sense of barring a suit for infringement but rather a limit to recovery to damages for infringing acts committed within six years of the date of the filing of the infringement action.thus,novartis has the right of an immediate action against teva under e a on any or all of the remaining famvir orange book patents these actions could be brought at any time until the patents expire and damages would be limited only by the limitations period.while it is unclear whether novartis would be prohibited from suing under the doctrine of claim preclusion,teva remains under the threat of an infringement suit because the statutory window does not preclude novartis from pursuing additional infringement suits under e a.in light of novartis pending suit on the same anda,this threat of litigation is a present injury creating a justiciable controversy.moreover,novartis retains the right to sue teva under the famvir patents pursuant to a.therefore,novartis has numerous opportunities to bring an action at any time for patent infringement and is not precluded by the window.
the district court erred in finding that teva did not demonstrate an article iii controversy.teva,slip op.at,wl.a justiciable controversy can arise from either an actual or an imminent injury.while it is true that several of teva grounds alleging an actual controversy when standing alone might not be sufficient,if taken as a whole these circumstances establish a justiciable controversy with novartis that can be resolved by allowing teva to bring a declaratory judgment.
first,novartis listed its famvir patents in the orange book.by so doing,novartis represents that a claim of patent infringement could reasonably be asserted if a person not licensed by the owner engaged in the manufacture,use or sale of generic famciclovir covered by the claims of its listed famvir patents.b see pfizer,at mayer,dissenting.while this conduct on its own may not be sufficient to establish an article iii controversy,it is a circumstance to be considered in determining whether a justiciable controversy exists under the totality of the circumstances.
a second circumstance that supports teva claim of a justiciable controversy is teva submission of its anda certifying that it did not infringe novartis famvir orange book patents or that the patents were invalid.the very act of submitting an anda is an act of infringement.e see eli lilly medtronic,d holding that the statute creates an act of infringement that consists of submitting an anda containing the fourth type of certification.there is no question that under e,novartis would have an immediate justiciable controversy against teva as soon as teva submitted the anda indeed,that is exactly what occurred in this case.it logically follows that if such an action creates a justiciable controversy for one party,the same action should create a justiciable declaratory judgment controversy for the opposing party.in fact,the supreme court has stated it is immaterial that frequently,in the declaratory judgment suit,the positions of the parties in the conventional suit are reversed the inquiry is the same in either case.cas,at.this conclusion is supported in the legislative history of the civil action to obtain patent certainty amendment to the act 
t he act has always provided that patent owners and brand drug companies can bring patent infringement suits against a generic applicant immediately upon receiving notice that the generic applicant is challenging a patent by filing an anda.the anda declaratory judgment provisions simply level the playing field by making it clear that the generic applicant can also seek a prompt resolution of these patent issues by bringing a declaratory judgment action if it is not sued within days.
cong.rec,remarks of kennedy,ranking member of the senate help committee.
a third circumstance we find relevant in determining whether teva has established an actual controversy is the combination of three statutory provisions the civil action to obtain patent certainty under j c the anda declaratory judgment provision under e and the purpose of the act.the civil action to obtain patent certainty,which was enacted in is designed to prevent patentees from gaming the act see j c.this amendment specifically permits an anda applicant to file a declaratory judgment action under against the patent owner or the drug company for a declaratory judgment that the patent listed in the orange book is invalid or will not be infringed by the drug covered by the anda if the patentee has not brought an infringement action within days.id.by virtue of e,congress extended federal court jurisdiction over these anda declaratory judgment actions to the extent consistent with the constitution.e.
by filing a lawsuit on only one its five patents certified under paragraph iv in teva anda,novartis has tried to simultaneously leverage the benefits provided to a patentee under the act and avoid the patentee accompanying responsibilities.novartis patent suit against teva has invoked the statutory automatic stay and is concurrently insulating the four method patents from a validity challenge.in the statute,congress explicitly required that in exchange for the stay,patentees were to reasonably cooperate in expediting the action of whether the paragraph iv patents were invalid or not infringed j b iii.novartis action insulates it from any judicial determination of the metes and bounds of the scope of the claims of its four famvir method patents in relation to,a determination that is central to the proper function of our patent system and is a central purpose of the act.teva pharm.usa,pfizer,rehearing en banc denied gajarsa,dissenting.
it is clear from the legislative history that congress intended this civil action to adjudicate the very controversy that novartis has created here 
the provision a civil action to obtain patent certainty is intended to clarify that federal district courts are to entertain such suits for declaratory judgments so long as there is a case or controversy under article iii of the constitution.we fully expect that,in almost all situations where a generic applicant has challenged a patent by filing an anda with a paragraph iv certification and not been sued for patent infringement,a claim by the generic applicant seeking declaratory judgment on the patent will give rise to a justiciable case or controversy under the constitution.we believe that the only circumstance in which a case or controversy might not exist would arise in the rare circumstance in which the patent owner and brand drug company have given the generic applicant a covenant not to sue,or otherwise formally acknowledge that the generic applicant drug does not infringe.
the mere fact that neither the patent owner nor the brand drug company has brought a patent infringement suit within days against a generic applicant does not mean there is no case or controversy.the sole purpose of requiring the passage of days is to provide the patent owner and drug company the first opportunity to begin patent litigation.inaction within the period proves nothing,as there are tactical reasons why a patent owner or brand drug company might refrain from bringing suit on a patent within days.
for example,the brand drug company might have several patents listed in the food and drug administration orange book with respect to a particular drug.it could be in the company interest to bring suit within days on one patent and to hold the others in res
