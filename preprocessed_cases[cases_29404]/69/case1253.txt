this litigation involves proposition,enacted pursuant to arizona voter initiative in.the proposition amended arizona law to require persons wishing to register to vote for the first time in arizona to present proof of citizenship,and to require all arizona voters to present identification when they vote in person at the polls.
plaintiffs are arizona residents,indian tribes and various community organizations.they filed this action in district court,challenging the validity of the proposition on six asserted grounds that it is an unconstitutional poll tax,in violation of the amendment to the united states constitution that it violates the equal protection clause of the fourteenth amendment because it imposes a disproportionate burden on naturalized citizens that it impedes the fourteenth amendment guarantee of the fundamental right to vote that it violates section of the voting rights act,a that it violates the civil rights act,a a and b and that it violates the national voter registration act,et.nvra.
plaintiffs filed their complaint in may,seeking an injunction,pending trial,against the operation of both the registration and the voting provisions of the proposition.on september,the district court denied a preliminary injunction.shortly before the november general election,plaintiffs filed their notice of appeal and also sought,from a motions panel of this court,an emergency interlocutory injunction.time was of the essence to plaintiffs because the general election was imminent.a regular motions panel of this court granted the requested relief and,in a brief order,enjoined enforcement of the proposition provisions.
on the application of the state and four counties,the supreme court vacated the emergency injunction because the motions panel gave no reasons for its action.see purcell gonzalez,d.the supreme court explained that,because the motions panel had not provided any reasoning,it could not determine whether the panel had given appropriate deference to the district court denial of the requested relief.id.at.in a separate opinion,justice stevens stressed that the case would benefit from the development of a full record regarding both the scope of voter disenfranchisement resulting from enforcement of the proposition and the prevalence and character of the ostensible voter fraud that the proposition was intended to counter.id.at opinion of stevens,concurring.
in the wake of the supreme court opinion,plaintiffs chose not to continue to seek injunctive relief with respect to the voting identification requirement.before us now,on the same underlying record that was before the motions panel,is plaintiffs appeal of the district court denial of preliminary injunctive relief with respect only to the voter registration requirement.we conclude that the district court did not abuse its discretion in denying injunctive relief with respect to this requirement,because the limited record before us does not establish that the balance of hardships and likelihood of success on the merits of plaintiffs claims justify an injunction at this stage of the proceedings.the litigation remains pending in the district court.there,final resolution of the scope of any appropriate permanent relief can be determined on the basis of a fully developed record,and well before the next general election in.
background 
voters approved proposition in the general election,and it was enacted on december.see.in relevant part,proposition amended arizona law to direct registering voters to submit evidence of united states citizenship with the application and the registrar to reject the application if no evidence of citizenship is attached.a.satisfactory evidence of citizenship may be shown by including,with the voter registration form,any of the following the number of an arizona driver license or identification license issued after october,the date arizona began requiring proof of lawful presence in the united states to obtain a license a legible copy of a birth certificate a legible copy of a united states passport united states naturalization documents or the number of the certificate of naturalization other documents or methods of proof that may be established pursuant to federal immigration law.f.the law applies to voters registered in arizona before its effective date only if they seek to change registration from one county to another.g.
the election was the first general election to which proposition applied.plaintiffs filed their challenges to it on may,and immediately moved for a preliminary injunction against both the proof of citizenship requirement and the voter identification requirement.on september,the district court denied plaintiffs motion but did not issue findings of fact and conclusions of law at that time.
plaintiffs appealed the denial to this court and the clerk set a briefing schedule that concluded on november,weeks after the general election.plaintiffs therefore requested an injunction pending appeal that,pursuant to this court rules then in effect,was heard by a motions panel.see cir.on october,the motions panel issued an order granting plaintiffs emergency request for an injunction pending appeal,retaining the briefing schedule,and stating the court enjoins implementation of proposition voting identification requirement in connection with arizona november,general election and enjoins proposition registration proof of citizenship requirements so that voters can register before the october,registration deadline.this injunction shall remain in effect pending disposition of the merits of these appeals.order in,filed,at.
four days later,the motions panel denied defendants request for reconsideration.the district court had not yet entered findings of fact and conclusions of law.the state and four counties then sought relief from the injunction in the united states supreme court.on october,while review by the supreme court was still pending,the district court issued the findings of fact and conclusions of law explaining its denial of the preliminary injunction.the findings stated that,although plaintiffs had shown some likelihood of success on the merits of some of their claims,the court could not conclude at this stage that they have shown a strong likelihood of success on any of the claims.it further concluded that the balance of hardships tipped sharply in favor of defendants,the state and counties that were all fully prepared to enforce the proposition provisions.
on october,the supreme court issued its opinion in which it construed the state filing as a petition for certiorari,granted the petition,and vacated the motions panel injunction.see purcell.at.the opinion did not affect plaintiffs underlying appeal of the district court denial of preliminary injunctive relief,which remained pending in this court.following the supreme court order vacating the emergency injunction pending appeal,the parties proceeded to brief the merits of the appeal.at that point elected to limit their appeal to the registration identification requirement.the voter identification requirement therefore is not before us.
because appellants moved for a preliminary injunction before any evidentiary proceedings could occur,the information in the record regarding proposition effect on voter registration is not extensive.it contains affidavits from four individuals who claim the new law burdens their right to vote.all four lack a driver license,a birth certificate or any other document sufficient to register to vote.it also indicates that,between and the present,as many as tried to register to vote and that the state prosecuted ten of those alleged.the record is silent,however,as to how many illegally registered to vote without detection,and also as to how many arizona citizens lack all of the documents for registration the state will accept.according to data extrapolated from population estimates and voter registration rolls,voter registration in arizona appears to have declined since january,but this data provides no enlightenment as to the extent or cause of the registration decline.
in its findings of fact and conclusions of law,the district court found that,while plaintiffs had s
