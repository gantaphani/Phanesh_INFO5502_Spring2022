defendant professional engineers in california government pecg is the exclusive bargaining agent for a unit of california state employees and has entered into a agreement with the state.the agreement contains a union security clause.plaintiffs are engineers who are members of the bargaining unit but nonmembers of pecg.as such,they are obligated to pay fees.
plaintiffs allege that pecg failed to provide proper notice to fee payers as required by chicago teachers union,local hudson,d,and that pecg improperly categorized certain activities as representational.with respect to the first claim,pecg concedes that the notice was defective.we hold that the proper remedy for a defective notice is issuance of a proper notice with a renewed opportunity for objection.we also hold that plaintiffs are judicially estopped from pursuing their second claim.
a union that represents employees in a unit has a legal obligation to represent equally all employees in the bargaining unit,whether or not they are members of the union.in lucas nlrb,cir,we explained 
the supreme court has long recognized that a union has a statutory duty of fair representation under the national labor relations act nlra.see vaca sipes,d.although the act does not explicitly articulate this duty,the court has held that the duty is implied from the grant under a of the nlra,a ed,of the union exclusive power to represent all employees in a particular bargaining unit.breininger sheet metal workers int l ass local union,d.in breininger,the court reasoned that this authority to represent all employees necessarily included the obligation to do so in a manner.see id.at.
because all employees benefit from the union representation,the supreme court has held that nonmembers constitutionally may be compelled to contribute their pro rata share of the costs incurred in obtaining the benefits of representation.abood detroit bd.of,d.as our court has recognized it is settled law that a union may charge nonunion employees certain fees to pay for their fair share of the union cost of negotiating and administering a collective bargaining agreement.cummings connell,cir,cert.denied,d.
the agreement between pecg and the state contains a union security clause,which requires to pay fees for the union representational activities.these fees commonly are known as fair share or agency fees.under the first amendment,however,a fee payer has a right to decide whether to pay for political and expressive activities that are unrelated to collective bargaining.hudson,at.n onunion employees do have a constitutional right to prevent the union spending a part of their required service fees to contribute to political candidates and to express political views unrelated to its duties as exclusive bargaining representative.quoting abood,at.california law also entitles a member to a refund,upon request,of the portion of the fee that is not related to the union representational activities.cal.gov t code.thus,although a union may charge fee payers the full equivalent of union dues,a fee payer may object to paying for nonrepresentational expenses.the expenditures that a union may not charge if a fee payer objects are commonly called nonchargeable expenditures.
to facilitate fee payers first amendment choice,the union must provide fee payers with an adequate explanation of the basis for the fee.hudson,at.this explanation is referred to as a hudson notice.in the hudson notice,each major category of expenditures is classified as chargeable,nonchargeable,or partly chargeable to objecting fee payers.those classifications are referred to as the union chargeability determinations.
the union also must provide to nonmembers an opportunity to object to paying for nonchargeable expenditures,as well as an opportunity to challenge before an impartial decisionmaker the union calculation of the amount of the fee.id.
this appeal concerns two kinds of claims that the hudson notice was defective,so that fee payers could not make an informed decision whether to object,and that certain chargeability determinations were improper.
factual and procedural history 
pecg is the exclusive representative of employees in state bargaining unit.in march,pecg issued a hudson notice to about fee payers.the notice classified as chargeable a number of expenditures,including expenditures under the headings legislative activity related to collective bargaining,initiatives,and action.
in response to the hudson notice,nonmember fee payers objected to paying the full fee,and they objected to the classification of the expenditures in the three foregoing categories as chargeable.the objectors filed this action in july.more than two years later,the district court certified a class consisting of all individuals who,at any time between april and october,were california state employees in the bargaining unit represented by pecg,were not members of pecg,and had fees deducted from their pay.
in response to a series of motions for summary adjudication,the district court eventually held that the march hudson notice was insufficient as a matter of law because it contained unaudited financial information and pecg had failed to show how any of the challenged expenditures was germane to activity.the district court therefore granted plaintiffs motion for summary judgment.the court also awarded nominal damages and compensatory damages to each member of the class.
pecg brought this timely appeal,and plaintiffs timely.

discussion 
appeala.the remedy for pecg defective hudson notice is a new,proper notice with a renewed opportunity to object.
as noted,the supreme court has established certain safeguards in connection with the collection of fees,including an adequate explanation of the basis for the fee.hudson,at.pecg does not appeal the district court determination that the hudson notice it provided in march was inadequate to explain the basis for the fee.
the question naturally arises,then,what is the appropriate remedy for issuance of a defective hudson notice pecg argues that the remedy for a bad notice is a good notice,resulting in a new opportunity to object and obtain a refund of the nonchargeable portion of the fee with interest,while plaintiffs argue that a bad notice invalidates the collection of any nonchargeable amounts for the period covered by the notice,resulting in a refund of all such amounts to fee payers.for the two reasons that follow,we agree with pecg.
first,we consider the function of a hudson notice and the kind of harm that arises from issuance of an inadequate notice.the purpose of the hudson notice is to provide fee payers with adequate information so that they may decide whether to object or to challenge the union calculation.cummings,at citing hudson,at.an inadequate notice gives fee payers insufficient information with which to decide whether or not to object to paying portions of the fee that are unrelated to representational activities.a new,conforming notice,with a renewed opportunity for fee payers to object to paying nonchargeable amounts,addresses that harm.following a new,conforming notice,fee payers could object,and objectors would be entitled to a refund of the nonchargeable portion of the fee,with interest 
by contrast,an automatic refund to every fee payer would violate a fundamental principle announced by the supreme court that dissent on the part of properly notified nonmembers is not to be presumed.see mitchell unified sch,cir d issent is not must affirmatively be made known to the union by the dissenting employee.quoting int l ass of machinists street,d.as explained in hudson,the nonunion employee has the burden of objection.at.it would be illogical to refund all nonchargeable amounts upon holding that a hudson notice was defective,because no nonmember would have had the opportunity to object to an equally protected right under the first to pay the nonchargeable expenses.
the second reason for our conclusion is our case law.in cummings,a union had issued defective hudson notices,but then issued a proper notice.nonmember fee payers sued the union.the objectors sought damages,claiming that the union could not unring the bell by providing a correct notice thirteen months after it began deducting fees and that a refund of the nonchargeable portion is the minimum permitted by our caselaw.cummings,at.we disagreed,relying on the rules that apply to unions that must issue notices.we observed that,i f a notice pursuant to communications workers of america beck,d,the equivalent to hudson,is defective,the union must send a corrected notice,and issue retroactive refunds,with interest,to fee payers who object to the corrected notice.id.we noted that the union eventually issued a proper hudson notice and gave the nonmembers a renewed opportunity to object.in that circumstance we fail ed to see how plaintiffs suffered any compensable harm aside from nominal damages from the initial defective notice.id.at.thus,we held that the nonmembers who did not object to the proper notice that was finally issued were not entitled to compensatory damages,even in the amount of the nonchargeable portion of the fee.id.
cummings thus stands for the proposition that,because the injury that fee payers suffer from an inadequate hudson notice is the lack of an informed opportunity to object,the proper remedy is for the union to issue proper notice and give another opportunity for objection.
the cummings panel was careful to note the district court finding that the union in that case had acted in good faith.id.in this case,similarly,there has been no showing of bad faith on the part of pecg.
the remedy ordered in cummings for a notice is in line with the remedies established for inadequate notices.in nlrb general motors,d,the supreme court approved of an arrangement in which a private employer workers could decline to join the union,but remain employed,without running afoul of a union security agreement.this arrangement has come to be termed an agency shop.id.at.in beck,at,the supreme court held that,under a private employer agency shop agreement,employees who do not wish to become members of the union must pay only those fees related to collective bargaining,contract administration,and grievance adjustment.see also brian woldow,the nlrb slowly developing beck jurisprudence defending a right in a politicized agency,admin.private employers must issue a beck notice,which is very similar to a hudson notice,to nonunion members.rochester,wl,aff mem.sub nom.cecil nlrb,cir unpublished disposition,cert.denied,d.
the cummings remedy also accords with that of united food commercial workers union,local nlrb,cir en banc,reinstating relevant portion of panel opinion,cir.in that case,the en banc court reinstated a portion of the panel opinion that had held that the proper remedy for a defective notice was to reissue a proper notice to those who had received the defective notice,to give those nonmembers an opportunity to submit objections nunc pro tunc,and to rebate the nonchargeable portions of the fee to all objecting fee payers.id.
plaintiffs urge us to hold that the proper remedy for a constitutionally inadequate hudson notice is the refund of the entire nonchargeable portion of the fees.they rely on prescott county of el dorado,cir prescott i,vacated and remanded on other grounds,d,reinstated in relevant part,cir prescott ii.
in prescott i,we rejected a fee payer argument that the remedy for a defective hudson notice was a total refund of all collected fees.see prescott i,at prescott asserts that he must simply be given full restitution of all amounts collected from him,even though it must of necessity be true that some substantial portion of the fee was used for properly chargeable purposes.with that extreme position we do not agree.rather,we remanded the case to the district court,explaining that 
all disputed fees must be deposited into an interest bearing escrow account.the district court must then determine just what is chargeable and what is not.however,full restitution of the fees is not required if,as we think will surely be the case,at least some portion will be allocated to properly chargeable expenses.
out of context,this passage from prescott i might be interpreted to stand for the proposition that the proper remedy for an improper notice is the return of the nonchargeable amounts to all fee payers,including nonmembers who did not object.the tenth circuit applies such a rule.see wessel city of albuquerque,cir a union violation of procedural requirements for the collection of fair share fees entitle s nonmembers to a refund of the portion of the amounts collected that exceed what could be properly charged.in context,prescott i can not be read to stand for such a sweeping proposition.
unlike this appeal,in which plaintiffs represent a class of all nonmembers,including nonobjectors,prescott involved a request by five individual plaintiffs for a preliminary injunction restraining the employer and the union from collecting any fees from plaintiffs,or otherwise enforcing the agency shop arrangement,until a constitutionally adequate notice has been provided and constitutionally adequate procedures are in place and operating.prescott county of el dorado,see also prescott i,at.prescott did not involve a mixed class including both objectors and nonobjectors having sued the union,the five plaintiffs in prescott can hardly be said to be presumed not to object.accordingly,we did not reach the issue whether the union must issue refunds to all nonmembers,even to those who did not object.nor did we have occasion to determine whether,after a calculation of properly chargeable expenditures has been made,the proper remedy would be to require the union to issue a new,proper hudson notice to give fee payers a new,informed opportunity to object.prescott therefore is not inconsistent with cummings and local.
plaintiffs also point out that the rule that objection can not be presumed,and that the burden to object is on the nonmember,is often discussed as attaching only upon provision of proper notice.see,cummings,at ordinarily,if there is a proper hudson notice,the employee has the burden to object to paying the full nonmember fee,and only then is entitled to a refund of the nonchargeable portion of the fee.this principle makes sense,for it would be unfair to require a nonmember to object when the nonmember has,as a matter of law,not been adequately informed of the facts.but plaintiffs proposed dissent could be presumed,as a protection to uninformed fail to respect the fee payers first amendment rights as running both ways.the fundamental right at issue is the right to be informed before making a choice whether to pay for expenditures to honor that right,proper hudson notice is required.basic considerations of fairness,as well as concern for the first amendment rights at stake,dictate that the potential objectors be given sufficient information to gauge the propriety of the union fee.hudson,at.
to summarize,the district court erred in awarding damages as a remedy for pecg improper hudson notice.the proper remedy is an order requiring pecg to issue a proper notice,with a renewed opportunity for nonmembers to object to paying the nonchargeable portion of the fee,and to receive a refund,with interest,of that amount 
plaintiffs are judicially estopped from reviving the chargeability claim that they disclaimed earlier in the litigation 
the district court granted summary judgment to plaintiffs on the chargeability issue.we hold that the district court erred in reaching the merits of that claim,because plaintiffs were judicially estopped from pursuing it.
judicial estoppel generally 
judicial estoppel,sometimes also known as the doctrine of preclusion of inconsistent positions,precludes a party from gaining an advantage by taking one position,and then seeking a second advantage by taking an incompatible position.rissetto plumbers steamfitters local,cir.judicial estoppel is an equitable doctrine that is intended to protect the integrity of the judicial process by preventing a litigant from playing fast and loose with the courts.russell rolfs,cir internal quotation marks omitted.judicial estoppel applies to a party stated position whether it is an expression of intention,a statement of fact,or a legal assertion.helfand gerson,cir.
plaintiffs took the position before the district court that they were not pursuing a chargeability claim.
plaintiffs filed a brief before the district court in support of their motion for a preliminary injunction.in that brief,plaintiffs argued,among other things,that pecg hudson notice was legally deficient because it improperly classified certain expenditures as chargeable.pecg filed a counterclaim,alleging that plaintiffs had failed to exhaust their remedies with respect to a challenge to the amount of the fee.see regs.tit,if an agency fee payer disagrees with the exclusive representative determination of the agency fee amount,that employee may file an agency fee objection.such agency fee objection shall be filed with the exclusive representative.an agency fee objector may file an unfair practice charge that challenges the amount of the agency fee however,no complaint shall issue until the agency fee objector has first exhausted the exclusive representative agency fee appeal procedure.no objector shall be required to exhaust the agency fee appeal procedure where it is insufficient on its face.
in a response,plaintiffs moved to dismiss the counterclaim.they argued that the foregoing regulation do es not require exhaustion of pecg appeal procedures before the may file a lawsuit.the regulations require exhaustion only before an individual may file a state unfair labor practice charge.they made the same assertion in the section of their reply to defendant pecg opposition to plaintiffs motion to dismiss pecg counterclaim that related directly to the exhaustion requirement.
in addition to arguing that california exhaustion requirement does not apply to litigation,plaintiffs made an alternative claim.they contended that,if the regulation applied to litigation,exhaustion still was not required because they were not challeng ing the amount of the agency fee.regs.tit,a.plaintiffs asserted strenuously that pecg had misunderstood their claim 
ii.this lawsuit alleges that the defendants procedures are inadequate,and therefore the defendants may not take one penny from the 
pecg clearly does not understand the allegations.the repeat yet again that they challenge the constitutionality of the defendants procedures in taking fair share fees.the allege that pecg and defendant connell have not complied with the procedures that are constitutionally required under hudson,for the taking of any fees.put another way,the allege that neither pecg nor connell has any right to take one cent from the,because the constitutional procedural requirements have not been complied with.the do not allege that the fee is simply too high.the do allege that the defendants procedures for taking the fee are constitutionally inadequate.
the implication here is even if the regulations do require exhaustion of pecg internal appeals process before a action against the fee may be filed,the regulations do not bar this action.the regulations require exhaustion when the fee payer challenges the amount of the fee.the regulations do not require a fee payer to exhaust the union appeal procedure where it is insufficient on its face.a.here,the allege that pecg procedures for taking fair share fees are insufficient under hudson.
although the non members explained this in their memorandum supporting their motion to dismiss,pecg has failed to respond.thus,pecg should be dismissed.
the district court granted plaintiffs motion to dismiss the nonexhaustion counterclaim in an order filed on november.the district court recited,and then relied on,plaintiffs second argument,that is,the argument that the regulation does not apply to parties bringing a hudson notice challenge,as opposed to a challenge to the amount of the fair share fee.emphasis added.
the dissent argues that the district court november,order demonstrates that plaintiffs did not,in fact,disavow a chargeability claim.with respect,we believe that the order can not fairly be read that way.
the district court clearly separated the hudson informational issue from the lehnert ferris faculty ass n,d,chargeability issue and chided plaintiffs for conflating the two.the court explained plaintiffs argument here conflates pecg notice compliance under hudson with a determination as to whether expenses are properly chargeable.the district court continued,in a footnote 
although plaintiffs concede in their reply to plaintiffs motion to dismiss pecg counterclaim that regs.a requires exhaustion of administrative remedies prior to a nonmembers challenge to the amount of the fair share fee,they improperly attempt to combine their notice challenge with a challenge to their fair share fees in this motion.
the district court thus understood what the dissent refuses to acknowledge there is no such thing as a hudson chargeability claim.as the district court correctly noted,we have previously held that there is a 
clear distinction between the adequacy of a union notice addressed by the supreme court in hudson,and the propriety of a union chargeability determinations,considered separately by the supreme court in lehnert 
we agree with the sixth and seventh circuits that at the notice stage,we do not decide whether expenses are properly chargeable.
knight kenai peninsula borough sch,cir.
in view of our holding in knight,as a matter of definition it can not be,as the dissent claims,that plaintiffs were challenging both the informational deficiencies and the inclusion of inappropriate charges as violations of hudson.dissent at.hudson governs the adequacy of information,while lehnert governs chargeability.there is a procedure for challenging the amount of the fees,but this procedure is not encompassed in a hudson challenge.
after separating the two types of claims,the district court turned to the question whether plaintiffs were pursuing a chargeability claim.in the section of the november,order entitled exhaustion of administrative remedies,the district court noted that pecg counterclaim asserted that plaintiffs were required to exhaust their state administrative remedies before filing the present action insofar as it challenged chargeability.the district court held that for the reasons stated below,these sections are not implicated by this action and therefore plaintiffs are not required to first exhaust their administrative remedies before bringing this lawsuit.as we have observed,the reasons stated below were that plaintiffs assert that the california regulation requiring exhaustion of administrative remedies is inapplicable to parties bringing a hudson notice challenge,as opposed to a challenge to the amount of the fair share fee.emphasis added.the district court continued plaintiffs assert they challenge pecg actions for failure to comply with hudson,not because of questions involving the propriety of the fee determination.thus,in light of plaintiffs assertion,it does not appear that the exhaustion requirement of section a applies to this action.
to recap,the district court understood plaintiffs to be bringing only a hudson challenge.the district court also understood that plaintiffs wished their hudson challenge to include a chargeability component,but properly rebuked plaintiffs for trying to conflate hudson claims with chargeability claims in contravention of our holding in knight.having deemed this conflation improper,the district court went on to note that the california code section requiring administrative exhaustion was not implicated because of plaintiffs assertion that they challenge pecg actions for failure to comply with hudson,not because of questions involving the propriety of the fee determination.what was left at the end of this analysis,then,was only a hudson challenge,devoid of any improper chargeability component.
in its november,order,the district court repeated and relied on plaintiffs assertion that they were not bringing a chargeability claim separate from their hudson claim.plaintiffs might have prevailed had they brought a chargeability claim and continued to argue as the dissent contends that a action is not subject to the exhaustion requirement.that was plaintiffs original argument,but in the end they chose a different path ultimately the district court did not need to decide whether the exhaustion requirement applied because,as it recognized,plaintiffs were bringing only a hudson claim.plaintiffs abandoned,and the district court in its november,order understood them to have abandoned,any separate chargeability claim.
even if plaintiffs abandoned their chargeability claim as a result of a mistaken belief that they could pursue chargeability issues as part of their hudson claim,judicial estoppel applies.the district court plainly apprised them in the november,order of the proper analysis,and they did not seek reconsideration due to a purported mistake 
having demonstrated that plaintiffs abandoned the chargeability claim,we turn next to the question whether they sought an advantage by reviving that claim.plaintiffs won dismissal of the nonexhaustion counterclaim on the basis of their contention that they were challenging only the informational deficiencies of pecg hudson notice.later,however,in their third summary judgment motion,plaintiffs argued that the hudson notice was deficient because,among other things,it misclassified some expenditures as chargeable when they were in fact clearly nonchargeable.that is,plaintiffs argued that the fees surviving nonmembers objections were too high because they included amounts that were unrelated to representational activities.the district court chose to reach the merits of this chargeability claim,despite its earlier reliance on plaintiffs abandonment of such a claim in resolving the state administrative remedies issue.this decision on the merits of plaintiffs newly revived chargeability claim was therefore inconsistent with the district court carefully considered november,order.
plaintiffs gained an advantage by initially taking the position that they were not litigating the chargeability claim.in order for their action to survive pecg nonexhaustion counterclaim,plaintiffs had to persuade the district court that they were not required to exhaust their state administrative remedies.plaintiffs accomplished this aim by abandoning any chargeability claim.the district court therefore never ruled on the question whether a party bringing a action must first exhaust state administrative remedies,because plaintiffs assertion that they had abandoned a chargeability claim rendered the question irrelevant.plaintiffs gained the concrete advantage of having the district court dismiss pecg nonexhaustion counterclaim.
plaintiffs then sought a second advantage by taking the incompatible position that they were pursuing a chargeability claim.the district court decision to reach the merits of the chargeability claim revived the relevance of the counterclaim.but the district court reached the merits of the chargeability claim without ever deciding whether plaintiffs were required,as a matter of law,to exhaust their state administrative remedies before litigating a chargeability claim and,if so,whether they had exhausted those remedies.
by first taking the position that they were not litigating a chargeability claim,and later litigating a chargeability claim,plaintiffs gained the advantage of never having to persuade the district court that they were not obliged to exhaust their state remedies or that they had done so.the district court abused its discretion,because it permitted plaintiffs to enjoy the advantage that came with abandonment of the chargeability claims that is,continuation of the action,and then permitted plaintiffs to enjoy the advantage of the incompatible position that plaintiffs were in fact litigating a chargeability claim that is,a decision on the merits of the claim.allowing this change of position unfairly prejudiced pecg,because the district court avoided deciding the exhaustion issue raised in the counterclaim,but then allowed plaintiffs to enjoy a determination of their revived chargeability claim on the merits.
plaintiffs argue nonetheless that judicial estoppel should not apply here for three reasons,which we will consider in turn.
different remedies 
plaintiffs argue,first,that even if they did take inconsistent positions for strategic purposes,judicial estoppel would have no practical effect in this case.plaintiffs explain that they brought two claims a hudson claim that notice was defective due to nonconforming work performed by an auditor on the financial statements accompanying the notice,and the chargeability claim.plaintiffs argue that the first and second claims are alternative claims.they provide the same relief.
plaintiffs are wrong,because the remedies for the two claims are not the same.the remedy for a defective notice is the issuance of proper notice with a renewed opportunity to object.the remedy for overcharging is a refund of improperly charged fees.
inconsistent positions 
plaintiffs next argue that they did not give up their chargeability claim.they point particularly to this sentence in their reply the nonmembers do not allege that the fee is simply too high.plaintiffs parse the sentence closely,claiming that the word simply means that plaintiffs were alleging that the fee was too high,but that their claims went beyond that lone defect.
although that reading may be consistent with basic grammar the context surrounding the statement makes plaintiffs present claim untenable.the thrust of pecg counterclaim was that plaintiffs chargeability claim had not been properly exhausted under state law.the counterclaim,therefore,sought the dismissal of that claim only.a statement that there was some other portion of plaintiffs case that did not involve the chargeability claim would have been nonresponsive to the counterclaim.the district court quite naturally and obviously understood plaintiffs declaration to mean that they were not pursuing a chargeability claim.
federal rule of civil procedure e 
finally,plaintiffs argue that they were incapable of engaging in behavior giving rise to estoppel on the chargeability issue as a matter of law,because federal rule of civil procedure e precludes class members from compromising claims of class members without a fairness hearing.this argument is unavailing.rule e relates to the dismissal or compromise of a class action.the estoppel here has nothing to do with the dismissal or compromise of plaintiffs claims.instead,the question is the initial scope of plaintiffs complaint,as plaintiffs well understood when they stated in their reply that pecg clearly does not understand the allegations.
conclusion 
plaintiffs took a position before the district court that their litigation was grounded solely in a challenge to pecg hudson notice,but did not include a chargeability claim.they took that position to gain an advantage in the litigation.later,they sought and won summary judgment on the chargeability claim.this change in position is precisely the kind of playing fast and loose with the courts that the judicial estoppel doctrine is designed to prevent.russell,at internal quotation marks omitted.
having dismissed the nonexhaustion counterclaim based on plaintiffs representation that chargeability was not at issue,the district court abused its discretion in later granting partial summary judgment on the merits of plaintiffs resurrected chargeability claim.the district court abused its discretion because,if the amount of the fee was at issue,plaintiffs had to exhaust the exclusive representative agency fee appeal procedure,regs.tit,a,or convince the court that the exhaustion requirement did not apply,and the court did not find that plaintiffs had done either before reaching the merits of the chargeability claim 
a.the district court did not abuse its discretion in denying plaintiffs request for injunctive relief.
plaintiffs sought an injunction enjoining the collection of fees until compliance with hudson was achieved.the district court denied that relief.
plaintiffs claims that the district court abused its discretion do not satisfy the strong showing of abuse needed to reverse a district court denial of injunctive relief.see united states laerdal,cir.plaintiffs only live claim in this litigation is that the hudson notice was inadequate.a conclusion that the issuance of a proper notice,followed by an opportunity to object and receive a refund,with interest,of the nonchargeable portion of the fee,would compensate plaintiffs was a permissible one.see cummings,at in this case,the nonmembers all eventually received notices with sufficient information under hudson,and a renewed opportunity to object and receive their money back with interest.we fail to see how plaintiffs suffered any compensable harm aside from nominal damages from the initial defective notice.local,at reimbursement is due only those employees who received the letter and object.
b.the district court did not abuse its discretion in refusing to issue a declaratory judgment that california government code is unconstitutional as applied.
plaintiff schwall argues that the district court refusal to issue a declaratory judgment holding that california government code was unconstitutional as applied to him because it allegedly forced him to subsidize the union political activities was error.in its april,order,the district court explained 
plaintiffs have not persuasively argued why they need declaratory relief in this case there is no need to determine whether california government code section was applied in an unconstitutional manner to plaintiffs because application of that statute has not been shown to be the reason pecg violated plaintiffs first amendment rights.plaintiffs rights were violated because pecg misperceived its obligations under federal law 
the district court reasoning was sound plaintiffs right to receive proper notice and to object was vindicated under federal law,so it would have been superfluous to address the state claim.the court refusal to issue a declaratory judgment did not constitute an abuse of discretion.
c.the district court did not err in limiting the class definition and the relief to a period between march and october.
plaintiffs first two complaints in this action were based on pecg march hudson notice.when pecg issued an amended notice in october,the march notice ceased to have any effect because it had been replaced by the new amended notice.if there were a defect in the october notice,it had to be alleged separately the october notice was not identical to the march notice plaintiffs were not obliged to challenge the new notice,whose contents they could not know when they filed suit three months before it was issued,and the district court therefore properly relied on plaintiffs express challenge to the march notice alone.this very circumstance is the reason why federal rule of civil procedure d exists.see keith volpe,cir stating that.d is designed to permit expansion of the scope of existing litigation to include events that occur after the filing of the original complaint.
on november,plaintiffs represented in a joint status report that neither party anticipated amending the pleadings.the district court then issued a scheduling order,which provided that n o further joinder of parties or amendments to pleadings is permitted except with leave of court,good cause having been shown.plaintiffs did not object to the order.six months later,they moved for leave to file a second amended complaint,which was intended,in part,to update the facts including allegations that two additional notices did not satisfy hudson.the court denied the motion,explaining that plaintiffs failure to focus on the rule good cause standard in their amendment motion is fatal.
plaintiffs argue here that,although the district court did not err in refusing to permit amendment of the complaint to address the amended notice,the district court did err by construing the complaint unreasonably.plaintiffs claim that the district court was unreasonable when it eliminated liability for the period after the october notice was issued.in other words,plaintiffs argument is that the two accepted complaints include claims regarding the october notice,despite the facts that the two filed complaints referred only to the march notice and that the rejected second amended complaint sought to update the facts including allegations of deficiencies in the october notice.
federal rule of civil procedure d requires a party to obtain leave of the court to serve a supplemental pleading setting forth transactions or occurrences or events which have happened since the date of the pleading sought to be supplemented.plaintiffs recognized the applicability of that rule and,thus,the limitation on the claims asserted in the first amended complaint,when they sought,unsuccessfully,to amend the complaint to include allegations.the district court did not err in construing the complaint as limited to the period from march through october.
conclusion 
the proper relief for pecg concededly defective hudson notice is for the district court to order the prompt issuance of a proper hudson notice,with a renewed opportunity for fee payers to object and,if they object in a timely fashion,to receive refunds of the nonchargeable portion of the fee,with interest.plaintiffs are judicially estopped from pursuing their chargeability claim.plaintiffs is denied.
affirmed in part,reversed and remanded in part.costs on appeal awarded to defendant.
i respectfully dissent with regard to the majority conclusions that the district court erred in reaching the chargeability issue section of the discussion in the majority opinion,and that the district court did not err in limiting the class definition and relief to the period spanning march through october,section.i concur in the remainder of the majority opinion.
chargeability 
the district court granted summary judgment for plaintiffs on their claim that categories legislative activity related to collective bargaining,initiatives,and legislative political action were nonchargeable,ruling that pecg had fail ed to show how any of the challenged expenditures are germane to collective bargaining activity.the majority reverses this ruling based not on the merits,but on the doctrine of judicial estoppel.it does so even though it is beyond dispute that at least part of plaintiffs claim is valid and meritorious,as pecg now concedes that category was.see ante at.to reverse the district court and require the dismissal of an indisputably valid claim is surely extraordinary.it is also,in the context of this case,both inefficient and wrong.
the majority correctly recognizes that judicial estoppel is intended to preclude a party from taking inconsistent positions to its advantage.ante at.the supreme court has stated that a party later position must be clearly inconsistent with its earlier position.new hampshire maine,d.plaintiffs pursuit of the chargeability claim was not inconsistent,much less clearly inconsistent,with the position they took in litigating pecg counterclaim.
the majority states that plaintiffs gained an advantage by initially taking the position that they were not litigating the chargeability claim i n order for their action to survive pecg nonexhaustion counterclaim plaintiffs then sought a second advantage by taking the incompatible position that they were pursuing a chargeability claim.ante at emphasis in original.this reflects a fundamental misunderstanding of plaintiffs claims.plaintiffs at no time took the position that they were not litigating the chargeability claim.plaintiffs did challenge chargeability in the context of a hudson violation.plaintiffs claims all along were that the notice was procedurally deficient under hudson for two reasons it had not been audited as required by hudson,and it violated hudson by classifying clearly nonchargeable expenses as chargeable.
plaintiffs consistently challenged chargeability in the form of that second claim throughout the litigation.in the first amended verified complaint,plaintiffs alleged that pecg,by including clearly nonchargeable expenditures in the agency fee,failed to adopt procedures which ensure that the fee is lawful,as required by hudson.in their brief for a preliminary injunction,plaintiffs argued that a union violates hudson when its procedures are so inadequate that objecting are charged for expenditures that have clearly and repeatedly been held.in their brief supporting their motion for partial summary judgment,plaintiffs wrote,it remains the plaintiffs position that pecg inclusion of clearly nonchargeable categories of expenditures in chargeable expense totals reflected in the notices violated the requirements of hudson the district court understood that,both at the time of granting summary judgment to plaintiffs on their claim that the expenditures within categories,and were not properly chargeable,and,as will be illustrated below,at the time of granting plaintiffs motion to dismiss the pecg nonexhaustion counterclaim.
plaintiffs asserted grounds for dismissal of pecg counterclaim were not inconsistent with their chargeability claim.pecg counterclaim sought a declaratory judgment which,in effect,called for dismissal of plaintiffs claims for failure to exhaust internal union remedies under regs.tit,plaintiff responded with alternative arguments.one was that the state regulation did not require exhaustion of pecg internal appeal procedures before a lawsuit could be filed,because the state regulation by its terms only required exhaustion before the filing of a state unfair practice charge,not a claim.a variant of that argument was that if the california regulation did apply to require exhaustion of state or union remedies before a action could be filed,that requirement was unconstitutional.plaintiffs also argued that because pecg procedures for taking fees from was insufficient under hudson,plaintiffs lawsuit qualified for the exception to the exhaustion requirement set forth in the last sentence of the regulation in question,which provides that exhaustion of the agency fee appeal procedure is not required when the union appeal procedure is insufficient on its face.regs.tit,a.
these arguments might not have all been meritorious,but that does not matter at this point what does matter is that plaintiffs position was not,as the majority asserts,that they were not litigating the chargeability claim.ante at.plaintiffs argument regarding the exception contained in the last sentence of a appears to have left that impression with the majority,but read carefully and in conjunction with the other arguments made by plaintiffs to the district court at the same time,it is clear that plaintiffs had not abandoned their chargeability claim.they were not challenging only the informational deficiencies of pecg hudson notice.ante at emphasis in majority opinion.simply put,plaintiffs were challenging both the informational deficiencies and the inclusion of inappropriate charges as violations of hudson.plaintiffs did not view the two contentions as mutually exclusive.they repeatedly asserted that pecg had violated the hudson requirements in both ways.
the majority assertion that t he district court understood plaintiffs declaration to mean that they were not pursuing a chargeability claim,ante at,is simply erroneous.the district court unquestionably knew that plaintiffs were making such a claim.in the district court order of november,which granted plaintiffs motion to dismiss pecg point at which,according to the majority,the district court was led by plaintiffs to believe that plaintiffs were not pursuing a chargeability district court also denied a motion by plaintiffs for a preliminary injunction.in the portion of the order discussing the preliminary injunction motion,the district court described one of plaintiffs claims as follows plaintiffs argue that pecg violated hudson by charging nonmembers for clearly expenditures.the district court went on to conclude that plaintiffs had not demonstrated a likelihood of success on that claim sufficient to support a preliminary injunction,but the fact of that in the very same order which dismissed the pecg nonexhaustion obvious that it was simply not true that plaintiffs had led the district court to believe that plaintiffs,in the words of the majority,were not pursuing a chargeability claim.the district court order itself said that plaintiffs were making that claim.
the district court,in dismissing pecg counterclaim,offered the following discussion and description of plaintiffs position 
pecg asserts that sets forth a mandatory procedure for persons who wish to challenge the determination of fair share fees.plaintiffs assert they challenge pecg actions for failure to comply with hudson,not because of questions involving the propriety of the fee determination thus,in light of plaintiffs assertion,it does not appear that the exhaustion requirement of section a applies to this action.
plaintiffs won dismissal of the counterclaim not because they disclaimed the chargeability claim,ante at,but because the district court accepted their position that the exhaustion required under a did not apply to their claim that pecg had not complied with hudson that is consistent with the words of the statute,which require exhaustion of the union fee appeal process before an unfair practice charge complaint will be issued for an agency fee objection.the statute does not say anything about exhaustion being required before a lawsuit can be filed in federal court complaining of a constitutional violation since the very same order said just a few pages earlier that plaintiffs argue that pecg violated hudson by charging nonmembers for clearly expenditures,it is plain that the district court understood plaintiffs hudson claim to include the chargeability contention.
the majority misunderstanding of plaintiffs position causes it to apply judicial estoppel where there should be none.not only have plaintiffs maintained a consistent position throughout this litigation,but they would not derive an unfair advantage or impose an unfair detriment on the opposing party if not estopped.new hampshire,at.it is not as if pecg lost on the merits of the chargeability issue without having been afforded an opportunity to defend its position.pecg had the opportunity to,and did,defend the chargeability of categories,and in its opposition to plaintiffs motion for partial summary judgment.the district court simply ruled against that position.pecg has suffered no unfair detriment,and plaintiffs have obtained no unfair advantage,so as to warrant judicial estoppel of the chargeability claim.
nor is judicial estoppel required to prevent plaintiffs from playing fast and loose with the courts.ante at quoting russell rolfs,cir.indeed,it is anomalous for the majority to under an abuse of discretion standard,see ante at the decision of the district court must be reversed because the district court itself was abused by being play ed fast and loose with.the district court surely knows better than we do how plaintiffs prior position affected the district court own ruling on the motion to dismiss the counterclaim.the district court awareness of plaintiffs chargeability claim was explicitly demonstrated in the same order in which the pecg counterclaim was dismissed.nevertheless,the majority today informs the district court that it was so misled by plaintiffs position that its later consideration of plaintiffs chargeability claim constituted an abuse of though the district court was persuaded to grant summary judgment to plaintiffs on that claim,and even though that claim is,at this point,conceded by pecg to be at least partially valid,as to category expenditures.i do not agree.with respect,it appears to me that it is the majority,not the district court,that has misunderstood.
on a pragmatic level,the majority holding regarding the chargeability claim simply promotes inefficiency.the majority remedy is an order requiring pecg to issue a proper notice,with a renewed opportunity for nonmembers to object to paying the nonchargeable portion of the fee,and to receive a refund,with interest,of that amount.ante at.because pecg has conceded that items in category were,plaintiffs and other fee payers will be entitled,upon timely objection,to obtain a refund for the portion of the fee related to category.see ante at.as to the other categories,when plaintiffs respond to the new notice by objecting to the chargeability of items in categories and,then pecg will presumably defend the chargeability of those items,and that difference will be litigated.but that difference has already been litigated,and the district court already granted plaintiffs motion for partial summary judgment,concluding that categories and were not properly chargeable.the majority application of judicial estoppel to reverse that holding simply means that the parties will be forced to litigate the chargeability of items in those categories anew.i see no reason to require litigation over that subject all over again.
i also disagree with the majority conclusion that the district court did not err by limiting the class definition and the relief to the period spanning march through october.there is no dispute that the march notice was inadequate.the october notice contained the same defects as the march notice.pecg does not even try to argue at this point that it satisfied the constitutional requirements set forth in hudson by issuing the october notice.pecg should not succeed in cutting off liability by issuance of an equally defective notice.
the constitutional wrong is the taking of the agency fees absent compliance with hudson requirements.that violation did not end in october.plaintiffs did not simply complain about the creation or delivery of a bad notice in march.they complained about the constitutional agency fees have been taken from them without compliance with the requirements identified in that wrong continued beyond october.delivery of another defective notice did not right that wrong.
nothing in the first amended verified complaint temporally limits plaintiffs claims.to the contrary,plaintiffs allegations suggest continuing liability.plaintiffs proposed for the class to include all nonmembers who had fair share fees seized from their pay at any time since april,and sought to enjoin pecg from seizing any fees until they establish a procedure in full compliance with hudson and abood requirements.emphases added.no allegation indicated that their claims were limited to the march notice or that liability could be cut off by issuance of another defective notice.had pecg never issued the october notice,plaintiffs would not have been subject to the limit.the issuance of an equally defective notice should not cut off liability when the issuance of no notice would not have done so.
the majority notes that plaintiffs represented in a joint status report after issuance of the october notice that they did not anticipate amending the pleadings,and that plaintiffs accepted the provision of the district court rule scheduling order stating that no amendments would be permitted without leave of court.but plaintiffs representation that they did not anticipate amending their complaint is fully consistent with their current position that no amendment was necessary.because they believed that no amendment was necessary,they had no reason to indicate that they anticipated amending their complaint.
nor does plaintiffs subsequent attempt to file a second amended complaint to update the facts including allegations of notice liability mean that amendment was necessary as a matter of law.the fact that plaintiffs attempted to amend their complaint is simply not very probative of the purely legal question of whether the complaint was limited to a period.plaintiffs may well have sought to add additional allegations in an abundance of caution.prudence in lawyering should not be held against plaintiffs.
finally,i disagree with the majority conclusion that rule d serves to cut off liability after october.the problem with the majority conclusion is that rule d is relevant only if one assumes that a supplemental pleading was required to extend liability past october.the majority reasoning is therefore circular it assumes what it sets out to prove.as explained above,i do not read the first amended verified complaint as limiting liability to a period on the contrary,it suggests an intent to impose liability until pecg issues a procedurally proper notice.the october notice was not procedurally proper.i would therefore reverse the district court limitation on the class definition and relief and remand for further appropriate proceedings.
the practical impact of this portion of the majority decision depends upon what other alternatives might be available to plaintiffs and other fee payers for obtaining relief for the time period after the october notice was sent.the door appears to be closed in this lawsuit,however,despite the facts that the october notice was just as defective as the march notice had been,and at least some of the charges imposed by pecg,category were improper.to require plaintiffs to go elsewhere to obtain relief is,at best,wasteful and inefficient.if it turns out that relief can not be obtained elsewhere,then this decision is unjust,as well.
pecg does not appeal the ruling that its hudson notice was inadequate.
the fee payers will have an opportunity to object to the chargeability of disputed items once they receive a proper hudson notice.an inadequate notice,by definition,gives fee payers inadequate information from which to decide whether to object and,if so,in what particulars.after fee payers receive proper and complete information,they can make a fully informed choice for the first time.
at oral argument,pecg conceded that the items identified in the march notice as category are not chargeable.pecg is judicially bound by this concession and its future hudson notices must accurately so reflect.see amberhill props.city of berkeley,cir concession at oral argument is binding in further proceedings.
generally,before an argument will be considered on appeal,the argument must be raised sufficiently for the trial court to rule on it.sofamor danek group,brown,cir internal quotation marks omitted.pecg objected in the district court to plaintiffs change in position.in its july,opposition to plaintiff first motion for summary judgment,pecg argued that plaintiffs improperly had changed their position on whether the chargeability issue was in the litigation.in its september,opposition to plaintiff motion for partial summary judgment,pecg again argued that plaintiffs had taken the position that the chargeability issue was not being pursued,and that plaintiffs had improperly changed their position on that question.pecg therefore preserved the issue of judicial estoppel.
plaintiffs do not argue that the agency fee appeal procedure is insufficient on its face.
kathleen connell was the state controller of california when the inadequate hudson notice was given and is a named defendant in this action.
the sixth circuit case cited in knight explained that,a t the outset,we disagree with plaintiffs premise that the constitutional validity of a notice is contingent upon the accuracy of the chargeability determinations within the notice.jibson.educ.ass,cir.
the seventh circuit case held p laintiffs challenge mistakenly equates the adequacy of the notice with the accuracy of the fee assessment,and thus squarely contradicts hudson holding and rationale.contrary to the plaintiffs position,hudson did not contemplate that federal courts would be required,on the basis of the notice,to pass on the legality and accuracy of every element of the fee calculation before any fees could be collected.were we to accept plaintiffs invitation and provide a hearing and judicial determination of the correctness of the fee,we would in effect render redundant and irrelevant the requirements that an impartial decisionmaker hear the dispute and that an escrow account be provided for the amounts reasonably in dispute while the challenge is pending.the proper procedure employs each of the three prerequisites identified by the supreme court the fair share notice provides the basis for a challenge to
