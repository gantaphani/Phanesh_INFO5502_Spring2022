this case arises from an investigation of hotel oasis,oasis by the wage and hour division of the department of labor.the district court found multiple minimum wage and overtime violations,and entered judgment against oasis and its president.the employers appeal the district court judgment,alleging error in the court failure to set aside a stipulation entered prior to trial,its conclusion that oasis president is personally liable as an employer,and its discretionary decision to award liquidated damages.we affirm on all grounds.
background 
oasis operates a hotel and restaurant facility in southwestern puerto rico.lionel lugo is the president of the corporation,runs the hotel,and manages its employees.oasis records and employee testimony show that between october,and june,employees were paid less than minimum wage,were not paid for training time or meetings held during hours,were paid in cash off the books,and were not paid appropriately for overtime.oasis also maintained two sets of payroll records for the same employees,covering the same time periods,one showing fewer hours at a higher rate,and the other showing more hours at a wage rate.oasis contends that two sets of books were necessary,one for temporary employees and one for permanent employees.
on april,the secretary of labor the secretary filed a complaint in the united states district court for the district of puerto rico against oasis and lugo collectively,defendants,alleging violations of the minimum wage,overtime,and recordkeeping provisions of the fair labor standards act flsa.the secretary also sought liquidated damages pursuant to c,and a permanent injunction pursuant to,enjoining oasis from further violations of the flsa.in their answer to the complaint,defendants raised an affirmative defense that the flsa did not apply to oasis because oasis annual dollar value adv was less than.see s a.
on february,during a conference,jorge sala,for oasis,stipulated that oasis had an adv of at least per year from april,to october,the sala stipulation in exchange,the secretary agreed that oasis was in compliance with the flsa thereafter.defendants point out that discovery had not been concluded at the time sala entered the stipulation,and that defendants had refused to execute a similar stipulation mailed to them ten weeks earlier by counsel for the secretary.on july,sala filed a motion to withdraw as counsel,and defendants hired a new attorney.
during a september,telephone status conference,defendants attempted to renew their adv defense,apparently claiming that sala did not have the authority to enter into the stipulation on september,the district court issued an order reaffirming the sala stipulation and stating that the stipulation would not be set aside absent the most extraordinary extenuating and grievous circumstances.
at a june conference,defendants asserted for the first time that the sala stipulation was based on a computational mistake.the district court once again upheld the stipulation,ruling that the secretary could rely on the stipulation to meet its burden to prove flsa coverage,but that defendants would be allowed to adduce evidence at trial to prove that oasis adv was less than for the relevant periods.
a bench trial began on june.after five successive days,the trial was continued for over two years,resuming on february.on july,more than a year after the trial commenced,defendants submitted a motion for summary judgment,which included expert affidavits concluding that oasis did not meet the adv threshold.the district court refused to entertain the motion for summary judgment because it was submitted well after the trial began.in addition,the court precluded defendants from introducing the accompanying expert testimony at trial because n either the expert nor the report was identified and disclosed to plaintiff before the trial commenced.
at trial in february,defendants attempted to introduce rule summaries which purported to show that oasis adv was less than for some of the periods covered by the sala stipulation.the secretary counsel objected on several grounds over the course of the trial,including that the summaries were inadmissible because they were based on hearsay,and that he had not been provided the summaries before trial and therefore could not concede their numerical accuracy.for these reasons,the district court refused to admit the summaries at that point.instead,after testimony was concluded on all subjects other than the adv,the court adjourned the trial,giving defendants thirty days to comply with rule and the secretary another sixty days to review the data and develop her position.
the trial was continued several times thereafter.on october,the secretary filed a memorandum in support of her motion to preclude defendants from presenting evidence contrary to the sala stipulation.defendants never formally opposed the motion,and on may,the district court granted the motion.the court explained that it had given defendants an opportunity to demonstrate that the sala stipulation was wrong,but that the record is bereft of any solid argument developed by oasis which may point to extraordinary extenuating or grievous circumstance s which might justify setting the sala stipulation aside.with no evidence of a clear manifest injustice,the court held defendants to the stipulation based on the principle that a party is bound by its attorney actions.
on june,having reaffirmed the sala stipulation,the district court nevertheless offered defendants an alternative way to submit the rule summaries in lieu of an evidentiary hearing the parties shall file a joint proffer of evidence or offer of proof,to preclude the necessity of the hearing it shall be akin to a book of evidence that is offered,albeit not admitted.although the court may,order holding defendants to the sala stipulation was final,the court felt that the proffered evidence would give the court of appeals a complete record on which to decide the adv issue on the merits.
a year later,on june,the district court entered an order granting the secretary unopposed motion for partial summary judgment on the issue of lugo personal liability as an employer under the flsa in addition,the order again addressed the sala stipulation and the rule summaries.although neither party had complied with the court alternative method of submitting the rule evidence,the court granted them another twenty days to file their offers of proof on the adv issue.the court also reminded defendants that t he sala stipulation was bilateral and had a quid pro quo for the employer,because the department of labor,as part of the announced stipulation,agreed that defendants had been in compliance since october.defendants finally submitted the rule summaries on july,and various memoranda and supplemental filings by both parties followed.
after further hearings,the district court entered judgment in favor of the secretary on october.the accompanying opinion order denied a number of rule motions filed by defendants over the course of the proceedings,the most relevant to this appeal being a motion not normally thought of as within the compass of rule motion to reconsider the court denial of defendants july,motion for summary judgment on the adv issue.the opinion also once again explained the history of both the sala stipulation and the issue of lugo personal liability as an employer.the court noted that its grant of partial summary judgment on lugo status was further supported by defendants admissions at trial that lugo had ultimate control over oasis operations,and over employment practices.
on june,the court amended the judgment,ordering oasis to pay in back wages and an equal amount in liquidated damages to current and former employees.oasis filed one last motion for reconsideration on july,asking the court to reconsider its decisions on liquidated damages and lugo personal liability as an employer.the district court issued an amended opinion and order on november,denying the motion for reconsideration on the ground that defendants were merely rehashing old arguments.defendants appeal from the final judgment and from the court denial of their last motion for reconsideration.
ii.discussion 
defendants raise three issues on appeal.first,they claim that the district court should have set aside the sala stipulation and allowed them to prove the adv defense at trial.second,they challenge the district court finding that lugo is personally liable as an employer under the flsa.third,they argue that the district court erred in awarding liquidated damages based on willfulness.we address each issue in turn.
sala stipulation 
the district court refused to set aside the sala stipulation based on the general principle that stipulations of attorneys made during a trial may not be disregarded or set aside at will.t i fed.credit union delbonis,cir quoting marshall emersons,cir see also gonz√°lez,cir attorneys represent clients,and as a general rule an attorney blunder binds her client.as the district court correctly noted,stipulations are highly favored in our judicial system as a means of expedit ing a trial and eliminat ing the necessity of much tedious proof.t i fed.credit union,at quoting burstein united states,cir.once entered,parties are not generally free to extricate themselves unless it becomes apparent that it may inflict a manifest injustice upon one of the contracting parties.id.quoting marshall,at.accordingly,a party may be relieved of a stipulation for good means,in a nutshell,that good reason must exist and that relief must not unfairly prejudice the opposing party or the interests of justice.am.honda motor richard lundgren,cir.one good reason for setting aside a stipulation is where it becomes evident that the agreement was made under a clear mistake.t i fed.credit union,at quoting brast winding gulf colliery,cir setting aside a stipulation as to tax liability where the calculation had been based on a misunderstanding of law.
here,the district court gave defendants an opportunity to prove that the stipulation was based on a mistake,but defendants failed to make the required showing defendants do not challenge the district court rulings with respect to the inadmissibility of the rule summaries or the expert evidence presented with their summary judgment motion.we have scoured the record,and,like the district court,we find no indication of any properly supported arguments that oasis did not meet the adv threshold.
alternatively,defendants argue that the sala stipulation is procedurally invalid because it was not in writing or signed by the parties.they assert that stipulations between attorneys are not binding unless the represented parties assent to the stipulation,and that stipulations usually must be in writing unless made in open court.defendants also posit that stipulations must be signed by all parties when required by local rules,citing cavallini state farm mutual auto insurance,cir applying civ.the district court for the district of puerto rico,however,has no specific rule requiring all agreements between parties to be in writing 
in any event,the district court memorialized the sala into by the attorneys at a status conference before the district court a september,order.defendants did not object to the order,move to strike the reference to the stipulation,or request reconsideration.the order then became the law of the case,and any formalities suggested by defendants with respect to the stipulation were rendered moot.see.e after any conference held pursuant to this rule,an order shall be entered reciting the action taken.this order shall control the subsequent course of the action unless modified by a subsequent order.
finally,defendants attack the subject matter jurisdiction of the court,arguing that the parties can not stipulate to adv coverage because it is a jurisdictional requirement of the flsa.see aponte tabares,wl,at cir unpublished opinion limits on subject matter jurisdiction are not waivable and,therefore,may be raised at any time.this argument fails,however,because adv coverage is not jurisdictional.as the supreme court recently noted,subject matter jurisdiction in cases is sometimes erroneously conflated with a plaintiff need and ability to prove the defendant bound by the federal law asserted as the predicate for determination.arbaugh y h,d quoting james moore et,moore federal practice ed.to mitigate this confusion,the court provided clear guidance for distinguishing between the two concepts w hen congress does not rank a statutory limitation on coverage as jurisdictional,courts should treat the restriction as nonjurisdictional in character.id.at.the flsa places the adv limitation in the definitions section of the act,and does not suggest that the adv limitation is jurisdictional.see s a.we therefore treat it as an element of the claim.fern√°ndez,while the merits of fernandez flsa claim turn on whether she was paid for hours worked in excess of forty per week,nothing in the flsa suggests that a failure to prove this particular element of her cause of action requires a dismissal for lack of jurisdiction.minard itc deltacom commc ns,cir in light of the supreme court decision in arbaugh,we conclude that the definition section of the family medical leave act is a substantive ingredient of a plaintiff claim for relief,not a jurisdictional limitation.
as defendants have not established good cause for setting aside the sala stipulation,we find no abuse of discretion in the district court decision to hold defendants to their agreement.
employer liability 
defendants next challenge the district court grant of partial summary judgment on the issue of lugo personal liability as an employer,arguing that the flsa does not contemplate holding corporate officers individually liable for the corporation statutory violations.we review a district court grant of summary judgment de novo,viewing the summary judgment record in the light most favorable to the party.vasapolli rostoff,cir.
under the flsa,an employer is any person acting directly or indirectly in the interest of an employer in relation to an employee.d.the first circuit has followed the supreme court lead in interpreting this definition pursuant to an economic reality analysis.donovan agnew,cir citing goldberg whitaker,d.accordingly,there may be multiple employers who are simultaneously liable for compliance with the flsa.baystate alternative staffing,herman,cir.
in donovan agnew,we acknowledged that t he overwhelming weight of authority is that a corporate officer with operational control of a corporation covered enterprise is an employer along with the corporation,jointly and severally liable under the flsa for unpaid wages.at collecting cases.although we found it difficult to accept that congress intended that any corporate officer or other employee with ultimate operational control over payroll matters be personally liable,id.at emphasis added,we narrowly determined that the flsa did not preclude personal liability for corporate officers with a significant ownership interest who had operational control of significant aspects of the corporation day to day functions,including compensation of employees,and who personally made decisions to continue operations despite financial adversity during the period of nonpayment,id.at.
we next visited the issue of an individual personal liability under the flsa for corporate employment practices in baystate alternative staffing.there,the department of labor administrative review board had held two corporate officers and managers personally liable for flsa violations because they had the authority to manage certain aspects of the business operations on a basis.id.at.noting our concern in agnew that not every corporate employee who exercised supervisory control should be held personally liable,we identified several factors that were important to the personal liability analysis,including the individual ownership interest,degree of control over the corporation financial affairs and compensation practices,and role in caus ing the corporation to compensate or not to compensate employees in accordance with the flsa.id.we remanded the personal liability issue in that case based on the board failure to address the individuals personal responsibility for making decisions about the conduct of the business that contributed to the violations of the act.id.
based on the above considerations,we affirm the district court judgment holding lugo personally liable for oasis compensation decisions.lugo was not just any employee with some supervisory control over other employees.he was the president of the corporation,and he had ultimate control over the business operations.in particular,it is undisputed that lugo was the corporate officer principally in charge of directing employment practices,such as hiring and firing employees,requiring employees to attend meetings unpaid,and setting employees wages and schedules.he was thus instrumental in causing the corporation to violate the flsa.see see also donovan sabine irrigation,cir holding corporate president who dominated employment practices liable under flsa.the flsa contemplates,at least in certain circumstances,holding officers with such personal responsibility for statutory compliance jointly and severally liable along with the corporation see agnew,at.
liquidated damages 
finally,defendants argue that the district court erred in awarding liquidated damages based on a finding of willfulness.the flsa authorizes the secretary of labor to recover on behalf of employees unpaid wages and overtime compensation plus an equal amount in liquidated damages.b,c.the only way an employer can escape liquidated damages is to show to the satisfaction of the court that it acted in good faith and had reasonable grounds for believing that its acts did not violate the flsa.id.because the flsa leaves the decision to depart from the norm of awarding double damages to the district court,see,herman rsr sec.servs,cir,we review only for abuse of discretion,mclaughlin hogar san jos√©,cir.the employer burden on appeal is especially difficult because we review the district court factual findings related to good faith and reasonableness for clear error.see id.the district court findings of good faith and reasonable grounds are mixed questions of law and fact,which are subject to the strict standard of review of rule a.
here,the district court found that defendants failed to show good faith or objective reasonableness,referring back to its findings on willfulness with respect to the applicable statute of limitations.see reich newspapers of new,cir the flsa imposes a statute of limitations unless the violations are shown to be willful,in which case a period applies.citing a.for statute of limitation purposes,the court found,inter alia,that defendants intentionally and consistently failed to keep accurate records of the time worked by its employees,disguised minimum wage,as well as overtime pay violations,did not record the amounts of cash tips,and most salient to a finding of willfulness,paid employees off the books.
the district court willfulness findings are not clearly erroneous,and they adequately support the court decision to award liquidated damages.oasis failure to keep adequate payroll records and its intentional manipulation of the records it did keep are sufficient grounds for concluding that oasis did not act in good faith or with a reasonable belief that it was in compliance with the flsa.elwell.hosps.home care,cir t he fact that an employer knowingly its employee work hours could suggest to a fact finder that the employer was attempting to conceal its failure to pay overtime from regulators,or was acting to eliminate evidence that might later be used against it in a suit by one of its employees.moreover,a finding of willfulness means that the employer either knew or showed reckless disregard for the matter of whether its conduct was prohibited by the statute.mclaughlin richland shoe,d.
defendants primary argument on appeal is that the court had indicated at trial that the willfulness issue was close and that the secretary had offered no evidence that oasis acted in reckless disregard of its statutory obligations.l√≥pez corporaci√≥n azucarera de,cir plaintiffs herein have proffered no evidence indicating that the employer acted with knowledge or reckless disregard with respect to its obligations under flsa therefore,in the first instance,the court holds that the limitation term is applicable to this case.these arguments are unpersuasive.first,the district court noted its initial inclination against a determination of willfulness,but explained that it ultimately relied on the employees testimony and defendants own documentary evidence to reach its conclusion regarding willfulness.we have already determined that the willfulness finding is not clearly erroneous furthermore,it is the employer burden to show good faith and objective reasonableness,see,and therefore the secretary alleged failure to offer evidence of willfulness is not an impediment to the court decision to award liquidated damages.the district court found that defendants failed to meet their burden,and,again,that finding is not clearly erroneous.we therefore find no abuse of discretion in the district court award of liquidated damages.
iii.conclusion 
for the foregoing reasons,we affirm the judgment against defendants.
oasis had been investigated twice before,and violations of minimum wage and overtime laws had been found on both occasions.oasis agreed both times to pay the back wages and comply in the future.
the minutes for that conference stated that defendants withdraw the adv defense.the minutes were amended on april,to reflect that defendants waive d the adv defense though the third quarter of.
defendants reasoning is gleaned from a may,order in which the district court indicated that prior to june,defendants had relied solely on sala lack of authorization as grounds for setting aside the stipulation.
federal rule of evidence provides in full the contents of voluminous writings,recordings,or photographs which can not conveniently be examined in court may be presented in the form of a chart,summary,or calculation.the originals,or duplicates,shall be made available for examination or copying,or both,by other parties at reasonable time and place.the court may order that they be produced in court.
the motion had been granted during a conference on june,after hearing the parties positions on the issue.the parties were aware of the court decision but the order had not been entered into the docket.the issue of lugo liability was rehashed on several occasions throughout the course of litigation,as noted in the court november,amended opinion and order,denying defendants final motion for reconsideration.
defendants argued that the district court misplaced the burden of proof on the adv issue,by requiring defendants to prove a lack of coverage.defendants,however,stipulated that oasis adv met the statutory threshold,and the district court affirmed the stipulation,which relieved the secretary of her burden to prove flsa coverage.see,eng g contractors ass of,metro.dade county,cir citing.c.the burden was then properly on defendants to show good cause for setting aside the stipulation.see cab√°n hern√°ndez philip morris usa,cir the appellants have shown nothing that would constitute good cause or otherwise justify relief from the stipulation.
defendants complain that they did not get a hearing on the rule evidence,as promised by the court.defendants did not,however,oppose the secretary motion to preclude them from offering any evidence contrary to the stipulation,which rendered the rule evidence unnecessary.moreover,defendants then agreed to file a joint proffer of evidence in lieu of a hearing.
note,however,that local rule j does specifically require stipulations extending discovery deadlines to be in writing.the closest rule otherwise on point is local rule,which requires that all documents submitted to the court be signed by an attorney or pro se litigant.
neither party discusses lugo ownership interest in oasis.in this case,however,lugo personal responsibility outweighs any ownership considerations.see agnew,at citing sabine irrigation,at,for the proposition that a corporate officer may be held liable even if he has no ownership interest.
some circuits have held that a finding of willfulness precludes a district court decision not to award liquidate
