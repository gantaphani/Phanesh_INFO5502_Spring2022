nathan fulton pled guilty to driving while under the influence of alcohol,causing injury.the trial court granted fulton probation and ordered him to pay the victim restitution,including in attorney fees the victim incurred pursuing a personal injury action against fulton for economic and noneconomic damages sustained as a result of fulton criminal conduct.
fulton sole appellate challenge concerns the restitution award.fulton contends the amount of the attorney fees awarded was improper because a portion of that award reflected attorney services incurred to recover noneconomic damages.while we agree section,subdivision f,allows restitution only for that portion of attorney fees attributable to the victim recovery of economic damages,we conclude the record supports that the restitution award reflected attorney fees incurred to recover the victim economic damages and that this amount was reasonable.accordingly,we affirm.
factual and procedural background 
in january,fulton was driving his car at a high rate of speed when he crossed over the center line,causing a collision with a vehicle driven by gary overton.fulton,his passenger,and overton were seriously injured in the accident.fulton level was measured at percent.he pled guilty at arraignment.in may,the court sentenced fulton to probation and imposed various terms and conditions of probation,but did not set victim restitution.the court continued the victim restitution hearing several times to permit overton and his wife to continue settlement discussions with fulton insurer.
on september,the court conducted the restitution hearing.by that time,overton had settled his civil case against fulton and had been reimbursed for his past and future medical expenses,lost wages and property damage.the only remaining restitution issue was the amount of attorney fees and costs fulton was obligated to pay overton.overton claimed in fees,and fulton argued the proper amount was percent of overton economic damages.following an evidentiary hearing,the court ordered fulton to pay overton in attorney fees pursuant to section,subdivision f h.
in support of overton claim that he was entitled to in fees,his attorney,barbara savaglio,submitted exhibits and points and authorities,which described the nature and extent of overton injuries set forth the amount of overton economic damages outlined the settlement negotiations between fulton insurer and overton and explained her fees.in opposition,fulton counsel submitted points and authorities and exhibits,including overton partial responses to fulton discovery requests.
these documents revealed that as a result of the accident,overton suffered injuries to his shoulder requiring surgery,physical therapy and possible future surgery a severe laceration requiring stitches to his ear a large laceration to his head and pain to his head,nose and legs.overton injuries caused him to miss several weeks of work,resulting in lost wages.his vehicle was totaled in the crash,resulting in property damage and expenses for a rental vehicle.
the documents also showed that shortly after the accident,overton and his wife retained the services of attorney savaglio to pursue legal action against fulton.overton agreed to a percent contingent fee arrangement.following unsuccessful negotiations with fulton insurer,wawanesa mutual insurance,savaglio filed a personal injury action against fulton on behalf of the overtons.the case settled in may for,fulton policy limits.at that time,overton economic losses were estimated to be approximately the overtons signed a release of all claims which specifically excluded their right to pursue further criminal proceedings against fulton,including a restitution order.
the documents submitted at the restitution hearing further established that during the course of the initial,unsuccessful settlement negotiations,wawanesa had agreed to pay overton his property damages,but disputed the value of his other claimed damages.wawanesa was particularly skeptical of overton claim that his shoulder injury would require further surgery.echoing a similar view,fulton counsel opined that it is doubtful that wawanesa will pay to resolve overton claim.thereafter,wawanesa offered to settle the matter,but overton rejected the offer.unable to convince wawanesa of the extent and nature of overton physical injuries,savaglio filed the lawsuit against fulton.following initial discovery,the production of additional medical records and a defense independent medical examination confirming the need for future shoulder surgery,savaglio successfully settled the case at the policy limits.in doing so,savaglio spent in excess of hours of her time at per hour,and more than hours of her legal assistant time at per hour.under the contingency fee agreement,savaglio received percent of the settlement and litigation costs.
in opposition to overton claim that he was entitled to,fulton argued that the restitution for attorney fees should be limited to the portion of the contingency fee attributable solely to recovering overton economic damages which fulton claimed were according to fulton,the percent contingency fee should be applied solely to the economic damages,not to the total recovery of,which reflected both economic and noneconomic damages.in the alternative,fulton argued the fee was unreasonable.
at the outset of the restitution hearing,the trial court stated it had tentatively concluded that the entire attorney fees were recoverable,regardless of how much of the attorney services were incurred to obtain economic,as opposed to noneconomic,damages.the court later stated it remain ed unconvinced that there is any workable practical formula that would allow a court to take attorneys fees and divide them up between economic and noneconomic damages.i already and absolutely convinced you ca do it by the ratio of the recovery,and i also find it entirely unworkable that you would do it by a factual analysis of the attorney time spent.based on the language of the statute,i remain convinced that the entire attorney fee contingency or otherwise is an economic cost that is can be awarded by a judge in a criminal case.
the trial court thus found the entire attorney fees qualified as an economic loss within the meaning of section,subdivision f,and that the percent contingency fee was reasonable.accordingly,the trial court ordered fulton to pay restitution of for attorney fees to overton.
discussion 
recoverable attorney fees under section 
fulton contends the court erred in awarding in restitution reflecting overton attorney fees because a portion of those fees was incurred to recover overton noneconomic damages.
section governs a trial court authority to order a criminal defendant to pay restitution directly to a crime victim.section,subdivision a states i t is the intent of the legislature that a victim of crime who incurs any economic loss as a result of the commission of a crime shall receive restitution directly from any defendant convicted of that crime.italics added.the statute implementing subdivision,subdivision f,states the court shall require that the defendant make restitution to the victim in an amount established by court order,and subdivision f provides that the restitution shall be of a dollar amount that is sufficient to fully reimburse the victim or victims for every determined economic loss incurred as a result of the defendant criminal conduct,including,but not limited to,all of the following h actual and reasonable attorney fees and other costs of collection accrued by a private entity on behalf of the victim,subd.f,italics added.
fulton does not dispute that,under section,subdivision f h,reasonable attorney fees constitute an economic loss recoverable as restitution.but fulton contends that attorney fees are recoverable as restitution only to the extent they are incurred to collect a recoverable restitution item,such as medical expenses and lost wages,and not to collect a nonrecoverable item such as pain and suffering noneconomic damages.the attorney general counters that all attorneys fees are economic losses and recoverable as restitution so long as the fees are reasonable.this issue appears to be one of first impression.see people pinedo th,d.
in resolving the parties different views of the statute,our task is to interpret the code section to effectuate the legislature intent.people allen th,d.in so doing,we look first to the words of the statute,giving the language its usual,ordinary meaning.people birkett cal th,d.w e consider portions of a statute in the context of the entire statute and the statutory scheme of which it is a part,giving significance to every word,phrase,sentence,and part of an act in pursuance of the legislative purpose.curle superior court cal th,d.if the plain language of the statute is uncertain,we must give the words their reasonable and common sense construction in accordance with the apparent purpose and intention of the lawmakers.this construction must be practical rather than technical and lead to wise policy rather than to mischief or absurdity.wise pacific gas electric th,d.further,consideration should be given to the consequences that will flow from a particular interpretation,fair employment housing com.cal d.
section,subdivision f h identifies attorney fees as an economic loss recoverable as direct restitution.the fees are expressly limited to those that are a ctual and reasonable and those incurred in the recovery of damages the victim suffered as a result of the defendant criminal conduct.this subdivision further includes the phrase and other costs of collection accrued by a private entity on behalf of the victim,subd.f h.viewed in context,the reference to attorney fees and other costs of collection logically suggests the legislature was viewing attorney fees as a cost of collection and was intending to permit the recovery of attorney fees that were incurred for collection purposes.although the subdivision does not expressly identify the object of that collection,it is only reasonable to infer it is the collection of restitution permitted under the statute.
this interpretation is consistent with the meaning and purpose of the entire statutory scheme.the legislature mandated that trial courts order restitution in an amount that will fully reimburse the victim for economic losses,such as property damage and medical expenses,caused by the defendant criminal conduct,subd.f.however,a victim who suffers these economic losses would not be fully reimbursed if he or she was required to bear the expense of an attorney to recover for that damage.recognizing this,the legislature provided for the victim recovery of reasonable attorney fees incurred to collect economic damages.but the legislature additionally made an express policy determination that noneconomic damages are not recoverable as restitution and therefore a victim will not be reimbursed for those losses from this rule,it rationally follows that the legislature did not perceive a need for a victim to recover attorney fees incurred to collect noneconomic damages in order for the victim to fully recover restitution under the statute.a contrary conclusion would mean that a victim who suffers only noneconomic loss would be entitled to recover as restitution all attorney fees incurred to recover that loss,but the same victim could not obtain restitution for any of the underlying noneconomic damages.likewise,under the attorney general interpretation of the restitution statute,a victim who incurs only a small amount of economic damage but sustains substantial noneconomic damages would be potentially entitled to a large attorney fee award that has no meaningful relationship to the restitution for the underlying damages.we decline to interpret the statute in such an incongruous fashion.
accordingly,we hold that under the plain meaning and express purpose of section,subdivision f h,actual and reasonable attorney fees incurred by a victim as a result of the defendant criminal conduct are recoverable as restitution,but they are limited to reasonable attorney fees incurred to collect restitution otherwise permitted under the statute.
this conclusion does not mean that a victim is prohibited from recovering attorney fees if those fees are incurred to recover both economic and noneconomic losses.because the legislature has directed that a victim be fully reimburse d for economic losses,subds.f g,it would be improper to reduce the attorney fees incurred to obtain economic damages merely because those same attorney fees also led to the recovery of nonrecoverable damages,pain and suffering damages.moreover,because of the strong public policy seeking to provide crime victims with direct restitution for all the losses they suffer cal,art.i,subd.b,when fees can not be reasonably divided between the pursuit of economic losses as opposed to noneconomic losses,the victim is entitled to be fully reimbursed for all actual and reasonable attorney fees.see people broussard cal th,d,people lyon th,d.
ii.determining the proper amount of attorney fees as restitution 
the parties dispute the evidentiary burdens applicable at victim restitution hearings.the resolution of this issue lies in the statutory language.
section sets forth broad rules for the court to follow in determining victim restitution.it begins with a requirement a victim who suffers economic loss as a result of a defendant conduct is entitled to restitution,subd.f and the restitution ordered is to be based on the amount of loss claimed by the victim or victims or any other showing to the court.ibid.full restitution is mandatory unless the court finds compelling and extraordinary reasons for not doing so,and states them on the record.ibid.a defendant is entitled to a hearing before a judge to dispute the determination of the amount of restitution,subd.f.in determining the amount of restitution,the court is required to order a dollar amount that is sufficient to fully reimburse the victim or victims for every determined economic loss incurred as a result of the defendant criminal conduct,subd.f.
at the core of the victim restitution statutory scheme is the mandate that a victim who suffers economic loss is entitled to restitution and that the restitution is to be based on the amount of loss claimed by the victim.thus,a victim seeking restitution or someone on his or her behalf initiates the process by identifying the type of loss,subd.f he or she has sustained and its monetary value.where the restitution claimed is attorney fees,this requirement is met when the record contains prima facie evidence of reasonable attorney fees incurred by the victim to recover the economic losses.in re th,d people scroggins d.people hartley d,fn.see also.
once the record contains evidence showing the victim suffered economic losses and incurred reasonable attorney fees to recover those losses,this showing establishes the amount of restitution the victim is entitled to receive,unless challenged by the defendant.in that event,the burden shifts to the defendant to show the portion of the attorney fees that are not recoverable because those fees can be attributed solely to a nonrecoverable category of noneconomic losses.see people foster th,d people baumann d.people hartley,supra,d at.this approach complies with the statutory mandate that the amount of restitution is to be based on the loss claimed by the victim and the designated right of the defendant to a hearing to dispute the determination of the amount of restitution.
we disagree with the assertion by fulton and amicus curiae appellate defenders,that due process precludes placing the burden of proof on the defendant to show the attorney fees were incurred solely to recover noneconomic losses.due process requires that the prosecution prove beyond a reasonable doubt all of the elements of the charged offenses.people babbitt cal d.however,when the defense raises factual issues collateral to the question of the accused guilt or innocence,there is no constitutional impediment to requiring the accused to prove these collateral facts by a preponderance of the evidence.id.at,people frye cal th,d,see also people allen cal th,d,people hawthorne cal th,d.a challenge to the amount of restitution to the victim is entirely collateral to the defendant guilt or innocence.moreov
