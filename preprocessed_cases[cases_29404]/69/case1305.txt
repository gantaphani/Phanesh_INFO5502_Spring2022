on october and,de la fuente mailed two letters that contained a white powder and that included notes with the following text surprise anthrax yor sic it die bitch.de la fuente sent his first letter to diane olin,a former boss.he sent his second letter to laura caudillo,a former girlfriend.
a usps employee at a mail processing and distribution center in california found the letter addressed to laura caudillo when it broke open during processing.acting in response to the white powder that spilled out of de la fuente letter,usps evacuated employees from its processing and distribution center,lost employee work hours,and incurred cleanup costs,for a total monetary loss of.three la hazmat officials also spent six hours responding to the incident,for a total la hazmat loss of.lahd tested de la fuente letters for anthrax its testing services were valued at.lahd tests established that the white powder in de la fuente letters was not anthrax.
on march,the government filed an indictment charging de la fuente with two counts of mailing threats to injure in violation of.after de la fuente pled guilty to both counts,the district court sentenced him to months imprisonment and three years supervised release.the district court also ordered de la fuente to pay in restitution to usps,to la hazmat and to lahd.
congress passed the mvra in as a supplement to the victim and witness protection act of vwpa.see united states grice,cir.per curiam,cert.denied,d.restitution under the vwpa is discretionary,and the district court must consider a defendant resources when deciding if restitution is appropriate.a a,b.the mvra eliminates district courts discretion with respect to restitution for certain classes of crimes.a.if the mvra applies,a restitution order is mandatory regardless of the defendant ability to pay.id see also grice,at.
the mvra applies,inter alia,to crime s of violence,as defined in,if an identifiable victim or victims has suffered a physical injury or pecuniary loss.c.on appeal,de la fuente argues that his was not a crime of violence subject to the mvra.
because de la fuente challenges the district court determination for the first time on appeal we review that determination only for plain error.b see also united states zink,cir applying plain error standard in restitution context united states johnson,cir applying plain error standard to determination made under mvra.an error is plain if it is clear or obvious under current law.united states olano,d.an error can not be plain where there is no controlling authority on point and where the most closely analogous precedent leads to conflicting results.see united states thompson,cir.plain error merits reversal if it affected the defendant substantial rights and if it seriously affected the fairness,integrity or public reputation of judicial proceedings.b olano,at.
a crime qualifies as a crime of violence if it is 
a an offense that has as an element the use,attempted use,or threatened use of physical force against the person or property of another,or 
b any other offense that is a felony and that,by its nature,involves a substantial risk that physical force against the person or property of another may be used in the course of committing the offense.
in this case,only a is potentially applicable.the crime of sending a threat to injure is complete when the perpetrator places his threatening letter in the mail,and there is little risk of physical force being used in the course of writing or mailing a threatening letter.see united states nilsen,cir per curiam crime of mailing threatening letters with intent to extort a thing of value,b,was complete when defendant put letters in the mail.
in deciding whether the district court committed plain error in determining that the crime of mailing a threat to injure is a crime of violence under a,we apply the categorical approach set out in taylor united states,d.see united states,cir applying taylor categorical approach to the enhancement in.we have not yet applied taylor in the specific context of the mvra,but the text of mandates a categorical inquiry because it directs the court attention to the element s and nature of the defendant crime.see united states david,cir per curiam interpreting materially identical wording in see also united states,cir applying categorical approach to determination made under sareang ye ins,cir same.
when applying taylor categorical approach,we first look to the statutory definition of the crime,rather than to the defendant specific conduct.united states,cir quoting united states,cir.if the statute reaches both conduct that would constitute a crime of violence and conduct that would not,we turn to a modified categorical approach,which allows us to examine documentation or judicially noticeable facts that clearly establish that the defendant actual offense qualifies as a crime of violence.see id.
the two elements of the crime of mailing a threat to injure are that the defendant letter contained a threat to injure and that the defendant knowingly caused the threatening letter to be deposited in the mail.c see also united states sirhan,cir per curiam.although we have never decided whether the threat to injure required by c satisfies the use,attempted use,or threatened use of physical force requirement in a,we have held that a criminal statute requiring the creation and use of a fear of unlawful injury includes the element of a threatened use of physical force.see david,at explaining that california robbery statute requiring the use of either force or fear satisfies the use,attempted use or threatened use of physical force requirement in a where fear is defined as fear of an unlawful injury to the person see also united states,cir holding that provision of arizona assault statute requiring that the defendant intentionally place the victim in reasonable apprehension of imminent physical injury satisfies the use,attempted use,or threatened use of physical force requirement in a.because the threat of injury required for a conviction in this case is not materially different from the fear or apprehension of injury required by the statutes at issue in david and,the district court did not plainly err in deciding that the elements of de la fuente crime satisfy a threatened use of physical force requirement 
de la fuente argues that his own offense conduct undermines our analysis because a threat of anthrax poisoning is not a threat of forceful conduct,as the term force ordinarily would be understood.we are not persuaded.anthrax is a physical substance that causes injury to the human body,and de la fuente letters clearly threatened death by way of physical contact with anthrax spores.the injury and pain caused by anthrax infection may not always be immediately obvious to the person exposed,but the bacteria physical effect on the body is no less violently forceful than the effect of a kick or blow see,at adopting black law dictionary definition of physical force as f orce applied to the body actual violence alteration in original.
in criminal cases,restitution may compensate victims only for actual losses caused by the defendant criminal conduct.united states gamma tech,cir.a victim is a person directly and proximately harmed as a result of the commission of an offense for which restitution may be ordered.a.de la fuente argues that usps,la hazmat and lahd are not true victims entitled to restitution in this case because any costs they incurred were too collateral to
