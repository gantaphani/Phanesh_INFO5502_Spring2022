are actions taken to collect a judgment,such as obtaining a writ of execution and levying on a judgment debtor property,protected by the litigation privilege of civil code section,subdivision b,as communication s in the course of a judicial proceeding in brown kennard th,d brown,the court of appeal held that the privilege protects both the process of applying for the writ of execution and the levy on the judgment debtor property,as an act of carrying out the writ.on the other hand,in drum bleau,fox associates th,d drum,the court of appeal held that,although the privilege protects the application for the writ of execution,it does not extend to the subsequent,noncommunicative acts in levying on the property.we granted review to resolve the conflict.
we conclude that where the cause of action is based on a communicative act,the litigation privilege extends to those noncommunicative actions which are necessarily related to that communicative act.in this case,because the claim for abuse of process was based on the communicative act of filing allegedly false declarations of service to obtain a default judgment,the postjudgment enforcement efforts,including the application for writ of execution and act of levying on property,were protected by the privilege.because the court of appeal here came to the contrary decision that the act of levying on property was not protected by the privilege,we reverse its judgment.
factual and procedural history 
this case arises from an action,filed as a,by terry rusheen against attorney barry cohen,individually,and barry cohen,a professional corporation collectively,cohen,for abuse of process.the claims are based on cohen representation of clients in this case and in three earlier proceedings against rusheen.
a.the earlier lawsuits.
in the first of the earlier proceedings,niki han and maurice abikzer applied for the issuance of a writ of possession of a house that they had bought from rusheen father case no.rusheen,who lived there,refused to move out after escrow had closed.in addition,han and abikzer sought an order to show cause re harassment and a temporary restraining order against rusheen.rusheen also filed two actions against han and abikzer separately,seeking his own orders to show cause re harassment and temporary restraining orders case nos.and.
during a hearing on the three cases,the trial court ordered rusheen to move out and denied rusheen applications for temporary restraining orders.han and abikzer moved to declare rusheen a vexatious litigant and to require him to post a bond in each of the three cases.the court issued a stay preventing rusheen from filing any pleadings except those relevant to the pending vexatious litigant motions.
b.the current case.
before the vexatious litigant motions were heard,cohen as han attorney filed a new action the case before us now for property damage,fraud,assault and battery,and unjust enrichment case no.
after a hearing,the trial court found rusheen to be a vexatious litigant and ordered rusheen to post a cash bond to avoid a default judgment in favor of han and as a precondition to the filing of any pleadings.rusheen did not file opposition to the vexatious litigant motion and did not appear at the hearing.
cohen filed a declaration of service signed by a process server,which was later used to obtain rusheen default.the process server declared,under penalty of perjury,that he had personally served rusheen with the summons,complaint,and order declaring rusheen a vexatious litigant.
cohen moved for a default judgment.after rusheen failed to post the bond,a default judgment was entered.han through a nevada attorney filed a notice of foreign judgment in nevada,where rusheen had moved,and began executing on rusheen property.the nevada attorney applied for a writ of execution and levied on the judgment.
rusheen moved to vacate the default judgment and the vexatious litigant orders on the ground the judgment was defective.rusheen claimed he had no notice of the vexatious litigant hearing and denied he was served with the summons,complaint,and order declaring him a vexatious litigant.in opposition,cohen submitted declarations that stated rusheen had been personally served with the above documents and the motion to declare him a vexatious litigant.the trial court denied the motion to vacate the default judgment,finding that rusheen had been personally served with the documents.
in an unpublished opinion,the court of appeal reversed the judgment.it held there was insufficient evidence that rusheen was a vexatious litigant and that the trial court had no authority to order the posting of a cash bond.it remanded the case and ordered the trial court to grant rusheen motion to vacate the default judgment and vexatious litigant orders.
on remand,rusheen initiated the issue cohen for abuse of process arising from his legal representation.after various procedural events,rusheen filed a second amended,alleging that cohen had made an illegal vexatious litigant motion against rusheen,failed to serve the complaint properly,took an improper default judgment against him without proper notice,permitted his client to execute on the judgment in nevada,and filed false declarations on the issue of service.
cohen brought a special motion to strike the under the statute code civ,asserting that there was no reasonable probability rusheen would prevail because cohen conduct was privileged under civil code section,subdivision b.the trial court agreed.it granted the motion,struck the against cohen,and entered judgment for cohen.
in an unpublished opinion,the court of appeal reversed the judgment.it held that the trial court improperly granted the motion to strike,finding that cohen could be liable for abuse of process in enforcing a default judgment obtained through the filing of allegedly false proofs of service.in determining whether cohen conduct fell within the litigation privilege,the court followed drum,supra,th,d,rather than brown,supra,th,d.it found that cohen filing of allegedly perjured documents fell within the litigation privilege as communicative conduct,but that his participation in the alleged conspiracy to execute on the resulting improper default judgment was unprivileged,noncommunicative conduct 
we granted cohen petition for review to determine whether actions taken to collect a judgment,such as obtaining a writ of execution and levying on the judgment debtor property,are protected by the litigation privilege as communications in the course of a judicial proceeding and whether a claim for abuse of process based on the filing of an allegedly false declaration of service is barred by the litigation privilege on the ground the claim is necessarily founded on a communicative act 
ii.discussion 
cohen maintains that rusheen abuse of process claim is barred by the litigation privilege and that the trial court properly granted his motion code civ.an appellate court independently reviews the trial court order granting a special motion to strike under section.kajima engineering construction,city of los angeles th,d.in evaluating the trial court order,we discuss the general legal principles first and then their application to this case.as explained below,we agree with cohen contention.
a.the statute.
a slapp strategic lawsuit against public to chill or punish a party exercise of constitutional rights to free speech and to petition the government for redress of grievances.briggs eden council for hope opportunity cal th,fn,d.the legislature enacted code of civil procedure section as the provide a procedural remedy to dispose of lawsuits that are brought to chill the valid exercise of constitutional rights.lafayette morehouse,chronicle publishing th,d.
in evaluating an motion,the trial court first determines whether the defendant has made a threshold showing that the challenged cause of action arises from protected activity.equilon enterprises consumer cause,cal th,d.under code of civil procedure section a cause of action against a person arising from any act of that person in furtherance of the person right of petition or free speech shall be subject to a special motion to strike code civ,subd.b.a cause of action arising from defendant litigation activity may appropriately be the subject of a section motion to strike.church of scientology wollersheim th,d,disapproved on other grounds in equilon enterprises consumer cause,supra,cal th at,fn,d.any act includes communicative conduct such as the filing,funding,and prosecution of a civil action.ludwig superior court th,d.this includes qualifying acts committed by attorneys in representing clients in litigation.see,chavez mendoza th,d dowling zimmerman th,d.
if the court finds the defendant has made the threshold showing,it determines then whether the plaintiff has demonstrated a probability of prevailing on the claim.equilon enterprises consumer cause,supra,cal th at,d.in order to establish a probability of prevailing on the claim code civ,subd.b,a plaintiff responding to an motion must state and substantiate a legally sufficient claim.citations.put another way,the plaintiff must demonstrate that the complaint is both legally sufficient and supported by a sufficient prima facie showing of facts to sustain a favorable judgment if the evidence submitted by the plaintiff is credited.citations.wilson parker,covert chidester cal th,d.

the common law tort of abuse of process arises when one uses the court process for a purpose other than that for which the process was designed.witkin,summary of cal.law ed.torts,see also kappel bartlett d.it has been interpreted broadly to encompass the entire range of procedures incident to litigation.barquis merchants collection cal d,fn.barquis.

c.the litigation privilege.
the litigation privilege is codified in civil code section section a privileged publication or broadcast is one made i n any judicial proceeding,subd.b.the privilege recognized in section derives from common law principles establishing a defense to the tort of defamation.oren royal oaks venture,supra,cal d at.
although originally enacted with reference to defamation citation,the privilege is now held applicable to any communication,whether or not it amounts to a publication citations,and all torts except malicious prosecution.citations.further,it applies to any publication required or permitted by law in the course of a judicial proceeding to achieve the objects of the litigation,even though the publication is made outside the courtroom and no function of the court or its officers is involved.citations.the usual formulation is that the privilege applies to any communication made in judicial or proceedings by litigants or other participants authorized by law to achieve the objects of the litigation and that have some connection or logical relation to the action.citations.silberg anderson cal d,silberg.thus,communications with some relation to judicial proceedings are absolutely immune from tort liability by the litigation privilege rubin green cal th,d,rubin.it is not limited to statements made during a trial or other proceedings,but may extend to steps taken prior thereto,or afterwards.witkin,summary of cal.law,supra,torts.
because the litigation privilege protects only publications and communications,a threshold issue in determining the applicability of the privilege is whether the defendant conduct was communicative or noncommunicative.kimmel goland cal d,kimmel.the distinction between communicative and noncommunicative conduct hinges on the gravamen of the action.rubin,supra,cal th at,d,pacific gas electric bear stearns cal d,fn.that is,the key in determining whether the privilege applies is whether the injury allegedly resulted from an act that was communicative in its essential nature.rubin,supra,cal th at,d,kimmel,supra,cal d at.the following acts have been deemed communicative and thus protected by the litigation privilege attorney prelitigation solicitations of potential clients and subsequent filing of pleadings in the litigation rubin,supra,cal th at,d,and testimonial use of the contents of illegally overheard conversation ribas clark cal d.the following acts have been deemed noncommunicative and thus unprivileged prelitigation illegal recording of confidential telephone conversations kimmel,supra,cal d at,eavesdropping on a telephone conversation ribas clark,supra,cal d at,and physician negligent examination of patient causing physical injury mero sadoff th,d.
the p leadings and process in a case are generally viewed as privileged communications.navellier sletten th,d.the privilege has been applied specifically in the context of abuse of process claims alleging the filing of false or perjurious testimony or declarations.pollock university of southern california th,d declaration functions as written testimony,is a communication,not conduct,and is exactly the sort of communication the privilege is designed to protect pettitt levy d.p reparing and presenting false documents is equivalent to the preparation and presentation of false testimony carden getzoff d.claim that expert witness had manufactured false evidence for former wife in dissolution action was privileged.thus,the court of appeal here correctly concluded that the communicative act of filing an allegedly false declaration of service of process fell within the litigation privilege.see also,steiner eikerling d.presentation of a forged will in a judicial proceeding constituted a publication under section pettitt levy,supra,d at.preparation and submission of false or forged building permit to city council and planning commission pursuant to alleged conspiracy was privileged.
however,the court of appeal further determined that the gravamen of the action was not the submission of false evidence.instead,it was a conspiracy to enforce a judgment obtained through the use of perjured declarations of service which culminated in the noncommunicative conduct of enforcing the judgment.recognizing that there is a conflict in the case law about whether the litigation privilege applies to postjudgment collection activities,the court of appeal chose to follow drum,supra,th,d.it noted that there,the filing was a document in support of a writ of execution actual execution of the writ was not a communication it concluded that,u nder the reasoning of the court in drum,the filing of a perjured proof of service may have been communicative but executing on the resulting default judgment was not.the litigation privilege therefore does not establish a complete defense to the abuse of process cause of action.
whether the litigation privilege applies to postjudgment collection conflict in the case law.
earlier cases have upheld actions for abuse of process involving allegedly improper collection practices without addressing the applicability of the litigation privilege.see,barquis,supra,cal d at,collection agency alleged practice of filing actions in multiple improper venues kappel bartlett,supra,d at.process server filing false declaration of service of process to obtain default judgment czap credit bureau of santa clara valley d.collection agency levy executed on exempt wages and threatened subsequent levies arc investment tiffith,d supp,levy executed on judgment debtor exempt wages.however,later cases applying the litigation privilege have narrowed the tort reach in the context of enforcements of judgments.brown,supra,th at,d kompa th,d merlet rizzo th,d merlet.
in merlet,supra,th,d,the plaintiff sued for abuse of process after the defendants filed a motion for a writ of sale against a property owned by the plaintiff and a motion for reconsideration after the trial court denied the issuance of the writ.the court of appeal held that the defendants acts were covered by the litigation privilege because they were clearly permitted by law in the course of a judicial proceeding.id.at,d.
in,supra,th,d,the plaintiff sued for abuse of process after the defendants had attempted to enforce a judgment for attorney fees while the action was on appeal and arguably stayed.one of the defendants levied on a bank account while the other defendant filed an allegedly fraudulent abstract of judgment with the recorder office.the court of appeal held that those efforts to enforce the judgment were privileged because they were an extension of th e judicial process and were logically and legally related to the realization of a litigation is,collection of a judgment.id.at,d.the court reasoned that the fact the conduct occurred outside the courtroom and after trial rather than before or during trial,as in the vast majority of litigation privilege cases was immaterial.id.at,d.
in brown,supra,th,d,the plaintiff sued for abuse of process against the defendant,a judgment creditor attorney in the underlying action.the plaintiff alleged that the defendant had enforced an invalid judgment by applying for and obtaining a writ of execution and levying on exempt funds.the court of appeal noted that,generally,judgment enforcement efforts are considered to be within the litigation privilege because they are an extension of a judicial proceeding and related to a litigation objective.id.at,d.nevertheless,the plaintiff contended that his abuse of process claim arose from the wrongful levy,which was neither a statement nor a communication within the litigation privilege.ibid.in rejecting the argument that the levy was not a communication within the litigation privilege,the court stated the act of applying for a writ is privileged.the privilege extends to torts arising from the privileged statement or publication.as such,not only does the privilege protect the application for the writ of execution,it also extends to the act of carrying out the directive of the writ.id.at,d,fns.omitted.
in contrast,the drum court later held that wrongfully levying on property pursuant to a writ of execution is not subject to the litigation privilege.drum,supra,th at,d.the plaintiff there sued for abuse of process against the defendants,the judgment creditor attorneys in the underlying action.the plaintiff alleged that the defendants wrongfully levied on a writ of execution against him after the underlying judgment had been stayed.the trial court dismissed the complaint for abuse of process after granting the defendants motion,but the court of appeal reversed.id.at,d.although the court of appeal in drum agreed with merlet,it criticized and brown for failing to distinguish between conduct and publications.drum agreed that,as in those cases,the filings of motions for a writ of sale and reconsideration and an abstract of judgment,and an application for a writ of execution were privileged.but it disagreed that levying on exempt funds was also privileged because its essential nature was action,not communication.id.at fn,d.i t does not follow that,merely because the application for the the statement by the judgment creditor to the clerk that the creditor has a judgment and requests the issuance of a a privileged communication,subsequent acts in levying on property are likewise privileged.id.at,d.the line is crossed when the levying officer,on behalf of the judgment creditor,actually levies on the property.that is a taking the act of removing property from one source here a financial institution and depositing it in a place controlled by the levying officer.id.at,d.
e.the litigation privilege protects the communicative act of filing a declaration of service,the gravamen of the abuse of process claim in this case.
rusheen argues that the courts of appeal in drum and in this case correctly determined that the wrongful act of levying on property in execution of judgment is a noncommunicative act in its essential nature and is thus unprivileged.however,even if levying on property involves a noncommunicative physical act,those courts failed to address the relevant question of whether the gravamen of the action was communicative or noncommunicative conduct 
drum assumed without analysis that the gravamen of the judgment debtor cause of action for abuse of process was based on the physical act of levying on property,rather than on the communicative process of applying for the writ of execution.but it is arguable that the gravamen of the action there was the judgment creditor application for writ of execution in violation of the stay,and that the subsequent levy on property during the stay merely resulted from the writ of execution.olszewski scripps health cal th,d,defendant filing of statutory liens resulting in allegedly unlawful seizure of funds was communicative conduct protected by litigation privilege hagberg california federal bank cal th,d,hagberg citizen reports of suspected criminal activity to law enforcement resulting in alleged false arrest and imprisonment of another was communicative conduct protected by litigation privilege.
similarly,the court of appeal here concluded that the filing of a perjured proof of service may have been communicative but executing on the resulting default judgment was not.it further concluded that the gravamen of the action was a conspiracy to enforce a judgment obtained through the use of perjured declarations of service,which culminated in the noncommunicative conduct of enforcing the judgment.it thus appears that the court of appeal identified two,rather than a single,gravamen of the action the alleged conspiracy and the actual enforcement by way of levy.
however,as cohen points out,the court of appeal reliance on an alleged conspiracy was misplaced.the second amended the operative pleading here no longer contained a claim of conspiracy against cohen.the conspiracy cause of action had been previously dismissed without leave to amend the first amended.additionally,a civil conspiracy does not give rise to a cause of action unless an independent civil wrong has been committed.the elements of an action for civil conspiracy are formation and operation of the conspiracy and damage resulting to plaintiff from a wrongful act done in furtherance of the common design.doctors superior court cal d.
the court of appeal failed to identify any allegedly wrongful conduct by cohen other than simply filing perjured declarations of service.although the court stated that the conspiracy culminated in the noncommunicative conduct of enforcing the judgment,enforcement of a judgment in this case by way of levy is simply the object of any civil action for damages.brown,supra,th at,d enforcement proceedings are an extension of the judicial process and related to a litigation objective.indeed,the court further stated somewhat inconsistently that the gravamen of the complaint here is that cohen and his coconspirators obtained a judgment by default by using false proofs of service italics added,conduct that is manifestly communicative.
on close analysis,the gravamen of the action was not the levying act,but the procurement of the judgment based on the use of allegedly perjured declarations of service.because these declarations were communications made in judicial or proceedings by litigants or other participants authorized by law to achieve the objects of the litigation and that have some connection or logical relation to the action silberg supra,cal d at,the litigation privilege applies to the declarations and protects against torts arising from the privileged declarations.id.at.moreover,as cohen argues,since a party may not be liable for submitting false testimony or evidence in the course of judicial proceedings which are used to obtain a judgment,the party should likewise be immune from abuse of process claims for subsequent acts necessary to enforce it.otherwise,application of the litigation privilege would be thwarted.thus,where the gravamen of the complaint is a privileged communication,allegedly perjured declarations of service the privilege extends to necessarily related noncommunicative acts,act of levying.
