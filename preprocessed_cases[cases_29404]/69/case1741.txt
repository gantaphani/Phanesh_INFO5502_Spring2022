in this asbestos personal injury case,a jury found arvinmeritor,arvinmeritor liable to gordon and emily for compensatory and punitive damages.on appeal,arvinmeritor does not challenge the jury verdicts as to liability or the amount of compensatory damages.it contends only that the trial court erred in declining to reduce the amount of punitive damages awarded by the jury.
arvinmeritor disputes the punitive damages award on two grounds first,that the amount is excessive under california law in light of arvinmeritor financial condition,and in particular,the evidence that arvinmeritor has a negative net worth and second,that the ratio of punitive to compensatory damages is so high as to violate the due process clause of the united states constitution,under the guidelines adopted by the united states supreme court.
as to the first contention,we hold that there is no legal requirement that punitive damages must be measured against a defendant net worth.here,there was expert testimony that arvinmeritor net worth was not a reliable indicator of its ability to pay punitive damages,and that other indicators in its financial data merited the amount of the award.
as to arvinmeritor second contention,we conclude that the to one ratio of punitive damages to compensatory damages awarded by the jury did not violate the federal due process clause of the fourteenth amendment,or the guidelines for making such awards as articulated by the united states supreme court.
consequently,we affirm.
facts and procedural background 
as is required on review after a jury trial,in reciting the facts,we resolv e all conflicts in the evidence and all legitimate and reasonable inferences that may arise therefrom in favor of the jury findings and the verdict.citations.weeks baker mckenzie th,weeks.we give only a general summary of the facts relating to liability and compensatory damages,because the details are not germane to the issues presented by this appeal.
arvinmeritor is the successor in interest to another company,rockwell which manufactured brake shoes for installation on commercial trucks during the time frame involved in this case.the brake shoes were fitted with linings that were manufactured by a number of other companies,including pneumo abex llc abex,the respondent in a companion appeal to this one 
by the,arvinmeritor knew that workers exposed to asbestos dust were at risk of developing diseases.indeed,in and again in,it wrote letters to abex and other manufacturers complaining about the presence of asbestos dust in the brake linings it was receiving from them.nonetheless,arvinmeritor did not place any warnings on its products until the early,and continued to market brakes until its inventory of them was exhausted sometime in the early.not until the fall of did arvinmeritor include an express reference to cancer in the warnings on its products.
bankhead was exposed to asbestos dust from brake linings during the years he worked at automotive maintenance facilities,primarily as a parts man,starting in and continuing through his retirement in.as a result of this exposure,bankhead contracted mesothelioma,a form of lung cancer,in.before his mesothelioma was diagnosed in january,bankhead experienced difficulty breathing,and underwent painful medical treatment to drain fluid from one of his lungs.after the diagnosis,bankhead was told he only had months to live and as his disease progressed,the quality of his life decreased significantly.at trial,bankhead medical experts testified that his condition would become increasingly painful until his inevitable death.
after bankhead mesothelioma was diagnosed,he sued numerous defendants,including arvinmeritor and abex.by the time the case went to trial,bankhead had settled with all but four of the defendants.the jury found against all of the defendants as to liability,allocating fault percent to each brake lining manufacturer abex and one other,percent to each brake shoe manufacturer arvinmeritor and one other,and percent to other defendants.the jury also found all defendants liable for punitive damages.
the jury calculated respondents economic damages at million,including bankhead medical expenses,lost earnings,and lost retirement benefits,and the value of the household services he had been providing before he became ill.it also awarded a total of million in noneconomic damages for bankhead pain,suffering,and emotional distress,and his wife loss of consortium.based on its percent share of fault,arvinmeritor was held jointly and severally liable for the million in economic damages,and severally liable for of the noneconomic damages,for a total of million 
a separate trial was held to determine the amount of punitive damages to be assessed against each defendant.by the time of that trial,all defendants except arvinmeritor and abex had settled.at the punitive damages trial,respondents presented an expert witness,robert johnson,to testify about arvinmeritor financial condition.in evaluating arvinmeritor economic status,johnson reviewed publicly available documents filed with the securities and exchange commission,including arvinmeritor,and annual k reports its adjusted k reports a proxy statement sent to shareholders and data regarding its market capitalization.these are generally accepted financial documents used and relied upon by economists or experts in finance to evaluate a company.
johnson testified that between and,arvinmeritor attained over billion in sales revenue each year,and an average annual profit of million arvinmeritor lowest performing year during that period was,but even in that year,it had million in cash available to it.in,arvinmeritor annual sales revenues reached billion its annual report indicated it had earned million in profit and it reported to its shareholders that it had earned a million net profit a conservative figure,as johnson explained,because companies seek to reduce their reported net income,using legally available deductions such as depreciation,in order to minimize their tax liability.at the end of,arvinmeritor had on hand some million in cash and cash equivalents,and its outstanding stock had a total market value of almost billion.
arvinmeritor chief executive officer,who also served as its board chair and corporate president,earned over million in,and stood to receive between million and million upon leaving the company.johnson explained that a company willingness and ability to pay sums of this magnitude to its chief executive is an indicator of financial strength.given all of these facts,johnson opined that arvinmeritor is financially sound.
johnson acknowledged that arvinmeritor reported that as of,it had a negative net worth of billion.he opined,however,that this number,taken on its own,did not reflect the full context of arvinmeritor financial condition and ability to pay.johnson explained that net worth is only one of a number of different tools that we use to assess a company financial health,wealth and condition,and opined that net worth is probably one of the least reliable financial metrics or statistics you can use,because there are a number of financial or accounting transactions in which a company can engage to lower its net worth,while remaining profitable.johnson testified that net worth is not a measure of a company financial condition totally or their ability to pay,because even within the guidelines of the generally accepted accounting principles net worth is something that can be pretty easily manipulated.as an example,johnson noted that a company can reduce its net worth simply by repurchasing shares of its stock.
johnson explained that because net worth can be unreliable,banks look instead to a company cash flow and profits,which are the most reliable indicators of its ability to repay debt,in determining whether to lend money to it.for this reason,companies with a negative net worth are still able to borrow money.indeed,arvinmeritor itself borrowed a total of million in,and still had million available on its line of credit as of september of that year.
johnson also acknowledged that over the past couple of years,arvinmeritor had been weathering the financial travails of the economy its sales had not gone up,and it had lost some money.he believed,however,that arvinmeritor was still a financially sound company that was able to meet all of its obligations,was not anywhere near on the verge of bankruptcy,and had generally turned the corner.in all but one year during the period johnson considered,the company losses resulted primarily from significant capital expenditures,as well as expenses for research and development.
arvinmeritor trial counsel johnson,but arvinmeritor did not offer any expert witness or other evidence to cast doubt on johnson methodology or his conclusions.in its opening brief on appeal,arvinmeritor cites various financial data taken from arvinmeritor annual report.however,though the report was entered into evidence,johnson was not asked about those particular figures at trial,and they were not called to the attention of the jury.
the jury returned a verdict awarding respondents million in punitive damages against arvinmeritor.arvinmeritor filed motions for judgment notwithstanding the verdict and for new trial.the trial court denied both motions,and this timely appeal ensued.
discussion 
amount of punitive damages relative to financial condition 
arvinmeritor first argument on appeal is that the punitive damages award is excessive under california law,primarily because of arvinmeritor negative net worth.arvinmeritor argues that because of its financial condition,the award should be stricken altogether,or reduced to at most.
standard of review 
in california,a trial court reviews a motion challenging the excessiveness of an award of punitive damages as a thirteenth juror the trial court is in a far better position than an appellate court to determine whether a damage award was influenced by passion or prejudice.citation.in reviewing that issue,moreover,the trial court is vested with the power,denied to us,to weigh the evidence and resolve issues of credibility.citation.citation.boeken philip morris,th,boeken.in contrast,we,as an appellate court,can not reweigh the credibility of witnesses or resolve conflicts in the evidence.citation.we must view the conflicting evidence regarding punitive damages in the light most favorable to the judgment pursuant to the familiar substantial evidence rule.citation.rufo simpson th,rufo.
impartial review of a punitive damage award by an appellate court is an important part of the procedural due process to which a defendant subject to punitive damages is entitled under both the state and federal constitutions.pacific mutual life insurance haslip,las palmas associates las palmas center associates d,las palmas.appellate review for passion and prejudice provides defendants with an additional safeguard to ensure that the award does not exceed an amount necessary to accomplish the societal goals of punishment and deterrence.las palmas,supra,at.accordingly,we review an award of punitive damages to determine whether the award is excessive as a matter of law,or raises a presumption that it is the product of passion or prejudice.
in so doing,we evaluate the award under three criteria the nature of the defendant wrongdoing the actual harm to the plaintiff and the defendant wealth neal farmers ins.exchange cal d,neal see adams murakami cal d,adams.an appellate court will not reverse the jury determination unless the award as a matter of law is excessive or appears so grossly disproportionate to the relevant factors that it raises a presumption it was the result of passion or prejudice.citations.rufo,supra,th at.
punitive damages and defendant wealth 
under california law,w ealth is an important consideration in determining the excessiveness of a punitive damage award.because the purposes of punitive damages are to punish the wrongdoer and to make an example of him,the wealthier the wrongdoer,the larger the award of punitive damages.citation.downey savings loan ohio casualty ins.d,citing bertero national general cal d.o bviously,the function of deterrence will not be served if the wealth of the defendant allows him to absorb the award with little or no discomfort.citations.neal,supra,cal d at.moreover,b oth california and the federal authorities agree that profits earned from tortious activity that supports an award of punitive damages are appropriately considered in the amount awarded.citations.boeken,supra,th at.
in assessing whether a punitive damages award is excessive relative to the defendant wealth,the key question is whether the amount of damages exceeds the level necessary to properly punish and deter.citations.adams,supra,cal d at.calculation of punitive damages involves a fluid process of adding or subtracting depending on the nature of the acts and the effect on the parties and the worth of the defendants.devlin kearny mesa,d,devlin.these factors are not evaluated under a rigid formula.whether punitive damages should be awarded and the amount of such an award are issues for the jury and for the trial court on a new trial motion.all presumptions favor the correctness of the verdict and judgment.citation.id.at.juries have a wide discretion in determining what is proper.citation.citation.id.at.
nonetheless,b ecause the important question is whether the punitive damages will have the deterrent effect without being excessive,an award that is reasonable in light of the reprehensibility of the defendant conduct and injury to the victims,may nevertheless be so disproportionate to the defendant ability to pay that the award is excessive for that reason alone.citation.t he purpose of punitive damages is not served by financially destroying a defendant.the purpose is to deter,not to destroy.citation.rufo,supra,th at.
net worth as a measure of wealth 
in the present case,arvinmeritor principal ground for contending the award is excessive under california law is its contention that punitive damage awards are limited to percent of the defendant net worth,which in arvinmeritor case was negative.contrary to arvinmeritor contention,however,net worth is not the only measure of a defendant wealth for punitive damages purposes that is recognized by the california courts.indeed,it is likely that blind adherence to any one standard of determining wealth could sometimes result in awards which neither deter nor punish or which deter or punish too much.lara cadag th,fn.lara.
although net worth is the most common measure of the defendant financial condition,it is not the only measure for determining whether punitive damages are excessive in relation to that condition.citations.rufo,supra,th at.for example,in rufo,the court upheld a punitive damages award that technically exceed ed the wealthy individual defendant net worth,because the evidence showed that the defendant would not be financially destroyed by the award.id.at.
moreover,as one california court has pointed out,n et worth is subject to easy manipulation and should not be the only permissible standard.lara,supra,th at,fn.thus,for example,in michelson hamada th,the evidence of the defendant financial condition included net worth statements for two successive years.the first statement,which was prepared for submission to a bank as part of a loan application,showed a far higher net worth figure than the second,which was prepared for use in the litigation.the trial judge called the lower figure patently crooked,and the court of appeal,although holding the punitive award excessive,agreed that the higher figure was the appropriate one to use for the purpose of determining that question.id.at.
in zaxis wireless communications,motor sound th zaxis,the court affirmed an award of punitive damages in the amount of,even though the defendant had a negative net worth of million,because the evidence showed that the defendant had the ability to pay the award.id.at.the court noted that the california supreme court has expressly declined to adopt net worth as the standard for determining a defendant ability to pay in any given situation.citation.id.at,citing adams,supra,cal d at,fn.it agreed that n et worth is too easily subject to manipulation to be the sole standard for measuring a defendant ability to pay id.at,citing lara,supra,th at fn.noting the ease with which net worth is subject to adjustment for amortization and depreciation,the court pointed out that in the case before it,the net worth calculation included accumulated depreciation and a note to the sole shareholder,which represent ed a loss for accounting purposes,but did not impact the defendant ability to pay in the same way that salary and wage expenses would.zaxis,supra,th at.
the zaxis court also noted that the defendant financial statement showed it had cash on hand and a checking account balance of over million,as well as a credit line of million,of which million remained available to the defendant.the extension of the line of credit indicate d the lender made a determination the defendant had the ability to pay amounts well in excess of the punitive damage award.zaxis,supra,th at.accordingly,the award was not excessive as a matter of law or so disproportionate to the ability to pay as to indicate passion or prejudice on the part of the jury.ibid.
similarly,in devlin,supra,d,the court affirmed a punitive damages verdict against a corporation that represented percent of its annualized net worth,or almost four months net profit.see id.at.in rejecting the defendant argument that the award was excessive,the devlin court relied in part on an unexplained accounting adjustment in the company financial records that operated to reduce its net worth.see id.at.the court also took note of a resolution authorizing the corporation to borrow money,opining that a resolution to borrow serves as an indicator of the continuing health and viability of a business.id.at.the devlin court compiled a list of cases in an attempt to discover a formula for determining whether a given percentage of net worth is excessive ultimately concluded there is no formula,and that each case must be decided on its own facts,considering various indicators of wealth rufo,supra,th at,citing devlin,supra,d at.thus,the court held that in arriving at the amount of punitive damages,the trial court properly took into account the defendant net worth plus a variety of other figures relating to the defendant wealth,and noted that o ther courts have considered various asset and income figures relevant to the issue of punitive damages.devlin,supra,at.
arvinmeritor challenge to the punitive damages award relies primarily on a plethora of older california cases to the effect that punitive damages amounting to more than percent of the defendant net worth are excessive.the most recent case arvinmeritor cites for this proposition is sierra club foundation graham th.in that case,the court affirmed a punitive damages award amounting to between two and three percent of defendant net worth.as part of the rationale for affirming the award,the court noted that it was far less than the percent cap generally recognized by our courts.citation.
arvinmeritor also relies for this point on weeks,supra,th at pages.in that case,the court affirmed an award that the trial judge had reduced to five percent of the defendant net worth.in so doing,the court noted that i t has been recognized that punitive damages awards generally are not permitted to exceed percent of the defendant net worth.citation.
in michelson hamada,supra,th at pages,the court vacated an award of punitive damages equal to percent of the defendant net worth,and remanded for remittitur or retrial.in that context,the court noted that punitive damages awards generally are not allowed to exceed percent of the net worth of the defendant.citation.similarly,in storage services oosterbaan d,in reversing an award amounting to percent of the defendant net worth,the court indicated that punitive damage awards are generally not allowed to exceed percent of the defendant net worth.
in seeley seymour d,which arose from the defendant unethical business tactics,the court vacated as excessive an award of million in punitive damages,which was equal to times the compensatory damages,and remanded for a new trial on both compensatory and punitive damages.while expressly declining to compare the punitive damages to the defendant net worth,the court remarked in dictum that awards totalling more than percent of a defendant net worth have been disfavored by our courts id.at.
in burnett national enquirer,d,a defamation case,the court held that an award of million in punitive damages,which the trial court had reduced to,was still excessive,inasmuch as it amounted to percent of the defendant million net worth.the court ordered a new trial unless the plaintiff accepted a reduction to.id.at.this figure was three times the compensatory damages,and fell between five and six percent of the defendant net worth,but the court did not rely on either of these facts.indeed,the court did not articulate any rationale for the choice of the figure,and made no reference to any set limitation on punitive damages as a percentage of net worth.
in goshgarian george d,the court noted that punitive damage awards exceeding percent of a defendant net worth have generally been disfavored by the appellate courts id.at,italics omitted,and on that basis,concluded that a punitive damage award amounting to approximately percent of the defendant net worth was not unduly disproportionate to his wealth.id.at.the court did hold the amount of punitives awarded was too large,but only because the defendant conduct in draining his swimming pool across his neighbors property was not sufficiently reprehensible to support such a large award.id.at.
in little stuyvesant life ins.d,the court held that a punitive damages award of million,which was more than percent of the defendant net worth,and times the compensatory damages,was excessive as a matter of law.it ordered a new trial unless the plaintiff agreed to reduce the award to the amount of punitive damages originally demanded in her complaint,which was.
in merlo standard life acc.ins.d,the court reversed the award of punitive damages on a number of grounds,including that the amount of the award was almost of the defendant net worth,as shown by the uncontradicted evidence.it remanded for a retrial on liability for punitive damages,as well as the amount.in neither of these cases did the court make any mention of any fixed limitation on punitive damages as a percentage of the defendant net worth.
arvinmeritor argues these cases establish,as a matter of law,that punitive damages may not exceed percent of the defendant net worth,which represents a cap on allowable punitive damage awards.however,as shown by our summaries in the preceding paragraphs,none of the cited cases actually held that punitive damages exceeding percent of the defendant net worth are per se impermissible.moreover,these cases can not be read as requiring punitive damages to be measured only against the defendant net worth despite undisputed expert testimony that the defendant net worth is not an accurate measure of its wealth.
here,the jury was entitled to credit johnson uncontroverted testimony that arvinmeritor was far wealthier than its stated net worth would indicate,and that net worth alone is an untrustworthy standard,because it is so easily manipulated.johnson caveat about the perils of relying solely on a net worth valuation standard echoed the same concerns expressed by the courts in the relatively more recent zaxis,rufo,lara,and devlin cases.zaxis,supra,th at rufo,supra,th at lara,supra,th at fn.devlin,supra,d at.thus,we reject the argument that percent of net worth constitutes a ceiling above which juries may not go in setting the amount of punitive damages.
the issue before us on review is not whether the award exceeds some specified percentage of the company net worth.rather,it is whether the trial court abused its discretion in determining that the amount of punitive damages awarded by the jury was not the result of passion or prejudice.our task simply is to determine whether,c onsidering all the factors,the punitive damages award,in light of the defendant wealth and the gravity of the particular act,exceed s the level necessary to properly punish and deter.citation.rufo,supra,th at.
the size of the jury punitive damage verdict,and the trial judge denial of arvinmeritor motions for judgment notwithstanding the verdict and for new trial,imply that both the jury and the trial judge accepted johnson assessment as to arvinmeritor ability to pay the million punitive damages award.this implied factual finding is fully supported by the evidence.
as already noted,in,arvinmeritor earned a cash flow profit of million,and reported a net profit of million.the compensation of its ceo was million.moreover,while the company had a negative net worth of billion,it was able to borrow million in,and had million in cash or the equivalent at its disposal as of the end of the year.
the jury punitive damages award of million amounted to percent of arvinmeritor net profit for.while this is hardly a slap on the wrist,million is only a small percentage about percent of arvinmeritor immediately available funds as of the end of.it is significantly less than what arvinmeritor paid its ceo that year,and less than of the amount arvinmeritor had promised to pay its ceo if he were fired without cause million or replaced if the company were sold million.moreover,johnson testimony that the company was financially sound was uncontroverted,and arvinmeritor chose not to introduce evidence tending to show that it would be financially destroyed by an award of million in punitive damages 
under these circumstances,we can not say that the jury punitive damages award,though large,is so disproportionate to arvinmeritor ability to pay as to lead ineluctably to the conclusion that the award resulted from passion or prejudice.rather,the jury was justified by the evidence in concluding that an award of that magnitude was necessary and appropriate in order to punish arvinmeritor for its contribution to causing the disease that took bankhead life,and to deter arvinmeritor and other manufacturers from failing to take every available precaution to mitigate workers exposure to toxic substances.
due process constraints on punitive damages 
as an additional ground for striking or reducing the punitive damages award,arvinmeritor argues that the size of the award exceeds the federal constitutional limits applicable to state court punitive damages awards.these limits were articulated in a line of united states supreme court cases culminating in state farm mut.automobile ins.campbell,state farm.see also cooper industries,leatherman tool group,bmw of north america,gore,bmw.
nature of constraints and standard of review 
the due process clause of the fourteenth amendment to the united states constitution places constraints on state court awards of punitive damages.citations.roby mckesson cal th,roby see state farm,supra,at bmw,supra,at.the imposition of grossly excessive or arbitrary awards is constitutionally prohibited,for due process entitles a tortfeasor to fair notice not only of the conduct that will subject him to punishment,but also of the severity of the penalty that a state may impose.citation.simon san paolo holding,cal th,simon.
in state farm,the high court articulated three guideposts for courts reviewing punitive damages the degree of reprehensibility of the defendant misconduct the disparity between the actual or potential harm suffered by the plaintiff and the punitive damages award and the difference between the punitive damages awarded by the jury and the civil penalties authorized or imposed in comparable cases.citations.roby,supra,cal th at,quoting state farm,supra,at.our own supreme court has characterized the constitutional test as a weighing analysis looking to the nature and effects of the defendant tortious conduct and the state treatment of comparable conduct in other contexts.simon,supra,cal th at.
in adjudicating a due process challenge to a punitive damages award,we review the express or implied factual findings of the trier of fact under the deferential substantial evidence test.however,we make our own independent assessment of the reprehensibility of the defendant conduct,the relationship between the award and the harm done to the plaintiff,and the relationship between the award and civil penalties authorized for comparable conduct.citations.simon,supra,cal th at.
reprehensibility of arvinmeritor conduct 
of the three guideposts that the high court outlined in state farm,supra,at page,the most important is the degree of reprehensibility of the defendant conduct.on this question,the high court instructed courts to consider whether the harm caused was physical as opposed to economic the tortious conduct evinced an indifference to or a reckless disregard of the health or safety of others the target of the conduct had financial vulnerability the conduct involved repeated actions or was an isolated incident and the harm was the result of intentional malice,trickery,or deceit,or mere accident.citation.roby,supra,cal th at.
in the present case,all of these factors weigh in favor of a high degree of reprehensibility.as the court put it in boeken,supra,th at page,intentionally marketing a defective product knowing that it might cause injury and death is highly reprehensible.citation.in the present case,bankhead contracted a painful cancer,and ultimately died,due to arvinmeritor and the other defendants failure to ensure that people like bankhead who used or worked with products were not exposed to lethal asbestos dust.arvinmeritor conduct continued over many years,and evinced an indifference to or reckless disregard of the health and safety of bankhead and those similarly situated.see philip morris usa williams,evidence of actual harm to nonparties can help to show that the conduct that harmed the plaintiff also posed a substantial risk of harm to the general public,and so was particularly reprehensible see also bullock,supra,th at in determining reprehensibility,court relied on fact that tobacco company knew many smokers would suffer death or serious injury,but sought for many years to convince public that health concerns regarding smoking were unfounded.
arvinmeritor argues that bankhead was not financially vulnerable.we disagree.as industrial workers,bankhead and others who were exposed to asbestos fibers on the job were financially vulnerable in that they could not avoid the exposure without leaving their employment.see generally roby,supra,cal th at characterizing relatively employee as financially vulnerable to employer discrimination and harassment gober ralphs grocery th,group of grocery store employees who relied on their jobs for their livelihood were financially vulnerable boeken,supra,th at characterizing consumers of tobacco products as financially vulnerable 
finally,we come to the issue of intentional,repeated conduct versus a accident.the jury found against arvinmeritor on those issues,concluding that arvinmeritor was percent responsible for the damages resulting from bankhead asbestos exposure,and that it acted with malice,fraud,or oppression.our obligation to conduct a due process analysis regarding punitive damages does not create an opportunity for arvinmeritor to make an end run around those factual findings.gober,supra,th at in deciding the constitutional maximum,a court does not decide whether the verdict is unreasonable based on the facts.while there is no evidence that arvinmeritor intended to injure bankhead or anyone else in particular,its prolonged failure to take adequate measures to protect people who worked with its products against a known hazard to their health and safety justifies the jury conclusion that its conduct towards workers exposed to the hazards in its products was malicious,fraudulent,or oppressive.
arvinmeritor attempts to minimize its degree of reprehensibility by emphasizing that the jury determined it was only percent at fault for bankhead exposure to asbestos.neither state farm,supra,nor any of the cases on which arvinmeritor relies holds that a defendant degree of reprehensibility for punitive damages purposes is affected by whether the conduct of others was concurrently responsible for the plaintiff injuries.rather,for the purpose of the punitive damages analysis,the proper role of the jury finding assigning arvinmeritor a low percentage of liability is to reduce
