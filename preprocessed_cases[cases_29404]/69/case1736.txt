a widow sued her stepsons,a law firm,a lawyer,and a paralegal,over an estate plan that purportedly divested her of the percent share of the marital estate that she would have received from her husband as the surviving joint tenant of the properties they held together in joint tenancy.the estate plan served to sever all of the joint tenancies and transfer the husband percent share in the properties to a trust for the benefit of the two stepsons,to the exclusion of the widow.
before trial,the widow settled with the stepsons.after a jury awarded the widow in damages against the law firm,the lawyer,and the paralegal,the court reduced the award to zero.on appeal,the widow claims the court erred in making a code of civil procedure section offset against the jury award.she has failed to meet her burden to show error.we affirm.
factsa.allegations of the second amended complaint 
elaine oliveira elaine filed a second amended complaint against richard neil oliveira,ii rick in his capacity as trustee of the richard neil oliveira trust dated april,the trust,patrick neil denmark patrick,citadel law offices and financial citadel,dael kiesler kiesler,and daniel clark hales hales.in that complaint,she alleged as follows.
she was married to richard neil oliveira decedent at the time of his death on june,having been married to him for more than years.rick and patrick were decedent sons by a prior marriage.hales was an attorney and the owner and operator of citadel,and kiesler was the agent employee of hales and citadel.hales,citadel and kiesler are hereinafter collectively referred to as the attorney defendants,from time to time.
elaine and decedent owned a number of properties as their community property.those properties were their marital residence on delong street in cypress,california,a single family residence on tully place in cambria,california,and three undeveloped lots in cambria.they held title to the properties in joint tenancy and it was always their mutual intention that the properties pass to the survivor of them.
rick desired to obtain control of decedent assets.in furtherance of this goal,he hired the attorney defendants to set up an estate plan for decedent.
when decedent was in failing health,kiesler,not a lawyer,came to the residence of elaine and decedent and recommended that each of them establish a separate trust.kiesler did not disclose either that she was rick agent or that she,hales and citadel had a conflict of interest in representing both elaine and decedent.kiesler,either alone or with the assistance of hales,prepared the trust and certain deeds,without explaining that the execution of the trust and the deeds would be to the disadvantage of elaine.via the three deeds,each recorded may,decedent severed the joint tenancies in the properties and transferred his undivided percent interest in each property to the trust.the trust left all of the trust property to rick percent and patrick percent.had the properties not been transferred into the trust,elaine would have acquired title to each of the properties on decedent death,as the surviving joint tenant.
the second amended complaint contained six causes of action.the first cause of action,against rick and patrick only,was to invalidate,rescind and nullify the trust.elaine asserted that at the time decedent executed the trust,he did not have the requisite mental capacity to do so.she further asserted that rick and kiesler exerted undue influence over decedent.
the second,third and fourth causes of action were against all defendants.in the second cause of action,elaine sought to cancel the three deeds on the basis of undue influence.she reasserted all of the facts previously alleged and further alleged,inter alia,that rick and the attorney defendants acted with malice and oppression and intended to cause her injury.
in the third cause of action,elaine sought to cancel the three deeds due to mistake.decedent did not understand that by executing the grant deeds,he was depriving elaine of her right of survivorship.in the fourth cause of action,elaine sought to cancel the three grant deeds due to fraudulent concealment.she alleged that hales and kiesler purported to provide legal services to decedent and elaine without disclosing that they were operating as the agents of rick and had an irremediable conflict of interest.
the fifth cause of action was against the attorney defendants only,for negligence.it was based on kiesler practicing law without a license,hales and citadel permitting the same,and hales and citadel failure to provide proper legal advice to elaine,or to disclose the conflicts of interest to her.
the sixth cause of action was against hales and citadel,for legal malpractice.elaine asserted that rick contacted hales and citadel to take advantage of decedent when he was seriously ill and to cheat her out of her survivorship interests in the properties.
good faith settlement with rick and patrick 
on september,elaine entered into a settlement agreement with rick,individually and as trustee of the trust,and patrick.elaine agreed to dismiss her complaint against rick and patrick,and rick agreed to dismiss his against elaine,in consideration of the following rick and patrick,would quitclaim their interests in the delong residence to elaine,with rick to retain a right of first refusal should elaine choose to sell and an option to purchase should elaine still own the property on her death the tully place residence would be listed for sale,with elaine and rick to receive each of the net proceeds of sale rick would receive the three vacant lots in fee simple and would assume all indebtedness thereon elaine would receive a motor home,a boat,a motorcycle,and six additional vehicles rick would receive other motorcycles and vehicles rick would receive certain tools,equipment and jewelry elaine would receive certain antiques and the contents of the delong residence elaine would release rick and patrick and rick and patrick would each release elaine.
rick,individually and as trustee,patrick,and the attorney defendants,lodged a stipulation for determination of good faith settlement.in that stipulation,they agreed that the settlement between elaine,rick and patrick was entered into in good faith,the court could so determine,and it could also determine that rick and patrick as settling defendants were entitled to the protections of code of civil procedure section,subdivision b.elaine made no opposition.the court determined that the settlement agreement was entered into in good faith and that the provisions of section,subdivision b would be applied to the settling defendants.
trial with respect to attorney defendants 
special verdicts 
elaine lawsuit proceeded to trial against the attorney defendants.in its special verdicts,the jury found that the attorney defendants intentionally concealed an important fact from elaine,resulting in a economic loss to her breached a fiduciary duty to elaine,resulting in a economic loss to her and committed negligence,resulting in a economic loss to elaine.
proposed judgment,objections,motion for judgment notwithstanding the verdict 
elaine filed a proposed judgment in the amount of plus costs against the attorney defendants jointly and severally.the attorney defendants objected to the proposed judgment.they claimed,inter alia,that a code of civil procedure section offset was required.
in the body of their objections,the attorney defendants purportedly quoted at length from a transcript of elaine closing argument.her attorney showed the jury a chart of elaine damages.he stated the value of the delong residence as opined by elaine,the value of the tully place residence,and the value of the three undeveloped lots.he stated the total real property loss was.he also said the total value of elaine loss with respect to the vehicles was.elaine attorney stated,in sum,that the total loss for real property and personal property combined was.
the attorney defendants pointed out that in the trial against them,elaine sought damages with respect to the same property that was the subject of the settlement with rick and patrick.because the jury award pertained to the same property,the attorney defendants claimed the value of the settlement with rick and patrick should be offset against the jury award,pursuant to code of civil procedure section.the net result,they claimed,was that the judgment should be reduced to zero.
in their objections,the attorney defendants also stated that they had raised,with both counsel for elaine and the judge,the question of whether the jury should be asked to provide specific values for the various items of property at issue,but that both of them indicated it was unnecessary.the objections were supported by the declaration of attorney christopher kanjo,representing the attorney defendants.he declared toward the end of the trial in this matter,i asked both counsel for elaine and his honor in the hallway following a sidebar whether the jury should not be asked to provide specific values as to the various items of property in which elaine was claiming a community property ownership.i specifically stated that in the event of a verdict there would have to be an offset,and that it could be helpful to know the values assigned by the jury.both his honor and elaine counsel stated to me that it was not necessary,using words along the lines of i think we can figure that out.
the attorney defendants also filed a motion for judgment notwithstanding the verdict.they argued that even if all the evidence proffered by elaine at trial is accepted as true,she failed to show the conduct of the attorney defendants caused the loss of an enforceable property interest,and thus failed to show that she suffered any recoverable damages,so that judgment must be entered in favor of the attorney defendants and against elaine.the attorney defendants argued,inter alia,that a joint tenant has the absolute right to sever a joint tenancy and that the loss of an expectancy is not the loss of an interest which can form the basis of an action at law.capitalization omitted.
in its minute order,the court stated motion for judgment judgment grant the motion to correct judgment to reflect offset is granted.after reduction for the settlement,the judgment is reduced to zero.the minute order further stated this court does not need to determine the exact amount of the settlement.it is clear that its value exceeds the judgment.
the judgment recited the special verdicts.it concluded with this language this court,however,on the motions of the attorney defendants,determined that the value of the consideration previously received by elaine as part of a settlement with rick and patrick was greater than the joint and several jury verdict and as a result,the court is reducing this judgment to zero pursuant to,over the objection of elaine.
discussiona.code of civil procedure section 
code of civil procedure section provides in pertinent part where a release is given in good faith before verdict or judgment to one or more of a number of tortfeasors claimed to be liable for the same tort,or to one or more other mutually subject to contribution rights,it shall have the following effect a it shall not discharge any other such party from liability unless its terms so provide,but it shall reduce the claims against the others in the amount stipulated by the release,or in the amount of the consideration paid for it,whichever is the greater.b it shall discharge the party to whom it is given from all liability for any contribution to any other parties italics added.
tortfeasors liable for the same tort 
elaine seizes upon the italicized language and says that code of civil procedure section does not apply to the facts of this case.first,she argues that rick and patrick,on the one hand,and the attorney defendants,on the other hand,are neither joint tortfeasors,nor tortfeasors claimed to be liable for the same tort,within the meaning of section.
as our supreme court stated in mesler bragg management cal d,the language of section is significant its drafters did not use the narrow term joint tortfeasors,they used the broad term tortfeasors claimed to be liable for the same tort.this language was meant to eliminate the distinction between joint tortfeasors and concurrent or successive tortfeasors citation,and to permit broad application of the statute.citations.id.at accord,gackstetter frawley th,fn.section has been construed to apply even more generally to all tortfeasors joined in a single action whose acts or omissions concurred to produce the sum total of the injuries to the plaintiff.citations.citations.gackstetter frawley,supra,th at.
for example,in kohn superior court d,the purchasers of a residence filed suit against a number of parties,including the seller and his affiliates collectively,sellers,and certain contractors,each of whom had performed work or services on the property before the completion of the sale.the purchasers alleged that the sellers had misrepresented the condition of the property and had breached their fiduciary duties to disclose that the property had been damaged in a fire.they also alleged that one contractor had negligently performed repairs on the property and a structural pest control company had negligently performed an inspection thereon.in addition,the purchasers alleged that all defendants had conspired to conceal the fire damage and had committed fraud.the purchasers entered into a settlement agreement with the repair contractor and the structural pest control company before trial.those settling defendants then obtained a good faith settlement determination and a dismissal of the sellers.id.at.
the sellers filed a writ petition to challenge the good faith settlement determination and the dismissal of their.kohn superior court,supra,d at.they argued that code of civil procedure section was inapplicable because they and the settling defendants were not claimed to be liable for the same tort,within the meaning of the statute.they explained that they were being sued,in essence,for fraud,whereas the settling defendants were being sued for the failure to properly repair or inspect the property.kohn superior court,supra,d at.
the appellate court in kohn superior court,supra,cal.app d held that code of civil procedure section applied.it stated here,there was but one injury,the purchase of a house which was worth less than plaintiffs believed.citation.the alleged tortious activities by the contractor,pest control inspector and seller were not independent,but combined to create one indivisible injury which took place when the sale was consummated.kohn superior court,supra,d at.
likewise,in the matter before us,there was one injury the loss of anticipated survivorship interests in certain properties due to the creation and implementation of an estate plan that terminated the joint tenancies.the alleged tortious activities,even to the extent labeled as different causes of action,were not independent.the purported actions of rick,in hiring the attorney defendants to further his plan,and of the attorney defendants,in preparing the documents to effectuate the plan,combined to create one indivisible injury when the documents were signed,the joint tenancies were terminated,and the new estate plan was put into place.
elaine nonetheless insists that code of civil procedure section can not apply,because an attorney can not be a joint tortfeasor with a.she impliedly states that rick and patrick,as,can not be held liable for legal malpractice or breach of fiduciary duty,and concomitantly,that legal malpractice and breach of fiduciary duty are separate torts from those rick and patrick committed.
in support of her contention,elaine cites munoz davis d.that case is inapposite.first and foremost,it has nothing to do with code of civil procedure section.moreover,the concepts expressed in that case are not helpful to elaine position in any event.
in munoz davis,supra,d,the plaintiff was injured in an automobile accident.he hired the defendant,an attorney,to file a lawsuit against the driver of the other automobile involved in the accident.however,the attorney failed to file a lawsuit before the expiration of the statute of limitations.when the plaintiff sued the attorney,the latter filed a against the driver for equitable indemnificatio
