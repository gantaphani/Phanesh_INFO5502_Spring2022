oea,oea appeals the final judgment incorporating the district court orders of september,and march,granting summary judgment for evanston insurance company evanston and royal insurance company of america royal and awarding prejudgment interest to evanston the insurance policies at issue are general commercial liability policies,with the royal policy providing excess coverage above the evanston policy.in granting summary judgment,the district court determined that evanston and royal were not obligated to defend and indemnify oea in two actions brought by employees of oea subsidiary oea aerospace,aerospace,and that evanston was entitled to reimbursement of and prejudgment interest on funds it had paid toward oea defense and settlement pursuant to a reservation of rights.on appeal,oea contends that the district court erroneously decided a disputed issue of fact in granting summary judgment for evanston and royal and that the district court erred in awarding prejudgment interest for evanston where oea liability was not established until the grant of summary judgment.because the reimbursement to evanston and the award of prejudgment interest were both proper,we affirm 
background 
oea is a delaware corporation with its principal place of business in denver,colorado.until,it manufactured booster caps and other items for use in the aerospace industry many of its products had explosive components,including the booster caps.aerospace is located in fairfield,california and is the wholly owned subsidiary of oea.oea alleges that it transferred its aerospace business to aerospace in and,from that point on,limited its business to manufacturing automotive safety devices.
in two incidents in late and early,aerospace employees patricia shugart shugart and karen wise wise were injured while repairing booster caps originally sold and manufactured by oea.both employees eventually retained the same kranz kranz.shugart filed suit on december,and wise did so on february.the complaints are virtually identical both name oea,oea aerospace,and does through as defendants and allege liability under theories of general negligence,products liability,premises liability,and strict liability.
oea purchased a general liability policy from evanston in,with policy limits of million per claim and million in the aggregate.the evanston policy period ran from may,to may,and provided coverage for claims first made during the policy period.the policy defines a claim as a notice received by the insured of an intention to hold the insured responsible for an occurrence involving the policy and shall include the service of suit or institution of arbitration proceedings against the insured.the royal policy provided million in excess coverage above the evanston policy during a policy period coterminous with the evanston policy period.oea contends that,prior to the policy period,it was unaware of shugart and wise intent to hold oea liable.
aerospace was served with shugart complaint on june,but oea was not served until over a year later on october.on november,james welsh welsh,oea director of personnel and security,was served with wise complaint as agent for service of process of oea aerospace,welsh,however,was not the agent for service of process for aerospace.it does not appear that wise made any further attempts to serve oea or aerospace.
when aerospace received the shugart complaint in june,it forwarded a copy to welsh at oea,but welsh concluded that shugart claim would be handled exclusively as a worker compensation claim.he notified aerospace worker compensation carrier of the claim through its agent,patricia hollenbeck.when welsh received the wise complaint,he followed the same procedure.
oea and aerospace filed answers to the shugart and wise complaints on january,and march,respectively.aerospace was ultimately dismissed from the actions because the claims were barred under the worker compensation laws.
following a jury trial,a judgment including million in punitive damages was entered against oea in the shugart suit.the california court of appeal,however,overturned the jury award on june,and remanded for a new trial.shugart oea,no,wl,at cal.june,as modified july.oea later settled both suits.under a full reservation of rights,evanston paid toward oea defense in the shugart case and paid to defend and settle the wise suit.
evanston filed suit in state court on november,alleging that oea was liable for breach of contract,intentional misrepresentation,and rescission of insurance contract.after removing these suits to federal court on grounds of diversity of citizenship,oea brought counterclaims against evanston,royal,and other insurers not party to this appeal,alleging breach of contract and breach of the covenant of good faith and fair dealing.royal counterclaimed and thereafter filed a first amended counterclaim against oea on october.
oea,evanston,and royal filed motions for partial summary judgment on the issue of whether the evanston and royal policies provided coverage for the wise and shugart claims.in its september,order,the district court concluded that the claims were not covered because they were first made in,prior to the evanston and royal insurance policy period.the court therefore granted partial summary judgment for evanston and royal.
evanston then moved for summary judgment,seeking reimbursement of amounts paid for oea defense and prejudgment interest from the date of payment.the district court granted the motion by its order of march.after the district court denied oea motion for reconsideration,evanston requested the entry of judgment.the judgment and amended judgment were entered for evanston on february,and february,respectively,and oea timely appealed.we have jurisdiction under.
liability for costs of defense and settlement 
oea challenges the district court grant of summary judgment on the amounts paid for defense and settlement,arguing that the district court erred by resolving a factual dispute when it determined that the shugart and wise claims were first made prior to the evanston and royal policy period.we review a district court grant of summary judgment de novo.arakaki hawaii,cir.in reviewing the grant of summary judgment for evanston and royal,w e must determine,viewing the evidence in the light most favorable to oea,whether there are any genuine issues of material fact and whether the district court correctly applied the substantive law.see olsen idaho state bd.of,cir.we do not weigh the evidence or determine the truth of the matter instead,we only determine whether there is a genuine issue for trial.see balint carson city,cir en banc.
it is undisputed that oea became aware of the shugart complaint in june and the wise complaint in november,before the evanston and royal policy periods commenced on may.relying on this fact and the content of the complaints,the district court held that the claims were first made in.but,oea contends that it did not become aware of shugart and wise intention to hold oea liable for their injuries until october,by which time the policies were in effect.oea argues that in granting summary judgment on this issue,the district court wrongly decided a disputed it was reasonable for oea to read the complaints as not evincing an intent to hold oea liable for the injuries at issue.we disagree.the complaints make clear shugart and wise intention to hold oea liable,and the district court properly held that there was no genuine issue of material fact as to the date the claims were first made.
only claims first made against the insured during the policy period are covered by the evanston and royal policies.a claim is defined in the evanston policy as a notice received by the insured of an intention to hold the insured responsible for an occurrence involving this policy and shall include the service of suit or institution of arbitration proceedings against the insured.the district court interpreted this language as follows 
the policy defines claim as a notice.without saying so explicitly,evanston and oea appear to agree that the language incorporates a reasonable person standard.a foolish or overly sophisticated failure or refusal to
