the dispute in this case arose after northrop corporation acquired grumman aerospace,for whom worked.at the relevant time,was on loan to the federal government to work on a project in san diego under a secondment agreement and grumman relocation policy.he subsequently relocated to los alamos.sued to recover unpaid relocation expenses and consequential damages flowing from alleged breaches of the grumman contract.in the last appeal,we held that the district court erred in denying consequential damages.ii.at.we reasoned it was undisputed that northrop grumman did not pay certain relocation costs it agreed were due,and it was reasonably foreseeable that would have to get money from some source to pay those expenses resulting in extra costs to him.id.at.noting that these holdings were law of the case,we remanded with directions for entry of an award of consequential damages that includes at least an amount reimbursing the penalties paid and interest lost on the funds was forced to withdraw from his retirement account to pay for undisputed relocation costs.id.we further directed the district court to consider all other claims for consequential damages and make specific findings as to each claim.id.

contends the district court erred in items,and of its award.he argues in addition that the court erred by failing to address his claim for lost earnings on the uncontested damages paid in the partial settlement in,and his claim for penalties and taxes on sip withdrawals made to cover increased taxes because he had no mortgage interest deduction in and 
we determined in the first appeal that new york law applies to this case.i,at.we stated that is entitled to damages that will put him in the same economic position in which he would have been if northrop grumman had not breached the contract with him,including any foreseeable economic injury resulting from the breach and the costs of mitigation.see id.at.we review the district court findings on damages for clear error.see easley cromartie,d furr v.at t,cir.to reverse under this standard requires that,based on the entire evidence,we have a definite and firm conviction that a mistake has been committed.easley,at.we review the district court legal conclusions de novo.dang unum life ins.of,cir.
does not dispute the amounts the district court awarded to reimburse him for the taxes and penalties he paid on withdrawals from his retirement account to pay undisputed relocation costs.in,was withdrawn to pay taxes and penalties,as shown in item of the district court order,and in,was withdrawn to pay taxes and penalties,as shown in item.rather,as explained below,disputes the district court failure to award lost earnings on these amounts,plus earnings on earnings,along with other items of consequential damages.
moving expenses and the value of vacation time used to move item 
we affirm the denial of claim for moving expenses.the district court denied this claim because did not hire movers or pay a moving fee to anybody,and he has provided no legal authority to justify an award for the value of his own labor.
we also affirm the denial of claim for the value of vacation time he used to move twice between rental houses in los alamos.although the district court erroneously denied relief because no longer worked for northrop grumman at the time he made these moves,did not contend his vacation time had a cash value or cite any legal authority showing he can claim his salary as the value of his vacation time.
lost mortgage interest deduction item 
the district court denied claim for damages for the lack of a mortgage interest deduction on his tax returns for the time between july,until september.we remand this claim for reconsideration.
argued that he was entitled to a lost mortgage interest deduction because northrop grumman failure to pay his relocation costs prevented him from buying a house in los alamos before september.he asserted that the lack of an interest deduction raised his taxes,which caused him to withdraw funds from his sip to pay his increased taxes in and,and incur taxes and penalties on the sip withdrawal.he also claims we directed that such an award be made,aplt.opening br.at,but we actually held only that such a claim was not foreclosed and that the district court should consider it.ii.at.presented tax returns for,and in support of these claims.
the district court agreed that sustained some damage by way of having to pay more income tax than he otherwise would have paid commencing in,vol.v at.the court concluded,however,that it would be virtually impossible to calculate the loss due to not having a mortgage interest deduction.id.the court stated that because did not itemize in and did not provide a return,it was unclear what his other deductions would have been.see id.
argues that he provided sufficient evidence to support an award for his lost mortgage interest deduction.we agree this claim is not speculative,assuming seeks a minimum award.he correctly states that the tax savings on a mortgage interest deduction are determined by his federal and state tax rates and the amount of mortgage interest claimed,not by the amount of his other deductions.see aplt.opening br.at.the evidence could support an award,for example,as long as the mortgage interest he would have been able to claim on his federal taxes exceeded the standard deduction,and as long as the calculation of damages included only the amount of an itemized interest deduction that would have exceeded the standard deduction.
testified that a month was a reasonable figure to assume would have gone to interest payments,based on the rent he had been paying in los alamos.see,vol.at.he showed that this is less mortgage interest than he actually paid in on his house in california or paid in the year on his house in los alamos.aplt.opening br.at citing tax returns at,vol.ii at.present calculation of the resulting loss does not match his testimony at trial.compare aplt.opening br.at with,vol.at.more importantly,however,did not subtract the amount of the standard deduction,wh
