this is a patent case concerning the scope of our jurisdiction over declaratory judgment actions.prasco,llc prasco brought a declaratory judgment action against medicis pharmaceutical and imaginative research associates,collectively the defendants,seeking a declaration that one of its products did not infringe various patents owned by the defendants.the district court dismissed the action for lack of jurisdiction,concluding that prasco complaint failed to establish a case or controversy under article iii of the constitution.prasco llc medicis pharm,wl,prasco i prasco llc medicis pharm,wl july,prasco ii.because the district court was correct that under the standard affirmed in medimmune,genentech,d,this action does not present an article iii case or controversy,we affirm.
as this case was dismissed on the pleadings,for the purposes of this appeal,we must take the facts in the complaint as true.medicis markets a benzoyl peroxide cleansing product triaz,which is marked as being covered by four patents,patent the patent the patent the patent and the patent.prasco makes a generic benzoyl peroxide cleansing product oscion,which it alleges will directly compete with medicis triaz product.the patent is owned by medicis the,and patents are owned by imaginative research associates and licensed to medicis.
on may,prasco filed the current action,requesting a declaratory judgment that oscion did not infringe the,and patents at the time that prasco filed its declaratory judgment action,it had not yet begun marketing oscion,but had devoted substantial efforts to development and marketing plans.
prasco does not dispute that the defendants did not know about the existence of oscion until the complaint was served.rather,in its initial complaint,prasco based its alleged article iii jurisdiction on two facts unrelated to the existence of oscion medicis marking of triaz products with the numbers of the four to satisfy the public notice requirements of and an infringement suit brought by medicis against prasco and another generic company in october,concerning a different cleanser product,covered by an unrelated patent 
defendants moved to dismiss the initial complaint on the grounds that a lack of case or controversy precluded subject matter jurisdiction.after the suit and the motion to dismiss werefiled,prasco sent a sample of oscion and an ingredient list to medicis and imaginative research associates and requested a covenant not to sue under the four patents.the defendants did not sign the covenant not to sue and responded with a single sentence letter advising that they do not plan to withdraw their motion to dismiss the complaint.prasco subsequently filed a second complaint,styled an amended complaint that included this conduct and the fact that it had begun to market oscion.defendants renewed their motion to dismiss.
shortly after the supreme court issued its decision in medimmune,genentech,d,the district court granted the motion to dismiss the amended complaint.prasco i,wl,at.medimmune reaffirmed that the proper test for subject matter jurisdiction in declaratory judgment actions is whether the facts alleged,under all the circumstances,show that there is a substantial controversy,between the parties having adverse legal interests,of sufficient immediacy and reality to warrant the issuance of a declaratory judgment.medimmune.at.at the time of the district court initial decision,this court had yet to issue a decision interpreting medimmune,and notwithstanding the medimmune court statement that the federal circuit reasonable apprehension of suit test for determining subject matter jurisdiction in declaratory judgment actions contradicted earlier supreme court precedent,id.at,the district court applied the federal circuit reasonable apprehension of suit test and found that prasco had not alleged a case or controversy.prasco i,wl.in a footnote,however,the court noted that even if medimmune had overruled the reasonable apprehension of suit test,it would still conclude that there was no case or controversy because there was no definite and concrete dispute that touches the legal relations of these parties.prasco i,wl at.

the only issue on appeal is whether the facts alleged in this case establish that there is a justiciable case or controversy within the meaning of the declaratory judgment act and article iii of the constitution.we review issues of jurisdiction de novo.novartis,at.
the declaratory judgment act provides 
in a case of actual controversy within its jurisdiction any court of the united states,upon the filing of an appropriate pleading,may declare the rights and other legal relations of any interested party seeking such declaration,whether or not further relief is or could be sought.
the declaratory judgment act is not an independent basis for subject matter jurisdiction.skelly oil phillips petroleum.rather,it provides a remedy available only if the court has jurisdiction from some other source.cat tech llc tubemaster,citing aetna life ins.haworth.such jurisdiction is limited by article iii of the constitution,which restricts federal judicial power to the adjudication of cases or controversies.const.art.iii,cat tech llc,at.the declaratory judgment act requirement of a case of actual controversy simply affirms this constitutional requirement,having long been interpreted as referring to any case and controversy that is justiciable under article iii.see aetna life,at.explaining that the phrase cases of actual controversy refers to controversies which are such in the constitutional sense see also medimmune.at.thus,as long as the suit meets the case or controversy requirement of article iii,a district court may have jurisdiction over a declaratory judgment action.novartis,at 
for there to be a case or controversy under article iii,the dispute must be definite and concrete,touching the legal relations of parties having adverse legal interests,real and substantial,and admi t of specific relief through a decree of a conclusive character,as distinguished from an opinion advising what the law would be upon a hypothetical state of facts.medimmune.at quoting aetna life,at.as the supreme court has recently reiterated,however,there is no rule for determining whether an action satisfies the case or controversy requirement.id.to the contrary,t he difference between an abstract question and a controversy contemplated by the declaratory judgment act is necessarily one of degree,and it would be difficult,if it would be possible,to fashion a precise test for determining in every case whether there is such a controversy.cas.pac.coal oil.instead of a rule,the analysis must be calibrated to the particular facts of each case,cat tech llc,at,with the basic standard being whether the facts alleged,under all the circumstances,show that there is a substantial controversy,between parties having adverse legal interests,of sufficient immediacy and reality to warrant the issuance of a declaratory judgment,medimmune.at quoting.cas,at.see also caraco pharm.labs.forest.while this standard can be analyzed directly,the supreme court has also developed various more specific but overlapping doctrines rooted in the same article iii inquiry,which must be met for a controversy to be justiciable,including standing,ripeness,and a lack of mootness.see caraco,at citing lujan defenders of wildlife,d standing abbott labs.gardner,d ripeness and parole comm geraghty,d mootness.as satisfying these doctrines represents the absolute constitutional minimum for a justiciable controversy,they can be a helpful guide in applying the test.id.
prior to medimmune,this circuit had generally required that a declaratory judgment plaintiff in a patent dispute demonstrate conduct by the patentee that created a reasonable apprehension of suit on the part of the declaratory judgment plaintiff and present activity by the declaratory judgment plaintiff that could constitute infringement or meaningful preparation to conduct potentially infringing activity.see,glaxo novopharm.however,in medimmune,the supreme court found that requiring a reasonable apprehension of suit conflicted with the court precedent.medimmune.at.while the supreme court rejected the reasonable apprehension of suit test as the sole test for jurisdiction,it did not completely do away with the relevance of a reasonable apprehension of suit.rather,following medimmune,proving a reasonable apprehension of suit is one of multiple ways that a declaratory judgment plaintiff can satisfy the more general test to establish that an action presents a justiciable article iii controversy.caraco.at 
as an initial matter,the parties dispute whether the allegations in prasco amended complaint that concern actions taken after the filing of the initial complaint can be used to establish subject matter jurisdiction.because the amended complaint included allegations regarding events that happened after the first complaint,technically it is a supplemental complaint,not an amended complaint.see.d allowing a party to serve a supplemental pleading setting forth transactions or occurrences or events which have happened since the date of the pleading sought to be supplemented charles alan wright,arthur miller mary kay kane,federal practice and procedure,at parties and courts occasionally confuse supplemental pleadings with amended pleadings and mislabeling is common.however,these misnomers are not of any significance and do not prevent the court from considering a motion to amend or supplement under the proper portion of rule.
rule d expressly allows for supplemental complaints to cure defects in the initial complaint.d permission to serve a supplemental pleading may be granted even though the original pleading is defective in its statement of a claim for relief or defense.the supreme court has confirmed that supplemental pleadings can be used to cure subject matter jurisdiction deficiencies.see mathews diaz,d explaining that there was little difficulty in a party failure to file an application that was a nonwaivable condition of jurisdiction until after he was joined in the action because a supplemental complaint in the district court would have eliminated this jurisdictional issue see also charles alan wright,arthur miller mary kay kane,federal practice and procedure,at explaining that,prior to the amendment to rule d,some courts had not allowed curing of defects through supplemental complaints,but that the addition of the second sentence to d in removed any uncertainty on the point.
thus,while l ater events may not create jurisdiction where none existed at the time of filing,the proper focus in determining jurisdiction are the facts existing at the time the complaint under consideration was filed.gaf.materials elk,emphasis added quoting arrowhead indus.water,ecolochem,see also rockwell int l united states,d w hen a plaintiff files a complaint in federal court and then voluntarily amends the complaint,courts look to the amended complaint to determine jurisdiction.connectu llc zuckerberg,cir.as the district court accepted prasco amended complaint,it is the amended complaint that is currently under consideration,and it is the facts alleged in this complaint that form the basis for our review 
considering the totality of the circumstances,prasco has not alleged a controversy of sufficient immediacy and reality to create a justiciable controversy.this immediacy and reality inquiry can be viewed through the lens of standing.to satisfy standing,the plaintiff must allege an,a harm that is concrete and actual or imminent,not conjectural or hypothetical,that is fairly traceable to the defendant conduct,and redressable by a favorable decision.caraco,at quoting steel citizens for a better env t,d see also daimlerchrysler cuno,d.absent an fairly traceable to the patentee,there can be no immediate and real controversy 
as prasco acknowledges,medimmune does not change our rule that the existence of a patent is not sufficient to establish declaratory judgment jurisdiction.see capo,dioptics med.prods,more is needed than knowledge of an adversely held patent.the mere existence of a potentially adverse patent does not cause an injury nor create an imminent risk of an injury absent action by the patentee,a potential competitor is legally free to market its product in the face of an patent.novartis,at.
prasco argues that a case and controversy has nevertheless been created because medicis has caused prasco to suffer an actual,paralyzing uncertainty from fear that medicis will bring an infringement suit against it.appellant br.as prasco admitted at oral argument,however,any uncertainty has not been paralyzing.to the contrary,notwithstanding this lawsuit,prasco has launched its oscion product.more importantly,the supreme court has emphasized that a fear of future harm that is only subjective is not an injury or threat of injury caused by the defendant that can be the basis of an article iii case or controversy.city of lyons,d see also indium of am,a purely subjective apprehension of an infringement suit is insufficient to satisfy the actual controversy requirement.rather,it is the reality of the threat of injury that is relevant to the standing inquiry,not the plaintiff subjective apprehensions.lyons,at.emphasis in original see also laird tatum,d allegations of a subjective chill are not an adequate substitute for a claim of specific present objective harm or a threat of specific future harm the federal courts established pursuant to article iii of the constitution do not render advisory opinions.although medimmune clarified that an sufficient to create an actual controversy can exist even when there is no apprehension of suit,it did not change the bedrock rule that a case or controversy must be based on a real and immediate injury or threat of future injury that is caused by the objective standard that can not be met by a purely subjective or speculative fear of future harm.thus,as we explained,jurisdiction generally will not arise merely on the basis that a party learns of the existence of a patent owned by another or even perceives such a patent to pose a risk of infringement,without some affirmative act by the patentee.sandisk,at.
rather than a purely subjective fear or the mere existence of a potentially adverse patent alone,the alleged injury at the root of most justiciable declaratory judgment controversies in the patent context is a restraint on the free exploitation of goods,or an imminent threat of such restraint.caraco,at quoting red wing shoe.
a patentee can cause such an injury in a variety of ways,for example,by creating a reasonable apprehension of an infringement suit,arrowhead indus.water,at,demanding the right to royalty payments,medimmune.at,or creating a barrier to the regulatory approval of a product that is necessary for marketing,caraco,at.see also arrowhead indus.water,at describing the type of sad and saddening scenario that led to enactment of the declaratory judgment act in which the patent owner attempts extrajudicial patent enforcement with tactics that infect the competitive environment of the business community with uncertainty and insecurity.
prasco does not allege that defendants had actually restrained its right to freely market oscion at the time the supplemental complaint was filed.rather,it is the threat of future injury that forms the basis for prasco complaint.thus,there can be no controversy without a showing that this threat was real,imminent,and traceable to defendants.
taking all the facts into account,prasco has not met this threshold burden of proving an immediate and real controversy.important to the totality of the circumstances analysis in the instant case is that which has not occurred.generally,the supreme court has affirmed declaratory judgment jurisdiction when the parties had taken adverse pos
