background 
in,guy caldwell started guy brand snack foods,a business he built into the primary regional snack food manufacturer in the country.trial tr.vol.i at.the business changed hands through the years,but maintained strong regional sales for its products.for instance,in,and,guy brand sales were approximately million per year.in,guy parent company filed for bankruptcy protection,and guy brand products were off the market for a short time.siefert company purchased guy and the brand reentered the market.soon,however,siefert company also floundered,and it filed for bankruptcy in.guy products again left the market.then,in the summer of,heartland acquired guy brand name,trade names,recipes,and packaging.according to tom price,president of heartland kansas city sales,heartland intent was to return guy brand products to their former strong market position.
shortly after heartland became owner of guy,mccleary,which was also in the snack food business,approached heartland and expressed interest in pursuing a partnership.on september,heartland and mccleary reached a written agreement whereby mccleary will act as the exclusive distributor of guys branded snack food products throughout kansas,missouri,and southern illinois.at.the products included in the agreement were described as substantially all of the product classes categories previously sold under the guys brand,specifically including potato chips,extruded cheese products,peanuts,popcorn,pretzels,tortilla chips,pork rinds,and can or jar salsa dips.id.according to the agreement,mccleary was responsible not only for the distribution of guy brand products,but also was bound to coordinate the manufacture of all guys branded products from the date of signing of this agreement until such time as a heartland owned manufacturing facility is completed and capable of producing guys branded products in such quantities and at such quality that meets or exceeds demand in the defined geographic territory.id.at.the agreement was written for a term,renewable for another five years at the written request of either party.
within thirty days of signing the agreement,mccleary had entered the kansas city market with a portion of the guy brand product line.because mccleary had previously been distributing its own pajeda brand snacks,it substituted guy brand products in much of the shelf space formerly occupied by pajeda.by so doing,mccleary was not required to engage stores in negotiations for shelf space it simply filled its own products space with guy brand snacks.
in late october or early november of,mark stisser,the managing director of heartland,met with pat mccleary,president of mccleary.stisser shared his concern that mccleary manufacturer was not using the correct recipe in producing guy brand products.at the same meeting,pat mccleary shared some potential marketing programs with stisser.stisser expressed his excitement at using these programs to gain share in the saint louis market.in response,pat mccleary explained that he was not ready to enter saint louis.mccleary had a business relationship with jay,another snack food manufacturer and major competitor of guy.according to stisser,pat mccleary stated,well,jay,one of my biggest customers,owes me million and you got to give me a little bit of time in louis.trial tr.vol.i at.neither pat mccleary nor anyone other at mccleary had informed heartland of its business association with jay prior to signing the agreement.
over the next few months,the relationship between mccleary and heartland eroded significantly.when mccleary put forth its projections for kansas city only area that mccleary had entered with guy brand found the projections exceedingly modest and asked for reconsideration.heartland attempted to reach agreement with mccleary on other marketing and sales goals and strategies,but found it difficult to communicate with mccleary.despite heartland insistence that mccleary expand its distribution ring,mccleary continued to distribute guy products only in kansas city.the product that it did distribute continued to be substandard,at least in the eyes of heartland.
on february,stisser wrote to mccleary,demanding that mccleary put forth a timetable for entering the saint louis market.mccleary did not respond.by letter dated april,stisser again wrote to mccleary to inform mccleary that heartland considered mccleary to be in default of the agreement.heartland detailed numerous issues surrounding mccleary nonperformance of its obligation to produce and distribute guy brand products throughout the region referenced in the agreement.nonetheless,mccleary still refused to introduce guy brand products anywhere other than kansas city.in july of,heartland sent written notice to mccleary that it was terminating the contract.
heartland then filed suit in district court,making numerous claims related to the guy agreement.four of those claims proceeded to trial on august,including one alleging breach of contract,one alleging breach of an implied covenant of good faith and fair dealing,and a fraud claim while the former two claims pertained only to mccleary,the fraud claim named mccleary,as well as pat mccleary and jerry stokely,president of mccleary snack food division,personally,as defendants.
at trial,heartland introduced the expert testimony of ed crumm.he was hired to testify as to the extent of heartland damages related to the guy agreement.crumm testified that he was a certified public accountant with years of experience,much of that time dedicated to forecasting and projecting future business performance.he was intimately familiar with the historical performance of guy brand products,as he conducted auditing and accounting services for guy from through.crumm further testified that,from reviewing guy past performance and comparing it to mccleary actual and potential performance under the agreement,he was able to forecast figures that he believed reflected a conservative estimate of heartland damages.crumm concluded that heartland had lost a total of in royalty revenue during the contract period,and could expect to spend at least to return guy products to their former market position,for a total of in actual damages.
after a short period of deliberation,the jury returned verdicts in favor of heartland on all claims.pursuant to special interrogatories,the jury found in favor of heartland on the breach of contract and breach of implied covenant of good faith and fair dealing claims,assessing damages at million,further apportioning damages at million for each breach.on the remaining fraud in the inducement claim,the jury found against mccleary,pat mccleary,and jerry stokely,but only assessed damages against mccleary,again in the amount of million.mccleary then filed a motion to modify the judgment,which the district court granted in part because it found the claim for breach of an implied covenant of good faith and fair dealing was inconsistent with and duplicative of plaintiff breach of contract claim.mccleary addendum at.accordingly,the court vacated the judgment on the claim related to breach of an implied covenant of good faith and fair dealing,consequently reducing the jury verdict to.mccleary then filed this appeal,challenging numerous aspects of the trial and the judgment.heartland has,arguing that the district court erred in vacating in part the judgment in its favor.
admission of evidence from heartland expert witness 
mccleary first contends that heartland expert testimony and report were improperly admitted,and that,in the absence of that evidence,there was no evidence of damages,entitling mccleary to judgment as a matter of law.the admissibility of expert witness evidence is left to the discretion of the trial court,and accordingly,we review for an abuse of that discretion.joiner,d lauzon senco prods,cir.
in order to be admissible,expert testimony must be both relevant to a material issue and reliable.kumho tire carmichael,d see also miller baker implement,cir the district court fulfills its role as gatekeeper by screening the proposed evidence and evaluating it in light of the specific circumstances of the case to ensure that it is reliable and sufficiently relevant to assist the jury in resolving the factual disputes.we give district courts great latitude in determining whether expert testimony meets the reliability requisites of rule.first union bank benham,cir.
mccleary directs us to what it views as eight infirmities related to crumm expert opinion.they share a commonality,however,in that each point takes issue with assumptions crumm wove into his damages estimate.in other words,mccleary challenges the factual basis for crumm report on damages.time and again,we have noted that the factual basis of an expert opinion generally relates to the weight a jury ought to accord that opinion.marvin lumber,cedar ppg,cir.thus,unless the factual or methodological basis for the testimony is fundamentally unreliable,its admission is not an abuse of discretion.meterlogic,klt,cir see also children broadcasting walt disney,cir recognizing that challenges to the factual basis of an expert opinion do not generally affect its admissibility.
we thus turn to crumm testimony and report to ascertain whether they were rooted in reason and factually sufficient.crumm stated that he was a certified public accountant with years of experience in the field.he and his firm were in the business of forecasting revenue projections for businesses.he testified that he undertook this type of exercise to estimate the damages flowing from mccleary nonperformance on the contract.crumm began his analysis by considering the snack food market in relation to the agreement.he researched industry data as to the breadth of the market for snack food products,as well as historic data detailing guy brand product performance in those markets based on these figures and assuming that guy products would take some time to regain their prior position in the market,crumm was able to estimate how much revenue guy brand products could have generated during the contract.crumm then considered how mccleary had done under the contract,and compared that to his estimation of how guy brand products could reasonably be expected to perform.he found that mccleary conduct resulted in over million in lost guy sales,and over million in damage to heartland,including the estimated costs associated with relaunching the guy brand in the markets that mccleary had neglected.crumm his estimates by comparing these figures to his knowledge of guy historic performance,as well as the expenses it incurred in reentering the market after a previous bankruptcy.
mccleary suggests these estimates are unsound because they included assumptions about what level of market penetration guy brand products could achieve,how much market share guy products could attain,what classes of product were covered by the agreement,and what it would cost for heartland to reenter the market.as crumm aptly explained at trial,he made assumptions in areas where it was impossible to gather more concrete data due to mccleary nonperformance.contrary to mccleary suggestion,these assumptions were not the product of mere conjecture with no factual basis they were estimates generated through consideration of guy past performance and potential for future performance,given current accepted market conditions.as we recognized in cole control data,cir,under missouri law,the plaintiff was not required to prove the exact amount of his damages,but only to produce evidence which established them with reasonable certainty.moreover,it is the fact of damages,rather than the amount of damages,which must be proven with reasonable certainty.citation omitted.crumm testimony and report were sufficiently reliable and relevant that the court was within its discretion to admit them,and they support the jury verdict.we thus find no error in the admission of evidence from heartland expert witness.
ii.mccleary assignment of instructional error 
mccleary next argues that the district court erroneously instructed the jury with regard to heartland breach of contract claim,permitting the jury to find for heartland without regard to whether heartland substantially performed its obligations on the contract.the instruction read as follows 
your verdict must be for plaintiff and against defendant mccleary incorporated if you believe 
first,mccleary did not distribute substantially all of the product classes and categories previously sold under the guys brand to all classes of trade in the entire states of missouri,kansas,and southern illinois,and 
second,because defendant mccleary incorporated did not do the above,defendant contract obligations were not performed,and 
third,plaintiff was thereby damaged.
the district court enjoys broad discretion to instruct the jury in the form and language it considers fair and adequate to present the substantive law,and w e will not reverse absent harmful error.gray bicknell,cir.for a diversity claim such as this,the instructions as a whole must adequately and fairly reflect the state of missouri law on the issue.ford gacs,cir.
missouri supreme court has promulgated model jury instructions,entitled missouri approved jury instructions mai,for use in civil cases.see.civ,see also rice bol,if there exists an applicable mai,rule b mandates its exclusive use.the instruction given by the district court tracked mai,the common verdict directing instruction for missouri breach of contract actions.in contrast,the instruction proffered by mccleary included as an element that plaintiff substantially performed its agreement.heartland addendum at.this instruction is similar to mai.notes on use for that instruction,however,caution that t his instruction is not proper in all contract cases,and its committee comment states that it would be appropriate where recovery is sought on a building contract.this case,of course,does not involve a construction or building contract.moreover,mccleary has conceded that the substantial performance required of heartland in its proffered jury instruction was simply heartland agreement to allow mccleary to act as exclusive distributor of guy brand snacks.mccleary directs us to no evidence suggestive that heartland neglected its exclusivity obligation.a party is entitled to have the jury instructed consistent with his or her theory of the case,but only where some evidence supports that theory.see brown sandals resorts int l,cir the jury should receive instructions on issues supported by competent evidence in the record the trial court is not required to instruct on issues that do not find support in the record.a jury need not determine matters not in dispute,and here,there was no dispute that heartland allowed mccleary to act as the sole distributor of guy brand snacks.thus,the district court was within its discretion to reject mccleary proffered instruction on substantial performance.
mccleary further suggests that mai,which included as an element that plaintiff performed his agreement under the contract,was the appropriate instruction.mccleary did not proffer such an instruction to the district court.accordingly,our review is limited to plain error.cross cleaver,cir.in order to prevail on a claim of plain instructional error,mccleary must demonstrate that it is the victim
