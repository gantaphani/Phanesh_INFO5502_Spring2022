the cy pres doctrine allows a court to distribute unclaimed or portions of a class action settlement fund to the next best class of beneficiaries.see six mexican workers.citrus growers,cir.cy pres distributions must account for the nature of the plaintiffs lawsuit,the objectives of the underlying statutes,and the interests of the silent class members,including their geographic diversity.see id.the cy pres distributions here do not comport with our cy pres standards.while the donations were made on behalf of a nationwide plaintiff class,they were distributed to geographically isolated and substantively unrelated charities.
in august,four named plaintiffs dawn fairchild,brian geers,laurence gerard,and robert nachshin plaintiffs brought a class action lawsuit against america online,llc aol on behalf of a putative class consisting of more than million paid aol subscribers.plaintiffs alleged that aol wrongfully inserted footers containing promotional messages into sent by aol subscribers.the amended complaint asserted six causes of action violation of the electronic communications privacy act,et unjust enrichment violation of california business and professions code et breach of contract violations of the consumer legal remedies act,california civil code et and violation of california business and professions code et.
the parties entered into voluntary mediation to settle their dispute.working with retired district court judge dickran tevrizian,aol and plaintiffs eventually reached a class settlement the settlement.the settlement calls for the certification of a settlement class consisting of all current aol members,or about million subscribers.it further provides that aol will notify its members of the existence of the footer advertisements and their ability to opt out of the footers if aol continues to append footer advertisements to members outgoing,aol will the same notification to members every six months for a period of two years and aol will inform future members of the footers and provide a link enabling members to opt out of the footer advertisements.
the settlement also addressed plaintiffs claims for monetary damages.all parties agreed monetary damages were small and difficult to ascertain.the maximum recovery at trial would have been the unjust enrichment aol received as a result of its footer advertisement sales,or about million.divided among the more than million aol subscribers,each member of the class would receive only about cents.the cost to distribute these payments would far exceed the maximum potential recovery.
in lieu of a distribution to the plaintiff class and at judge tevrizian suggestion,the parties agreed that aol would make a series of charitable donations.because the plaintiffs were geographically and demographically diverse,the parties claimed they could not identify any charitable organization that would benefit the class or be specifically germane to the issues in the case.at the parties request,judge tevrizian suggested and the parties agreed that aol would donate to three charitable beneficiaries the legal aid foundation of los angeles,the federal judicial center foundation,and the boys and girls club of america shared between the chapters in los angeles and santa monica.
in addition and at the suggestion of judge tevrizian,the parties agreed to compensate the named class representatives for bringing the action by awarding to four charities of the class representatives choice rather than providing direct financial compensation.the settlement provides that aol will donate to a charity designated by each named representative.these designated charities include the new roads school of santa monica,designated by fairchild and nachshin oklahoma indian legal services,designated by geers and the friars foundation,designated by gerard.each entity is a organization with tax deductible status under c.
the district court granted preliminary approval of the settlement and provisionally certified the settlement class.shortly thereafter,aol sent an to over million members of the class notifying them of the settlement the notice.the notice explained that aol will make donations to several charities totaling notified class members that the full settlement agreement is available at the district court or online at the internet addresses provided in the notice and provided contact information,including phone numbers and an address,where inquiries could be sent.two members of the class objected to the settlement darren mckinney and janel buycks an additional aol subscribers opted out of the settlement,but failed to provide their names for the as required by the district court instructions,and seven failed to submit requests before the deadline.
on december,mckinney filed a formal objection to the proposed settlement pending before the district court.in his briefs and at oral argument,mckinney argued,among other things,that the charitable award does not meet the standard for cy pres,because the charities selected by the parties do not relate to the issue in the case and are not geographically diverse the district court judge should have recused herself given her husband position as a director on the board of one of the charity beneficiaries,the legal aid foundation of los angeles and aol notice to the class was defective,because it did not specify that fairchild worked for the charity she selected to receive a charitable donation.
the district court denied mckinney objections,finding that judge tevrizian involvement in the negotiations was a significant indicator of the agreement fairness,the class was receiving significant prospective relief in addition to the cy pres awards,and the charities that have been chosen are not inappropriate or out of line with other class actions settlements that i have seen approved in this court and in other courts.judge snyder also declined to recuse herself,explaining i have considered the motion,but i do not think it is a basis for recusing myself in this matter.i certainly had no involvement in picking the charities.the parties picked the charities and i was asked to approve the settlement.on december,the district court issued a final order re approval of class action settlement and final judgment thereon,noting that the court has considered and denied all objections filed in this action.on appeal,mckinney raises the same three objections he made before the district court.

we have recognized that federal courts frequently use the cy pres doctrine in the settlement of class actions where the proof of individual claims would be burdensome or distribution of damages costly.six mexican workers,at.the cy pres doctrine takes its name from the norman french expression,cy pres comme possible,which means as near as possible.in re airline ticket comm antitrust,cir citation omitted.the doctrine originated to save testamentary charitable gifts that would otherwise default.the cy pres doctrine allows a court to modify a trust to best carry out the testator intent that is,to effectuate the next best use of the gift.id.in the context of class action settlements,a court may employ the cy pres doctrine to put the unclaimed fund to its next best compensation use,for the aggregate,indirect,prospective benefit of the class.masters wilhelmina model agency,cir quoting herbert newberg alba conte,newberg on class actions ed.
