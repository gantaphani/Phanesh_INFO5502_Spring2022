the department of general services of the state of california state appeals from a postjudgment order denying its request to vacate that portion of a judgment awarding postjudgment interest against state at a rate of percent,which is contrary to article xv,section of the california constitution,providing for percent interest.we conclude that the order is appealable because it gives effect to that portion of a judgment awarding postjudgment interest which is claimed to be void.further,we determine that the award in excess of percent interest is void and thus subject to collateral attack because it constitutes relief which the court had no power to grant.accordingly,on remand the trial court will be directed to vacate that portion of the judgment awarding postjudgment interest in excess of percent.
background 
plaintiff is a commercial landlord who sued state for breach of a lease and obtained a judgment against state for damages of approximately million,plus prejudgment interest and postjudgment interest at the rate of percent.although state filed numerous objections to the proposed judgment,state did not challenge the postjudgment interest rate of percent.state appealed from the judgment but did not challenge the postjudgment percent interest rate on appeal.in may,we upheld the judgment in favor of plaintiff.see south spring street company department of general services may,nonpub.opn,wl.the remittitur was issued on july.
on august,plaintiff received a check from state for.according to plaintiff,the check was short by.state withheld that part of the judgment representing the award of postjudgment interest in excess of percent,claiming that plaintiff is entitled to only a percent rate pursuant to california constitution,article xv,section 
plaintiff filed a motion for an order compelling state to satisfy the remainder of the judgment.state filed opposition in which it argued,among other things,that the portion of the judgment awarding postjudgment interest in excess of percent was void and subject to collateral attack at any time.in its reply,plaintiff addressed the issues of whether the trial court had jurisdiction to amend the final judgment and whether state had waived its objection to the amount of postjudgment interest by failing to raise the objection in a timely manner.
at the hearing on the motion,state again contended that the part of the judgment awarding postjudgment interest in excess of percent was void.the motion was heard and granted on september.on september,an order was entered providing that state must satisfy the money judgment entered against it in this action by october.
state appeals from the september,order,contending that the trial court acted in excess of its jurisdiction by granting plaintiff motion because the judgment against state can be enforced only pursuant to the provisions of government code section,which plaintiff did not follow,and the portion of the judgment awarding postjudgment interest at a percent rate is void and subject to collateral attack at any time,even after appeal from the judgment.
plaintiff filed a motion to dismiss the appeal on the ground that the september,order is not appealable because the instant appeal involves issues that could and should have been raised in the prior appeal from the underlying judgment.state filed opposition to the motion to dismiss,arguing that the september,order is appealable as a postjudgment order under code of civil procedure section,subdivision a,and as a void order which gives effect to a portion of the judgment which is void.
discussion 
appealability 
we agree with state that the september,order is appealable because it is tantamount to a postjudgment order denying a motion to vacate a portion of a judgment that is claimed to be void.as a preliminary matter,although state opposition to plaintiff motion in the trial court was not styled as a request to vacate that portion of the judgment awarding postjudgment interest in excess of percent,the request was unequivocally made by state and addressed in plaintiff reply papers.state again made the request at the hearing.under the circumstances,all parties and the trial court were afforded adequate notice of the nature of state request and the issue before the court.
as explained in carlson eassa th,d a n order denying a motion to vacate a judgment is generally not appealable otherwise,an appellant would receive either two appeals from the same decision,or,if no timely appeal has been made,an unwarranted extension of time in which to bring the appeal.citation.in this case,the postjudgment order did not decide new issues,but merely affirmed the validity of the judgment.thus,it initially appears that appeal from the postjudgment order is precluded.h owever,an exception to this general rule applies when the underlying judgment is void.in such a case,the order denying the motion to vacate is itself void and appealable because it gives effect to a void judgment.id.at,d.
because of state claim that the portion of the judgment awarding postjudgment interest in excess of percent is void,the september,order is appealable,and plaintiff motion to dismiss the appeal is denied.
award of postjudgment interest in excess of percent is void 
plaintiff argues that the percent postjudgment interest rate is proper and,in any event,can not be collaterally attacked.we disagree.first,under article xv,section of the california constitution,the postjudgment interest rate to which plaintiff is entitled is percent.second,the award of percent postjudgment interest is void because it constitutes relief which the court had no power to grant and thus is subject to collateral attack.
without citing any authority,plaintiff maintains that the judgment percent postjudgment interest rate is correct because state was purportedly acting in a role in entering into the leases with plaintiff.in other words,plaintiff asserts that government code section,subdivision b see fn,ante is inapplicable and that state is subject to the provisions of code of civil procedure section.but this proposition was rejected in california fed.savings loan,supra,cal th at page,d,where the court stated that the plain language of these provisions government code sections,applicable to state,and,applicable to local government entities exempts the state as well as local public entities from the enforcement of title,including the interest provision of code of civil procedure section.
we therefore agree with state contention that the amount of postjudgment interest in this case is set by the constitution at percent per annum.notwithstanding the judgment erroneous percent postjudgment interest rate,the judgment is nevertheless final.
turning to the dispositive issue in this appeal,we conclude that the provision awarding interest in excess of percent is void and is the type of defect which can be collaterally attacked at any time.the doctrine of res judicata is inapplicable to void judgments.obviously a judgment,though final and on the merits,has no binding force and is subject to collateral attack if it is wholly void for lack of jurisdiction of the subject matter or person,and perhaps for excess of jurisdiction,or where it is obtained by extrinsic fraud.citations.witkin,cal.procedure,supra,judgment.rochin pat johnson manufacturing th,d.and the affirmance of a judgment on appeal does not insulate it from a subsequent collateral attack on the ground that it is void.hager hager d.the affirmance of a void judgment upon appeal imparts no validity to the judgment,but is in itself void by reason of the nullity of the judgment appealed from.
lack of jurisdiction in its most fundamental or strict sense means an entire absence of power to hear or determine the case,an absence of authority over the subject matter or the parties but in its ordinary usage the phrase lack of jurisdiction is not limited to these fundamental situations.abelleira district court of appeal cal d,abelleira.the concept of jurisdiction embraces a large number of ideas of similar character,some fundamental to the nature of any judicial system,some derived from the requirement of due process,some determined by the con
