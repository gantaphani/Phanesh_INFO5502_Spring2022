introduction 
code of civil procedure section,subdivision b requires the trial court in a civil action to grant relief from default when the defaulting party attorney files an affidavit attesting that the default was the product of his or her mistake,inadvertence,surprise,or neglect.the question now before us is whether an affidavit so attesting entitles the defaulting party to mandatory relief if it is executed by an attorney not licensed to practice in california,but licensed in another jurisdiction.we have concluded that granting relief in such circumstances is consistent with both the language and the remedial purpose of the statute.accordingly we will deny a petition seeking a writ of mandate to set aside an order granting relief on the basis of an affidavit of fault signed by a portuguese attorney.
factual and procedural background 
plaintiff maria rodrigues brought this action with respect to certain residential real property in san jose,which had been purchased as an investment by defendants fernando machado joaquim and maria machado,who are married.plaintiff claimed an undivided half interest in the property,and sought to partition it by sale under sections and.defendants were served with process in portugal,where they reside,under the provisions of the hague convention.when they failed to answer the complaint,plaintiff took their default and then obtained a default judgment.the judgment awarded an undivided half interest in the property to plaintiff,and the other half to defendants as joint tenants.the default judgment directed plaintiff to sell the property and to divide with defendants the balance due after payment of encumbrances,expenses,and attorney fees.
defendants filed a motion to set aside the defaults and default judgment pursuant to section,subdivision b,on the ground that their failure to properly answer the complaint was the fault of their attorney,abel marques.in support of the motion defendants filed a declaration of fault in which marques declared as follows he is an attorney licensed to practice law in portugal,with offices in lisbon.he has represented defendants in connection with various legal matters for many years.for that reason,when defendants were served with process in this matter they brought the summons and complaint to his office and asked him to take care of the matter,which he agreed to do.he prepared a portuguese legal response denying the allegations of the complaint,which he mailed to the superior court.he later obtained and mailed to the court a certified english translation of the response.with this response,he declared,i assumed the matter was taken care of and that i would receive further instructions from the court.i did not,however,receive anything and i,therefore,assumed that i did not have to do anything further.months later,he was contacted by the california attorney now representing defendants,who told him that a default judgment had been entered against his clients.in conclusion he declared,as the court can see from the foregoing,entry of default was the result of my mistake,inadvertence and neglect.i respectfully request that the court set aside the defaults and the default judgments 
relying on this declaration,defendants sought relief from default under that portion of section,subdivision b,which mandates relief where the application is accompanied by an attorney sworn affidavit attesting to his or her mistake,inadvertence,surprise,or neglect.they prayed in the alternative for discretionary relief under the portion of section,subdivision b,empowering the court to grant relief where the default results from the mistake,inadvertence,surprise,or excusable neglect of a party or his or her legal representative.they asserted that the defaults could have been avoided if plaintiff attorney had contacted the local manager of defendants real estate investments to warn that plaintiff intended to obtain entry of default.they asserted that the allowance of relief from the default would inflict no prejudice on plaintiff.
in opposition,plaintiff contended that the marques declaration could not trigger the statutory provision for mandatory relief,because marques is not licensed to practice law in california.plaintiff noted that foreign attorneys are generally prohibited from appearing in california courts.cal.rules of court,rule d.plaintiff further contended that granting relief on a foreign attorney affidavit would render unenforceable any conditions the court might impose on an order granting relief,as provided by section,subdivision b.since foreign attorneys are not subject to professional discipline in california,plaintiff contended,a foreign attorney could not be compelled to comply with an order to pay the opposing party attorney fees or costs,or to pay monetary sanctions to the state bar client security fund.see,subd.b.defendants replied by,among other things,citing the explicit inclusion of foreign attorneys in the definition of lawyer in the california rules of professional conduct 
the trial court agreed with defendants that the word attorney in section,subdivision b,should be broadly construed to include foreign lawyers in accordance with rule b of the california rules of professional conduct.the trial court also determined that public policy favored relief from default,because the policies about granting relief in this type of case are the same whether the attorney is a california attorney or a foreign attorney.those policy considerations are broader than those concerning attorney discipline.the court therefore ruled that the marques declaration was a valid and effective affidavit of fault,and granted the motion to set aside the default.the court also ordered attorney marques to pay a penalty of to the state bar client security fund,pursuant to section,subdivision c b 
discussion 
propriety of writ relief and the standard of review 
we recognize that an order vacating a default judgment and setting aside the default is appealable as an order after a final judgment,subd.a see county of stanislaus johnson th,d baske burke d.however,writ review of an appealable order is appropriate where it is necessary to resolve an issue of first impression promptly and to set guidelines for bench and bar.see people superior court howard th,d anderson superior court d.for these reasons,writ review is appropriate in the present case.
because defendants writ petition raises only a question of law as to the applicability of the mandatory relief provision of section,subdivision b,and does not require resolution of disputed facts,we review the trial court order de novo.see leader health industries of america,th,d.applying that standard,we first consider the statutory requirements for mandatory relief from default under section,subdivision b.
ii.mandatory relief from default under section,subdivision b 
in,subdivision b of section was amended to provide for relief from default upon the filing of an affidavit of fault by the defaulting party attorney relief is mandatory when a complying affidavit is filed,even if the attorney neglect was inexcusable.metropolitan service casa de palms,th,d.relief may be denied only when the court finds that the default was not in fact the attorney fault,for example when the attorney is simply for the client.citation.rogalski nabers cadillac th,d,fn.omitted.
iii.an affidavit of fault is sufficient if signed by an attorney licensed to practice in any jurisdiction 
the statute does not by its terms require california licensure on the part of the affiant in order to invoke the mandatory provisions of section,subdivision b.rodrigues contends,however,that such a requirement is implicit in the statutory scheme and legislative purpose.as a result,rodrigues contends,the affidavit here was insufficient to entitle defendants to relief.there is no dispute about the factual premise,that marques is not licensed to practice law in this state 
in considering whether the statute implicitly requires california licensure,we are guided by fundamental principles of statutory construction a court should ascertain the intent of the legislature so as to effectuate the purpose of the law.citations.to
