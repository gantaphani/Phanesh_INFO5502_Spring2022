we reluctantly return in this case to the question of default judgments with a cautionary tale well,three actually.the first is a tale for plaintiff attorneys,who may assume a defendant default is an unalloyed gift an opportunity to obtain a big judgment with no significant effort.it is not.instead,when a defendant fails to timely respond to the complaint,the first thing plaintiff counsel should do after offering an extension of time to respond is review the complaint with care,to ascertain whether it supports the specific judgment the client seeks.if not,a motion to amend is in order.in this case,counsel for plaintiff gil kim failed to do that.instead,he simply asked the court to enter defendants defaults on the complaint as initially alleged.unfortunately for kim,the factual allegations of that complaint do not support any judgment in his favor.
and even when the allegations of a complaint do support the judgment plaintiff seeks,he is not automatically entitled to entry of that judgment by the court,simply because defendant defaulted.instead,it is incumbent upon plaintiff to his damages,with actual evidence.it is wholly insufficient to simply declare,as kim did here,that defendants breach of one or more promissory notes caused him tremendous financial loss,and that a judgment of million against each defendant,for a total of million would be a reasonable sum.that evidence may establish the amount kim feels entitled to recover,but it fails utterly to demonstrate what he is legally entitled to recover.kim failure to offer any significant evidence to support his damage claims precludes any monetary judgment in his favor.
we consequently reverse the default judgment entered in kim favor,and remand the case to the trial court with directions to enter judgment in defendants favor.
the second cautionary tale is for trial courts.and it not the first time we have told this tale.as we previously explained in heidary yadollahi th,d,i t is imperative in a default case that the trial court take the time to analyze the complaint at issue and ensure that the judgment sought is not in excess of or inconsistent with it.it is not in plaintiffs interest to be conservative in their demands,and without any opposing party to point out the excesses,it is the duty of the court to act as gatekeeper,ensuring that only the appropriate claims get through.that role requires the court to analyze the complaint for itself with guidance from counsel if necessary ascertaining what relief is sought as against each defaulting party,and to what extent the relief sought in one cause of action is inconsistent with or duplicative of the relief sought in another.the court must then compare the properly pled damages for each defaulting party with the evidence offered in the.unfortunately,the trial court in this case seems not to have done that,and instead simply gave kim what he asked for which in this case was million.even more unfortunately,this trial court is certainly not alone in doing so,even since heidary was published.see,electronic funds solutions,llc murphy th,d million in compensatory damages awarded on a complaint alleging in damages.we need to shore this up.the court role in the process of entering a default judgment is a serious,substantive,and often complicated one,and it must be treated as such.
and third,this case is a cautionary tale for appellate counsel.those who practice before this court are expected to comport themselves honestly,ethically,professionally and with courtesy toward opposing counsel.the fact a respondent has no obligation to file a brief at all,in no way excuses his counsel misconduct if he chooses to do so.the conduct of timothy donahue,kim counsel herein,which included seeking an extension of time to file his brief under false pretenses,and then filing a brief which was not just boilerplate,but a virtual copy of a brief for another case including a boilerplate accusation of misconduct against appellants counsel and a boilerplate request for sanctions based on a purportedly frivolous appeal will not be countenanced.donahue response to this court notice,informing him that we were contemplating the imposition of sanctions on our own motion,was both truculent and dismissive,going so far as to assert that we must have issued the notice in error.we did not.nor did we appreciate him responding to our order that he appear to address possible sanctions against him by sending in his stead an attorney who had not been informed sanctions were being considered,and knew nothing about our order.donahue conduct on appeal was inappropriate in nearly every respect,and we hereby sanction him in the amount of.
gil kim unverified complaint,filed march,alleges defendants matt jennings and rob jennings are sophisticated businessmen,licensed investment brokers experienced in selling investments to the general public.it further alleges that o ver the last several years,the jennings opened up and formed several companies and businesses,including westmoore partners,honolulu harry,westmoore capital,and temecula harry pacific grill,each of which is also named as a defendant.
according to the complaint,the two jenningses would mix,mingle and shuffle money between the different companies,close one and open another one.this was designed to hide assets and evade potential creditors.
all six defendants were allegedly jointly involved in,owned and operated a global marketing business,and sought investment money from plaintiff.although kim initially thought defendants were honest,reputable and forthright,he learned only within the last year,after defendants had taken his money,that this was untrue.
allegedly,defendants initially borrowed only a little bit of money from kim,and promised a substantial return.and in fact,kim acknowledges that i n the beginning,defendants paid a substantial return,although he asserts they did so as bait,to entice him to loan more money.this alleged enticement was apparently effective,as kim asserts he did loan defendants more money,again relying upon their promise to repay the loans with a substantial return.
defendants then allegedly enticed kim to once again lend them even more money,by informing him that they really did need his money.then,in august of,matt and rob jennings,acting on behalf of the other defendants,allegedly promised to make monthly payments,in the amount of,on an office building owned by kim,in exchange for kim investment of.however,according to kim,defendants had no intention of repaying the loan.
kim attaches to his complaint,and incorporates by reference,seven promissory notes which reflect defendants alleged indebtedness to him.he asserts that within the last year,defendants have each acknowledged responsibility to pay on the seven notes,and have promised to pay him.however,defendants have never followed through on the promises and the money remains outstanding.
the first promissory note reflects that on february,westmoore partners,promised to pay kim,on the maturity date of march,only days later.interest payments of per month were due on the of each month,starting on february.it provides that a default occurs if westmoore partners fails to pay the principal and interest on the maturity date.
the second promissory note reflects that on may,westmoore partners,promised to pay kim,on the maturity date of december,only seven months later.interest payments of were due on the of each month,starting february.it provides that a default occurs if westmoore partners fails to pay the principal and interest on the maturity date.
the third promissory note reflects that on june,honolulu harry,promised to pay kim,on the maturity date of august,two months later.interest payments of per month were due on the of each month,starting on july.it provides that a default occurs if honolulu harry,fails to pay the principal and interest on the maturity date.
the fourth promissory note reflects that on august,matt jennings promised to pay kim,on or before october,two months later.the note further specifies that the funds are immediately due and payable upon sale of a specified piece of real property owned by matt jennings.this note does not specify an interest rate,but includes closing costs of percent as part of the principal amount due,and provides for interest of percent per annum in the event of default in the payment of principal when due.
the fifth promissory note reflects that on july,westmoore capital,promised to pay kim,on the maturity date of july,one year later.interest payments of were due on the of each month,starting on july,it provides that a default occurs if westmoore capital fails to pay the principal and interest on the maturity date.
the sixth promissory note reflects that on july,westmoore capital,also promised to pay kim,on the maturity date of july,again,one year later.interest payments of were due on the of each month,starting on july.it provides that a default occurs if westmoore capital fails to pay the principal and interest on the maturity date.
nowhere does kim allege that the maturity dates of any of these first six promissory notes were ever extended,either orally or in writing.by their terms,each required full payment of the indebtedness on dates between march of and july of,inclusive meaning the latest note was to be fully performed nearly three years prior to the filing of kim complaint.
the seventh promissory note reflects that on august,temecula harry pacific grill,llc,promised to pay kim on the maturity date,which is defined as being at such time as harry pacific grill restaurant located in temecula,ca and owned and operated by temecula harry pacific grill is sold or substantially all of its assets are transferred,except for any transfer or sale to westmoore capital group,llc or any other westmoore affiliated entity.pending the maturity date,temecula harry is obligated to pay interest at a rate of percent per annum on the of each month,but remarkably only so long as it has the cash available to do so.also of note,any interest which is not paid when due shall accrue and will be payable at such time as the company has sufficient funds to pay any interest which is in arrears.
as additional consideration for this seventh promissory note,kim was also entitled to a prorated portion of of the annual net income from the operation of the temecula restaurant in excess of,until such time as either kim converted some or all of his loan into membership interests in temecula harry pacific grill,or the loan principal was repaid.finally,this seventh promissory note includes a provision specifying that it reflects the entire agreement between the parties with respect to the subject matter,supersedes all prior agreements and understandings,and can not be amended except by signed written agreement.
while it is somewhat inconsistent with the conclusory allegation that defendants had no intention of repaying him,kim also alleges that until approximately one year prior to the filing of the complaint,until march of,defendants did comply with their loan obligations.however,they allegedly stopped doing so within the last year.with respect to defendants alleged obligation to make monthly payments of,on an office building he owned,kim specifically asserts that as of january,defendants were behind,by more than,a number which equates to six months of arrearages.finally,kim alleges that although he requested defendants disclose where the investments were placed,they refused to specify,and refused to account for the money.
kim first cause of action is for breach of contract.in support of this claim,he incorporates all of his factual allegations,and further alleges that defendants by their actions,payments,statements and signatures,became obligated to perform under the promissory notes attached as exhibit,and that a fter making some payments,and agreeing to make further payments,defendants breached the contract and said breach occurred within the last one year.as a result of the breach,he suffered loss and harm.
kim second cause of action is for negligent misrepresentation,and in support of that cause of action,he incorporates all prior allegations,and further alleges d efendants had a special relationship with him and they undertook a duty to exercise due and reasonable care in advising and speaking to him.defendants allegedly breached that duty by unreasonably and improperly fail ing to warn him and improperly advis ing him.kim alleges that he was harmed by these breaches and reserves the right to perform discovery,and prove the extent and amount of damages caused by defendants.
kim third cause of action is for professional negligence,and in support of that cause of action,he incorporates all prior allegations,and further alleges that at all relevant times,defendants were acting as investment brokers,and made numerous representations to him that he relied upon.he also alleges defendants concealed material facts and material information from him,despite having the ability to disclose true information.he asserts defendants acted unreasonably in failing to disclose true information.he alleges that he was misled and relied upon the lack of full disclosure,and suffered consequent loss and harm.he again reserves the right to perform discovery,and present evidence of the full extent of loss and harm.
kim fourth cause of action is for conversion,and states,without explanation,that it is alleged in the alternative.in support of that claim,kim incorporates all prior allegations,and alleges additionally that i nstead of using kim money as agreed for business purposes,defendants took the money,squandered the money,enjoyed the money and used the money for their own personal pleasure.kim asserts defendants formed the intent to misuse the money and to spend it,and they knew that their use of his money was improper,unauthorized and unlawful.he alleges that defendants conduct was willful,wanton,malicious,oppressive and fraudulent,and claims an entitlement to punitive damages.conversion is the only cause of action for which kim seeks punitive damages.
kim final cause of action is for unfair business practices.in addition to incorporating all prior allegations,it is supported with additional allegations that defendants are licensed investment brokers and he is a consumer and member of the general public.defendants are alleged to have violated business and professions code section,and to have taken his money and wasted it,spent it and enjoyed it,for their own personal benefit.he alleges defendants took advantage of him,tricked him and fooled him.
kim complaint specifies no amount of damages or harm caused to him by defendants alleged actions,other than the failure to pay per month,starting sometime in,which amounted to an alleged debt of more than by january of.however,when kim served defendants with the complaint,on may,he also served each with formal statement s of damages,which recites that it is for personal injury or wrongful death,and which claims that kim had suffered special damages consisting of property damage of,unpaid fees of million,and loan payments of million.only the loan payments claim is consistent with the facts pleaded by kim in his complaint the complaint includes no allegation of either property damage or unpaid fees of any kind.the statements also reflected that kim reserved the right to seek punitive damages of million against each defendant 
defendants did not timely respond to kim complaint.kim requested and obtained entry of their defaults on august.
on november,defendants westmoore partners,westmoore capital,and matt jennings moved to set aside the defaults entered against them in support of their motions,these defendants asserted that at the time kim commenced his lawsuit,matt jennings who was also the president of both westmoore entities,was undergoing incredible financial and emotional hardships due to the current economic downturn and was in near financial ruin and on the verge of filing for bankruptcy.the extreme personal stress this imposed on jennings caused him to be dilatory in engaging in kim lawsuit,and made dealing with it an overwhelming impossibility,especially because at the time that kim filed his complaint,jennings did not have the resources to hire legal counsel.however,these defendants asserted that i n recent months,jennings health and financial outlook had drastically improved,such that he had been able to hire legal counsel,and wished to defend the lawsuit.
kim opposed the motion to vacate,and the court denied it.in its ruling,the court explained that the motion failed to cite a statutory basis for the relief,but it appeared relief could be available only on the basis of excusable neglect.the court felt matt jennings declaration did not sufficiently establish that he was ill,or even under a doctor care at any point,such that he could not have avoided default through the exercise of ordinary care.
kim thereafter filed two separate requests for entry of a default judgment,each of which was rejected by the clerk due to inconsistent or incomplete paperwork.however,kim third attempt to secure a default judgment from the court was successful.
in support of that third attempt,kim provided the court with the six statements of damages he served on defendants along with the complaint.although each of those statements of damages set forth claims totaling million,including punitive damages,kim requested a judgment of only million against each defendant,for a total of million.kim made no effort to correlate that amount to any particular claim or promissory note,or even to explain the extent to which it represented compensatory and punitive damages.instead,kim declaration simply stated that c onsistent with the statement of damages,each defendant owes me at least million.he goes on to explain that a judgment of million against each defendant,for a total of million,would not be an excessive sum.it would be a reasonable sum,if they ever paid it.it would compensate me for some of the devastation caused by these defendants.and that is all it says.otherwise,kim merely states that his attorney donahue submits a declaration with exhibit,dated october,and that he concur s with that declaration and its contents are incorporate d herein by reference as those sic set forth at length.
donahue declaration,in turn,explains nothing about the damages incurred by kim.instead,it merely references the attached exhibit,which donahue describes as documentation regarding the damages and information he to defendants counsel on september,those documents consist of several pages of accounts,some of which consist solely of numbers,and others of which list dates and monetary sums,with references to maplewood,gil kim judy kim,lv waterford castle,and brigadoon rent.none of those references seems to correlate to any of the promissory notes appended to the complaint,and none of them is explained in any declaration.we have no evidence demonstrating who prepared the accounts,or when.in short,these documents are entirely unintelligible,and useless as evidence.
kim filed this third package with the court on june.on july,the matter was assigned to a new judge.on july,that judge signed the judgment proposed by kim,without any changes.the document states that j udgment is hereby ordered in favor of plaintiff gil kim,and against each individual defendant listed below,in the single sum of,plus costs of suit in the amount of,for the total sum of.it then lists the names of all six defendants 
appellants matt jennings,westmoore partners,and westmoore capital,collectively the westmoore defendants,first challenge the court denial of their motion to set aside the defaults entered against them.they rely upon the public policy favoring disposition of cases on their merits,and argue the court abused its discretion in denying them relief in this case.the westmoore defendants argue because they moved for relief from the default promptly,and offered sufficient evidence of a reasonable excuse to justify that relief,the court was obligated to grant it.
we are not persuaded.first,as to the issue of promptness,the westmoore defendants argue their motion was filed within three weeks of learning about the default,as they did not receive notice of entry of default from plaintiff and it was until plaintiff filed his request for entry of judgment on october,that they were made aware that default had been entered.but that claim,whether accurate or not,is not supported by the record.the declaration of matt jennings,which was the sole evidentiary support for the motion to set aside the defaults,contains no assertion that he did not receive notice of the entry of default.the trial court was consequently free to presume the westmoore defendants actually received the notice of entry of default in august of,and waited over three months rather than three weeks,to do anything about it.while such a delay does not preclude relief,neither does it demonstrate particular promptness.
more significantly,jennings declaration,notable primarily for its brevity,amounts to nothing more than a conclusory assertion his anxiety,depression,and financial hardships caused the westmoore defendants to be dilatory in answering the lawsuit.he offers no evidentiary facts about either his emotional or financial state,which the court might have been able to assess in determining whether his failure to respond was actually excusable in the circumstances.as such,the declaration was insufficient to support relief.united parcel service wage hour cases th,d a declaration consisting of only a recitation of legal conclusions and ultimate facts,without any evidentiary facts,was insufficient to establish a triable issue of fact to defeat summary judgment hayman block d.declarations containing general and vague charges do not qualify as competent or credible evidence.
the trial court focused on this very issue in its order denying relief,noting that t he declaration does not sufficiently establish that matt jennings was ill,or even under a doctor care at any point,such that he could not have avoided default through the exercise of ordinary care.on the record before us,we can not say the trial court erred in that conclusion.
next,all six appellants argue that even if the entry of their defaults was valid,the default judgment must nonetheless be reversed.on this point,they fare substantially better.
we begin with the basic guidelines for analyzing the legal effect of a default.substantively,t he judgment by default is said to confess the material facts alleged by the plaintiff,the defendant failure to answer has the same effect as an express admission of the matters well pleaded in the complaint.steven garber associates eskandarian th,d,second italics added.the allegations of a complaint refer to all material facts properly pleaded,but not contentions,deductions or conclusions of fact or law.evans city of berkeley cal th,d,quoting serrano priest cal d.
because the default confesses those properly pleaded facts,plaintiff has no responsibility to provide the court with sufficient evidence to prove them they are treated as true for purposes of obtaining a default judgment.ostling loring th,d.but that is all the default does.there is no penalty for defaulting.a defendant has the right to elect not to answer the complaint.greenup rodman cal d.although this may have been a tactical move by defendant,it is a permissible tactic.stein th,d.
and if the allegations of the complaint do not state any proper cause of action,the default judgment in plaintiff favor can not stand.on appeal from the default judgment,a n objection that the complaint failed to state facts sufficient to constitute a cause of action may be considered.martin lawrence cal,bristol convalescent hosp.stone d.moreover,w hen considering the legal effect of those facts,we disregard any erroneous or confusing labels employed by the plaintiff.mead sanwa bank california th,d,citing saunders cariss d.
in this case,a review of kim complaint reveals it does not set forth any valid cause of action.although kim purports to state several different causes of action,the gravamen of his complaint is breach of contract.he alleges defendants,acting in concert,entered into various agreements with him to borrow increasing sums of money over a period of time,promising him substantial returns,but then breached their repayment obligations within the year prior to the filing of his complaint.
in support of that claim,kim incorporates by reference seven written promissory notes which reflect defendants alleged indebtedness to him.and that where the trouble begins.when plaintiff attaches a written agreement to his complaint,and incorporates it by reference into his cause of action,the terms of that written agreement take precedence over any contradictory allegations in the body of the complaint.if facts appearing in the exhibits contradict those alleged,the facts in the exhibits take precedence.holland morse diesel,th,d,citing mead sanwa bank california,supra,th,d.
here,the first six of the seven promissory notes kim incorporated into his complaint specify that defendants were obligated to repay the subject debt,in full,on dates between three and six years prior to the date he filed his complaint,and nowhere does kim allege that the maturity dates for any of those obligations were ever extended.consequently,those first six promissory notes could not,by their terms,have been breached within a year prior to kim filing of the complaint.they were breached if at all years earlier.the complaint therefore states no cause of action for breach of those first six promissory notes.
the seventh promissory note,in the amount of million,fares no better as a basis for kim breach of contract claim.although that agreement could have been breached within the year prior to kim filing of his complaint,he alleges no facts demonstrating that it actually was.by its terms,the seventh promissory note requires payment of the principal amount only when harry pacific grill restaurant located in temecula,ca and owned and operated by temecula harry pacific grill is sold or substantially all of its assets are transferred kim does not allege that ever happened.
pending that maturity date,the seventh promissory note required payment of interest at rate of percent per annum on the of each month,but only so long as defendant temecula harry pacific grill had the cash available to do so.and any interest which is not paid when due would accrue and will be payable at such time as temecula harry pacific grill has sufficient funds to pay any interest which is in arrears.kim did not allege that temecula harry ever had the cash available to make those interest payments or sufficient funds to pay interest arrearages.consequently,he had not alleged any facts demonstrating a breach of this promissory note.
what kim does allege is that,in exchange for his loan of million,defendants promised to make his loan payments on a commercial property.he claims they breached the agreement when they stopped making those loan payments.that allegation,being entirely inconsistent with the terms of the seventh promissory note,must be disregarded as a basis for establishing its breach,especially given that the promissory note includes a provision specifying that it reflects the entire agreement between the parties with respect to the subject matter,that it supersedes all prior agreements and understandings,and that it can not be amended except by signed written agreement.
in short,kim has alleged no facts establishing any defendant breached the terms of any of the promissory notes he attaches to his complaint,and his complaint thus fails to state a cause of action for breach of contract.
kim next cause of action is for negligent misrepresentation,stated in terms which are entirely conclusory.kim alleges that defendants advised him on what to do and how to proceed,and recommend ed investments and loan strategies to him.they allegedly breached their duty of due care in addressing,advising and speaking to him by failing to properly advise him.if we ignore the contentions,deductions or conclusions of fact or law citation contained in this purported cause of action evans city of berkeley,supra,cal th at,d,there is simply nothing left.specifically,kim fails to allege what factual representations were made to him,or any facts suggesting that a reasonable person in defendants position should have known those representations were untrue at the time they made them.consequently,no cause of action is stated.
kim third cause of action,for professional negligence fails because its key allegation that a t all times herein,defendants were acting as investment brokers is squarely contradicted by the terms of the promissory notes he incorporated into the complaint.those promissory notes make clear that defendants were not brokering any investments.see ufitec,s.carter cal d,italics added noting the definition of a securities broker is a person engaged in the business of effecting transactions in securities for the account of others.bus,italics added defining a real estate broker as one who does or negotiates to do one or more acts for another or others.instead,the promissory notes unambiguously establish that the relationship between kim and defendants was simply one of.
kim fourth cause of action,for conversion,fails because the simple failure to pay money owed does not constitute conversion.a cause of action for conversion of money can be stated only where defendant interferes with plaintiff possessory interest in a specific,identifiable sum,such as when a trustee or agent misappropriates the money entrusted to him.money can not be the subject of a cause of action for conversion unless there is a specific,identifiable sum involved,such as where an agent accepts a sum of money to be paid to another and fails to make the payment.citation.mckell washington mutual,th,d see haigler donnelly cal d,fischer machado th,d sales agent liable for conversion of proceeds from consignment sale of farm products software design application,hoefer arnett,th,d money can not be the subject of a conversion action unless a specific sum capable of identification is involved.a generalized claim for money is not actionable as conversion.vu california commerce club,th,d witkin,summary of cal.law ed.torts.california cases permitting an action for conversion of money typically involve those who have misappropriated,commingled,or misapplied specific funds held for the benefit of others.see,haigler donnelly,supra,cal d at,real estate broker fischer machado,supra,th at,d sales agent for consigned farm products weiss marcus d.attorney claim for fees from proceeds of settlement subject to lien watson stockton morris plan d,savings and loan issued duplicate passbook and delivered funds to third party.pco,christensen,miller,fink,jacobs,glaser,weil shapiro,llp th,d see also,software design application,hoefer arnett,supra,th at,d no claim for conversion is stated where money was allegedly misappropriated over time,in various sums,without any indication that it was held in trust for plaintiff mckell washington mutual,supra,th at,d bank practice of overcharging customers for fees,and retaining the difference,did not constitute a conversion of customers funds,since the bank had not violated any duty to distribute the disputed funds to the third parties.
in this case,kim did not allege he entrusted funds to defendants for a specific purpose,and the promissory notes he incorporated into the complaint demonstrate beyond dispute that this case actually involves a simple relationship,in which defendants are alleged to have violated their obligations to repay the subject debts.those facts do not constitute a claim defendants interfered with kim possession of a specific,identifiable sum of money.thus,no cause of action for conversion was stated.
finally,kim has also failed to state a valid cause of action for unfair business practices.what he asserts as the basis of this purported claim is that d efendants are licensed investment brokers and have violated business and professions code section.however,business and professions code section does not actually prohibit any conduct.it is merely definitional no cause of action can be stated for violating a statutory definition.an action for unfair competition must refer to one of the sections following business and professions code section.
kim alleges that defendants have engaged in wrongful,improper,illegal and unreasonable business practices,have taken plaintiff money and wasted it,spent it and enjoyed it,for their own personal benefit,and have taken advantage of him,tricked him,and fooled him.these allegations are entirely vague,conclusory,and do not amount to any cognizable claim.moreover,kim alleged no facts which would support his implied assertion defendants were prohibited from doing whatever they wanted with the money he loaned them.their only obligation,as set forth in the promissory notes,was to pay the money back in accordance with the terms of those notes.their alleged failure to do that does not qualify as an unfair business practice.
because kim complaint does not state any cognizable cause of action against defendants,it does not support any judgment in his favor.
but kim problems do end there,because his complaint also fails to set forth any clear demand for damages,let alone one which would support the enormous judgment he obtained from the trial court.as this court has iterated and then reiterated,code of civil procedure section prohibits the entry of a default judgment in an amount in excess of that demanded in the complaint.stein york th,d electronic funds solutions,llc murphy th,d sole energy hodges th,fn,d.
moreover,we have also made it clear that a statement of damages can not be relied upon to establish plaintiff monetary damages,except in cases of personal injury or wrongful death.statement s of damages are used only in personal injury and wrongful death citation.in all other cases,when recovering damages in a default judgment,the plaintiff is limited to the damages specified in the complaint.citations.sole energy hodges,supra,th at,fn,d electronic funds solutions,llc murphy th,d see also levine smith th,d.
here,the only damage numbers included in kim complaint are found in his allegation defendants defaulted on their obligations to make monthly payments on his commercial property,in consideration of his agreement to loan them million.kim alleges defendant failure to do that caused him damages of more than.however,as we have already explained,kim complaint states no valid claim for breach of that purported obligation,since it is inconsistent with the terms of the promissory note he incorporated into the complaint,which governs that particular loan.consequently,kim complaint supports no award of damages at all.
as explained in ostling loring,supra,th at,d,ordinarily when a judgment is vacated on the ground the damages awarded exceeded those pled,the appropriate action is to modify the judgment to the maximum amount warranted by the complaint.see also finney gomez th,d.in this case,that maximum is zero.
and finally,even if kim complaint were sufficient to support a judgment in his favor,he would still be facing reversal of that judgment on appeal,because he failed to provide the court with sufficient evidence to his entitlement to any damages.
code of civil procedure section sets forth the two options for obtaining a default judgment.first,where the plaintiff complaint seeks compensatory damages only,in a sum certain which is readily ascertainable from the allegations of the complaint or statement of damages,the clerk may enter the default judgment for that amount.code civ,subd.a.a clerk judgment is appropriate only in cases where the determination of damages is a purely ministerial act,where there is some definite,fixed amount of damages or where such may be ascertained by computation made by the clerk.if evidence must be taken to establish the amount due,the clerk may not render judgment.ford superior court d.
however,if the relief requested in the complaint is more complicated than that,consisting of either nonmonetary relief,or monetary relief in amounts which require either an accounting,additional evidence,or the exercise of judgment to ascertain such as emotional distress damages,pain and suffering,or punitive damages,the plaintiff must request entry of judgment by the court.code civ,subd.b.in such cases,the plaintiff must affirmatively establish his entitlement to the specific judgment requested.the court shall hear the evidence offered by the plaintiff,and shall render judgment in the plaintiff favor for that relief,not exceeding the amount stated in the complaint,in the statement required by section,or in the statement provided for by section,as appears by the evidence to be just.if the taking of an account,or the proof of any fact,is necessary to enable the court to give judgment or to carry the judgment into effect,the court may take the account or hear the proof,or may,in its discretion,order a reference for that purpose.if the action is for the recovery of damages,in whole or in part,the court may order the damages to be assessed by a jury or if,to determine the amount of damages,the examination of a long account is involved,by a reference as above provided,italics added.
and while code of civil procedure section does give the court discretion to permit the use of affidavits,in lieu of personal testimony,as to all or any part of the evidence or proof required or permitted to be offered,received,or heard in those cases,it specifically requires that t he facts stated in the affidavit or affidavits shall be within the personal knowledge of the affiant and shall be set forth with particularity,and each affidavit shall show affirmatively that the affiant,if sworn as a witness,can testify competently thereto.code civ,subd.d,italics added.
in this case,that did not happen.instead,as we have already explained,kim evidence consisted of nothing more than his own conclusory demand for million dollars from each defendant a demand that bore absolutely no relationship to the allegations of his complaint.additionally,kim counsel offered the court a sheaf of documents which he claimed to have transmitted to opposing counsel at some earlier point.those documents were not only unintelligible,but also unsupported by any foundation suggesting how,when,or by whom they were created.they were consequently useless as evidence.
on appeal,defendant may challenge the sufficiency of the evidence offered to support the default judgment.plaintiffs in a default judgment proceeding must prove they are entitled to the damages claimed.barragan banco bch d,citing code civ,taliaferro hoogs d.
although some cases have recited a general rule that sufficiency of the evidence tendered in a default proceeding can not be reviewed on an appeal from a default judgment see,uva evans d,that rule applies only as to matters for which no proof is required by virtue of the admission by default of the allegations of the complaint.ostling loring,supra,th at,d.however,as to damages which,despite default,require proof the general rule does not apply.ibid.
indeed,the uva court itself departs from the general rule in concluding that defendants can challenge the sufficiency of the evidence to support the damage award in that case.as explained by the court,such a challenge is proper because the right to appellate review flows logically from the fact that damages must be proved in the trial court before the default judgment may be entered.code civ,subd.the requirement of proof of damages is meaningless if it can be fulfilled by any evidence,even evidence which results in a judgment prompted by passion,prejudice or corruption.yet without appellate review,such a judgment would stand while the role of the appellate court in reviewing damages is much more limited than that of the trial court reviewing a jury verdict,the policies which sanction such review are not dissimilar just as the trial court need not sit idly by and watch injustice be done through an improper award by the jury,we know of no statutory or constitutional barrier which requires an appellate court to ignore gross injustice in the award of damages simply because the judgment was procured by way of default.uva evans,supra,d at.see also scognamillo herrick th,d the issue of speculative damages is subject to review where,as here,the damages awarded are unsupported by sufficient evidence.finney gomez,supra,th at,d.
