this product liability case arises from the death of walter white,the son of plaintiffs ginny and jimmie white,who was killed when white parked ford pickup truck rolled over him in the family driveway.the case is before us for the second time following a remand for a new trial on punitive damages.see white ford motor,cir white i affirming the first jury award of in compensatory damages but reversing as to punitive damages.defendant ford motor company appeals the district court decision that a second jury award of million in punitive damages on remand did not violate the due process clause of the fourteenth amendment.in addition,ford argues that during the retrial,the district court committed multiple reversible errors in its pretrial and other jury instructions and evidentiary rulings.in light of the supreme court intervening decision in philip morris usa williams,d,we reverse and remand for a new trial on punitive damages.
background 
a.the defective product 
in,ford began to produce model year pickup trucks using a parking brake designed and manufactured in the by the orscheln company.although conventional brakes employ a cable that becomes loose over time and therefore must be adjusted periodically to maintain tension,orscheln brake kept the cable tight,even as the vehicle aged.the brake used a ratchet wheel and a pawl,which is a hinged or pivoted finger that sticks into a tooth of the ratchet wheel.white i,at.a driver would engage the brake by depressing the pedal,setting the mechanism in gear until the pawl tooth fit in between two of the ratchet teeth.
by,ford had preproduction reports of potential problems with the orscheln brake,and by the time the trucks were in production,the reports had increased.for example,some customers reported that sometimes the parking brake did not engage and instead pressed freely down to the floor,while other customers reported that their trucks rolled despite the parking brake being engaged.id.at.
ford told orscheln to identify and fix the problem,and in the fall of,the company assigned timothy rakowicz,a young ford engineer,to assist in the investigation.by november,ford and orscheln discovered that sometimes the pawl tooth would skip over the tops of the ratchet wheel teeth instead of engaging in one of the gaps.ford called this the or skip out problem.id.in february,orscheln testing showed that if the pawl tooth engaged a ratchet tooth at its tip,rather than firmly engaging between the two teeth,the driver would feel resistance when pressing the brake pedal even though the pawl tooth was in fact resting on a ratchet tooth tip.testing also showed that an outside force on the vehicle could disturb the equilibrium and cause the brake to disengage,allowing the vehicle to roll.ford referred to the condition as spontaneous disengagement,id.at,or,and the corresponding effect on the vehicle as rollaway,id.at.
rakowicz included orscheln test results in a february,draft paper to ford critical product problem review group cpprg,a committee whose job was to assist with ford investigation of potential safety problems.in the paper,titled parking brake control self releasing field campaign and owner notification paper,rakowicz wrote that the parking brake control will intermittently self release after pedal apply causing a decrease in pressure to the rear brakes.rakowicz defined the root cause of the concern as a load carrying,ratchet tooth tip on tip condition,and referring to tests three days earlier,wrote that t he condition has been duplicated during parking brake hill hold testing on february,at the supplier facility using a part removed from a problem vehicle.rakowicz wrote that a customer with a brake assembly affected with this condition would experience the following affects sic 
the parking brake pedal apply would feel normal.
the customer will leave the vehicle and in an arbitrary amount of time,the parking brake control will self release.a popping noise will be heard if the customer is within hearing distance.the parking brake pedal will remain in approximately the same position it was applied to.
c.if the vehicle is on an incline,the vehicle will potentially roll down the incline emphasis added.
rakowicz believed that the condition warranted a recall.at retrial,he testified that he was personally aware of reported rollaways when he wrote his report however,more senior engineers at ford disagreed with rakowicz draft and required him to tone it down,concluding instead that the orscheln test was not valid.id.thus,the cpprg did not then or ever refer the matter to ford field campaign review committee fcrc,which made recall decisions.at the same time,ford management worried about a recall and its potential cost.at a february,meeting of ford and orscheln personnel,a senior ford engineer lamented that this problem may cause serious financial ramifications for both companies with warrant recall.a march,memo similarly referred to a full recall as the worst case scenario.the ultimate cost to recall manual transmission vehicles was approximately million.
in march,orscheln proposed a solution for the skip out problem.the fix was a small plastic wedge,costing cents to manufacture,which could be installed over the pawl to make sure it pressed down between the teeth instead of skipping over them.however,the wedge also disabled the feature of the brake and increased ford cost.id.at.
meanwhile,the evidence of problems with the parking brake increased,and in the same month march,the national highway traffic safety administration nhtsa became involved in the investigation,having received reports of rollaways.in may,ford disclosed to nhtsa reports of either or rollaway.the agency requested additional information in september,including complaints,testing documents and accident reports,which ford provided in february in addition,the agency collected and inspected parking brake assemblies from complainants,bench tested five of these assemblies and tested three of them on a complaint vehicle.although nhtsa was unable to detect a spontaneous disengagement malfunction in these specific assemblies,it did find that some of them experienced skip out 
by august or september,the plastic wedge was approved for use,and enough were manufactured for ford to install them in all of the trucks on the road id.at.but rather than recall the vehicles,ford issued a technical service bulletin to dealers on november,making the wedge available for any vehicle owner who complained about a problem with skip out.id.at.the bulletin did not mention spontaneous disengagement or rollaway.
in,nhtsa began to pressure ford to conduct a recall and install the wedge as a precautionary measure.on august,and in response to nhtsa urging,ford informed the agency that it had decided to recall manual transmission included through pickup trucks rather than engag e in a protracted dispute with the agency.in its letter to the agency,ford stated that a lthough all of the vehicles are potentially susceptible to the condition arising,less than one percent or vehicles are expected to exhibit it,and those which do are expected to do so on an intermittent basis.in describing the problem,ford noted that it may occur occasionally when the parking brake control pawl lines up in a relationship with the ratchet,explaining that i f this occurs,the pawl may skip over one or more teeth in the ratchet during parking brake application.ford further informed the agency of reports of unattended vehicle s roll ing and result ing in property damage,one of which alleged that an injury had occurred.however,the whites proved at retrial that ford knew of at least eight injuries and that it had received reports of over rollaways at the time it submitted its letter to nhtsa.
in november,ford provided nhtsa with its proposed recall notice,which stated during rapid pedal application of the parking brake,the pedal may go to the floor with little or no effort.should this occur,the parking brake system may not achieve full tension,potentially resulting in parking brake ineffectiveness,or diminished effectiveness.nhtsa acknowledged receipt of the recall notice and described the defect as the parking brake control pawl does not line up properly with the ratchet allowing the pawl to skip over one or more teeth in the ratchet.the parking brake will not hold the vehicle allowing the vehicle to roll freely.the agency,however,did not ask ford to make any changes to its notice.on december,ford issued its recall notice to vehicle owners 
b.the accident,first trial and first appeal 
on october,two months before ford issued its recall,jimmie white parked his company ford pickup truck facing downhill in his sloped driveway.white put the truck into first gear,set the parking brake by stepping on the brake pedal and went inside the home.the whites son,walter,was playing unsupervised in the front yard,with white occasionally checking on him through the window.walter climbed into the vehicle cab,and according to the whites,knocked the gearshift into neutral.when the parking brake did not hold,the truck started to roll and walter fell or climbed out of it.tragically,the truck rear dual wheels rolled over and crushed the boy body.id.at.
the truck that killed walter was built in april and sold to jimmie white employer on september.by the time of the sale of that vehicle,it was clear to ford that there was a potential rollaway problem.id.at.although ford agreed to conduct a recall before the date of the accident,ford did not begin issuing the recall notice to owners until december,two months after walter death.moreover,white employer did not receive a recall notice until march,months after rakowicz had recommended a recall and seven months after ford told nhtsa it would do so.thus,as we stated in white i,the accident happened after the brake problem was discovered and figured out,after the technical bulletin to dealers had gone out,and after ford had decided to recall the trucks to install the fix,but before the recall notices or any warnings to ultimate consumers were sent out.id.
the whites brought a products liability action under nevada law against ford and orscheln,alleging strict product liability defective design,negligence,failure to warn,intentional misrepresentation and negligent infliction of emotional distress.their theory of the case was that the parking brake failed to engage,allowing the truck to roll,and that ford knew the brake was prone to failure but refused to recall it or warn consumers of the danger.id.at.
during the trial,orscheln settled with the whites and the case went to verdict against ford.id.the jury found that the brake was defective in design,but that this design defect did not proximately cause the accident.rather,the jury found that the brake was defective for ford failure to warn,that ford was negligent with respect to the brake and that ford had thereby proximately caused walter death.the jury also found the whites percent contributorily negligent.finally,the jury found ford liable for negligent infliction of emotional distress and intentional misrepresentation of the safety of the vehicle,and found by clear and convincing evidence that ford acted with oppression or malice in the conduct that caused walter death.id.at quoting the jury questionnaire.the jury returned a verdict against ford for in compensatory damages to each parent for emotional distress and to walter estate for funeral in punitive damages.the district court found that the punitive damages award was constitutionally excessive and therefore remitted it to times the compensatory the theory that the largest punitive damages award the nevada courts had approved was times the compensatory damages.id.at see also id.at graber,dissenting.the parties then.
in white i,this court unanimously affirmed the first jury compensatory and punitive liability findings.with respect to punitive damages,it held that the evidence was sufficient to support the following conclusions,which in turn were sufficient under nevada law to support a punitive damages award 
that ford knew the parking brake could malfunction and let a pickup truck roll away,did fix it,did recall it,and did warn drivers of the trucks,all prior to the white accident 
that ford knew a parking brake malfunction could result in a rollaway,and failed to warn people driving pickup trucks about the brake in conscious disregard of their safety that is,knowing that someone could be injured or killed and deliberately failing to warn 
that when the engineers had figured out the problem and the fix for it,ford covered it up with a euphemistic notice to dealers,rather than consumers,instead of a plain warning and immediate recall 
that,where a person pressed the parking brake with his foot and felt no resistance,and rollaway,where the parking brake seemed to engage but did prevent the truck from rolling away were both the same thing,failure of the pawl to drop properly between the teeth of the ratchet wheel and 
once ford knew that pickup trucks could be rolling down hills without drivers behind the wheel,it was obvious that someone was likely to be killed if ford did do something about it.
id.at majority opinion.
however,a majority of the panel ultimately reversed the punitive damages award because the district court instructions unconstitutionally allowed a nevada jury to punish ford for conduct.id.at.the majority held that the jury must be limited to punitive damages reasonably required to vindicate nevada legitimate interests in punishment and deterrence,if any,and prohibited from imposing punitive damages to protect people or punish harm outside of nevada.id.it therefore remanded for a new trial on punitive damages without addressing whether the original or remitted amount of punitive damages was unconstitutionally excessive.see id.at.
c.the second trial 
in,district judge hagen,who presided over the first trial,conducted a retrial limited to the amount of punitive damages before a new jury.the district court did not inform the second jury of the amount of the white compensatory damages award,but rather told the jury that t he original jury found for the whites and awarded damages to compensate them for their injuries,and that the whites had already been compensated for the injuries they suffered.it also explained that ford liability for punitive damages has already been established and that t he only remaining question for the jury to decide is the amount of punitive damages.
after an trial,the jury awarded the whites million.the district court initially reduced the award to to account for the whites comparative fault,but subsequently reinstated the full award,concluding that under nevada law the whites fault should not be considered.the district court also concluded that the full million award,representing a to ratio of punitive to compensatory damages,was constitutionally permissible.
defendant ford motor company appealed the second jury award as a violation of the due process clause of the fourteenth amendment,and urged us to reverse for instructional and evidentiary errors.after we heard argument,the supreme court decided philip morris usa williams,d,holding that states must provide assurances that juries do not award punitive damages based in part on a desire to punish defendants for harming nonparties.we reheard argument to consider the implications of williams.
ii.discussion 
harm to nonparties instruction 
the due process clause forbids a state to use a punitive damages award to punish a defendant for injury that it inflicts upon nonparties or those whom they directly represent,injury that it inflicts upon those who are,essentially,strangers to the litigation.williams.at.a jury may consider evidence of actual harm to nonparties as part of its reprehensibility determination,but may not use a punitive damages verdict to punish a defendant directly.id.at.where there is a significant risk that jurors will misapprehend the distinction,the court must upon request protect against that risk by avoid ing procedure that unnecessarily deprives juries of proper legal guidance.id.
during closing argument,counsel for the whites told the jury that by january,ford knew that people had been injured by rollaways.counsel argued that ford decided to do everything possible to avoid telling people the truth about the rollaway problem because t hey know there are not less than people as of january of who were injured from a rollaway a nd they do ever want to have to be accountable for that conduct.
concerned that the jury would punish ford for the harm suffered by other rollaway victims,counsel for ford had objected to the district court proposed jury instructions,and requested an instruction that would prevent the jury from punishing ford in this case not just for the harm to these plaintiffs,but for harm to other plaintiffs,whether in state or out of state.ford conceded that evidence of harm to other people could be considered by the jury in assessing reprehensibility,but argued that the jury could punish only for the harm to this plaintiff.the district court refused such an instruction,deciding that it was not required by existing precedent.
although we are sympathetic to the difficult task that both district court judges and counsel face in maneuvering through this area of the law,we are compelled to reverse here and remand for a new trial in light of the intervening precedent of williams.as in williams,there is a significant risk that the jury,in arriving at its punitive damage award,punished ford for harm to nonparties.absent a proper limiting instruction,the jury could have mistakenly understood the whites argument that ford conduct injured other people to justify not just a finding of reprehensibility,but also to consider those other injuries in calculating the amount of damages warranted to punish ford reprehensible conduct.given williams guidance,we must conclude that the court failure to give a harm to nonparties instruction violated due process.
the whites argue that any constitutional error was harmless because the district court gave an extraterritoriality instruction,restricting jurors from add ing damages to protect people or to punish harm to people outside of nevada emphasis added.we agree this limiting instruction mitigated the problem.it did not render the error more probably than not harmless,swinton potomac,cir,however,because the jury may have interpreted the extraterritoriality instruction as allowing damages for harm to people residing inside nevada.
there was no evidence linking any of the nonparty victims to nevada,but neither did the evidence establish that none of the victims were nevada residents.this gap in the evidence was critical because the jury heard plaintiffs counsel assert that nevada residents purchased ford truck models affected by the rollaway problem in disproportionate numbers.thus,jury members may have assumed that at least some of the nonparty victims lived in nevada.
to remedy the due process violation,we may either remand for a new trial on punitive damages or change the level of the punitive damages award.williams.at.we conclude that a new trial on punitive damages is the proper remedy.see werbungs und commerz union austalt collectors guild,cir holding that remittitur is not designed to compensate for excessive verdicts in cases where jury is improperly instructed.on remand,the district court must explain to the jury that although evidence of harm to nonparties may bear on ford reprehensibility,any award of punitive damages can not be used to punish ford directly for harms to.williams.at 
b.other alleged instructional and evidentiary errors 
the remainder of ford challenges can be divided into three categories.first,ford argues the district court erroneously refused to provide a reasonable relationship instruction and further failed to tell the jury the amount of compensatory damages the first jury awarded to the whites.second,ford faults the district court opening jury instructions in several respects.third,ford argues the district court erred by admitting into evidence a redacted,version of ford december,consolidated balance sheet,which ford claims misrepresented the company financial condition.
we review the district court formulation of jury instructions and its evidentiary rulings for abuse of discretion.see beachy boise cascade,cir.we conclude that the district court abused its discretion by not telling the jury the amount awarded to the whites in compensatory damages that the first jury found ford brake defect did not proximately cause the accident and that the whites were percent responsible for the accident.we decline to decide whether the district court abused its discretion by excluding ford financial statement and annual report,and we reject the remainder of ford arguments.
reasonable relationship instruction and compensatory damages 
reasonable relationship.we reject ford argument that due process requires the district court to instruct the jury that any award of punitive damages must bear a reasonable relationship to compensatory damages.see hilao estate of marcos,cir holding that procedural due process does not require the jury to be instructed that a reasonable relationship must exist between the amounts of compensatory and exemplary damages.ford argument that hilao was implicitly overruled by state farm and williams is not persuasive.in state farm mutual automobile insurance campbell,d,the supreme court held that courts must ensure that the measure of punishment is both reasonable and proportionate to the amount of harm to the plaintiff and the general damages recovered.id.at.but nothing in state farm precludes courts from ensuring proportionality through a review,rather than with jury instructions.
similarly,williams holding is inapposite in the context of the reasonable relationship inquiry.williams mandates that juries receive proper instruction on harm to nonparties,an instruction that is essential if the jury is to calculate the proper amount of punitive damages.but the reasonable relationship inquiry is markedly different from the jury determination of a specific amount of punitive damages its purpose is to aid in ascertaining the constitutional ceiling.unlike the initial damage calculation,determining the constitutional ceiling on a punitive damage award is a question of law,properly reserved for the court.see bains llc arco prods,cir holding that t he constitutional level of punitive damages is not a finding of fact that must be determined by the jury it may be determined de novo by the court.although states are certainly free to incorporate the reasonable relationship concept into jury instructions,see morgan woessner,cir,it is also constitutionally permissible for a district court to delay the reasonable relationship inquiry until the judge review.nevada has taken the latter course.see bongiovi sullivan,adopting state farm guideposts for judicial review for excessiveness under state law.compare,with cal.baji including nevada identically worded reprehensibility and deterrence factors but adding a reasonable relationship factor.
compensatory damages.although we hold that ford was not entitled to a reasonable relationship instruction under either the due process clause or nevada law,we nevertheless conclude that the amount of compensatory damages is relevant to the amount of punitive damages.in accordance with nevada law,the jury was properly instructed to consider two factors in determining the amount of punitive damages the reprehensibility of the conduct of the defendant and the amount of punitive damages which will have a deterrent effect on the defendant in light of the defendant financial condition.in a typical case,the same jury would award both compensatory and punitive damages.here,because of this case unique procedural history,the jury empaneled to award punitive damages was unfamiliar with the original jury verdict and the amount of compensatory damages it awarded.without knowing the amount of those damages,the punitive damages jury could not have come to a reasoned conclusion as to the amount of additional damages necessary to deter ford from similar conduct in the future.the district court withholding of that information was,therefore,an abuse of discretion.
on remand the district court must instruct the jury that the whites have been awarded in compensation for the death of their son.consonant with nevada law,the district court in formulating its instruction should
