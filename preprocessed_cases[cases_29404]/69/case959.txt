roger kight was hired as a full time salesperson at autozone on july.over the course of his employment he was promoted from counter salesman to parts sales manager and later to assistant manager.from september,until his termination,he worked as the head of the store commercial division with the title commercial sales specialist.in that position he reported directly to the store manager.he was offered the position of store manager,but declined it because he enjoyed working with the commercial clients.in the year preceding his termination on january,he twice received autozone highest evaluation ranking of exceeding expectations during employment reviews.that same year gross sales in kight department improved and profits increased.he was years old in.
steve sinor was promoted to store manager in april.sinor made disparaging remarks about the age of his employees nearly every day.sinor referred to kight as old man,old fart,and old fat fart and told him he was too old to do his job.in the presence of other employees and customers,sinor announced over the store intercom that it was time for the old men over fifty to take a pee break.after kight department won a regional trophy for sales,sinor told him he did want to shake his old man hand and said,you too old and you wo work under my rule.sinor told him he was going to go anywhere in the company because he was too old.he made general comments that he did like working with old people because they were sick,inflexible,and stuck in their ways.kight began keeping a record of sinor age related comments in a notebook which he stored on a shelf in the commercial division of the store.sinor found the notebook while kight was on vacation in december of.
kight received only one written disciplinary warning at autozone that was in a corrective action review car.the car was issued on september,for using abusive language,displaying aggressive and intimidating behavior,and for conduct detrimental to autozone and its commitment to diversity and respect.the review stated that kight could be terminated if he engaged in similar conduct in the future.
some time after sinor found the notebook in which kight had kept track of his comments about age,kight and edward powers got into a heated argument,but assistant manager rocky reid separated the two before the fight could become physical.sinor then arranged for an investigation into kight conduct by human resources manager grant bagwell.
bagwell investigation reported that coworkers reid and cecil hall said kight belittled people,called them names,and used profanity.bagwell also interviewed powers and sinor before he talked with kight.sinor gave bagwell the notebook in which kight had written down sinor age related comments.tim harrison,an autozone staff attorney,also reviewed the notebook contents before it was returned to kight at his interview.kight told bagwell that sinor had repeatedly made disparaging remarks about his age and that several employees had told him that sinor had admitted he tried to get kight fired,but bagwell responded that it was not his job to investigate sinor.powers gave bagwell a written statement listing his complaints about kight,including a description of their recent altercation and a claim that kight forced him to work off the clock.
bagwell communicated his conclusions to staff attorney harrison and told him that kight had engaged in abusive behavior,made inappropriate comments,and used profanity toward staff and customers.harrison then consulted with the regional manager,todd sittig.the two decided to terminate kight on january,for inappropriate comments,misconduct toward customers,unprofessional behavior,conduct unbecoming an autozoner,conduct detrimental to autozone,loss of confidence.their decision to terminate kight was based solely on bagwell investigation the car was not considered.
kight initiated this action on may,alleging autozone had discriminated against him because of his age in violation of the adea and retaliated against him for keeping the notebook that recorded sinor age related comments.the court granted summary judgment on kight retaliation claim which was dismissed on february,but it denied summary judgment on his adea claim.a jury trial was held from april.kight presented evidence to show that his supervisor steve sinor discriminated against him because of his age and wrongfully initiated and influenced a human resources investigation that eventually led to his termination.autozone denied discriminating against kight because of his age.its theory and evidence was that kight had been terminated for inappropriate behavior with customers and employees,which kight claimed was only pretext.
during trial autozone sought to enter kight car into evidence.the district court excluded it as irrelevant because it had not been used in the decision to terminate kight and its relevance was further diminished because it was remote in time.autozone also made an offer of proof seeking to introduce the cars and termination notices for four other employees who had been terminated for what it asserted were similar reasons.the district court excluded the reviews and termination notices as well as any testimony about them because these employees had not been listed as witnesses and the record did not provide any context about their situations.
included in kight evidence at trial was his own testimony about his interview with bagwell.bagwell had told kight he would not investigate the complaints he raised about sinor,and kight attempt to contact sinor supervisor about his behavior failed because the supervisor cancelled every appointment and told him he was too.in his testimony kight admitted that he knew he could be terminated for abusive or disruptive behavior.he called both ed powers and cecil hall as witnesses.they had complained about kight to bagwell,but testified at trial on his behalf.in the interim powers had filed and lost an age and disability lawsuit against autozone and hall had filed four eeoc charges.they reported that sinor had coerced their previous negative statements about kight and threatened to fire them if they did not comply.powers testified that the statement he signed had been written by sinor and then given to bagwell.hall testified that bagwell seemed to have a preconceived idea about what the written report of their interview should say about kight behavior and that he had manipulated the written answers.kight counsel stated in his closing statement that there no corrective action reviews anywhere in his file about any of these things that they are purporting he was doing at the time and emphasized that kight was not told that he had acted inappropriately until he was fired.
autozone called todd sittig,kight regional manager,who testified that he had terminated other employees for conduct similar to kight,and that some of them may have been under the age of.sittig and harrison both testified that they were the decisionmakers in terminating kight.when bagwell took the stand,he was asked why he had not investigated any of the claims made about sinor inappropriate behavior and he responded that he did not know.
counsel discussed jury instructions with the court in chambers.the district court had previously informed them that it did not plan to submit a willfulness instruction,but kight attorney requested one at the chambers conference.autozone counsel responded that the court intention to omit a willfulness instruction was appropriate.the district court subsequently told counsel it had decided to give the instruction if the jury returned an initial verdict in favor of kight.on the day the case was submitted to the jury,a clerk informed counsel that the court would add the following instruction if
