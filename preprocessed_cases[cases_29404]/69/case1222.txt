this is a breach of contract case,involving breach of an agreement between a cable television broadcaster and a company licensing programming.
this is an appeal from a judgment following a bench trial.we take the facts from the findings and exhibits except as otherwise explained.
starting in,warner brothers licensed television programming to golden channels,a cable television company in israel.golden was associated with two other cable television companies,and the three together,as israel cable programming,coordinated their operations.for almost a decade,warner and golden made agreements lasting about one year.none of those are at issue.this case arises out of a contract made in.
the israeli television market changed in january,when the government licensed a satellite television broadcaster.satellite television subjected golden to competition and opened up different possibilities,positive and negative,for warner.
warner and golden accordingly changed their arrangement.instead of year to year agreements,they made a contract for months.under the new agreement,golden had less power to pick and choose programs,and had to buy at least the minimum amounts specified in the contract of various types of programs,both new and popular shows,and old reruns.the contract commenced december,and ended may.golden was obligated to spend million the first year,million the second year,and million the last six months.
during the contract term,to may,golden was obligated to provide an irrevocable unconditional draw down letter of credit,for at least million,the form of which was specified in an addendum.a letter of credit creates an absolute,independent obligation and payment must be made upon presentation of the proper documents regardless of any dispute between the buyer and seller concerning their agreement.like a travelers check which is a letter of credit,it enables international business to be done safely and securely because the vendor need only rely on the financial strength of the issuing bank,and not on the financial strength and willingness to pay of the vendee 
golden maintained the letter of credit as required,with its bank.the form was a commitment from the bank that the beneficiary,warner,could draw funds up to million,once or in multiple drafts,by presenting sight drafts to the bank,which had a branch in los angeles.the sight drafts were in the form,p ay on sight to the order of warner.international television distribution the sum of,to be signed by an authorized signatory for warner.the letter of credit was to expire in one year,but would be automatically extended at each one year anniversary unless terminated with at least days notice.the letter issued by the bank ran from july to july,with notice of cancellation to be given in may.as a practical matter,this means that million of golden credit line at the bank was tied up so long as the letter of credit remained in effect,and warner could in substance write checks on an account of million.
another part of the contract was that warner could at its sole discretion extend the term for a second month period,so that it would end november,instead of may,by giving notice by september.if warner extended the term,golden was obligated to pay warner a extension option fee,and minimum spend amounts of million for the first months,then million and million respectively for the subsequent two years.
but in the contract,warner and golden expressly did not agree to maintain the letter of credit in place during the extension.instead,they agreed that the million letter of credit would be in place during the initial term only.the closest they got to any agreement regarding security for a subsequent term was that they would discuss it.here is the text of the entire paragraph regarding the letter of credit if warner chose to exercise its option to extend the contract for a second term 
the letter of credit referred to in clause above shall be in place from july to may only.if licensor warner intends to exercise the extension option under clause licensee golden agrees to discuss with licensor appropriate security to be given in respect of license fees due in years.
golden business began to suffer during the initial term,perhaps because of the new competition from satellite television.golden nevertheless continued to maintain the letter of credit in place,so warner was fully secured regardless of golden declining financial strength.
in june,warner exercised its option to extend the term of the license agreement through november.subsequently,in august of,golden told warner it could not pay the quarterly licensing fee due on september.in september,golden asked warner to renegotiate the agreement,principally to lower licensing fees.warner could,of course,have refused,but it did.the contract provided that warner could at its sole discretion suspend delivery of programs,terminate the agreement,or both,if golden missed a payment,and golden did pay less than it owed.but warner did not find it in its interest to exercise its right to terminate at that time.instead,warner agreed to continue to supply programming for a lower fee than it had agreed upon,while the parties negotiated,reserving its right to demand the full amounts required under the contract if negotiations were not successful.
negotiations trundled along,over email,letter exchanges,and in meetings,even though the parties had not agreed to appropriate security for an extension and had not agreed on much of anything else.in october,the parties discussed what to do about the letter of credit if the term was extended.the parties were still performing under the initial term of the contract,although the second term would begin june pursuant to warner exercise of its option to extend the previous june.
here is where the findings of fact and the evidence we can find in the record diverge.the trial judge found that warner was adamant that it would not negotiate unless the letter of credit was kept in place.but all we can find in the evidence is that warner was adamant that any modified contract they negotiated would have to keep the letter of credit in place.warner negotiator testified that he said the only basis on which warner would contemplate renegotiating the deal would be in the circumstances that we would not review the letter of credit and it would remain in situ throughout not just the term per the agreement but also any extended term as a result of the negotiation.warner sent an email confirming what had been said at the meeting.one of warner points in the confirming email was that it was absolutely critical that the letter of credit remains in situ throughout the term of the deal with the final year being a on that letter of credit.we deal with this possible discrepancy between the evidence and the findings of fact below,in the analysis.
golden did not immediately say whether it would accept this proposal,though it spoke to it some months later.warner continued negotiations,even though it had no agreement that the letter of credit would remain in place during the extension term.
the contract had the usual clause limiting changes to changes put in writing and agreed to by both parties t he terms of this agreement may be altered only by written agreement of the parties properly authorised representatives.there was no such written agreement to alter the terms,regarding the letter of credit running through may,only or anything else.
negotiations continued through,even though no written agreement had been made regarding appropriate security.basically,golden wanted lower fees,and warner wanted to sell more programming and not risk losing viewers by a change in who broadcast its programs.throughout the negotiations,warner suggested that there might be some give on price,but was adamant that the million letter of credit would have to remain in place during any new deal.
while these negotiations were going on,golden allowed the bank to renew the letter of credit in may of,so the letter of credit secured warner through july.this date ran over a year beyond what golden promised to provide in the contract they had signed.thus golden caused warner to remain secure as negotiations proceeded.
in august of,golden responded to warner demand made for the last several months that the million letter of credit remain in place during the second month period.golden told warner that it would maintain the letter of credit through the extension term only after the completion of a merger that it was engaged in with two other cable television companies,and only for a reduced amount based upon what would be a reduced price 
cable companies will be able to provide a letter of credit for movies and series contracts only after the completion of the merger between them the amount of the letter of credit will be reduced according to the new contract prices.
despite this explicit rejection of the requirement on which warner had been adamant,warner continued to negotiate,though warner evinced no give on its demand for a full million of security by letter of credit.
things came to a head in november,a few months into the second term.warner negotiator in london emailed warner executive in los angeles that golden had blinked and realises we are prepared to play hardball.the parties negotiated in london with no success and scheduled a conference call for november.meanwhile,warner issued a notice of default pursuant to the terms of the contract on november.this notice was the hardball.the contract provided for default for either of two reasons,failure to maintain the letter of credit in place until may,only,or unpaid fees 
in the event that 
a letter of credit complying with the terms of clause is not delivered by the due date under this agreement and licensor gives licensee written notice that such letter of credit has not been delivered and further the letter of credit is not delivered within fourteen days after the date of such written notice 
the initial fee,extension option fee or any license fee instalment is not paid on the due date under this agreement and licensor gives licensee written notice that payment must be made and further the payment is not made within fourteen days after the date of such written notice 
then licensor shall in each case be entitled at its sole discretion to either suspend delivery of the programs pending compliance terminate this agreement 
warner sent golden two communications the same day.it sent a letter pursuant to claiming an entitlement to in arrears,and demanded that golden tender payment within days,or else be subject to suspension of delivery of programs,termination of the contract,or both.warner further reminded golden that in two weeks it would owe another.warner did not claim any breach or default with respect to the letter of credit or mention the other clause.warner letter was couched exclusively in terms of the second termination clause,for missed payments,and not the first,for failing to maintain a letter of credit for million.
on the same day as the letter,warner sent golden an email with quite a different tone.warner email thanked golden representative for flying to london to negotiate,stated that warner would not immediately draw down the letter of credit,and explained the simultaneous letter by saying that it had merely set the day clock running by issuing the breach notice.obviously we hope that we will have successfully concluded negotiations prior to the end of this period and as such no further action would be required on this.by now it had been clear for several months that golden did not propose to maintain a million letter of credit during the extension term,and warner proposed to insist on it.
at this point,golden faced termination in december,had not agreed with warner upon new terms,and had a letter of credit that would be outstanding until the following july.the contract had obligated golden to keep a letter of credit in place until may only,the bank ran the letters of credit from july to july,and by not cancelling with the bank while negotiations were going on,golden had allowed the letter of credit to run until july.golden proposed to pay and be done with it.
golden responded to the letter and email on november,characterizing warner notice of default as a decision by warner to unilaterally and without good faith terminate the negotiations golden also noted a number of points it had made that warner had not responded to,questions it had not answered,and claims unexplained by warner.golden also disputed the calculation by a few hundred thousand dollars and proposed to pay warner by its calculation,not warner for.the difference,constitutes hours of rerun programming that warner had not yet delivered to golden because golden had not yet told warner which titles it wanted.golden immediately paid the cash that it calculated it owed on top of the million secured by the letter of credit.golden then requested the return of the letter of credit.golden wrote,
according to section of the agreement,the letter of credit shall be in place until may only.based on the assumption that the amendment shall be executed,we have prolonged the period of the letter of credit delivered to warner.since as mentioned in your letter of november,warner has decided that no such amendment shall be executed and pursuant to section of the agreement,we hereby request warner to return the letter of credit to us immediately.
in a letter a few days later,golden proposed that an escrow agent be used to collect the money from golden and the letter of credit from warner and exchange them so that warner would get the full.the record does not show why golden preferred to exchange the letter of credit for million cash,so we do not know whether it had something to do with golden ongoing merger,bank fees the bank charged golden a year as a fee for keeping the letter of credit in place,not burdening its line of credit during subsequent months,or some other reason.the escrow arrangement would give warner million cash in exchange for the million letter of credit.the record also does not show why warner would not be indifferent between the two forms of payment,million by sight draft on the letter of credit,or million cash.
warner concluded that more negotiations would be fruitless,so on december,it told golden that it was terminating the contract,stating that golden materially breached the license agreement by failing to pay license fees when due.that day it also drew down the entire on the letter of credit and sued golden to collect money claimed on top of the.golden responded by issuing its own termination letter on january.among other things,golden asserted that warner materially breached the license agreement by wrongfully drawing upon the letter of credit and by improperly declaring golden to be in default.golden said that it was entitled to continue to broadcast the inventory of programs already paid for through april.golden then counterclaimed in warner suit.
the case was tried to the bench.there is no finding of fact explaining why warner insisted on drawing down the letter of credit instead of taking the identical amount in cash through an escrow,or why golden insisted on return of the letter of credit in exchange for the identical amount of cash through an escrow.in its conclusions of law,the district court concluded that whether golden had breached depended on whether its demand for return of the letter of credit constituted a demand for return of security,which would be proper under california law,or a tender subject to a condition warner was not obligated to satisfy,which would not be a valid tender of performance under civil code.the district court did not find an inadequacy of the amount of golden tender,even though it varied from warner demand because of the disputed charge for some reruns.
the court concluded that the tender was improperly conditioned on return of the letter of credit,on the theory that golden was equitably estopped from denying that it had given the letter of credit as security at least through may.the theory for the estoppel was that golden renewal of the letter of credit in may had misled warner into continuing negotiations,because golden knew of warner adamant insistence that the letter of credit had to remain in place through the second term of the contract november.golden s
