introduction 
plaintiff aviva malatka has obtained an order restraining one of her neighbors,defendant christine helm,from verbally harassing her and her husband.code civ.the initial order was filed on may,after hearings on april and may.an amended order adding plaintiff husband was filed on june.
rather than appealing from the restraining order,defendant filed a motion to dissolve or modify it.after a hearing on september,the court modified the restraining order,implicitly denying the request to dissolve it.a modified order was filed on october.
on appeal from the latter order,defendant asserts that the trial court erred at the may hearing by refusing to consider declarations she had submitted and by denying her motion to strike one witness testimony.plaintiff contends that these issues should have been raised in an appeal from the initial order and are not reviewable in an appeal from a modification of that order.on the eve of oral argument,defendant filed a motion to dismiss this appeal as moot and to reverse the judgment.we will affirm the challenged order after explaining why defendant contentions are neither reviewable nor meritorious.
ii.procedural history 
a.the written request for a restraining order and opposition 
on april,plaintiff obtained an ex parte court order temporarily restraining defendant from harassing plaintiff and her husband.defendant lived across the street from them.plaintiff application for the order included a declaration that defendant had cursed and threatened her since they became neighbors in,most recently on april.one of their earliest confrontations in involved defendant expressing displeasure about plaintiff and her husband cutting down a tree on their property,as the tree had been part of defendant view for years.defendant knocked on plaintiff door later that day and offered an apology,but plaintiff was dismissive.there were other confrontations over time.on april,while plaintiff was unloading her groceries from her car,among other things defendant yelled that plaintiff was a fucking bitch,the capitola whore,and a fucking cunt,and said,i will fuck you up,bitch.
plaintiff declaration also recited that another neighbor,al sehorn had obtained a temporary restraining order against defendant in august.defendant had been cutting his flowers and harassing his family.plaintiff also said that she once saw defendant and her son struggling over a shotgun in the middle of the street.
a hearing was scheduled for april.defendant filed written opposition on april.her declaration admitted that she said something inappropriate in connection with the tree,but said it was plaintiff who cursed her when she offered an apology.she denied some other alleged confrontations had occurred.she admitted that,on the final occasion,she told plaintiff off after plaintiff again dismissed her.
defendant opposition included declarations from al sehorn and kathleen keil.sehorn stated that defendant is a great neighbor.sehorn denied saying to plaintiff what her declaration reported.keil stated she is a good neighbor.she did remember defendant and her son having words over a gun that he inherited.
defendant submitted a request by sehorn for dismissal without prejudice on september,of an action seeking a harassment injunction against defendant.
b.the april,hearing 
on april,plaintiff appeared with counsel.at the outset of the hearing,the court identified the problem of not having enough time in the morning and plaintiff attorney being unavailable in the afternoon.plaintiff testified consistently with her declaration.
jorge michael,called by plaintiff,testified that he used to be a neighbor of plaintiff and defendant.once defendant came to complain about them removing a tree on plaintiff property that was damaging michael car.she said she enjoyed looking at the tree,and they had no right to remove it.he overheard defendant direct profanity at plaintiff.
defendant said she had no for michael,but asked,am i allowed to call him back if i need to talk to them after we discover more the court answered affirmatively.
cindy clanton,called by plaintiff,testified that she had heard defendant using the kind of language described by plaintiff over a dozen times since.defendant yelled at and cursed her one day and told her she could not park her car on the street.clanton told her she would call the police if she would not leave the property.clanton heard defendant using profanity at plaintiff.on,defendant elicited that defendant once called the police on clanton claiming that clanton had damaged rocks placed by defendant on a neighborhood easement.defendant said that she was finished with her,and plaintiff proceeded with redirect examination.
before plaintiff husband was able to testify,the court interrupted the proceedings,explaining there was no more time that day.there was consideration of another date.defendant said that may would not work,because due to the testimony that i heard,i going to call in some other witnesses.the hearing was set for may.when asked if she wanted michael to come back,defendant said,well,i have have to think about what was said and come up with some good questions.i not an attorney.michael said he would be in australia.
michael was recalled to the stand.defendant established that he had not had a problem parking in the neighborhood.
c.the continued hearing on may,
the hearing resumed on may,with both sides being represented by attorneys,defendant by delman smith.defendant brought a motion to strike cindy clanton testimony because she was unavailable for.the trial court denied the motion 
sandberg,offered as a character witness by defendant,testified that she had heard plaintiff yell and swear on three occasions over six years earlier,none involving defendant.
plaintiff husband,called by defendant,testified about defendant confronting them about cutting down a tree.she called plaintiff a fuckin bitch,and said they had no right to cut down the tree.on a later occasion,she complained again about them trimming another tree that was scratching michael car.apart from these occasions,they have been cordial to each other.his wife has told him over the telephone about other confrontations when he is at work.
defendant testified that when she offered an apology about the tree on the first occasion,plaintiff said,i do have to take an apology from you,you bitch,and slammed the door in her face.defendant retorted,do call me a i know things about you.you are the earlier that day,plaintiff had called her a fucking bitch,and told her to go back to her property.
on a later occasion,plaintiff muttered something under her breath about a dog barking at defendant.
on april,defendant called out to plaintiff from her yard and said she should have accepted her apology.let end this thing get it over with.plaintiff gave her a look.defendant said,you know it never going to be peaceful here with you.defendant admitted calling plaintiff a fucking bitch that day.she denied using the other curses attributed to her,since she did not use that kind of language.
on redirect examination,plaintiff objected to defendant characterizing the declaration provided by sehorn.smith responded,i not calling for hearsay i asking her whether the declaration is true.just whether he did.
the court stated,i not going to all sides aware,i not going to consider sehorn declaration he not here he not subject to.defendant interrupted the court to say that the court could call him.the court said that the hearing was scheduled four weeks earlier.defendant began to respond to the court,and smith admonished her,please,since you have gone to the trouble to bring me here,would you please just respond to questions and not give speeches 
when smith asked her again about sehorn declaration,the court reiterated,i not considering what sehorn has said.he not here.i going to base it on the evidence that was presented.smith said,thank you.nothing further of this witness,your honor.on recross examination,defendant admitted that sehorn wife filed a restraining order against defendant.
in rebuttal,plaintiff denied using any obscenities in responding to defendant apology.she denied using obscene language as sandberg had described.
at the close of the hearing,the trial court stated that it was most impressed by the testimony of michael and clanton and these are people who really had no axe to grind.sandberg testimony,on the other hand,had limited relevance.the court found clear and convincing evidence creating a credible threat of violence.the court found that plaintiff is more credible.
a restraining order was issued may,with an expiration date of may.a first amended restraining order was issued on june,including plaintiff husband as a protected person.it required defendant to stay yards away from plaintiff,her husband,and their vehicles for a period of two years.the amended order was sent to attorney delman smith on june.
d.the motion to dissolve or modify the restraining order 
on july,defendant,represented by new counsel,george kovacevich,filed a motion to dissolve or modify the injunction.the motion included declarations by defendant,her husband,and three friends who claimed that defendant did not use the kind of language that plaintiff had attributed to her.defendant and her husband stated,in part,that her husband had contacted the santa cruz county code enforcement department and caused clanton to obtain a permit for an addition to her residence and to redesign the addition.after that,clanton swerved her car at defendant husband and she has driven over their plants and run over a children playing sign on a daily basis.
defendant argued,among other things,that she was denied due process because the court refused to consider the declarations defendant had submitted and that she was denied the right to impeach clanton.while clanton was at the first hearing,she did not show up at the second hearing,and the trial refused to permit defendant to clanton.
plaintiff filed opposition to the motion and defendant filed a reply.
the motion to dissolve came on for hearing on september.regarding the declarations originally submitted by defendant,the court stated that it had reviewed the declarations,and my tentative is that they would not change my mind on what i heard and what i saw.after a further hearing at which no testimony was taken,the court adopted its tentative rulings.it stated with respect to the additional declarations that were submitted,the court did consider those and has considered those and has read them.the court finds that while they do cast some doubt on the credibility of clanton,and they are definitely placing helm in a positive light,the court does find that it would not have affected and changed the court ruling.between the first and second hearings,the court read all the documentation.so anything that had been attached to helm response to the restraining order was read and considered by the court,including sehorn declaration.
the court denied the motion to dissolve the restraining order,but modified it to provide that defendant will stay yards away from plaintiff,her husband,and their vehicles.kovacevich offered to prepare the order.a modified restraining order form was filed on october,retaining an expiration date of may.the order did not expressly reflect the court denial of the motion to dissolve the restraining order.notice of entry of this order was filed on october.
on december,kovacevich filed a notice of appeal on behalf of defendant from a judgment or order which was entered on october.
iii.appealability 
malatka filed a motion to dismiss this appeal on the basis that helm is attempting to appeal from a nonappealable order.on april,this court ordered this motion to be considered in connection with the appeal.
section,subdivision a states that an order granting or dissolving an injunction,or refusing to grant or dissolve an injunction is appealable.
malatka acknowledges that some orders refusing to dissolve injunctions are appealable.her contention is that such an appeal must be limited to issues newly arising from the motion to dissolve the injunction and that a motion to dissolve can not serve as a vehicle for reviving issues that could and should have been raised in an earlier appeal from the initial grant of injunctive relief 
it is established that an order denying a motion to vacate a judgment is deemed appealable only to the extent it raises new issues unavailable on appeal from the judgment.this restriction is imposed to prevent both circumvention of time limits for appealing and duplicative appeals from essentially the same ruling.anderson sherman d,see spellens spellens cal d,rooney vermont investment cal d,carlson eassa th.to further implement this policy,on an appeal from an appealable ruling,an appellate court will not review earlier appealable rulings.berge international harvester d,morrissey city and county of san francisco d,mclellan mclellan d,oliver sperry cal,sara superior court cal th,dependency.
similar reasoning has been applied to rulings on motions to reconsider orders,which are not expressly appealable by statute.the california supreme court has noted that there is a split in authority about whether such orders are appealable ketchum moses cal th,fn,although the court had earlier held that an order denying a motion for reconsideration was appealable when the motion was based in part on new grounds.freeman state farm mut.auto.ins.cal d,fn.
more recently,this court stated in morton wagner th morton at pages and there is a split of authority as to whether an order denying a motion for reconsideration is separately appealable.in re the marriage of burgard th,the majority of recent cases have concluded that orders denying motions for reconsideration are not appealable,even where based on new facts or law.annette sharon s.th,see also in re marriage of burgard,supra,th at these courts have concluded that orders denying reconsideration are not appealable because section of the code of civil procedure does not authorize appeals from such orders,and to hold otherwise would permit,in effect,two appeals for every appealable decision and promote the manipulation of the time allowed for an appeal.reese stores,th,see also crotty trader th,hughey city of hayward th,limandri judkins th,fn.estate of simoncini d,in re jeffrey d,fn.
noting that the motion for reconsideration in morton was not based on new facts or law,this court concluded that the order denying that motion was not appealable.morton,supra,cal.app th at.the order for which reconsideration was sought in morton was a restraining order issued under section.id.at.
the same reasoning has been applied in the context of a ruling modifying a preliminary injunction.chico feminist women health center scully d,scully.in scully,on which plaintiff relies,a preliminary injunction was issued on february,and modified in part on april.in an appeal from the latter order,the appellants sought to challenge not only the modifications of the injunction,but also unmodified parts of the original injunction issued on february.after discussing the restrictions on appeals from motions to vacate judgments and noting that the original preliminary injunction was appealable,the court concluded the general rule controls here.to allow defendants to challenge the subject paragraphs of the earlier preliminary injunction would allow them two appeals on identical grounds.moreover,if defendants theory were allowed,it would theoretically allow wholesale challenges to a preliminary injunction many years after its entry,merely because a court modified the injunction in some insignificant manner and even though the trial court was never given a chance to cure the asserted illegality.id.at.we perceive no reason why defendants should be able to use the order of april,amending the injunction,as an artificial springboard from which to launch an appeal that could have been taken earlier.id.at.
the sculley court explained our conclusion is buttressed by cases allowing appeals from orders modifying injunctions.so far as we can tell,the courts of this state have entertained such appeals where the later orders have modified an injunction in important particulars cherry hill gold min.baker cal.and the appeal challenges the modifications see,barrett lipscomb d,palo park yellow cab santa
