background 
in june,ed alfaro,a licensing manager at taco bell,attended a trade show in new york where he first discovered a cartoon depiction of a chihuahua dog character psycho chihuahua being marketed by its creators,tom rinks and joe shields of wrench llc,a michigan corporation collectively,wrench.alfaro told rinks and shields that he wanted to explore the use of psycho chihuahua by taco bell.
during the summer and fall of,wrench provided taco bell with goods bearing psycho chihuahua image.from that time through june,alfaro tried to build support within taco bell for its use of psycho chihuahua in its advertising.he showed the goods to taco bell senior managers and advertising agency at that time,bozell worldwide bozell.taco bell conducted a focus group study which included psycho chihuahua and several other designs.alfaro reported to a senior taco bell executive that psycho chihuahua was the most popular out of all the designs.
in november,taco bell and wrench licensing agent,strategy licensing,discussed the possible use of psycho chihuahua as taco bell mascot and taco bell requested that strategy licensing submit a proposal on financial terms for the use of psycho chihuahua.on november,strategy licensing submitted a proposal but taco bell did not accept it.discussions continued about taco bell possible use of psycho chihuahua and taco bell understood that if it decided to use that character,taco bell would have to pay wrench for such use.
in february,taco bell company,pepsi,made a presentation to taco bell marketing department regarding the possibility of using psycho chihuahua in a taco bell cinco de mayo promotion.taco bell then conducted additional focus group studies on psycho chihuahua which resulted in positive consumer response.
in march,taco bell changed advertising agencies from bozell to tbwa.taco bell commissioned tbwa to create a new advertising campaign for.
between february and april,alfaro continued to work with wrench to develop possibilities for taco bell use of psycho chihuahua.
in may,tbwa presented approximately thirty advertising ideas to taco bell for its new campaign.one of the ideas involved a male chihuahua dog passing a female chihuahua dog to get to taco bell food.the executives to which the ideas were presented included taco bell president,peter waller,and its chief marketing officer,vada hill.waller and hill selected tbwa chihuahua idea as one of the five advertisements that would be during the summer of.months later,market research demonstrated favorable results for the tbwa chihuahua test advertisement and waller and hill chose that character as the center of its new advertising campaign starting in january.
meanwhile,alfaro believed the character wrench had created from the original psycho chihuahua closely resembled the tbwa chihuahua to be used in taco bell commercials.he alerted taco bell counsel that wrench would likely sue because of the similarities between the characters.taco bell sent a box of psycho chihuahua materials to tbwa at some point between june,and july.alfaro drafted a memorandum that accompanied the materials,describing the parallel path he had taken with wrench and their idea of using a chihuahua to advertise taco bell food.
by january,taco bell began using a chihuahua to advertise its food.wrench then sued taco bell,claiming that taco bell was using psycho chihuahua in its advertising without providing compensation to wrench.wrench llc taco bell,d.
in february,taco bell and tbwa entered into a joint defense and confidentiality agreement joint defense agreement.they also executed a contract controlling their business relationship agency agreement.the agency agreement was executed january,but the parties agreed to make the effective date retroactive to april,to include all of tbwa services to taco bell from the beginning of their business relationship.
in its defense in wrench,taco bell alleged there was no contract with wrench because alfaro had no authority to bind the company,the chihuahua character used by taco bell was not psycho chihuahua,and the chihuahua character used by taco bell was independently created by tbwa.
tbwa created and broadcast over forty more chihuahua commercials between january and june.in june,the wrench jury determined that taco bell had breached an implied contract by using psycho chihuahua without compensating wrench.all copyright claims were disposed of prior to trial.a judgment was entered against taco bell in the amount of,and the court subsequently amended the judgment to account for and interest,bringing the total to over.

ii.discussion 
we review de novo the district court grant of summary judgment.universal health,thompson,cir.
taco bell argues the district court erred in granting summary judgment in favor of tbwa because the wrench verdict established tbwa fault tbwa breached the agency agreement tbwa was collaterally estopped from litigating the issue of its fault and the district court was required to take as true that the chihuahua character used in taco bell advertising was not independently created by tbwa,confirming fault on the part of tbwa.
taco bell relies heavily on tbwa alleged obligation to indemnify taco bell under the indemnification section of the agency agreement which states 
indemnification.tbwa agrees to exercise its best judgment in the preparation and placing of taco bell advertising and publicity,with a view to avoiding any claims,proceedings,or suits being made or instituted against taco bell or tbwa.
agency indemnification.tbwa agrees to defend,indemnify,and hold taco bell,its officers,directors,employees and agents harmless from any loss,damage,liability,claim,demand,suit or expense,including reasonable attorneys fees and costs,that taco bell may incur or be liable for as a result of any claim,suit or proceeding made,threatened or brought against taco bell based upon or arising out of i any materials created,produced,furnished by tbwa for taco bell except for claims covered by paragraph below ii tbwa fault or negligence in the performance of its obligations hereunder or iii tbwa breach of its obligations under this agreement.
client indemnification.taco bell agrees to defend,indemnify and hold tbwa,its affiliated companies and their officers,directors,employees and agents harmless from any loss,damage,liability claim,demand,suit or expense,including reasonable attorneys fees and costs,that tbwa may incur or be liable for as a result of any claim,suit or proceeding made,threatened or brought against tbwa based upon or arising out of i assertions for or descriptions of taco bell products or services or any product or service of taco bell competitors,in any advertising which tbwa may prepare for taco bell,if the assertions or descriptions are based on information or data supplied or approved by taco bell,and such advertising is approved by taco bell before its release,publication or broadcast ii the nature or use of taco bell products or services iii risks which have been brought to the attention of and discussed with taco bell and taco bell has nevertheless elected to proceed as evidenced in writing and signed by either the vice president of advertising or senior vice of taco bell or iv taco bell fault or negligence.the foregoing notwithstanding,taco bell obligation to indemnify,defend,and hold tbwa harmless hereunder shall not apply to the extent that damages are incurred as a result of tbwa negligence or failure to properly perform its obligations as provided in this agreement 
wrench verdict 
the first issue we consider is whether the wrench jury findings are proof of tbwa fault,obligating it to indemnify taco bell for the liability taco bell incurred.
a verdict sheet that was provided to the wrench jury reflects what that jury found 
question number did wrench prove by a preponderance of the evidence that wrench and taco bell had a mutual understanding that if taco bell used the psycho chihuahua character in its advertising and on products,taco bell would pay wrench for this use 
question number did wrench prove by a preponderance of the evidence that taco bell used the psycho chihuahua character in its advertising from to and that the character used by taco bell was not independently created by twba 
question number did wrench prove by a preponderance of the evidence that it suffered damages because taco bell did not pay for its use of the psycho chihuahua character 
the wrench jury answered all three questions affirmatively.
according to taco bell,these findings are proof of tbwa fault.because tbwa was involved in the creation of the tbwa chihuahua character and tbwa had possession of the psycho chihuahua materials,taco bell argues the jury findings that psycho chihuahua was used by taco bell and the character used was not independently created by tbwa confirms wrongdoing by tbwa.taco bell relies heavily on the second question in the verdict sheet submitted to the wrench jury,but as to that question,the court in the wrench trial instructed the jury 
let me give you some things to consider in determining whether the taco bell chihuahua is the same character as the psycho chihuahua character 
if you find that the taco bell chihuahua is the same character as the psycho chihuahua character,then you must still consider whether,on the one hand,taco bell used wrench creation of the psycho chihuahua character or,on the other hand,whether taco bell and tbwa created the taco bell chihuahua on an independent creative,but parallel path.
in answering this question,in addition to considering the differences and between and similarities of the two dogs,as i pointed out in the preceding paragraph,you should consider the access or lack thereof to the psycho chihuahua character by people at taco bell and tbwa.
considering these instructions to the wrench jury,no inference of fault by tbwa can be drawn from the jury verdict.the instructions leave unclear what the wrench jury determined on the issue of independent creation of the chihuahua character.the jury was told to consider whether taco bell and tbwa created the taco bell chihuahua on an independent creative,but parallel path.the court also asked the jury to consider the access or lack thereof to the psycho chihuahua character by people at taco bell and tbwa.the wrench jury was never instructed to differentiate between taco bell and tbwa or determine which party was at fault for the liability to wrench.
the undisputed facts do not support a finding of fault or negligence on the part of tbwa.tbwa was not a party to the implied contract between taco bell and wrench and was unaware of its existence.tbwa had no knowledge of psycho chihuahua nor taco bell contact with wrench before proposing a chihuahua character for taco bell advertising on june.the facts that taco bell did not have input on tbwa creation of its advertising character and that a box of psycho chihuahua materials was sent to tbwa are of no consequence not only because tbwa created its own chihuahua character before it received the psycho chihuahua materials,but also because taco bell was found liable for the use of psycho chihuahua without compensating wrench,not copyright infringement.taco bell arguments speak to copyright issues not pertinent to this case because those claims were disposed of before trial.
the agency agreement indemnification provisions require tbwa to indemnify taco bell for liability incurred as a result of i any materials created,produced,furnished by tbwa for taco bell ii tbwa fault or negligence in the performance of its obligations hereunder or iii tbwa breach of its obligations under this agreement.even if liability arose from materials created,produced,furnished by tbwa for taco bell,paragraph includes an exception for claims covered by paragraph,claims resulting from taco bell fault.although taco bell argues the wrench jury finding warrants an inference that tbwa misappropriated wrench material,neither the verdict nor the undisputed facts allow a finding of tbwa fault,but only taco bell breach of a contract.the district court properly determined no obligation for tbwa to indemnify taco bell under the agency agreement arose from the verdict.
furthermore,as properly decided by the district court,tbwa can not be held at fault under the agency agreement which allows it to rely on the approval of taco bell.taco bell approved the chihuahua character proposed by tbwa and continued to approve the chihuahua advertisements for broadcasting after the wrench lawsuit was initiated,despite the existence of its implied contractual commitment to wrench.
taco bell argues that its approval of advertising created by tbwa was only an approval of costs as provided for in paragraph of the agency agreement.this argument contradicts the statement of taco bell counsel at oral argument of the summary judgment motions in the district court 
so i would dispute strongly that there was an approval of the ads in the form of agreeing that they go forward and shifting the risk.i would dispute that there was approval in the sense of,yes,let run them.i think we sell some more tacos.that,i think there was an approval of.
in addition to the fact that the commercials were broadcast,the admission of taco bell counsel confirmed that taco bell approved the chihuahua commercials for airing.the district court correctly considered taco bell approval to broadcast the chihuahua commercials after wrench filed its lawsuit a dispositive factor in taco bell indemnification claim against tbwa.the admission confirmed that there was approval pursuant to the agency agreement authorization section.
paragraph of the agency agreement states 
authorization.tbwa will be entitled to rely and act upon any instruction,approval or authorization given by taco bell or by any of taco bell representatives.
under this paragraph,tbwa was permitted to rely on taco bell approval of advertising tbwa created the district court properly relied on the fact that taco bell approved for airing the chihuahua commercials between january and june while denying the existence of its contractual obligation to wrench.under the agency agreement,tbwa can not be found at fault for liability arising from advertisements approved by taco bell.
agency agreement 
the next issue we consider is whether tbwa is at fault for breach of the agency agreement,leading to taco bell liability in wrench.subparagraph iii provides that taco bell will indemnify tbwa for any liability resulting from risks which have been brought to the attention of and discussed with taco bell and taco bell has nevertheless elected to proceed as evidenced in writing and signed by either the vice president of advertising or senior vice of taco bell.
taco bell argues that the district court ignored material evidence of tbwa breach of its obligations under paragraph to exercise its best judgment in the preparation and placing of taco bell advertising and publicity with a view to avoiding any claims,proceedings,or suits being made or instituted against taco bell.it is taco bell position that it was tbwa responsibility to make sure taco bell advertising campaign did not misuse psycho chihuahua and tbwa breached its duty when it failed to do advertising copy clearance,uncover an application for a trademark,and bring risks of using a chihuahua in adver
