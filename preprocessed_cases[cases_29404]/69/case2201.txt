oil and gas lessors brought suit against lessee for breach of the implied covenant to protect the leasehold against drainage.the case was tried to the bench.at trial,lessors sole evidence of the amount of damages was the expert testimony of michael riley.after riley,lessee objected and moved to strike riley testimony as unreliable.the trial court denied the motion and,at the close of trial,rendered judgment for lessors.concluding,among other things,that the evidence was legally sufficient to support the damages award,the court of appeals affirmed,wl we conclude that riley testimony regarding the amount of damages is unreliable and is therefore no evidence.accordingly,because lessors failed to present any competent evidence on an essential element of their cause of action,we reverse the court of appeals judgment and render judgment that lessors take nothing.
corporation acquired oil and gas leases from the respondents,who consist of individuals,estates,and trusts collectively referred to as helton.the leases cover all of section,block,roberts and eddleman survey,in wheeler county pooled the leases effective march.also owned leases in several sections of the west park field surrounding section 
in september,began drilling a wildcat well in section,which is directly south of section.this well,holmes,was a deep gas well in the west park field,upper morrow formation of the anadarko basin.it was completed on december.holmes was located feet from the northern and western boundary lines of section.it encountered approximately feet of the previously unknown lower puryear zone in the upper morrow formation and was a very profitable well,producing approximately bcf billion cubic feet of gas over its lifetime.
after holmes was drilled,drilled several additional wells in the west park field,including two wells in section mitchell and mitchell.mitchell,which was located feet from the southern boundary line of section,was completed in august,and encountered no lower puryear.next drilled the eden well in section,which is directly west of section.placed this well feet from the eastern and southern boundary lines of section,as close as spacing rules would allow to the boundary lines,thereby placing the eden as close as possible to holmes.eden encountered feet of lower puryear.it was completed in january in another zone,the puryear,and will make a reasonable profit.
after completing a seismic survey,drilled the zybach well in section,the section southwest of section.zybach was spudded in february near the southern boundary line of section.it encountered no lower puryear.then returned to section to drill an additional well,mitchell,in june.although mitchell was feet from the southern boundary line of section,it was feet from the western boundary line,and thus was not very close to holmes.mitchell encountered approximately feet of lower puryear,was completed in the lower puryear and two other zones,and was a marginal producer.it will not make a profit.
in december,completed a second well in section.this well,fleetwood trust,was located west of holmes,feet from the eastern boundary line of section.fleetwood trust,which was placed as close as possible to holmes,encountered approximately feet of lower puryear,produced approximately bcf of gas,and was also a very profitable well.drilled three additional wells in the west park field,for a total of nine wells 
the parties agree that,in the upper morrow formation in the anadarko basin,rock and sands were deposited by streams and rivers and are therefore difficult to find.the area is extremely difficult to map,and deposits are easily missed.of the nine wells drilled in the west park field,four,eden,mitchell,and fleetwood trust the same lower puryear reservoir.holmes and fleetwood trust,which were located in the thick part of the reservoir,were both very profitable within that formation.
although two wells were drilled in section,helton brought suit claiming that breached its implied covenant to protect section from drainage from the holmes well.helton alleged that an offset well should have been drilled in section,much nearer to holmes than the mitchell and wells,and that a reasonably prudent operator would have had the offset well producing by february.according to helton,the offset well should have been drilled feet from the southern boundary line and feet from the western boundary line of section,placing it feet directly north of holmes.helton asserts that a reasonably prudent operator who owned only the leases in section would have drilled a protection well as close as possible to a known producer such as holmes,but that had no economic incentive to do so because it owned leases in the surrounding sections.according to helton,drilled the mitchell and wells farther away from holmes in an attempt to find another lower puryear deposit rather than to protect section from drainage by holmes.
helton argued that,if drilled as close as possible to holmes,the hypothetical offset well would have encountered the same lower puryear reservoir as holmes and would have been very profitable.dennis kerr,helton petroleum geology expert,testified that the lower puryear reservoir from which holmes and fleetwood trust were draining extended north to the location of the hypothetical offset well,and that there would be approximately feet of lower puryear reservoir at that location.does not dispute this evidence on appeal.
to establish liability and damages,helton offered the expert testimony of michael riley,a petroleum engineer.riley testimony was presented to establish the amount of gas the hypothetical offset well would have produced,that a reasonably prudent operator would have drilled the well,and the amount of royalties helton would have received.it is undisputed that helton claims for damages have been and are based solely on the royalties that the hypothetical protection well would have yielded helton had it been timely drilled.although challenged the measure of damages in the trial court,arguing that damages should be measured by the amount of gas drained rather than what the hypothetical well would have produced,does not challenge helton measure of damages on appeal.riley testified that the hypothetical offset well would have produced approximately bcf of gas,and that helton,who owned a royalty interest,would have received.
during,riley testified that he based his projection of the hypothetical well production on the assumption that the hypothetical well would have produced at the same rate as the holmes well until the fleetwood trust well began producing,and then the three wells would have produced at the same rate until the reservoir was depleted.when asked if the production from these wells would tell him what the hypothetical well would have produced,he answered no,it does not.further,riley was asked,y ou simply do not have any factual basis for projecting the production of that hypothetical well,do you he responded,that is correct.immediately after riley was and dismissed,objected to riley testimony as unreliable and moved to strike.the trial court denied the motion.riley was recalled twice,once during helton and once in rebuttal.
presented four expert witnesses regarding liability.ronald platt,a petroleum engineer,opined that holmes had not drained a substantial amount of gas from underneath section.he further opined that the hypothetical offset well would not have produced sufficient gas to recover the costs of drilling and completion approximately million and,therefore,a reasonably prudent operator would not have drilled the well.in support of those opinions,platt testified that the original gas in place in the entire lower puryear reservoir was bcf the original gas in place in the lower puryear reservoir below section was bcf and the value of the recoverable gas in the lower puryear reservoir below section was.other experts also testified that a reasonably prudent operator would not have drilled the hypothetical well.
at the close of helton,filed a motion for judgment as a matter of law.argued,among other things,that plaintiffs have wholly failed to sustain their burden of proof as to the amount of their damages,if any.there is no competent evidence from which the amount of damages,if any,can be computed.after the close of all the evidence and before the trial court announced a decision,filed a motion for judgment,again asserting that there was no competent evidence to support a finding of damages.the trial court denied both motions.
the trial court issued findings of fact and conclusions of law.in its findings of fact,the trial court found that breached the implied covenant under the section oil and gas leases to protect that portion of the lower puryear interval of the upper morrow formation in and under section from substantial drainage.it further found that t he holmes well drained substantial volumes of gas from underneath section during a reasonably prudent operator owning the oil and gas leases covering section would have commenced drilling a protection well feet from the west line and feet from the south line of section in sufficient time to have such well producing gas by february,and t he hypothetical protection well would have paid out in a reasonable time and would have made a reasonable profit for the lessee after deducting the costs of drilling,completing,operating and marketing.the trial court awarded as lost royalties in royalties from february,to march,and for future damages after march,
after the trial court rendered judgment for helton,filed a motion to modify the judgment or for new trial,arguing,among other things,that there was no competent evidence to support the trial court findings on the amount of damages.also filed a request for additional findings of fact on the volume of gas drained,the dollar value of that gas,and the monthly volume and value of the gas upon which the trial court calculated damages.the trial court denied motion to modify the judgment or for new trial and did not issue additional findings.filed a timely notice of appeal.
the court of appeals affirmed,wl.citing southeastern pipe line tichacek,christi,rev on other grounds,the court of appeals concluded thus,while riley opinion may not be absolute,we believe there is some factual basis to support his opinion as to the amount of damages.the determination as to the credibility of that opinion is to be made by the trier of fact.at,wl at.the court of appeals did not analyze or otherwise address whether riley testimony was reliable under this court established jurisprudence regarding expert testimony.
filed a petition for review asserting that riley testimony is unreliable,incompetent and inadmissable and there is no evidence to support an award of damages or to support the amount of damages awarded.asserts that the petition presents one overarching issue,whether there is any reliable evidence to prove the volume of gas the proposed protection well would have produced and thus,whether there is any evidence to support an award of damages,including the amount found by the trial court.
states that it assumes,for purposes of argument,that the basic liability findings,other than the amount of damages,were supported by legally sufficient evidence.states,however,that although these facts are assumed for purposes of argument,they were vigorously contested and denied in the trial court.because assumes,for purposes of appeal,that the basic liability findings other than the amount of damages are supported by some evidence,we shall do the same.
before reaching the merits,we consider several issues raised by helton.specifically,helton complains that objection was untimely,that waived its complaint by failing to object to certain exhibits,and that objection was not sufficiently specific to preserve a challenge to riley methodology.to preserve error for appeal,a party must make a timely,specific objection or motion to the trial court that states the grounds for the ruling sought with sufficient specificity and complies with the rules of evidence or procedure.app.
helton first complains that motion to strike riley testimony was untimely.helton contends that,to preserve its challenge to riley testimony based on reliability,was required to object to the testimony before it was admitted,either before trial or after taking the witness on voir dire.thus,helton concludes,by waiting until after to object,failed to preserve its appellate complaint that the testimony was unreliable,and thus no evidence.
in maritime overseas ellis,we held that t o preserve a complaint that scientific evidence is unreliable and thus,no evidence,a party must object to the evidence before trial or when the evidence is offered.we did not consider whether a motion to strike after would be sufficient to preserve error we held only that an objection made after the jury verdict comes too late.in river authority kraft,we revisited the preservation issue and concluded that an objection made when the witness began his testimony was timely.thus,was not required to object before trial.
relying on texas rule of evidence b,helton contends that should have conducted a voir dire examination and objected before riley testimony was admitted.rule b provides prior to the expert giving the expert opinion or disclosing the underlying facts or data,a party against whom the opinion is offered upon request in a civil case may be permitted to conduct a voir dire examination directed to the underlying facts or data upon which the opinion is based.this examination shall be conducted out of the hearing of the jury.evid.b,however,relies on rule a to establish that its motion to strike following was timely.rule a provides that t he expert may in any event disclose on direct examination,or be required to disclose on,the underlying facts or data.evid.a.according to,because rule a contemplates that the party against whom the evidence is offered may elicit testimony regarding the underlying facts or data on,a motion to strike the testimony after such is timely.
as we explained in maritime overseas ellis,requiring a reliability objection during trial prevents trial or appeal by ambush without requiring a timely objection to the reliability of the scientific evidence,the offering party is not given an opportunity to cure any defect that may exist,and will be subject to trial and appeal by ambush.maritime overseas,at.to hold otherwise,we reasoned,is simply unfair because the offering party relied on the fact that the evidence was admitted.id.in this case,helton was not subjected to trial or appeal by ambush.objected to the testimony immediately after,when the basis for the objection became apparent,and helton had the opportunity to respond to the objection when riley was recalled.accordingly,we conclude that motion to strike after was sufficient to preserve its complaint on appeal.
helton further suggests that failed to preserve its complaint by allowing helton to admit,without objection,two exhibits and demonstrating riley estimates of the gas production of the hypothetical well.we find no merit in this argument.it is true that motion to strike did not encompass the exhibits it was directed to riley testimony.but is not challenging the admissibility of those exhibits on appeal.rather,it is making a challenge to riley testimony.we have concluded that preserved its complaint by timely objecting to riley testimony based on reliability.if riley opinion is found to be unreliable,and thus no evidence,exhibits and,which are merely representations of riley opinion,would be no evidence for the same reasons.
last,helton contends that,even if timely,objection in the trial court was more limited than argument on appeal.helton contends that a n expert opinion may be unreliable in two different ways the factual foundation is unreliable or improper methodology is used based on reliable facts.according to helton,trial objection was solely that riley testimony was based upon an unreliable factual foundation,and therefore can not challenge riley methodology on appeal.
in its,probed the basis for riley opinion on damages.after riley admitted that he had no factual basis for his projections,counsel objected 
counsel at this point,your honor,the defendant would move to strike the testimony of riley,with respect to damages,on the grounds that by his own admission,his estimate,his numbers,on damages are purely estimates and are not based upon any factual foundation.
and,of course,as this court knows,for an expert opinion to be admissible and to constitute competent evidence,it must have a reliable factual foundation.and by his own admission,he has stated that those are estimates of what might have been produced if the theories about the hypothetical well are correct.and that does not constitute a factual foundation upon which an expert opinion can be based.therefore,we move to strike his testimony as to damages.
also on the grounds of incompetence.it is not within his scope of his expertise or based upon an adequate factual foundation.
the question is whether riley estimate of the production from the hypothetical well is based upon any foundation of fact.and we submit that it is not.
it is clear that was objecting on the basis that riley opinion was not sufficiently supported with facts or data,and that is the basis for challenge in this court.
an oil and gas lessee has an implied obligation to protect the leasehold from drainage.amoco prod.alexander.local drainage occurs when oil migrates from under a lease to the well bore of a producing well on an adjacent lease.id.drainage may be prevented by drilling an offset well.id.to establish a breach of the implied covenant to protect against drainage,a lessor must show proof of substantial drainage from the lessor field,and that a reasonably prudent operator would have acted to prevent the drainage.id.at.
once the lessor has established a breach of the implied covenant to protect against drainage,the lessor is entitled to damages.one measure of damages is the amount of royalties that the lessor would have received from the offset well on its lease.see.pac.coal oil barker,discussing other cases that announce the correct doctrine which requires the lessee to pay the lessor the amount he actually loses by awarding him,without deduction,the full value of royalty lost to him through the lessee failure to exercise ordinary care to either develop the minerals in the leased premises or to protect same from drainage by nearby wells.
does not challenge the trial court findings that there was substantial drainage,that a reasonably prudent operator would have drilled the hypothetical offset well,or that the well would have been profitable.challenges only helton evidence of the amount of damages,arguing that riley testimony is unreliable,and therefore no evidence supports the damages awarded by the trial court.
when reviewing a challenge,we view the evidence in a light that tends to support the finding of the disputed fact and disregard all evidence and inferences to the contrary.bradford vento.in determining whether an expert testimony constitutes some evidence,however,an expert bare opinion will not suffice and t he substance of the testimony must be considered.merrell dow,havner.further,t he underlying data should be independently evaluated in determining if the opinion itself is reliable.id.at river auth.kraft.the proponent of the evidence bears the burden of demonstrating that the expert opinion is reliable.du pont de nemours robinson.if the expert testimony is not reliable,it is not evidence.havner,at.
the reliability requirement focuses on the principles,research,and methodology underlying an expert conclusions.exxon pipeline zwahr.under this requirement,expert testimony is unreliable if it is not grounded in the methods and procedures of science and is no more than subjective belief or unsupported speculation.id.quoting daubert merrell dow,d.expert testimony is also unreliable if the court concludes that there is simply too great an analytical gap between the data and the opinion proffered.gammill jack williams chevrolet,quoting joiner,d.in reviewing the reliability of expert testimony,the court is not to determine whether the expert conclusions are correct rather,the court should determine only whether the analysis used to reach those conclusions is reliable.zwahr,at citing gammill,at.
long before robinson,texas courts required that evidence of drainage be based upon more than mere speculation.barker,at.although estimating the production of a hypothetical well necessarily involves circumstantial evidence,for the lessor to recover damages,t he amount and value of oil or gas production,obtained or obtainable through reasonable diligence,must be definitely alleged,and must be proven with reasonable certainty before damages may be allowed.id.as in any case seeking recovery of lost profits,recovery does not require that the loss be susceptible of exact calculation.holt atherton,heine.but,at a minimum,opinions or estimates of lost profits must be based on objective facts,figures,or data from which the amount of lost profits can be ascertained.id.
riley testified that he looked at numerous accepted sources,such as well logs,base maps,production information,railroad commission records,and scout cards,to obtain data about the area and the wells surrounding the hypothetical well location.riley testified that if the hypothetical offset well had been drilled and placed in production in february,it and holmes would have produced at the same rate,approximately mcf of gas per day the rate that holmes was producing at that time,and that the rate would have declined at a certain rate depicted in exhibit until february,when production would have been approximately mcf per day.at that point,fleetwood trust would have gone into full production,and the production rates of all three wells would have declined more steeply until the reservoir was depleted.
as noted,does not dispute on appeal kerr testimony that the lower puryear reservoir encountered by holmes,eden,mitchell,and fleetwood trust extended below section,and that the hypothetical offset well would have had approximately feet of lower puryear beneath it.but argues crediting the geological testimony of kerr that the hypothetical well site would have feet of lower puryear,one might guess that the well would produce some gas,but the issue is not whether it would issue is how much it would produce.emphasis in original.complains that riley assumption that the hypothetical well would have produced at the same rate as holmes and later fleetwood trust is insupportable.according to,riley assumption is contrary to the actual facts because production records show that holmes and fleetwood trust did not produce at the same rate.also asserts that the hypothetical well,with feet of lower puryear,would likely not produce the same as holmes and fleetwood trust,which had feet and feet of lower puryear,because,all other factors being equal,thickness determines a well productivity.in sum,contends that it is not reasonable to assume that the wells would have produced at the same rate.
riley on these issues as follows 
q.as a petroleum engineer,riley,assuming all factors are equal,except the thickness of the reservoir,would the wells produce at the same rate 
not assuming all things are equal,no.
so,if everything is equal,except the thickness of the reservoir,the thick reservoir is going to produce at a higher rate.the well in the thicker reservoir is going to produce at a higher rate,is it 
all right.well,we know that holmes and fleetwood had different thicknesses of reservoirs,do we 
a.that is correct.
and we know from the production histories that they produced at a different rate 
a.that is correct.
do we so,how is it then,that you theorize that this hypothetical well with an unknown thickness of formation,would produce at the same rate as holmes and fleetwood 
because not all other things are equal.
q.if it thinner,then it certainly not going to produce at the same rate,is it 
i ca say that for sure.there are other factors in the reservoir.your water saturation affects your permeability.your skin damage from the invasion of drilling fluids into the well bore can drastically affect your flow capacity of the well.
and the porosity would certainly affect it,would it 
a.the porosity is somewhat linked to the permeability 
q.a well with porosity would not produce at a greater rate than one with porosity 
a.as i stated earlier,there se
