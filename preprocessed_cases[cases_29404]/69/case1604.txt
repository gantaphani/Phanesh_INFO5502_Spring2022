sandisk corporation sandisk appeals from a decision of the district court for the northern district of california granting stmicroelectronics st motion to dismiss sandisk second through claims relating to declaratory judgment of noninfringement and invalidity for failure to present an actual controversy.see sandisk stmicroelectronics.because the district court erred in dismissing the declaratory judgment claims for lack of subject matter jurisdiction,we vacate the judgment and remand the case to the district court.
background 
sandisk is in the flash memory storage market and owns several patents related to flash memory storage products.st,traditionally in the market of semiconductor integrated circuits,more recently entered the flash memory market and has a sizeable portfolio of patents related to flash memory storage products.on april,st vice president of intellectual property and licensing,lisa jorgenson jorgenson,sent a letter to sandisk chief executive officer requesting a meeting to discuss a agreement.the letter listed eight patents owned by st that jorgenson believed may be of interest to sandisk.sandisk,slip op.at letter from jorgenson to sandisk.on april,sandisk responded that it would need time to review the listed patents and would be in touch in several weeks to discuss the possibility of meeting in june.
on july,having heard nothing further from sandisk,jorgenson sent a letter to sandisk reiterating her request to meet in july to discuss a agreement and listing four additional st patents that may also be of interest to sandisk.sandisk,slip op.at letter from jorgenson to sandisk july.on july,sandisk chief intellectual property counsel and senior director,earle thompson thompson,responded to st letter by informing jorgenson of his understanding that both sides wish to continue friendly discussions such as those between the business representatives in may and june.sandisk,slip op.at letter from thompson to jorgenson july.the discussions of may and june that thompson referred to were discussions among managers and vice presidents of sandisk and st at business meetings held on may,and june,to explore the possibility of st selling flash memory products to sandisk.the business meetings were unrelated to any patents.thompson also requested that jorgenson join the next business meeting on august.on july,jorgenson replied,again urging a meeting with thompson,noting that it was best to separate the business discussions from the patent license discussions.sandisk,slip op.at letter from jorgenson to thompson july.
on august,when the business representatives next met,sandisk presented an analysis of three of its patents and orally offered st a license.st declined to present an analysis of any of its patents,stating instead that any patent and licensing issues should be discussed in a separate meeting with jorgenson.later that same day,thompson wrote a letter to jorgenson objecting to separating business and intellectual property issues and stating that i t has been sandisk hope and desire to enter into a mutually beneficial discussion without the rattling of sabers.sandisk,slip op.at letter from thompson to jorgenson.on august,jorgenson replied,stating that it was her understanding that the parties were going to have a property meeting later that month to discuss the possibility for a patent.letter from jorgenson to thompson.she said that sandisk should come to that meeting prepared to present an analysis of the three sandisk patents it identified during the august business meeting,as well as any infringement analyses of an st device or need for st to have a license to these patents.id.she also said that st would be prepared at that meeting to discuss the twelve patents identified in her prior letters.in closing,jorgenson said that st was look ing forward to open and frank discussions with sandisk concerning fair and reasonable terms for a broad agreement.id.
on august,the licensing meeting was held.jorgenson,two st licensing attorneys,and three technical experts retained by st to perform the infringement analyses of sandisk products,attended on behalf of thompson and an engineer attended on behalf of sandisk.at the meeting,jorgenson requested that the parties discussions be treated as settlement discussions under federal rule of evidence sandisk,slip op.at.st then presented a slide show which compared statistics regarding sandisk and st patent portfolios,revenue,and research and development expenses,and listed sandisk various unlicensed activities.id.this slide show was followed by a four to presentation by st technical experts,during which they identified and discussed the specific claims of each patent and alleged that they were infringed by sandisk.according to thompson,the presentation by st technical experts included mapp ing the elements of each of the allegedly infringed claims to the aspects of the accused sandisk products alleged to practice the elements.id.thompson declares that the experts liberally referred to sandisk alleged infringement of st products,slip op.at.sandisk engineer then made a presentation,describing several of sandisk patents and analyzing how a semiconductor chip product sold by st infringes,slip op.at.
at the end of the meeting,jorgenson handed thompson a packet of materials containing,for each of st fourteen patents under discussion,a copy of the patent,reverse engineering reports for certain of sandisk products,and diagrams showing how elements of st patent claims cover sandisk products.according to sandisk,jorgenson indicated in words to this effect 
i know that this is material that would allow sandisk to dj st on.we have had some internal discussions on whether i should be giving you a copy of these materials in light of that fact.but i have decided that i will go ahead and give you these materials.
id.jorgenson further told thompson that st has absolutely no plan whatsoever to sue sandisk.id.thompson responded to jorgenson that sandisk is not going to sue you on monday and that another meeting might be appropriate.id.
on september,jorgenson wrote to thompson,enclosing copies of st general slide presentation from the august meeting and also enclosing a hard copy booklet containing each of the engineering reports for each claim on all products where st demonstrated coverage by the st patents sic.letter from jorgenson to thompson.jorgenson requested that sandisk provide st with a copy of sandisk presentation and information about the three sandisk patents presented.on september,thompson replied by,confirming receipt of the package from st,attaching a copy of sandisk presentation,indicating it was his personal feeling that we have got to trust one another during these negotiations,and seeking a agreement.sandisk,slip op.at from thompson to jorgenson.thompson also wrote i still owe you the rates quoted.id.
on september,thompson again corresponded with jorgenson,this time by letter,enclosing a confidential version of sandisk cross licensing offer,which noted that the offer would expire on september.sandisk,slip op.at letter from thompson to jorgenson.jorgenson destroyed this confidential offer and did not retain a copy,and,on september,sent thompson an requesting that a version be sent for st consideration.sandisk,slip op.at from jorgenson to thompson.sandisk refused to send a version.instead,on september,thompson offered to send another confidential version,or to communicate the offer orally.from thompson to jorgenson.thompson also indicated that sandisk did not need additional information regarding st patents because sandisk was quite comfortable with its position and that it was time to let our business people talk and see if a peaceful resolution is possible.id.on september,jorgenson repeated her request for a written version of sandisk licensing offer.sandisk,slip op.at from jorgenson to thompson.the following day,thompson jorgenson another confidential version of sandisk offer.sandisk,slip op.at.
on october,after several further and phone calls between the business representatives trying to establish another meeting,sandisk filed the instant lawsuit.sandisk alleged infringement of one of its patents and sought a declaratory judgment of noninfringement and invalidity of the fourteen st patents that had been discussed during the cross licensing negotiations.on december,st filed a motion to dismiss sandisk declaratory judgment claims for lack of subject matter jurisdiction,maintaining that there was no actual controversy at the time sandisk filed its complaint.
the district court granted st motion to dismiss,holding that no actual controversy existed for purposes of the declaratory judgment act because sandisk did not have an objectively reasonable apprehension of suit,even though it may have subjectively believed that st would bring an infringement suit.see,slip op.at.the district court reasoned that sandisk has presented no evidence that st threatened it with litigation at any time during the parties negotiations,nor has sandisk shown other conduct by st rising to a level sufficient to indicate an intent on the part of st to initiate an infringement action.id.the district court found that the studied and determined infringement analyses that st presented to sandisk did not constitute the requisite express charges of infringement carrying with them the threat of enforcement,slip op.at.the district court also found that the totality of the circumstances did not evince an actual controversy because st told sandisk that it did not intend to sue sandisk for infringement,slip op.at.in a footnote,the court indicated that,as an alternative basis for its ruling,even if it did have jurisdiction,it would exercise its discretion and decline to hear the case,slip op.at.
sandisk appealed the dismissal to this court.we have jurisdiction pursuant to a.
ii.discussion 
standard of review 
for purposes of article iii,this court reviews a dismissal of a patent claim for lack of an actual controversy upon a particular set of facts as a question of law subject to plenary appellate review.arrowhead indus.water,ecolochem.this court reviews the underlying factual findings for clear error.vysis.
sandisk argues that the district court erred as a matter of law by requiring an express accusation of patent infringement coupled with an explicit threat of judicial enforcement to support declaratory judgment jurisdiction,and that,under the correct legal standard articulated by this court in arrowhead,at,the facts of this case illustrate that sandisk apprehension of an infringement suit was objectively reasonable.sandisk asserts that the infringement analysis presented by st and its experts at the august,licensing meeting constituted an allegation of infringement and that the totality of the circumstances shows that st conduct gave rise to an actual case or controversy.sandisk further points out that negotiations regarding licensing had ceased by the time sandisk filed its claims for declaratory judgment.
st counters that the district court applied the correct legal standard and argues that sandisk ignores the line of cases that have followed and interpreted arrowhead.st asserts that the cases following arrowhead reveal that the bare mention of infringement,particularly during license negotiations,is not sufficient to meet the standard set forth in arrowhead.st asserts that its conduct at the august,licensing meeting was to strengthen its position during licensing negotiations and that,under the totality of the circumstances,sandisk has not shown that st conduct gave rise to declaratory judgment jurisdiction.moreover,st argues that the district court did not abuse its discretion when it concluded,as an alternative basis for its ruling,that it would exercise discretion to decline to decide sandisk claims.
case or controversy 
the first question we address is whether the facts alleged in this case show that there is a case or controversy within the meaning of the declaratory judgment act,a.
the declaratory judgment act provides,in relevant part,that 
i n a case of actual controversy within its jurisdiction any court of the united states,upon the filing of an appropriate pleading,may declare the rights and other legal relations of any interested party seeking such declaration,whether or not further relief is or could be sought.
a.the actual controversy requirement of the declaratory judgment act is rooted in article iii of the constitution,which provides for federal jurisdiction over only cases and controversies.thus,our jurisdiction extends only to matters that are article iii cases or controversies.
the supreme court,in the context of a patent license dispute,recently examined article iii case or controversy requirement as it relates to the declaratory judgment act.see medimmune,genentech,d.in medimmune,the supreme court considered whether article iii limitation of federal courts jurisdiction to cases and controversies,reflected in the actual controversy requirement of the declaratory judgment act,a,requires a patent licensee to terminate or be in breach of its license agreement before it can seek a declaratory judgment that the underlying patent is invalid,unenforceable,or not infringed.id.at.
the supreme court began its analysis 
with the recognition that,where threatened action by government is concerned,the court do es not require a plaintiff to expose himself to liability before bringing suit to challenge the basis for the example,the constitutionality of a law threatened to be enforced.the plaintiff own action or inaction in failing to violate the law eliminates the imminent threat of prosecution,but nonetheless does not eliminate article iii jurisdiction.
id.at.the supreme court quoted its earlier decision in maryland casualty pacific coal oil,where the court stated that the question in each case is whether the facts alleged,under all the circumstances,show that there is a substantial controversy,between parties having adverse legal interests,of sufficient immediacy and reality to warrant the issuance of a declaratory judgment.medimmune.at.the supreme court emphasized that article iii requires that the dispute at issue be definite and concrete,touching the legal relations of parties having adverse legal interests and that it be real and substantial and admi t of specific relief through a decree of a conclusive character,as distinguished from an opinion advising what the law would be upon a hypothetical state of facts.id.quoting aetna life ins.haworth.the supreme court stated that,when faced with a genuine threat of enforcement that the government will penalize a certain private action,article iii d oes not require,as a prerequisite to testing the validity of the law in a suit for injunction,that the plaintiff bet the farm,so to speak,by taking the violative action.id.at citations omitted.as the supreme court noted,the declaratory judgment procedure is an alternative to pursuit of the arguably illegal activity.id.quotation marks omitted.the supreme court clarified that,although a declaratory judgment plaintiff may eliminate an imminent threat of harm by simply not doing what he claimed the right to do,t hat did not preclude jurisdiction where the behavior was effectively coerced.id.the dilemma posed by that the challenger to the choice between abandoning his rights or risking a dilemma that it was the very purpose of the declaratory judgment act to ameliorate.id.at internal quotation marks omitted.
the supreme court then applied these principles to the facts of the case and remarked that the requirements of a case or controversy are met where payment of a claim is demanded as of right and where payment is made,but where the involuntary or coercive nature of the exaction preserves the right to recover the sums paid or to challenge the legality of the claim.id.internal quotation marks omitted.the supreme court held that t he rule that a plaintiff must destroy a large building,bet the farm,or as here risk treble damages and the loss of percent of its business,before seeking a declaration of its actively contested legal rights finds no support in article iii.id.at.
with regard to patent disputes,prior to medimmune,this court articulated a test that first considers whether conduct by the patentee creates a reasonable apprehension on the part of the declaratory judgment plaintiff that it will face an infringement suit,and second examines whether conduct by the declaratory judgment plaintiff amounts to infringing activity or demonstrates concrete steps taken with the intent to conduct such activity.see arrowhead,at.the supreme court,in medimmune,addressed the reasonable apprehension of suit aspect of this court test and concluded that it conflicts with aetna life insurance and maryland casualty,and is in tension with cardinal chemical morton international,d.see medimmune.at.
in aetna life insurance,an insurer sought a declaratory judgment that the insured was not relieved of his duty to continue to pay insurance premiums and that,since the insured had stopped making the payments,the insurance policy had lapsed.in that case,the supreme court first upheld the constitutionality of the federal declaratory judgment act.at.the supreme court then held that,although the insured party gave no indication that he would file suit,id.at,the case nevertheless presented a controversy under article iii because the parties had taken adverse positions with regard to their obligations,each side presenting a concrete claim of a specific insured claiming that he had become disabled and therefore was relieved of making insurance premium payments and the insurer claiming that the insured was not disabled and that the failure to make payments caused the policy to lapse,id.at.similarly,in maryland casualty,the declaratory judgment plaintiff,an insurance company which had agreed to indemnify and defend the insured against actions brought by third parties against the insured,sought a declaration that it had no duty to defend or to indemnify the insured.at.in that case,the insured could not have sued the declaratory judgment plaintiff without first obtaining a judgment against the third party and the underlying action against the third party a pparently ha d not proceeded to judgment.id.at.nevertheless,the supreme court held that i t is clear that there is an actual controversy between petitioner and the insured since the insured was in the process of seeking a judgment and had a statutory right to proceed against the declaratory judgment plaintiff if such judgment were obtained and not satisfied.id.at.finally,in cardinal chemical,the supreme court held that this court affirmance of a judgment of noninfringement does not necessarily moot a declaratory judgment counterclaim of patent invalidity.at.the supreme court rationale for holding that the declaratory judgment action can proceed consistent with article iii was that a contrary result would create the potential for relitigation or uncertainty with regard to the validity of patents and would be contrary to laboratories,university of illinois foundation,d.
the supreme court opinion in medimmune represents a rejection of our reasonable apprehension of suit test the court first noted that the continuation of royalty payments makes what would otherwise be an imminent threat at least remote,if not nonexistent petitioner own acts,in other words,eliminate the imminent threat of harm.medimmune.at.the court nonetheless concluded that declaratory judgment jurisdiction existed relying in particular on its earlier decision in altvater freeman.there,the patentee brought suit to enjoin patent infringement,and the accused infringer filed declaratory judgment counterclaims of invalidity.the district court found that there was no infringement and that the patent was invalid.id.at.the appellate court affirmed the finding of noninfringement but vacated the finding of invalidity as moot.id.the supreme court held that the declaratory judgment counterclaims were not mooted by the finding of noninfringement.id.at.in finding declaratory judgment jurisdiction in medimmune,the court specifically addressed and rejected our reasonable apprehension test 
e ven if altvater could be distinguished as an injunction case,it would still contradict the federal circuit reasonable apprehension of suit test or,in its evolved form,the reasonable apprehension of imminent suit test,teva pharm.usa,pfizer.a licensee who pays royalties under compulsion of an injunction has no more apprehension of imminent harm than a licensee who pays royalties for fear of treble damages and an injunction fatal to his business.the test also conflicts with our decisions in maryland casualty pacific coal oil,where jurisdiction obtained even though the defendant could not have sued the without first obtaining a judgment against the insured and aetna life ins.haworth,where jurisdiction obtained even though the very reason the insurer sought declaratory relief was that the insured had given no indication that he would file suit.it is also in tension with cardinal chemical morton int l,d,which held that appellate affirmance of a judgment of noninfringement,eliminating any apprehension of suit,does not moot a declaratory judgment counterclaim of patent invalidity.
medimmune.at.
the supreme court in medimmune addressed declaratory judgment jurisdiction in the context of a signed license.in the context of conduct prior to the existence of a license,declaratory judgment jurisdiction generally will not arise merely on the basis that a party learns of the existence of a patent owned by another or even perceives such a patent to pose a risk of infringement,without some affirmative act by the patentee.but article iii jurisdiction may be met where the patentee takes a position that puts the declaratory judgment plaintiff in the position of either pursuing arguably illegal behavior or abandoning that which he claims a right to do.we need not define the outer boundaries of declaratory judgment jurisdiction,which will depend on the application of the principles of declaratory judgment jurisdiction to the facts and circumstances of each case.we hold only that where a patentee asserts rights under a patent based on certain identified ongoing or planned activity of another party,and where that party contends that it has the right to engage in the accused activity without license,an article iii case or controversy will arise and the party need not risk a suit for infringement by engaging in the identified activity before seeking a declaration of its legal rights.see id.contra cygnus therapeutics alza,holding that declaratory judgment jurisdiction was not supported where the patentee does nothing more than exercise its lawful commercial prerogatives and,in so doing,puts a competitor in the position of having to choose between abandoning a particular business venture or bringing matters to a head by engaging in arguably infringing activity.
our holding is consistent with decisions of other courts in various cases unrelated to patent licensing.see,bancroft masters,augusta,cir finding declaratory judgment jurisdiction based on trademark owner cease and desist letter despite the fact that trademark owner offered to waive all trademark infringement and related claims gnb battery,gould,cir finding declaratory judgment jurisdiction where declaratory judgment plaintiff filed action in anticipation of potential action by the defendant based on new legislation although the defendant had not indicated whether or when it may act kunkel cont l cas,cir affirming exercise of declaratory judgment jurisdiction over suit seeking declaratory judgment for determination of value of insurance coverage even though existence of coverage remained dependent upon the outcome of a collateral action and noting that t he contingent nature of the right or obligation in controversy will not bar a litigant from seeking declaratory relief when the circumstances reveal a need for present adjudication see also ims health,vality tech,d holding that requirements for declaratory judgment jurisdiction were satisfied where copyright holder had not indicated it was going to file suit but had taken positions and made demands such that the declaratory judgment plaintiff justifiably believed that copyright holder might take such action in the future and noting that i t is quite possible for two parties to simultaneously consider nonlitigious settlement of a dispute,while at the same time maintaining a
