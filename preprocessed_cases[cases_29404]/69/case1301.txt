a jury in district court found that defendant nycomed amersham had wrongfully terminated the employment of plaintiff jeffrey freund for making safety complaints,thereby committing the california tort of wrongful termination in violation of public policy.the jury awarded compensatory damages of and punitive damages of.the district court overturned the jury award of punitive damages,granting nycomed judgment as a matter of law on that issue.
nycomed now appeals the judgment of compensatory damages,and freund appeals the order overturning the award of punitive damages.we affirm the judgment for compensatory damages and reverse the order overturning the punitive damages as a matter of law we remand for the district court to rule on nycomed motion for a new trial on the issue of punitive damages.
factual background 
in,freund was hired by nycomed as a pharmacist in nycomed nuclear pharmacy in san diego freund was hired by mike wakefield,who remained his supervisor for the entire term of his employment.freund eventually was appointed a radiation safety officer with responsibility for safety compliance at the san diego pharmacy.the san diego pharmacy for which freund worked was operated by,which is a subsidiary of nycomed.
after a few years,the relationship between wakefield and freund soured.they disagreed on a number of issues,including the office temperature,the proper handling of laboratory equipment,and the company work scheduling policies.freund lodged complaints about staffing,expressing his concern that overwork of staff members increased the probability that they would make mistakes that endangered their safety and that of their customers.on one occasion,another employee,mike thomas,reported to freund that he had seen wakefield pierce his hand with a needle while preparing a radiopharmaceutical kit,causing blood to spill in the laboratory.freund claimed that wakefield never reported the incident as he was required to do.freund also accused wakefield of unfairly reprimanding thomas for bringing the needle matter to freund attention.
wakefield subsequently gave freund a negative performance evaluation and a written warning for having an improper attitude and for failing to act as a positive example for other employees.the next day,a telephone conference was held between freund,wakefield,rich de veau,nycomed director of pharmaceutical operations,and karen mertins,nycomed human resources representative.wakefield and de veau admonished freund for his aggressive and confrontational attitude.after the conversation,de veau placed freund on ninety days probation for his poor attitude and his failure to develop a better working relationship with wakefield.
shortly thereafter,freund sent wakefield several messages reiterating his earlier complaints and accusing wakefield of opening his mail.wakefield responded and then forwarded the entire correspondence to mertins and de veau.de veau decided to terminate freund employment,and a letter was sent by human relations director vinci to freund terminating freund services with nycomed due to disruptive behavior.
proceedings in the district court 
freund filed a complaint alleging that he was wrongfully terminated in violation of public policy freund asserted that the public policy that was violated by his firing was expressed in california labor code which prohibits an employer from terminating an employee for raising bona fide complaints relating to workplace health or safety.freund sought both compensatory and punitive damages.
the case proceeded to trial,and at the conclusion of the evidentiary phase,nycomed moved for judgment as a matter of law,pursuant to federal rule of civil procedure a,solely on the ground that freund complaints did not implicate any public policy that could give rise to a wrongful termination claim.the court denied the motion,and the jury returned a verdict in favor of freund.the jury awarded freund in emotional distress damages,in compensatory damages,and in punitive damages.
following the trial,nycomed filed a motion for judgment as a matter of law,pursuant to rule b,in which it reiterated the argument from its earlier rule a motion and also raised a new argument that the punitive damages award should be overturned because freund did not prove that either de veau or vinci acted with malicious intent in terminating him.nycomed also moved for a new trial pursuant to federal rule of civil procedure.the district court granted in part nycomed motion for judgment as a matter of law,overturning the jury award of punitive damages,but upholding the jury verdict that freund was wrongfully terminated in violation of public policy.the court denied nycomed motion for a new trial.both parties then appealed.
nycomed appeal 
ability of to support a claim for wrongful termination 
unless the parties contract otherwise,employment relationships in california are ordinarily at will,meaning that an employer can discharge an employee for any reason.see cal.labor code.in tameny atlantic richfield,cal d,the california supreme court carved out an exception to the rule by recognizing a tort cause of action for wrongful terminations that violate public policy.see id.at,at.more recently,that court elaborated on its meaning of public policy sufficient to support a wrongful termination claim.the public policy must be delineated in either constitutional or statutory provisions public in the sense that it inures to the benefit of the public rather than serving merely the interests of the individual well established at the time of discharge and substantial and fundamental.city of moorpark superior court,cal th,d,internal quotation omitted.
nycomed contends that does not meet these requirements,particularly the requirement that it embody a fundamental public policy.we reject the contention because the california courts have long held to the contrary.in hentzel singer,d,the court of appeal held that embodies a public policy against retaliatory firings,and that violation of could serve as the basis for a claim of wrongful termination in violation of public policy.see id.at.
nycomed argues that hentzel is no longer good law in light of intervening decisions by the california supreme court.nycomed relies particularly on foley interactive data,cal d,which ruled that discharge of an employee for reporting an employer embezzlement did not give rise to a claim for discharge in violation of public policy,and on gantt sentry,cal th,d,overruled on other grounds by green ralee eng g,cal th,d,which ruled that the requisite public policy must be clearly articulated in a statute or constitutional provision.the flaw in nycomed argument is that both foley and gantt cite hentzel as an example of a situation in which a plaintiff can raise a wrongful termination claim because a public policy was violated.see foley,cal d at,citing hentzel for the proposition that an employee fired for disclos ing other illegal,unethical,or unsafe practices can bring a wrongful termination claim gantt,cal th at,d,citing hentzel as an example of a wrongful termination in violation of public policy for reporting an alleged violation of a statute of public importance.furthermore,california appellate courts have continued to find that a violation of gives rise to a wrongful termination tort action even after the supreme court decisions in foley and gantt.see,taylor lockheed martin,th,d a private cause of action for retaliatory discharge under labor code section is part of california statutory scheme for occupational safety.cabesuela,th,d barton new united motor,th,d an employer who fires an employee in retaliation for protesting unsafe working conditions violates fundamental public policy citations omitted thus,hentzel and its progeny appear still to be good law in california notwithstanding the decisions in foley and gantt 
in a variation of its argument that can not support a tort action,nycomed contends that,because administrative remedies are provided for violations of,they are exclusive.the california courts have rejected this view,see,stevenson superior court,cal th,d,and we accordingly do so as well.
whether employee complaints must be shown to involve an actual and identifiable health or safety violation 
nycomed next argument is that,in evaluating freund claim for wrongful termination based on a violation of,the district court was required to determine whether the substance of freund complaints demonstrated the violation of a health or safety rule elsewhere set forth.we reject this argument as well it is sufficient that freund complaints fell within the ambit of.
the public policy behind is not merely to aid the reporting of actual safety violations,as nycomed seems to assume it is also to prevent retaliation against those who in good faith report working conditions they believe to be unsafe.see,skillsky lucky stores,at the public policy at stake here also involves protecting the right of employees to voice their dissatisfaction with working conditions.quoting hentzel,d at.foley,cal d at,noting interest in protecting employees who disclose unsafe working conditions.as long as the employee makes the health or safety complaint in good faith,it does not matter for purposes of a wrongful termination action whether the complaint identifies an actual violation of other workplace safety statutes or regulations.see cabesuela,th at,d.nycomed argument would add a requirement that california law simply does not support.
whether damages are limited to those specified in 
the california supreme court has made it clear that damages for wrongful discharge in violation of public policy are not limited to those specified in the underlying statute that was violated.in rojo kliger,cal d,two employees brought an action for wrongful discharge,and an action under the fair employment and housing act feha,for sexual harassment.the court held that the plaintiffs tort remedies were not limited to the remedies provided under feha,even though feha was the statute used to establish the public policy basis for the wrongful termination claim.see id.at.the plaintiffs therefore could seek punitive damages on their tort theory,even though feha did not allow for a punitive damage recovery.see id.at.even closer to the point,in hentzel the court held that wrongful termination actions under are not limited to remedies.see hentzel,d at.holding that remedies were not intended to be exclusive see also daly exxon,th,d had exxon fired,discharged,or terminated daly before the contract expired because she complained about unsafe working conditions,she could have sued for wrongful discharge in addition to statutory damages.citations omitted.
nycomed contends that these cases are undermined by moorpark,in which the california supreme court stated that when the constitutional provision or statute articulating a public policy also includes certain substantive limitations in scope or remedy,these limitations also circumscribe the common law wrongful discharge cause of action.stated another way,the common law cause of action can not be broader than the constitutional provision or statute on which it depends moorpark,cal th at,d.seizing upon this language,nycomed argues that freund damages are limited to that provided by pay and reinstatement.all other relief,argues nycomed,including front pay,emotional damages,and punitive damages,must be overturned because it is not authorized explicitly by.
nycomed argument is unpersuasive.moorpark does not refer to either rojo or hentzel in the two sentences of the decision relied on by nycomed,and it is unlikely that the moorpark court intended to overturn those decisions by a casual turn of phrase.second,both rojo and hentzel grounded their decisions in the maxim that where a statutory remedy is provided for a preexisting common law right,the newer remedy is generally considered to be cumulative,and the older remedy may be pursued at the plaintiff election.rojo,cal d at,citations omitted.moorpark never took issue with this principle.the existence of an independent tort remedy for wrongful discharge based upon,but not limited by,is too firmly established in california case law for us to accept moorpark two sentences as implicitly overturning that established law.
judgment as a matter of law overturning the punitive damages award 
freund argues that the district court erred in granting nycomed motion for judgment as a matter of law with regard to punitive damages because nycomed failed to move for such relief at the close of the evidence.we conclude that freund is correct 
federal rule of civil procedure a permits a party to move for judgment as a matter of law after the opposing party has been fully heard and prior to the submission of the case to the jury.a.if such a motion made at the close of all the evidence is denied,rule b allows the moving party to renew its motion within ten days after the court entry of final judgment in the case.b.a party can not raise arguments in its motion for judgment as a matter of law under rule b that it did not raise in its rule a motion.see advisory comm.notes to the amendments.a post trial motion for judgment can be granted only on grounds advanced in the motion.murphy city of long beach,cir judgment notwithstanding the verdict is improper if based upon grounds not alleged in a directed verdict motion.the purpose of this rule is twofold.first it preserves the sufficiency of the evidence as a question of law,allowing the district court to review its initial denial of judgment as a matter of law instead of forcing it to engage in an impermissible reexamination of facts found by the jury.lifshitz walter drake sons,cir.second,it calls to the court and the parties attention any alleged deficiencies in the evidence at a time when the opposing party still has an opportunity to correct them.see id.at.
the district court judgment as a matter of law defeated both of these purposes.the judgment was granted on the ground that there had been insufficient evidence of malice on the part of nycomed managing agents.that ruling necessarily redetermined a fact found by the jury.and because there had been no motion for judgment as a matter of law at the close of the evidence,freund was deprived of the opportunity to introduce further evidence to remedy any deficiencies in its showing of malice.the judgment as a matter of law therefore violated rule and must be reversed.
the district court recognized that nycomed had not raised insufficiency of evidence of malice in its rule a motion at the close of the evidence,and that rule would normally preclude nycomed from raising it after judgment.it noted,however,that under california law the appealability of punitive damage awards is not waivable.see adams murakami,cal d.the district court accordingly entertained nycomed challenge and granted its motion.
we conclude that the district court erred in permitting california law to trump federal rule.under the rule of erie tompkins,federal courts sitting in diversity jurisdiction apply state substantive law and federal procedural law.gasperini center for humanities,d.
a special case arises when the federal law is embodied in a federal rule of civil procedure.in that situation,the federal rule must be applied if it does not abridge,enlarge,or modify any substantive right in violation of the rules enabling act.see see also hanna plumer,d.
the california rule that collides with federal rule in this case is not a substantive rule that would be modified by the application of the federal rule.the rule set forth by the california supreme court in adams does not in itself create any substantive right.it does not add,subtract,or define any of the elements necessary to justify punitive damages it merely establishes when and how those substantive rules can be reviewed.thus,in overriding the california rule,federal rule does not run afoul of the rules enabling act,because its application affects only the process of enforcing litigants rights and not the rights themselves.burlington woods,d see also donovan penn shipping,d question whether acceptance of remittitur waives right to appeal is question of federal,not state law,involving the proper role of the trial and appellate courts in the federal system neifeld steinberg,cir federal law determines whether assertion of counterclaim waives challenges to personal jurisdiction rule accordingly governs.
it is true that california rule has its roots in the state public policy.in setting forth the rule in adams,the california supreme court stated that the primary interest that must be protected is the public interest in punitive damage awards in appropriate amounts.we can not allow the public interest to be thwarted by a defendant oversight or trial tactics.cal d at,at emphasis in original.but procedural rules commonly have a basis in public policy.a state standard of review,for example,doubtless reflects state policy concerns about the desirability of appellate oversight for particular issues.yet it is well established that rules regarding the appropriate standard of review,or even the availability of review at all,to be applied by a federal court sitting in diversity,are questions of federal law.see,indus.kelco disposal,d othman globe indemnity,cir applying,as a court sitting in diversity,a federal standard of review to a directed verdict motion felder united states,cir applying federal law to review an award of damages made pursuant to state law.thus the mere fact that california rule concerning punitive damages is rooted in public policy does not render it substantive for purposes of our analysis.see hanna,at.importance of rule to state is relevant only to determine whether refusal to apply rule would encourage or unfairly discriminate against state citizens.we adhere,therefore,to our conclusion that california rule is procedural and must yield to federal rule.the district court therefore erred in ruling that nycomed could raise the issue of requisite malice in its rule b motion 
excessiveness of punitive damages award because of lack of proper evidence of defendants financial condition 
nycomed also challenges the punitive damage award as excessive on the ground that freund failed to submit appropriate evidence regarding the defendants financial condition nycomed first invokes tomaselli transamerica ins,th,d,and argues that the jury improperly relied on evidence of the net worth of nycomed amersham,the parent company of,even though freund was an employee of.see id.at,d finding it improper to consider evidence of the financial condition of a parent company where the parent was neither a named defendant nor the entity committing misconduct.here,the jury appropriately considered evidence relating to nycomed amersham rather than to.nycomed amersham was named as a defendant from the beginning of the litigation,and the officers whom the jury found acted with malice,de veau and vinci,were employees of nycomed,not.
nycomed second argument,which it raised for the first time at oral argument,is that the jury improperly considered evidence concerning the financial condition of the british nycomed amersham rather than the delaware nycomed amersham.at oral argument,counsel pointed out that there are two corporate entities which use the name nycomed amersham a parent company based in the united kingdom and a subsidiary based in delaware.counsel asserted that,although the delaware nycomed is the defendant in the case,the jury heard evidence only about the net worth of the british entity.because the british entity is neither a defendant nor the entity that committed misconduct,nycomed contends that the evidence presented to the jury can not provide the basis for a punitive damage award.we reject this contention.
first,nycomed failed to clarify any misunderstanding caused by the introduction of evidence concerning the british nycomed.the only party at the punitive damages hearing that was in a position to rectify the understandable confusion resulting from the existence of two different companies sharing an identical name was nycomed,yet it never objected to the introduction of the evidence that it now claims is improper.therefore,there was no reason for anyone at the proceeding to question the validity of the evidence.
in any event,there was enough evidence in the record concerning the financial condition of the delaware nycomed to support the jury punitive damage award.a financial statement introduced at the hearing on punitive damages indicated that nycomed north american operations,of which the delaware nycomed presumably comprised a substantial part,had an operating profit of.that amount is sufficient to support a punitive damage award of 
denial of motion for new trial 
in its motions,nycomed requested the district court to order a new trial pursuant to rule of the federal rules of civil procedure nycomed motion urged a new trial on two grounds that it had also urged in support of its motion for judgment as a matter of law insufficiency of evidence of malice,and insufficiency of evidence of the financial condition of nycomed.the district court denied the motion in so doing,the district court stated that b ecause the court has already vacated the punitive damages award,the court need not address defendants argument that a new trial should be granted on the ground that the punitive damages award was excessive.nycomed argues that,having reversed the judgment as a matter of law,we should now remand so the district court can address the arguments for a new trial that it did not reach.we conclude that nycomed contention has merit.
the district court should not have declined to reach the motion for new trial on punitive damages on the ground that it had already granted judgment as a matter of law on that issue.rule c of the federal rules of civil procedure requires a district court granting a judgment as a matter of law also to rule on whether to grant a new trial in the event the judgment as a matter of law is reversed on appeal.the efficiency of such a rule is apparent here if the district court had entered such a ruling,we could review it as part of this appeal.
when a district court fails to enter a rule c conditional order on a new trial motion,we have discretion to either remand to the district court to let it decide the new trial motion or to decide the new trial motion ourselves.acosta city and county of san francisco,cir see also gordon mailloux,firemen ins,cir.in the present case,we exercise our discretion to remand so that the district court can address the motion in the first instance.the district court is most familiar with the context of the trial,and enjoys broad discretion with regard to a new trial motion.see murphy,at.we elect not to exercise that discretion for the district court.
we reject freund contention that nycomed has waived its right to a new trial motion.unlike a motion for judgment as a matter of law,a motion for new trial does not have to be preceded by a rule a motion prior to submission of the case to the jury.see williams fenix scisson,cir holding that failure to move for directed verdict nullifies a motion for judgment notwithstanding the verdict,but leaves open for review a motion for new trial see also farley transp.santa fe transp,cir gilchrist jim slemons imports,cir 
we also reject freund contention that nycomed waived its right to a new trial by not drawing the district court attention to its failure to make a conditional ruling as required by rule c.freund relies on arenson southern.law,clarified,cir,which held that a litigant who fails to secure a rule c conditional ruling in the district court loses the right to a new trial if the judgment as a matter of law is reversed.with all due respect to our sister circuit,we decline to follow its rule.our decisions in acosta and gordon mailloux suggested no such limitation on our discretion to remand for the district court to address a motion for new trial after failing to make a conditional ruling under rule c.moreover,in the present case the district court actually did enter an order denying new trial it was only in a footnote to its decision that the court indicated that it had found it unnecessary to address the new trial contentions because of its decision to grant judgment as a matter of law.nycomed appealed from the order denying a new trial and raised the issue at the first appropriate point in its appellate briefs.we conclude that there was no waiver,and we accordingly remand the matter to the district court so that it may address a renewed motion for new trial on punitive damages.
denial of attorneys fees 
freund argues that the district court erred by not awarding him attorneys fees pursuant to cal.labor code.nycomed argues that is an indemnification statute that does not apply to this case.we agree with nycomed.
california labor code states that a n employer shall indemnify his or her employee for all necessary expenditures or losses incurred by the employee in direct consequence of the discharge of his or her duties cal.labor code a.the statute defines necessary expenditures to include attorney fees incurred by the employee enforcing the rights granted by this section.cal.labor code c.
section does not authorize freund to receive attorney fees.as the language of the statute makes clear,is designed to indemnify employees for their legal defense costs when they are sued for actions arising out of their employment.see,devereaux latham watkins,th,d jacobus krambo,th,d.it does not require an employer to pay the fees to support an employee affirmative litigation against the employer.indeed,freund does not cite a single case in which the court interpreted to authorize attorneys fees in this context we affirm the district court denial of attorneys fees under.
conclusion 
the district court judgment awarding compensatory damages is affirmed.its order setting aside punitive damages is reversed and the matter is remanded for the district court to address a renewed motion by nycomed for a new trial on the issue of punitive damages.the district court denial of attorneys fees for freund under is affirmed.
the parties will bear their own costs on appeal.
main appeal affirmed.
affirmed in part reversed in part remanded.
a primary interest that must be protected is the public interest in punitive damage awards in appropriate amounts.we can not allow the public interest to be thwarted by a defendant oversight or trial tactics.adams murakami,cal d,emphasis in the original.
a decision to punish a tortfeasor by means of an exaction of exemplary damages is an exercise of state power that must comply with the due process clause of the fourteenth amendment.the commonlaw practice,the strong presumption favoring judicial review that we have applied in other areas of the law,and elementary justice all support the conclusion that such a decision should not be committed to the unreviewable discretion of the jury.honda oberg,d.
the majority reverses the district court order overturning as a matter of law punitive damages awarded to freund.these punitive damages,in my view,were correctly stricken by the district court on motion because of lack of evidence of malice.the majority errs in reinstating these punitive damages even though subject to the district court decision on remand about new trial on punitive damages 
the majority decision is based on the requirement of rule b of the federal rules of civil procedure that a motion for relief must state the same grounds for relief as the litigant.a directed verdict motion in so doing,my colleagues expand the scope of a federal court power in a diversity action beyond permissible bounds,produce a result that is contrary to both adams and the due process clause of the fourteenth amendment,and create a circuit split in the process.see simmons city of philadelphia,cir becker,applying pennsylvania substantive rule preventing waiver of municipalities sovereign immunity and allowing municipality to raise sovereign immunity in b motion notwithstanding failure of municipality to raise immunity in a motion.
i agree with the majority that freund compensatory damage award against nycomed amersham nycomed should be upheld.i also agree with the majority that federal waiver precepts under the literal terms of rule conflict with california law,preventing waiver of judicial review of punitive damages.however,i respectfully dissent from the majority apparent view that california rule preventing waiver of judicial review of punitive damages,and the fourteenth amendment due process protection requiring meaningful judicial review of punitive damage awards,succumb to rule waiver requirement.in my view,the substantive interests of california and the protections of due process require that we sustain the district court rejection of punitive damages that were inconsistent with california law,despite the apparent conflict with rule,because there is no evidence that nycomed acted with malice.
the complexities of rules in federal diversity actions took an important turn in erie tompkins,which overturned swift tyson,pet,and held that federal courts sitting in diversity must apply state law to resolve substantive issues,but apply federal law to resolve procedural issues.erie tompkins.
erie established the basis for the result in ragan merch.transfer warehouse,a case applying the erie doctrine to the federal rules of civil procedure.in ragan,the plaintiff filed a complaint in federal court on september,arising from an accident that occurred on october,and served the defendant on december,notwithstanding a kansas statute which provided 
an action shall be deemed commenced within the meaning of the statute of limitations,as to each defendant,at the date of the summons which is served on him an attempt to commence an action shall be deemed equivalent to the commencement thereof within the meaning of this article when the party faithfully,properly and diligently endeavors to procure a service but such attempt must be followed by the first publication or service of the summons within sixty days.ragan,at.quoting.
the defendant moved for summary judgment on the ground that service had not been made within either the limitations period or the period for service after filing required by kansas law.id.at.the plaintiff defended on the ground that rule of the federal rules of civil procedure provided that an action in federal court commenced upon the filing of the complaint in federal court.id.at.despite rule,the supreme court dismissed the action,relying on the erie doctrine and concluding that a cause of action could not have a longer life in the federal court than it would have had in the state court,and that the state service of summons statute controlled because it was an integral part of the state statute of limitations.id.at.
ragan was not the last word on the interplay between the federal rules of civil procedure and state law in diversity actions.in hanna plumer,d,the supreme court clarified the erie doctrine application to the federal rules of civil procedure.the supreme court held that the first inquiry was whether the federal rule of civil procedure is sufficiently broad that it creates a direct collision with state law,thereby leaving no room for the operation of that law.hanna,at.see also burlington woods,d explaining hanna.if the federal rule of civil procedure is applicable,then it applies regardless of any contravening state law,so long as the federal rule complies with the requirements of both the rules enabling act and the constitution.hanna,at.t he court has been instructed to apply the federal rule,and can refuse to do so only if the advisory committee,this court,and congress erred in their prima facie judgment that the rule in question transgresses neither the terms of the enabling act nor constitutional restrictions.see also gasperini ctr.for the humanities,d concerning matters covered by the federal rules of civil procedure,the characterization question is usually unproblematic it is settled that if the rule in point is consonant with the rules enabling act,and the constitution,the federal rule applies regardless of contrary state law.vess.usa,cir in other words,if a federal rule of civil procedure is valid under the constitution and the enabling act,it applies according to its terms in all civil cases in federal district court.
because the application of rule here to deny a defendant judicial review of a punitive damages award would exceed the scope of the authority granted to the courts under the rules enabling act and would be contrary to the constitution,i conclude that we must allow judicial review of punitive damages.
although as yet no federal rule of civil procedure has been wholly invalidated because of the enabling act or the constitution rules including rule have been narrowed by federal courts to avoid abridging substantive rights.see ragan,at.narrowing rule walker armco steel,d narrowing rule simmons,at narrowing rule to avoid abridging state rule against waiver of governmental immunity here,if rule is to be limited to its intended procedural scope,and not to supplant substantive california law and constitutional protection under the due process clause,it must be narrowed.
the rules enabling act authorizes the adoption of the federal rules of civil procedure,but provides that s uch rules shall not abridge,enlarge or modify any substantive right.b.the majority application of rule frustrates a substantive right granted by california law because it permits punitive damages to stand without judicial review of the validity of the punitive damages award.rule application in this case must be restricted to comply with the california supreme court rule in adams murakami adams rule.
in my view,the adams rule reflects a substantive policy decision of california to require meaningful judicial review before a defendant is subjected to punitive damages.under california substantive law governing punitive damages,the public interest must be recognized and assessed before california courts may permit an award punitive damages to stand.stated another way,california does not allow punitive damages except when and to the extent that the punitive damage award promotes the public interest.viewed in this light,the adams rule is not a mere rule of procedure,as the majority incorrectly characterizes it.the adams rule does not make the litigation process more efficient,more accurate,or serve any procedural function that would favor applying rule in place of the adams rule as the california supreme court in adams made clear,the reasoning for the rule is based upon the public interest in punitive damage awards in appropriate amounts.adams,at.the adams rule gives defendants a right to judicial review of a punitive damages award.
the majority view of rule abridges this california substantive right because it precludes defendants from obtaining judicial review of a punitive damages award if they do not anticipate an improper punitive damages award and raise the objection by a rule a motion.the majority decision to adhere to rule violates fundamental limitations of the supreme court rulemaking power as delineated by the rules enabling act because the majority abridges a substantive right of a defendant to be protected against an improper punitive damages award.in enacting the rules enabling act,congress made clear that it did not authorize the supreme court to modify substantive policies such as the california substantive policy that punitive damages be permitted only when they serve the public interest.because application of rule would transgress the authority granted by congress under the rules enabling act,i would apply the adams rule requiring judicial review of a punitive damages award.
the due process clause of the fourteenth amendment,which requires meaningful judicial review of punitive damage awards fashioned by a jury,also dictates against applying the terms of rule in this case.honda,at.the wise principle that courts should not allow the imposition of excessive or arbitrary exemplary damage awards is long established this principle predated our constitution and still recurs in current times.fabrigas mostyn,eng.some awards may be so monstrous and excessive,as to be in themselves an evidence of passion or partiality in the jury day woodworth,how.exemplary,punitive or vindictive damages should reflect the enormity of the offence indus.of vermont,kelco disposal,d,concurring in part and dissenting in part chapter of magna carta,hen.iii,ch,prohibited amercements that were disproportionate to the offense or that would deprive the wrongdoer of his means of livelihood a shall not be amerced for a small fault,but after the manner of the fault and for a great fault after the greatness thereof.honda,at.due process dictates that a defendant can not be subjected to exemplary damages absent judicial review bmw of,gore,d breyer,concurring this constitutional concern,itself harkening back to the magna carta,arises out of the basic unfairness of depriving citizens of life,liberty,or property,through the application,not of law and legal process,but of arbitrary coercion.ciraolo city of new york,cir calabresi,concurring although widely accepted by economists and acknowledged by some courts,the multiplier function of punitive damages has nonetheless been applied haphazardly at best.one reason this is so is that the twin goals of deterrence and retribution are often conflated,rather than recognized as analytically distinct objectives.state farm mutual automobile ins.campbell,d the due process clause of the fourteenth amendment prohibits the imposition of grossly excessive or arbitrary punishments on a tortfeasor.emphasis added.though each of these cases might be distinguished in some way,a general principle favoring judicial review of punitive damages runs through these cases and should illuminate our judgment 
as adams recognized,based on the supreme court reasoning in pac.mut.life ins.haslip,d,there is a constitutional mandate for meaningful judicial scrutiny of punitive damages awards.adams,at.in haslip,the court held that alabama system of jury instructions and judicial review that governed an award of punitive damages protected a civil defendant due process interests.id.at.the supreme court also made it clear that alabama system for reviewing punitive damage awards satisfied due process because it provided a definite and meaningful constraint on a jury discretion to award punitive damages by allowing review procedures.id.at.this constitutional mandate requiring meaningful judicial scrutiny of punitive damages post was further clarified in honda motor oberg.in honda,the supreme court specifically held that oregon system for awarding punitive damages violated procedural due process because it did not permit meaningful review of jury verdicts that included punitive damages.at.more importantly,the court made clear that review of punitive damage awards is the most important procedural safeguard on punitive damage awards and held that the lack of meaningful review of jury verdicts violates the due process clause of the fourteenth amendment.id.at.see also white ford motor,cir read together haslip and honda teach that it is the availability of review of punitive damages that provides the most substantial procedural check on punitive damages.graber,concurring in part and dissenting in part.the due process guarantee mandating judicial review of punitive damages provides an additional reason against the application of rule in this case.
the supreme court made clear in hanna that its decision did not purport to abridge either the rules enabling act or the guarantees of the constitution.hanna,at.notwithstanding the explicit language of hanna,the majority concludes that what i consider to be a substantive right in california and a federal constitutional guarantee relating to a court ability to check punitive damage awards
