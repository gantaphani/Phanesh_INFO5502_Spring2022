some plaintiffs in five related cases pending in two trial courts in orange county and jefferson county have sued relator and more than other defendants for damages from exposure to asbestos.relator moved to dismiss the plaintiffs claims against it under section of the texas civil practice and remedies code on the ground that the claims were commenced after august,and arose outside texas at a time when plaintiffs were not residents of this state.the trial courts denied the motions,and relator seeks review by mandamus in this consolidated original proceeding.we conditionally grant relief.
we have before today stated that section was enacted in as part of a legislative package aimed at reducing the crowding of texas courts with claims arising out of state and claims brought by foreign plaintiffs,having little or no connection to texas,at the expense of texas residents.as pertinent to the present proceeding,the statute provides 
a this section applies only to a claim for personal injury or wrongful death in which 
the plaintiff was not a resident of this state at the time the claim arose 
the plaintiff claim arose outside this state and 
the plaintiff claim alleges that harm was caused by exposure to asbestos fibers.
c the court,on motion of a defendant,shall dismiss each claim against the defendant that is subject to this section and was commenced in this state on or after august,but before january,unless the plaintiff files a written statement electing to 
abate the plaintiff claim against the defendant for a period of days from the date the court disposes of the defendant motion,to afford the plaintiff an opportunity to file a new action on the claims in another state of the united states or 
retain the plaintiff claims against the defendant in this state and limit the plaintiff recovery on the claims for exemplary damages,if any,against the defendant to an amount not to exceed the greater of 
a two times the amount of economic damages plus an amount equal to any noneconomic damages found by the trier of fact,not to exceed or 
e a court may not abate or dismiss a claim under subsection c against a defendant until the defendant files with the court or with the clerk of the court a written stipulation that,with respect to a new action on the claim commenced by the plaintiff,the defendant waives the right to assert a statute of limitations defense in all other states of the united states in which the claim was not barred by limitations at the time the claim was filed in this state as necessary to effect a tolling of the limitations periods in those states beginning on the date the claim was filed in this state and ending on the date the claim is dismissed or the period of abatement ends.
f the court may not abate or dismiss a claim under this section against a defendant until the defendant files with the court or with the clerk of the court a written stipulation that,with respect to a new action on the claim commenced by the plaintiff in another state of the united states,the plaintiff may elect that the plaintiff and the defendant may 
rely on responses to discovery already provided under the texas rules of civil procedure,plus any additional discovery that may be conducted under the rules of civil procedure in the other state or 
use responses to discovery already provided and conduct additional discovery as permitted under the rules of civil procedure in the other state.
g to comply with this section in relation to an action that involves both claims that arose in this state and claims that arose outside this state,a court shall consider each claim individually and shall sever from the action the claims that are subject to this section.
h a court shall determine that a claim arose in the jurisdiction in which the plaintiff was located at the time the plaintiff is alleged to have been exposed to asbestos fibers.if a plaintiff alleges that the plaintiff was exposed to asbestos fibers while located in more than one jurisdiction,the court shall determine,for purposes of this section,which of the jurisdictions is the most appropriate forum for the claim,considering the relative amounts and lengths of the plaintiff exposure to asbestos fibers in each of the jurisdictions 
the statute applies to a civil action that is pending on the effective date of the act,which was may,unless a trial of a plaintiff action had already begun 
four of the five related cases underlying the present proceeding were filed before may,and were pending on that in orange county on behalf of a total of about plaintiffs and one in jefferson county on behalf of about plaintiffs none of the four cases had yet gone to trial,but a few of the plaintiffs had been severed out of one of the orange county cases into a separate action that had been tried in january and was awaiting judgment since then there have been at least two other trials in severed cases involving a few plaintiffs,as well as a number of settlements.
relator,du pont de nemours and,has not been involved in any of the trials or settlements.dupont was not originally named as a defendant in any of the four cases and was first added by amended pleadings filed in all of them on september,a little more than eight months before section was enacted dupont immediately filed special appearances in the cases,which the trial courts denied,and moved to dismiss the claims against it based on forum non conveniens,which the trial courts also denied.dupont took an interlocutory appeal from the rulings on the special appearances the court of appeals affirmed in february and we dismissed dupont petition for review for want of jurisdiction in january 
in august the fifth case involved in the present proceeding was severed from the three cases in orange county a few days later,dupont moved in each of the five cases to dismiss the plaintiffs claims against it under section c if plaintiffs did not elect between a cap on exemplary damages or a abatement to allow for refiling in another state.dupont asserted that section c was applicable because the claims against it were commenced in this state on or after august,but before january,since it was not named as a defendant in the litigation until september,and because discovery in the cases showed that all but eighteen plaintiffs in the four orange county cases and sixteen in the jefferson county case had no contact at all with texas.for those plaintiffs who had indicated some contact with texas,dupont argued under section h that texas was not the most appropriate forum for the claim s,considering the relative amounts and lengths of the plaintiff s exposure to asbestos in each of the jurisdictions.alternatively,dupont argued that any of the plaintiffs for whom this was not true should be severed from the actions under section g.dupont stipulated,as required by sections e and f,that limitations on any plaintiff claim in another state would be tolled for the time the texas case in which he was involved had been pending,and that plaintiffs could elect to use discovery in the texas cases in any new actions they filed in other states.in response to dupont motions,the plaintiffs did not contest the extent of their texas connections or the adequacy of dupont stipulations under the statute.they argued only that section c does not apply because the actions were filed before august,even though dupont was not named as a defendant until later.because they argued that the statute was inapplicable,the plaintiffs did not make the election called for under section c.
the trial court in orange county denied the motions to dismiss in its cases by four orders dated july,and the trial court in jefferson county denied the motion in its case by order dated november.on december,dupont petitioned the court of appeals for relief from all five orders by mandamus,which that court denied by unpublished order on december,dupont filed a consolidated petition for mandamus in this court on january,
to obtain mandamus relief,dupont must first show that the trial courts clearly abused their discretion by denying dupont motions to dismiss since the provisions of section are mandatory,the trial courts had no discretion to
