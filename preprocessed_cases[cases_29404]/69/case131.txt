factual background and procedural history 
lockheed and rantec 
lockheed is an advanced technology company incorporated in maryland that also has its principal place of business in maryland.rantec is a delaware corporation with its principal place of business in missouri.rantec designs and constructs anechoic chambers on april,lockheed and rantec entered into a written contract in which rantec agreed to design and construct an anechoic chamber at a lockheed facility in merrimack,new hampshire.as part of the contract,rantec was required to design,fabricate,and install a fire detection and sprinkler system in the chamber.the contract contained a warranty clause providing that a ll equipment and workmanship shall be guaranteed to be free from defects by rantec for a period of one year after final acceptance,unless a different warranty is specified.rantec completed construction of the chamber in late,and final acceptance occurred in.
the fire detection system consisted of,inter alia,smoke detectors,fire alarms,valves,telescoping sprinkler assemblies tsas,and sprinkler heads.the tsas were retracted above and outside the chamber and were designed to extend into the chamber when the detection system identified smoke or fire but not immediately release water.once the temperature exceeded a certain level,a fusible link incorporated in the sprinkler head would melt and water would be released into the chamber.
the present case stems from two incidents involving flooding of lockheed anechoic chambers.in december,an anechoic chamber at a lockheed facility in california suffered water damage when three of the tsas broke and water flooded the chamber.on march,the sprinkler system at the anechoic chamber in new hampshire malfunctioned.the fire suppression system activated due to a defect in an electronic panel sold and installed by another contractor not party to this suit.the tsas extended and some of the sprinkler heads broke and released a large amount of water into the chamber.the foam and of the chamber suffered of damage.according to lockheed,also damaged by the flood were a pedestal and positioning system costing over.these items were not provided under the contract with rantec.lockheed did not include these items in its complaint and did not amend its complaint to add these items 
on december,lockheed brought suit against rantec in the united states district court for the northern district of california alleging claims stemming from the incidents in california and new hampshire.on august,the district court in california severed lockheed new hampshire claims,and the parties then stipulated to transfer the new hampshire claims to the united states district court for the district of massachusetts.lockheed raised the following claims regarding the new hampshire events negligence,strict liability,and implied warranties.
rantec and the fm entities 
fmrc performs testing,issues product standards,and publishes a directory of fm approved products for use in fire suppression systems.rantec claims against the fm entities stemmed from fmrc approval of rantec tsas on the condition that they be equipped with certain sprinkler sprinkler heads that broke when the tsas extended into lockheed anechoic chamber.after lockheed sued rantec,rantec moved to add the fm entities as defendants pursuant to rule a of the federal rules of civil procedure.in their briefs,rantec and the fm entities dispute when rantec filed its complaint against the fm entities.because we are not reaching rantec appeal regarding the grant of summary judgment in favor of the fm entities,we do not address this issue.
proceedings below 
on april,rantec moved for summary judgment against lockheed.the district court denied this motion on june.on september,the court stayed all further proceedings pending resolution of the california litigation.the district court reopened litigation on december.rantec its motion for summary judgment against lockheed,and the fm entities moved for summary judgment against rantec.on april,the district court granted rantec motion for summary judgment against lockheed and granted the fm entities motion for summary judgment against rantec.regarding lockheed claims against rantec,the district court found that the economic loss doctrine barred lockheed tort claims and that the implied warranties claims were barred by the statute of limitations.lockheed appealed on may.rantec appealed on may.

lockheed tort claims 
the parties agree that new hampshire law governs this case.the district court found that,under new hampshire law,lockheed tort claims were barred by what is known as the economic loss rule.under the economic loss rule,a party generally may not recover in tort for economic loss.we begin by discussing how the new hampshire courts have defined economic loss and applied the economic loss rule.
the new hampshire supreme court has defined economic loss as the diminution in the value of a product because it is inferior in quality,ellis robert morris,internal quotation marks omitted,overruled on other grounds by lempke dagenais,and that loss resulting from the failure of the product to perform to the level expected by the buyer,which is commonly measured by the cost of repairing or replacing the product,lempke,at.the new hampshire supreme court has also stated that w hen a defective product accidentally causes harm to persons or property,the resulting harm is treated as personal injury or property damage.but when damage occurs to the inferior product itself the harm is characterized as economic loss.ellis,at the new hampshire supreme court has also noted that i t is clear that the majority of courts do not allow economic loss recovery in tort,but that economic loss is recoverable in contract,lempke,at,and that a party usually may not recover damages for economic loss via a tort claim.see border brook terrace condo.ass gladstone.the district court found that the flooding was caused by a malfunction of the anechoic chamber and that the only thing damaged was the chamber itself.the district court therefore concluded that lockheed suffered only economic loss and could not recover on its negligence or strict liability claims.
lockheed argues that,under new hampshire law,the economic loss rule does not bar tort actions where a defect actually poses an affirmative risk of harm to persons or property.lockheed would have us look to how the damage occurred and,if we find that the defect or accident posed an affirmative risk to persons or property,find that its tort claims are not barred by the economic loss rule however,we see nothing in the new hampshire cases dealing with economic loss indicating that,when determining whether or not loss is economic,the new hampshire courts would inquire into the risk posed by an accident or defect in a product.instead,the new hampshire cases are clear that when a product harms only itself,the loss is economic and may not be recovered in tort.for example,in a recent new hampshire supreme court case,the court stated that w hen a defective product accidentally causes harm to persons or property other than the defective product itself,the resulting harm is treated as personal injury or property damage.kelleher lumber,quoting ellis,at alteration in original emphasis added.the court went out of its way to add the phrase other than the defective product itself,which was not present in ellis.the implication of this statement is that,when a defective product accidentally causes harm to itself,that harm is not treated as personal injury or property damage but is instead treated as economic loss,which is not recoverable in tort.the new hampshire supreme court has therefore clearly rejected the logic behind lockheed argument.
we also think that this approach comports with the policies behind several fundamental tenets of contract and tort law.lockheed argues that the purpose of the economic loss doctrine is to distinguish between a product that fails to perform as promised and a product whose defect poses an actual risk of injury or damage,and that the dividing line between tort and contract should not hinge on the fortuity of what happened to be damaged.to our knowledge,the new hampshire courts have not explicitly addressed these arguments.however,the united states supreme court has done so in east river transamerica delaval,d.in east river,an admiralty case,the court discussed the merits of the majority view of the economic loss damage to a product caused by that product is economic loss and not recoverable in well as the view argued by the economic loss doctrine should turn on the affirmative risk posed by the defective product.in rejecting the position advocated by lockheed,the court stated that such a position,which essentially turn s on the degree of risk,is too indeterminate to enable manufacturers easily to structure their business behavior.id.at.the court also stated that 
t he distinction that the law has drawn between tort recovery for physical injuries and warranty recovery for economic loss is not arbitrary and does not rest on the luck of one plaintiff in having an accident causing physical injury.the distinction rests,rather,on an understanding of the nature of the responsibility a manufacturer must undertake in distributing his products.when a product injures only itself the reasons for imposing tort duty are weak and those for leaving the party to its contractual remedies are strong.
id.at.citation and internal quotation marks omitted as the court noted,e ven when the harm to the product itself occurs through an abrupt,event,the resulting loss due to repair costs,decreased value,and lost profits is essentially the failure of the purchaser to receive the benefit of its the core concern of contract law.id.at.
further,lockheed position would eviscerate the line between tort and contract and would allow tort,in many ways,to swallow up contract law.as the supreme court noted in east river,p roducts liability grew out of a public policy judgment that people need more protection from dangerous products than is afforded by the law of warranty.it is clear,however,that if this development were allowed to progress too far,contract law would drown in a sea of tort.id.at.citation omitted.lockheed view would lead to just that result.it would allow any party who suffered damage as a result of a product malfunction to bring a tort claim by asserting that the malfunction occurred in a way that might have harmed another person or property,regardless of whether any other person or property was actually harmed.we think the better approach is to look at what in fact happened,not what could have happened.
in sum,it is clear from the new hampshire cases,especially kelleher,the new hampshire supreme court most recent case regarding the economic loss rule,that new hampshire has adopted the majority view of the economic loss rule which the supreme court discussed in east river.therefore,if the flooding caused by the allegedly defective sprinkler systems damaged only the product itself,then the economic loss rule prohibits lockheed from recovery on its tort claims.
we turn now to address whether the flooding damaged only the product itself.lockheed makes two arguments regarding this issue.first,it argues that the fire suppression system and the anechoic chamber were different products,and that the defect in the fire suppression therefore damaged another anechoic chamber.however,as rantec points out,the parties contract for the anechoic chamber included the fire suppression system as a component part of the chamber,not a separate product.as part of the contract,the parties included a document entitled tapered anechoic chamber,compact range chamber technical specification.paragraph of this document,entitled introduction,stated that t his document provides specification information for a tapered anechoic chamber paragraph,entitled tapered anechoic chamber and control room,stated that t he specification is for a tapered anechoic chamber to be used as a general purpose facility for rcs test and antenna pattern measurements the contractor will design,fabricate,and test the chamber,including all hvac,fire detection and suppression utilities.from these provisions,it is clear that the fire suppression system was a component part of the anechoic chamber according to the technical specifications for the chamber agreed upon by the parties.the anechoic chamber and fire suppression system are therefore properly regarded as a single unit.as the supreme court noted in east river,s ince all but the very simplest of machines have component parts,a contrary holding would require a finding of property damage in virtually every case where a product damages itself.at.internal quotation marks and citation omitted.
lockheed second argument is that there were in fact other items in the chamber when it was flooded a pedestal and positioning system.however,as rantec points out,lockheed never mentioned these items in its complaint and never amended its complaint to include these items lockheed attempts to get around this issue by arguing that,under the federal rules of civil procedure notice pleading standard,it was not required to itemize its damages in the complaint.lockheed also argues that the complaint,fairly read,gave notice to rantec that these other items were in the chamber.we disagree for several reasons.first,while the federal rules of civil procedure require only notice pleading,there is nothing in the complaint that would put rantec on notice that lockheed was claiming anything other than damage to the chamber itself.a review of the complaint reveals no mention of other items in the chamber.instead,the complaint repeats several times that plaintiff anechoic chambers were doused with water and severely damaged.lockheed also specified that the anechoic foam and in the chamber was damaged.nothing in the complaint provides the slightest indication that there were other items in the chamber or that lockheed suffered damage to anything other than the chamber itself.we see no reason to allow lockheed to claim damage to other items when it never bothered to mention or even hint toward damage to anything beyond the anechoic chamber itself in the complaint.
second,in reviewing the new hampshire cases dealing with the economic loss doctrine,it is clear that the new hampshire courts have looked to the complaint to determine whether the damages claimed by a plaintiff were economic loss.see border brook terrace condo.ass n,at looking to the plaintiffs writ in determining whether plaintiffs suffered only economic loss ellis,at the plaintiffs claim does not involve property damage per se.rather,the writ alleges economic loss resulting from the defendant failure to properly perform a contractual obligation.emphasis added although it is not controlling under the federal rules of civil procedure,we find the approach of the new hampshire courts instructive.because lockheed failed to give any indication in its complaint that it was alleging damage to anything other than the anechoic chamber,we will not consider alleged damage to t
