plaintiff harvey frank robbins brought this suit challenging the termination by the bureau of land management blm of a settlement agreement that,if it had remained in effect for two years,would have required the blm to dismiss sixteen pending administrative actions against robbins.the district court upheld the blm action.robbins appeals,arguing,as he did below,that,in voiding the settlement agreement,the blm violated his fifth amendment procedural due process rights.the blm responds that robbins claim is barred by sovereign immunity based on the relationship between the administrative procedure act,and the tucker act.for the reasons set forth below,we reject the blm sovereign immunity argument but affirm the district court denial of robbins due process claim.
background 
robbins is the owner of three ranch properties located in hot springs county,wyoming.these three ranches include areas of private land interspersed with public land administered by the blm.robbins has held grazing permits,issued by the blm,which authorize cattle grazing on some of this public land.between and,the blm took sixteen separate administrative actions against robbins,ten of which alleged that robbins had engaged in trespass by allowing his cattle to graze on public lands for which he did not hold a permit.robbins appealed these sixteen actions to the blm office of hearings and appeals or the department of interior board of land appeals.
on january,while all sixteen administrative appeals remained pending,robbins and the blm executed a settlement agreement for the purpose of improv ing the working relationship between robbins and the blm such that they would handle any future disputes with each other in good faith and in a spirit of mutual cooperation.settlement agreement sa at,appellant app.at.the agreement provided that the parties would jointly request stays of the sixteen appeals and would subsequently jointly move to dismiss the appeals with prejudice provided that a period of consecutive months transpires after the effective date of th e agreement without blm having initiated a formal administrative or judicial proceeding against robbins alleging willful trespass,the violation of any regulation,law,or blm decision where range or resource degradation is at issue.sa at,id.at.it further provided that robbins and the blm would engage in an informal dispute resolution idr process to attempt to resolve any future disputes before pursuing any legal or administrative remedies but that the blm may at any time take action necessary to enforce its regulations or protect public land resources,including a decision that requires robbins to take action that is the subject of a dispute between robbins and the blm.sa at,id.at.among other things,the agreement also contained the following provision 
the parties stipulate and agree that,as soon as practical after the effective date of this agreement,blm shall conditionally transfer to robbins the owl creek grazing permit.before the blm conditionally transfers this grazing permit to robbins,robbins shall first submit to the blm an appropriate and acceptable grazing or pasture plan detailing robbins contemplated uses under this conditional grazing permit.however,if at any time during the months following the conditional transfer of this permit,and after first complying with the idr requirement set forth in paragraph,blm initiates a formal administrative or judicial proceeding against robbins alleging willful trespass or the violation of any regulation,law,or blm decision where range or resource degradation is at issue regardless of whether such a proceeding directly involves the owl creek permit or any other disputed matter between robbins and the blm,then without the need for any further consultation,action,or legal recourse,the blm may cancel the owl creek permit in this event,robbins shall be free to file an appropriate pleading with the federal district court to pursue his legal remedies in the respect to the owl creek permit.
sa at,id.at.however,following this month period,provided that no idr proceedings have been concluded adversely to robbins,and provided that robbins is otherwise qualified under the then existing law,regulations,and land use plan,robbins may apply for the owl creek permit,and the blm shall issue the permit to robbins free of the conditions previously imposed.sa at,id.at.
in addition,the agreement provided that,if the blm initiated a formal proceeding against robbins that alleged a willful trespass or the violation of any regulation,law,or blm decision where range or resource degradation is at issue within months of the effective date of the agreement,the blm,without the need for any further consultation,action,or legal recourse,may,in blm sole discretion declare the stays on the administrative appeals to be of no further force or legal effect.sa at,id.at.in that event,the agreement itself would become void.
beginning in may,four months after the agreement was executed,the blm on a number of occasions observed unauthorized grazing by robbins cattle on allotments for which robbins held no permit.the blm issued one trespass notice to robbins on december,relating to cattle found in three allotments on december and,and a second notice on december,relating to cattle found in two allotments on december.the notices indicated that robbins had allowed unauthorized grazing by his cattle in violation of b iii robbins protested the two notices on december,and met with blm local field office officials on january.at that meeting,robbins criticized the blm practice of issuing notices of trespass for nonwillful violations because,in his view,it was unreasonable to expect cattle to stay on their designated allotments all the time.the blm officials explained that they based the decision of whether to issue a notice of trespass on the circumstances of each case,and in robbins case there had been a number of previous incidents in the past year involving escaped cattle where no notice of trespass had been issued.robbins expressed his concern that having trespasses on his record jeopardized his ability to keep or renew his grazing permits.citing this concern,robbins refused to agree to a settlement under,which would have required designating the noticed trespasses as nonwillful,willful,or repeated willful in accord with the idr provision of the settlement agreement,the parties therefore sought review by the blm director office.
as part of that review,robbins met with the blm deputy state director on january.the deputy state director then issued a written decision indicating that robbins continued to refuse to settle the noticed trespasses and directing the field office to issue a proposed decision in accordance with.accordingly,on january,the field office issued a notice of proposed decision indicating that the trespasses constituted nonwillful violations of b iii and assessing a charge against robbins to cover the amount of unauthorized forage that the trespassing cattle were calculated to have consumed,based on the number of cattle and number of days they were in trespass.in accord with subpart,governing blm administrative actions,the notice of proposed decision explained that the proposed decision would become the final decision unless it was protested within fifteen days and that robbins could appeal the final decision within thirty days of its receipt.see.
two days later,on january,the blm sent a letter to robbins to confirm that the settlement agreement of january,between robbins and the blm is now void and of no further effect because the agreement voiding provision was triggered by the formal administrative proceeding initiated on january.appellant app.at.the letter further indicated that,a t this time,the blm is considering its options regarding the sixteen stayed administrative proceedings listed in the agreement.id.
robbins then brought suit in federal district court,challenging,under the administrative procedure act apa,and the fifth amendment due process clause,the blm voiding of the settlement agreement.specifically,robbins alleged that he had a protected property interest in the settlement agreement and that the blm violated his procedural due process rights by declaring the agreement void without having alleged that robbins trespasses implicated range or resource degradation.the relief requested by robbins involved,essentially,a declaration of robbins rights under the agreement and an injunction prohibiting the blm from violating the agreement.the blm filed a motion to dismiss,arguing that robbins suit was barred by sovereign immunity.the district court denied the blm motion to dismiss but ultimately ruled in favor of the blm on robbins constitutional claim.robbins appealed,raising the same arguments before this court.the blm,in turn,renews its claim of sovereign immunity 
discussion 
sovereign immunity 
the blm sovereign immunity defense is jurisdictional in nature.wyoming united states,cir.by depriving courts of subject matter jurisdiction over claims against the united states,its agencies,and officers acting in their official capacity,s overeign immunity generally shields these entities from suit.see also united states sherwood.t he terms of the united states consent to be sued in any court define that court jurisdiction to entertain the suit.
here,robbins asserts sovereign immunity is waived pursuant to the apa,which provides that,in most circumstances,a n action in a court of the united states seeking relief other than money damages shall not be dismissed nor relief therein be denied on the ground that it is against the united states.we have recognized that this language waive s sovereign immunity in most suits for nonmonetary relief against the united states,its agencies,and its officers simmat bureau of prisons,cir.however,this waiver does not apply where any other statute that grants consent to suit expressly or impliedly forbids the relief which is sought.neighbors for rational,norton,cir quoting.thus,we must read the apa in conjunction with other jurisdictional statutes waiving sovereign immunity in order to determine whether those statutes forbid the relief sought in the case at hand.city of albuquerque,at quoting new mexico regan,cir.
neither party here disputes that the settlement agreement is equivalent to a contract in this context,and we therefore assume that to be the case accordingly,there are two other federal statutes that are potentially implicated here.the tucker act,provides that t he united states court of federal claims shall have jurisdiction to render judgment upon any claim against the united states founded upon any express or implied contract with the united states.id.a.the little tucker act a,grants federal district courts concurrent jurisdiction over contract claims against the government where plaintiffs seek no more than in damages.the supreme court has long held that neither the tucker act nor the little tucker act authorize relief other than money damages for such contract claims.united states jones.see lee,at.indeed,in larson domestic foreign commerce,the supreme court suggested that injunctive remedies against the government were generally quite limited.see united states murdock mach.eng g of utah,cir construing larson.
as we have previously recognized,however,the amendments to the apa to a large extent superseded the restrictions on injunctive relief set forth in larson by inserting into the language quoted above,waiving sovereign immunity for suits seeking relief other than money damages.simmat,at murdock mach.eng g,at see also bowen massachusetts,d i t is undisputed that the amendment to was intended to broaden the avenues for judicial review of agency action by eliminating the defense of sovereign immunity in cases covered by the amendment.clark library of congress,t he amendments to of the administrative procedure act eliminated the sovereign immunity defense in virtually all actions for relief against a agency or officer acting in an official capacity.citation omitted,brown,cir recognizing that the amendments in effect repealed the larson holding except in cases where the expressly or impliedly forbids language of applies.
the question is thus whether congress intended the apa amendments to supersede the restrictions on injunctive and declaratory relief for contract claims that the supreme court had previously recognized pursuant to the tucker and little tucker acts,or whether,alternatively,those statutes impliedly forbid such relief a number of other circuit courts have adopted the latter interpretation,thus holding that the apa does not waive sovereign immunity for claims that arise out of a contract and that seek specific performance of the contract as relief.see up state fed.credit union walker,cir tucson airport auth.dynamics,cir transohio sav.bank,at coggeshall dev.diamond,cir,at see also bowen,at.scalia,dissenting it is settled that sovereign immunity bars a suit against the united states for specific performance of a contract,and that this bar was not disturbed by the amendment to.citation omitted citing larson and opinions of the circuits listed above.
it is not immediately clear whether this circuit is in accord with this view.indeed,in hamilton stores,hodel,cir,we explicitly held that a determination that a particular action is not an action for money damages resolves in the plaintiff favor the issue of the waiver of sovereign immunity raised by the government.id.at.the plaintiff in hamilton stores sought injunctive and declaratory relief for an alleged breach of contract,as well as alleged violations of statutory and regulatory provisions,by department of interior and national park service officials.
while this suggests that we have already held that a plaintiff may seek nonmonetary relief in district court based on the government breach of contract,it must be noted that the government only argument in hamilton stores in support of its claim that the apa waiver of sovereign immunity does not apply was that the plaintiff claim was essentially a disguised action for damages.id.at citation omitted.we determined that that was not so and thus rejected the government sovereign immunity defense.id.at.thus,we did not then consider the argument raised by the blm here,regarding the impliedly forbids exception to the waiver.while we also stated in hamilton stores that the tucker act does not preclude a claimant from seeking nonmonetary relief in a district court,id.at,that general statement did not address contract claims in particular.subsequent to our decision in hamilton stores,we suggested in dicta that the waiver does not apply to contract claims.southeast.cmty.action program,sec y of,cir.
we now join our fellow circuits in holding that the tucker and little tucker acts impliedly forbid federal courts from ordering declaratory or injunctive relief,at least in the form of specific performance for contract claims against the government,and that the apa thus does not waive sovereign immunity for such claims.we find these circuits reasoning persuasive,particularly in light of the discussion in the house report on the apa amendments,which specifically addressed their intended impact on contract claims 
in the tucker act,congress created a damage remedy for contract claims with jurisdiction limited to the court of claims except in suits for less than.the measure is intended to foreclose specific performance of government contracts t he tucker act impliedly forbids relief for contract claims other than the remedy provided by the act.thus,the partial abolition of sovereign immunity brought about by this bill does not change existing limitations on specific relief,if any,derived from statutes dealing with such matters as government contracts 
at,as reprinted in,see,at.moreover,the same public policy concerns that led the supreme court to recognize this limitation on relief for contract claims continues to apply.see larson,at.the government can not be stopped in its tracks by any plaintiff who presents a disputed contract right i n the absence of a claim of constitutional limitation,the necessity of permitting the government to carry out its functions unhampered by direct judicial intervention outweighs the possible disadvantage to the citizen in being relegated to the recovery of money damages after
