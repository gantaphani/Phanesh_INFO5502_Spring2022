in this diversity case,amoco oil company amoco appeals a damages award in the amount of to caroline gomez gomez,a former amoco franchisee and lessee,on a breach of contract counterclaim because the damages gomez recovered did not flow from amoco breach,we reverse.
gomez dealings with amoco began in late,when she and her husband,robert gomez,approached the company and informed amoco representatives that they were interested in becoming amoco dealers in miami,florida.amoco put them in contact with james perez to discuss a convenience store,car wash,and service station located at west flagler street in miami.the ensuing discussion between the gomezes and perez bore fruit,and in march,robert gomez,acting as president of rocabaja corporation rocabaja,purchased the inventory and goodwill of the west flagler street facility from gemar service station,gemar for the sum of.this transaction,however,was specifically contingent upon the termination of the existing lease and dealer agreement between the president of gemar and amoco oil and the ability of rocabaja to negotiate and enter into a lease agreement,dealer agreement,and fuel purchase agreement with amoco oil,under terms acceptable to rocabaja and no less favorable than those between the president of gemar and amoco oil.rocabaja and amoco were unable to come to terms because amoco granted franchises only to individuals.the problem was solved,however,when,in april,gomez,acting in lieu of rocabaja,entered into a trial franchise lease with amoco that obligated her to operate the west flagler street facility as a prospective amoco franchisee for a trial period commencing may.
the ink had barely dried on the trial franchise lease,however,before gomez discovered problems with the station.in june,inspectors from the department of environmental resource management derm arrived at the site to conduct environmental tests.the tests revealed that the gasoline station was not in compliance with environmental regulations more revealingly,gomez learned from one of the derm inspectors that amoco had known about the gasoline station shortcomings as far back as.armed with this information,gomez contacted amoco to report the derm inspectors findings.amoco did not deny prior knowledge of the station environmental defects but instead explained that extensive,underground construction would be needed to install a vapor recovery system on site to bring the station into compliance.because amoco was responsible under the lease for keeping the station in working order,amoco paid for the installation.gomez,however,was forced to shut down the business for a month while the underground construction took place.
shortly after the new vapor recovery system was installed,gomez noticed that the fuel dispensing equipment at the station no longer functioned properly the equipment would pump gasoline slowly or stop pumping altogether.as a result,customers often complained to gomez and her employees,resulting in angry customers,lost sales,and,ultimately,a loss of business.gomez contacted amoco on numerous occasions to express her frustration with the slow flow problems at her station,and amoco routinely sent maintenance people over to the station to investigate the matter.those who were sent to the station were unable to identify the source of the slow flow problem,however,so the problem remained unsolved.nevertheless,to counter gomez financial losses,amoco frequently offered gomez rent waivers and rent incentives that enabled her to reduce her monthly obligations and thus to keep her head above water.
in january,notwithstanding the continuing malfunction of the station fuel pumps,gomez and amoco entered into a franchise lease and dealer supply agreement franchise agreement governed by the petroleum marketing practices act pmpa.the franchise agreement extinguished and superseded the trial franchise lease and obligated gomez to operate the west flagler street station from may,until may,at a monthly rent of.
notwithstanding the new agreement,the economic situation gomez faced at the service station persisted.in september,alex escardo,an amoco representative,responded to gomez continued complaints about the slow flow problems at her station by assuring her that his company was sympathetic to her concerns and wanted to find a way to work out a solution.the solution escardo eventually proposed would require the parties to cancel the franchise agreement and enter into a commission marketer agreement cma and a commission marketer lease cml.these two agreements would alter the economic,as well as the legal,nature of their relationship.
if the parties entered into the cma and cml,gomez would no longer purchase gasoline from amoco and then resell it to the public at whatever price she deemed appropriate.instead,amoco would maintain ownership of the gasoline and would establish the price it would sell for while gomez would receive a commission on the gasoline she sold additionally,under the cma and cml,gomez would be obligated to pay approximately less in rent per month than she had under the franchise agreement while amoco would assume responsibility for many of the costs associated with the upkeep of the station and storage of the gasoline for which gomez had been responsible under the franchise agreement finally,if gomez entered into the cma and cml,amoco said that it would approve her for a cma and cml to operate a second service station,which was located at west flagler street and was more profitable than the west flagler street station.this would enable gomez to offset her losses from the first station until the problems with the fuel dispensing equipment there were remedied.in return for these advantages,however,gomez,no longer a franchisee,would lose the benefits and protections afforded to franchisees under the pmpa.
in september,gomez and amoco cancelled the franchise agreement by executing the cma and cml in addition to signing these two contracts,gomez signed a mutual cancellation of the franchise lease and dealer supply agreement that included a summary of pmpa rights available only to franchisees and not to commission marketers,rights gomez was losing because the cma and cml superceded the franchise agreement.gomez also filled out a franchise disclosure questionnaire,which stated that she had received and personally reviewed the cma and cml documents with an attorney,accountant or other professional advisor,and that she understood the risks.the cma and cml incorporated each other by reference by their terms,the two contracts would govern the parties relationship for the next four years.
unfortunately,despite amoco efforts to repair the malfunctioning fuel dispensing equipment at the west flagler street station,the slow flow problems persisted at the first station,and gomez continued to experience poor sales.over the next few months,she sustained the west flagler street station with the proceeds she received from sales at her second station,but her losses still mounted eventually,gomez decided that both stations should be sold.although she ultimately sold the inventory and goodwill at the second station,the west flagler street station went unsold in march,rocabaja having failed to find a buyer for the west flagler street site,gomez abandoned the station in the process,she pocketed the entire proceeds from the station most recent gasoline sales even though,under the cma,she was obligated to remit those proceeds to amoco,less a percent commission for herself.
amoco learned of gomez abandonment of the west flagler street station when truck drivers delivering gasoline to the station informed amoco that it was unoccupied and empty.the next month,in april,amoco filed this lawsuit against gomez.its complaint contained two counts.count i,brought under the cma,sought a declaration that gomez had abandoned the service station and the recovery of the proceeds of gasoline sales she should have remitted to amoco.count ii,brought under the cml,sought the rental payments called for by the lease.
gomez,answering the complaint denied amoco allegations,and interposed eight affirmative defenses she also asserted a counterclaim.count i alleged that amoco fraudulently induced her to enter into the trial franchise lease and sought compensatory and punitive damages.the fraud consisted of amoco failure to inform gomez of a material fact,the environmental problem at the station site and that the station would be closed one month for the installation of the vapor recovery system.had amoco informed her of this,gomez alleged,she would not have entered into the trial franchise lease.count ii alleged that amoco owed gomez a fiduciary duty to inform her of the above material fact before she signed the trial franchise lease,that it breached such duty,and that it should respond in compensatory damages.count iii alleged that amoco breached the trial franchise lease,the franchise agreement,the cma,and the cml by failing to maintain the gasoline pumps in working order.count iii sought the same relief as count ii.
amoco reply to gomez counterclaim denied the material allegations and asserted fifteen affirmative defenses,which we set out in the margin before the case went to trial,amoco moved for partial summary judgment on counts i and ii of its complaint and to strike gomez affirmative defenses amoco also moved for summary judgment on counts i and ii and part of count iii of gomez counterclaim.
the district court denied amoco motion for partial summary judgment on counts i and ii of amoco complaint but struck four of gomez eight affirmative defenses economic duress,fraud,frustration of purpose,and impossibility of performance amoco oil gomez,d.turning to gomez counterclaim,the court granted amoco summary judgment on counts i fraudulent inducement regarding the trial franchise lease,ii breach of fiduciary duty regarding the trial franchise lease,and the part of count iii alleging that amoco had breached the trial franchise lease and the franchise agreement on the ground that a novation occurred when gomez entered into the cma and the cml.id.at.the part of count iii alleging that amoco had breached the cma and cml by failing to maintain the fuel dispensing equipment at the west flagler street station would proceed to trial.id.at.
the parties agreed to conduct a bifurcated trial on the issues of liability and damages.at the conclusion of the liability phase of the trial both gomez and amoco moved for judgment as a matter of law amoco sought judgment on its cma and cml claims in counts i and ii,respectively gomez sought summary judgment on those counts on the basis of her pmpa defense addressing count i,the court ruled and the parties agreed that gomez had breached the cma by not paying amoco its share of the proceeds and that none of her affirmative defenses applied to that count.the court therefore granted amoco judgment as a matter of law on count i as to the issue of liability.on count ii,the court ruled that gomez had breached the cml by abandoning the premises but that two of her affirmative amoco failure to maintain the fuel pumps or amoco fraudulent misrepresentation that it would correct the problem excused her go to the jury under special verdicts see.a.
gomez pmpa defense,as stated in her answer to amoco complaint,was a vague claim that amoco had executed the cma and cml in violation of the pmpa.see supra note.at the hearing on amoco motion for partial summary judgment,gomez explained that this defense was based on amoco breach of the pmpa notice requirement by canceling with gomez consent the franchise agreement and replacing it with the cma and cml.the pmpa notice requirement is contained in a,which states,in part 
prior to termination of any franchise or nonrenewal of any franchise relationship,the franchisor shall furnish notification of such termination or such nonrenewal to the franchisee who is a party to such franchise or such franchise relationship in the manner described in subsection c of this section and except as provided in subsection b of this section,not less than days prior to the date on which such termination or nonrenewal takes effect.
the court questioned the parties as to whether section a provided a franchisee an affirmative defense to claims such as amoco was making or an independent cause of action.neither party had considered the issue,so the court recessed the proceedings for the day to enable the parties to research it.the next day,after hearing from both sides,the court held that although the statute permitted franchisees to use the notice provision as a sword,it could not be used as a shield.in other words,according to the court,if a franchisor terminates a franchise agreement without affording the franchisee the required notice,the statute gives the franchisee the right to bring an action to void the termination it does not,however,provide the franchisee an affirmative defense in a situation such as the one presented here.the court therefore struck gomez pmpa defense as legally insufficient.
after the court ruled,gomez moved the court to designate her pmpa defense as a counterclaim pursuant to rule c of the federal rules of civil procedure.rule c provides,in relevant part,that w hen a party has mistakenly designated a defense as a counterclaim or a counterclaim as a defense,the court on terms,if justice so requires,shall treat the pleading as if there had been a proper designation.amoco,in response,urged the court to deny the motion,contending that it could not possibly prepare to defend the counterclaim while the trial was underway.after hearing from gomez,the court denied her motion on the ground that by entering into the cma and cml,the parties had mutually cancelled the franchise agreement and rendered pmpa notice provision inoperative.
the above rulings having been made,the case went to the jury on gomez two affirmative defenses to amoco count ii and on count iii of gomez counterclaim.a jury finding for gomez on her affirmative defenses would excuse her abandonment of the station and preclude amoco from recovering on count ii the rent due under the cml.since count iii of gomez counterclaim was based on the same theory as her first affirmative defense,that amoco failed to maintain the pumps in working order,a jury finding for gomez on that defense would require the court to hold amoco liable on count that the jury found against amoco on its affirmative defense of waiver 
in special verdicts,the jury found for gomez on her first affirmative defense to amoco count ii pursuant to these special verdicts,the court gave judgment to gomez on amoco count ii.the court also ruled that amoco was liable to gomez on count iii of her counterclaim subject to amoco waiver defense,which the jury would consider,confusingly enough,in the damages phase of the trial.see supra note finally,the court,with the parties consent,stated that it would determine the amount of proceeds gomez owed to amoco on count i,under the cma.
after making these rulings,the court brought the jury back to the courtroom for the second phase of the trial to determine the amount of damages gomez should receive on count iii of her counterclaim.the jury heard the testimony of one witness,gomez.she testified that rocabaja gave gemar for the inventory and goodwill at the west flagler street facility and that she spent to run the business.after gomez rested her case,amoco moved the court for judgment as a matter of law,contending that,at best,gomez recovery should be limited to nominal damages.the court denied the motion.
the court instructed the jury on the issue of damages,explaining that gomez was seeking her loss of investment.we replicate the relevant part of the court damages instruction in the margin after deliberating over amoco waiver defense and gomez damages,the jury,returning special verdicts,found against amoco on the waiver issue and awarded gomez in damages.the district court thereafter entered judgment for gomez on count iii of her counterclaim after determining and deducting from the jury award the amount gomez owed amoco on count i of its complaint and awarding her prejudgment interest.following the entry of judgment,amoco timely renewed its motion for judgment as a matter of law and,alternatively,moved for a new trial on the issue of damages the court denied the motion.
gomez now appeals the district court denial of her rule c motion to recast her pmpa defense as a counterclaim and the court decision striking five of her affirmative defenses amoco the court denial of its renewed motion for judgment as a matter of law we resolve the issues below.
we dispose of gomez appeal in but a few words.first,the fact that the court struck her affirmative defenses is of no moment because those defenses addressed amoco count ii claim for rental payments under the provisions of the cml,and gomez obtained judgment on count ii accordingly,gomez was not prejudiced by the court rulings on her defenses,and any hypothetical error is harmless.see directing appellate courts to disregard errors or defects which do not affect the substantial rights of the parties.second,the court refusal to permit gomez to amend her counterclaim to include a count based on the pmpa is unassailable.although case law in this circuit does not indicate the standard we are to apply in reviewing a district court denial of rule c motion,we believe the rule use of the phrase justice so requires calls for abuse of discretion review.orange partners arnold,cir holding that we have held that a district court rule c decisions with regard to the treatment of affirmative defenses is reviewed for an abuse of discretion see baez banc one leasing,cir holding that w e review for abuse of discretion the district court decision to deny the motion for leave to file an amended complaint where rule a of the federal rules of civil procedure states that leave shall be granted freely when justice so requires.we would be hard pressed to hold that a district court abused its discretion in denying a motion to amend a counterclaim to include a new claim for claim that would require the presentation of additional evidence from both the liability phase of the trial had closed.
having found no merit in gomez appeal,we now consider amoco the question of whether the district court should have granted amoco judgment as a matter of law on gomez count iii.
amoco motion was directed to the evidence gomez presented to the jury in support of her claim for damages on count iii.much of gomez evidence related to expenditures that were not made in her performance of her contracts with amoco,the cma and cml.for example,of the funds she said were spent in the performance of the contract were spent by rocabaja in purchasing gemar inventory and goodwill at the west flagler street site before gomez entered into the cma and cml.amoco objected to this testimony,and the court should have sustained its objection.we note that gomez cites no authority that would have permitted her to recover individually the funds rocabaja had invested in the site,and we find none indeed,florida law the governing law in this case,does not permit an individual in gomez situation to bring an action for damages on behalf of a corporate entity.see lincoln oldsmobile,branch,so d,the injury here is to the corporation and not to the principal stockholder.in such cases,a stockholder can not maintain an action in his own name but must bring it in the name of the corporation.this is true even where the individual is the sole stockholder of the corporation.
the jury award was deficient in several additional respects as well.under florida law,a party standing in gomez shoes suing for breach of contract has two alternatives for calculating its damages.the party may seek lost profits,in which case the interest it is protecting is its expectation interest,beefy trail,beefy king int l,so d,or it may omit an attempt to show lost profits and prove instead its actual expenditures made before the defendant breach insofar as those expenditures were reasonably foreseen,expenditures made in preparation for performance or in part performance and in such case the interest the party seeks to protect is its reliance interest.id.professor corbin,who is cited by the beefy trail panel for authority,expresses these alternatives this way 
it is often very difficult to estimate the amount of profits that have been prevented by the breach of contract not only because of uncertainty in the happening of various contingencies,but also because of difficulty in determining the money value of a promised performance or the cost of completion by the plaintiff.there is usually little difficulty,however,in proving what has already been expended by the plaintiff prior to the date of breach by way of preparation and.the fact that profits are too uncertain for recovery does not prevent a judgment in favor of the plaintiff for the amount of his expenditures.
arthur linton corbin,corbin on contracts interim ed.under this rule,therefore,gomez,having elected not to seek lost profits,was entitled to recover as reliance damages the expenditures she incurred pursuant to entering into the cma and cml in september.she testified that she spent to run the business,implying that she expended such sum in or after september.a close examination of her testimony reveals,however,that of that amount was spent in may,while she was operating the service station under the trial franchise lease.the district court should have sustained amoco objection to this testimony on two grounds first,the expenditures could not have constituted reliance they were not incurred in the performance of the cma cml second,the court had granted amoco summary judgment on the part of count iii of gomez counterclaim that sought damages for breach of the trial franchise lease.gomez,d at.
further,gomez testimony reveals that part of the spent running the business was spent by her corporation fat man oil,not gomez just as gomez lacked standing to claim for rocabaja the it invested in the inventory and goodwill at the west flagler street site,see lincoln oldsmobile,so d at,she lacked standing to claim for fat man oil the it spent 
in sum,all that the jury could have awarded gomez under the reliance damages theory was.accordingly,the court should have granted amoco judgment as a matter of law to the extent of,and we therefore reduce the jury award by that amount.this means that the court should have awarded gomez plus prejudgment interest on that amount which amoco does not challenge less the gomez owes amoco on count i of amoco complaint.on receipt of our mandate,the court shall make the appropriate calculations and enter judgment accordingly.
the judgment of the district court is vacated and the case is remanded with instructions.
so ordered.
the district court originally reduced the jury award by a set off of,which it ruled gomez owed amoco.this brought the total to.the court subsequently entered an amended judgment adding prejudgment interest in favor of gomez that increased the total amount of the judgment to.
the environmental tests conducted by derm revealed that there was soil contamination on the site caused by leaking gasoline,as well as vapor recovery problems.
the new agreements would obligate gomez to remit the proceeds of gasoline sales to amoco,less a cents per gallon commission she would keep for herself.in addition,she would be responsible for promptly accounting to amoco all gross receipts.
under the franchise agreement,gomez was obligated to pay amoco per month.under the cma and cml,the rent would be reduced to per month.
shortly after gomez entered into the cma and cml,fat man oil corporation fat man oil,which gomez and her husband owned,purchased the inventory and goodwill at the west flagler street station so that she could operate the station at that site.
gomez had days to review the cma,the cml,and the cancellation agreement before she signed them.at trial,she contended that she did not fully understand the import of these documents specifically,she claimed that she was unaware that by entering into these agreements she would forfeit her rights under the pmpa as a franchisee.
although gomez had the contractual relationship with amoco,two separate and fat man the financial benefits she gained from the cmas and cmls.at trial,she testified that she passed money back and forth between the two companies mainly to offset the losses she was enduring at the west flagler street station.
gomez did not own the st
