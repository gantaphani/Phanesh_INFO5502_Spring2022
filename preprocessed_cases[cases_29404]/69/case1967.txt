this is an appeal by plaintiff and appellant,gary bailey bailey,from the judgment entered on november,in his favor and against defendants and respondents,outdoor media group omg,jon gunderson,and lamar advertising company lamar,following a court trial on bailey complaint for,among other things,damages based on trespass,wrongful occupation of land,and a common count for money had and received.the trial court awarded bailey compensatory damages of against omg and jon gunderson,its principal,and an additional against lamar,on the noted causes of action.bailey challenges the damage awards,contending that the trial court did not apply the correct statutory measure of damages with respect to lamar,and failed to correctly calculate damages with respect to omg.we agree with bailey claim regarding lamar,for reasons we now explain,and therefore we will modify the judgment accordingly.
factual and procedural 
bailey sued omg and lamar,both of which are billboard advertising companies,to recover damages for trespass and wrongful occupation of a strip of land in the city of grand terrace that bailey had leased from the property owners and then subleased to omg,which constructed billboards on the land and sold the advertising space.when omg sublease with bailey expired in,omg continued to occupy the land and sell advertising on its billboards while it attempted to negotiate a new sublease agreement with bailey.bailey and omg did not agree on the terms of a new sublease,and in bailey sued omg for damages based on,among other things,its wrongful occupation of bailey leasehold.bailey won that lawsuit which the parties in this case refer to as bailey i,a designation we adopt and recovered damages from omg through august.although the trial court in that case awarded bailey damages,it denied bailey cause of action for ejectment on the ground that ejectment could result in waste because the city of grand terrace had outlawed new billboard construction with the result that if the billboards were removed from the property,they could not be replaced.bailey appealed the damage award in bailey i but he apparently did not challenge the trial court denial of his request to eject omg from the property.in that appeal,this court modified the judgment by increasing the damage award and affirmed the judgment as modified.despite its loss in bailey i,both at trial and on appeal,omg continued to occupy bailey property and sell advertising space on its billboards until may,when it sold the billboards to lamar.
in the sale to lamar,omg represented that it had a valid sublease with bailey on the subject property and that it would assign that sublease to lamar.omg provided lamar with a copy of what omg represented to be the sublease agreement.the purported sublease in fact was an offer that bailey had made to omg nine months earlier and that omg had not accepted and that bailey subsequently revoked.because bailey had signed the sublease offer,omg backdated its acceptance,and represented to lamar that the document was a valid sublease agreement with bailey when bailey learned of the transaction between omg and lamar,which occurred shortly after the transaction took place,he notified lamar that omg did not have a sublease on the property.in addition,when lamar sent bailey what it represented to be its first rent payment,bailey returned the check,and advised lamar that no sublease existed between bailey and omg.lamar continued to occupy the property and send monthly rent payments to bailey,only to have bailey return the payments with a letter advising lamar that omg did not have a lease on the property.
bailey filed the instant action in july,seeking among other things damages under civil code section for trespass measured by the gross revenue lamar and omg received from their respective sale of advertising space on the billboards located on bailey leasehold.bailey also sought to recover from omg the price lamar had paid to purchase the billboards from omg.a court trial took place in march at the conclusion of which the trial court found in favor of bailey and against both omg and lamar.the trial court awarded damages to bailey against omg measured by the net profit it generated from the billboards,rather than by gross revenue,and against lamar measured by the reasonable rental value of the land,rather than its net profit.the trial court denied bailey recovery of the purchase price omg had received from lamar,and also found that bailey was collaterally estopped by bailey i from seeking ejectment,and in any event,ejectment would cause waste.after the trial court issued its tentative decision,bailey moved for a new trial on the issue of damages or in the alternative to vacate the submission and reopen the case to evidence.the trial court denied that motion.bailey appeals from the subsequently entered judgment.
discussion 
bailey contends that the trial court incorrectly calculated the amount of damages to which he is entitled as the result of the wrongful occupation of his leasehold by omg and lamar.more particularly,bailey claims that under civil code section,he was entitled to recover the benefits obtained by both omg and lamar as a result of their respective wrongful occupations of bailey leasehold,and that the benefit obtained consists of the gross revenue,not the net profit,generated by the billboards,along with the proceeds of omg sale of the billboards to lamar.although the trial court awarded bailey the value of the use of the property measured by the benefits omg obtained as a result of its wrongful occupation of bailey leasehold,it determined that those benefits consisted of the profit omg made on the billboards rather than its gross revenue,and did not include the proceeds of omg sale to lamar.with respect to lamar,the trial court found that its occupation of the property was the result of a mistake of fact,and therefore the trial court assessed damages under civil code section,subdivision b,quoted below,based on the reasonable rental value of the property,an award bailey also challenges.we first address bailey claim regarding the damage award against omg,which turns on the meaning of the phrase benefits obtained as used in civil code section.
measure of damages under civil code section 
civil code section provides in pertinent part a the detriment caused by the wrongful occupation of real property is deemed to include the value of the use of the property for the time of that wrongful occupation,the reasonable cost of repair or restoration of the property to its original condition,and the costs,if any,of recovering the possession.b except as provided in paragraph,for purposes of subdivision a,the value of the use of the property shall be the greater of the reasonable rental value of that property or the benefits obtained by the person wrongfully occupying the property by reason of that wrongful occupation.if a wrongful occupation of real property subject to this section is the result of a mistake of fact of the wrongful occupier,the value of the use of the property,for purposes of subdivision a,shall be the reasonable rental value of the property.
the phrase benefits obtained is not defined in section.by urging that it means gross rather than net revenue,bailey contends either that his interpretation is required as a matter of law,or that application of the trial court interpretation is not supported by substantial evidence.we first address the assertion that benefits obtained means gross revenue as a matter of law because that assertion,if correct,renders the alternate claim moot.
at the outset,we note that we did not resolve this issue in bailey i because the trial court in that case awarded bailey damages under section based on the reasonable rental value of the property and rejected bailey claim that damages should be based on the benefit omg obtained by its wrongful occupation of the property.we reversed,and held that damages should be measured by the benefit omg obtained,which we concluded was the gross revenue generated by its sale of advertising space on the billboards because that amount was greater than the reasonable rental value of the property.we based that holding,in part,on the language of section,and,in part,on the fact that omg had not presented any evidence regarding the expenses it incurred in connection with the operation of the signs,and therefore its net income or profit could not be calculated.in this case,omg did present evidence of the expenses it incurred.therefore,the trial court found that the benefit omg received was its profit from the sale of advertising space on the billboards.
resolution of bailey claim in this appeal that,as used in section,the phrase benefits obtained means gross revenue requires us to construe,or interpret,section.statutory interpretation is a question of law,which we conduct de novo.ghirardo antonioli cal th,d.in determining statutory construction we begin with the principle that the objective of the endeavor is to determine and give effect to the legislature purpose in enacting the statute in question.hughes board of architectural examiners cal th,d.
only two cases have discussed the benefits obtained provision of section,subdivision b,neither of which involves the specific issue presented in this appeal,but which both conclude that the phrase includes any financial benefit obtained as a result of the trespass.in the recently decided starrh and starrh cotton growers aera energy llc th,d starrh,the issue was whether benefits obtained was limited to the cost the defendant saved,or did not incur,as a result of the wrongful trespass,such as the cost of properly disposing of the waste water at issue in that case.on appeal,the fifth district held,in pertinent part,that damages under the benefits obtained provision are not so limited and may include profits the trespasser generated that are directly linked to the wrongful trespass.starrh,at,d.
in watson land shell oil th,d watson,the issue was whether benefits obtained included restoration or remediation costs that were paid by a codefendant and therefore were avoided by the trespasser.division two of the second district held that benefits obtained do not include the avoidance of remediation costs because remediation is a separate component of the damages specified in subdivision a of section.if benefits include the cost of remediation and the value of the use of the money saved,as the plaintiff suggests then the language permitting recovery of the reasonable cost of repair or restoration would be surplusage,subd.a.watson,at,d.
both starrh and watson based their interpretations on the legislature intent as evidenced by the legislative history of section.that history reveals that before,section stated,in pertinent part,that,the detriment caused by the wrongful occupation of real property is deemed to be the value of the use of the property for the time of such occupation.stats,ch.in,the legislature amended the section,first,by designating the above quoted language as subdivision a and,next,by adding to that language that the detriment is deemed to include the value of the use of the property for the time of that wrongful occupation,the reasonable cost of repair or restoration of the property to its original condition,and the costs,if any,of recovering the possession,subd.a,as amended by stats,ch.the amendment also added subdivision b,which specifically defines the value of the use of the property to mean the greater of the reasonable rental value of that property or the benefits obtained by the person wrongfully occupying the property,and that the value of the use of the property is the reasonable rental value if the wrongful occupation is the result of a mistake of fact on the part of the wrongful occupier,subd.b,as amended by stats,ch.
the amendment was sponsored by a resolution of the conference of delegates of the california state bar association.its author explained in a letter to the state bar legislative counsel that the resolution provides a definition for the value of the use which eliminates section economic incentive to dump toxic waste when the rental value of the property on which the waste is dumped is cheaper than the cost of disposal.the value of the use would be the greater of the reasonable rental value or the benefits obtained by the trespasser by reason of the trespass.the measure of damages would take into account the benefit obtained by the cost saved by not properly disposing the pollutants.watson,supra,th at,d.the state bar resolution prompted assembly bill reg.sess.pursuant to which section was amended in.see watson,supra,at,d.
the legislative history demonstrates that the legislature intended to eliminate financial incentives for trespass by eradicating the benefit associated with the wrongful use of another land.watson,supra,th at,d.the amendment created not only a measure of damages for the property owner,but an economic disincentive to the polluters.starrh,supra,th at,d.
in this case,omg wrongfully occupied bailey leasehold in order to conduct a business enterprise on the property,to sell advertising space on billboards.the financial incentive for operating such a business is to generate profit.bailey argues that gross revenue is the financial disincentive or the benefit obtained in such a situation.to support that claim,bailey relies on starrh,supra,for the general,and unremarkable,proposition that section should not be read narrowly given the legislature intent in enacting the statute.as previously discussed,starrh held that benefits obtained includes profits the trespasser enjoyed that are directly linked to the wrongful trespass.starrh,supra,th at,d.starrh does not address gross revenue.
bailey also cites cases involving the wrongful extraction of minerals in which damages are measured according to a harsh rule,applied when the misappropriation is willful,or a mild rule,which is applied when the extraction is unintentional or a mistake.see whittaker otto d.under this mild rule,the measure of damages is the value of the ore extracted less the costs incurred by the defendants in the mining,transportation,and smelting of the converted ore,citations,since this constitutes the value of the ore in place.id.at.under the harsh rule,the measure of damages is the value of the ore without deductions for the previously noted costs of production,what the whittaker court describes as the net value of the ore converted without deduction for defendant cost of mining,transportation,and smelting.whittaker otto,supra,at.bailey argues that like the cited cases,when the defendant wrongful occupation is intentional,as in this case,the benefit obtained should be the harsh measure of damages and that harsh measure is gross revenue.
as set out above,section,subdivision b specifies the mild measure of damage that applies when the trespass is the result of a mistake of fact,and therefore is unintentional or inadvertent.in that situation damages are measured by the reasonable rental value of the property.see,subd.b.therefore,the mining cases do not aid our analysis because they do not necessarily exclude net income as the measure of damages to calculate the benefit obtained.
bailey also relies on a m records,heilman d,a case in which the trial court imposed a constructive trust on the gross receipts the defendants received as a result of their misappropriation and sale of pirated music recordings.in affirming both the damage award and the remedy,the court of appeal noted that the defendants conduct amounted to conversion of the plaintiff intangible personal property,and cited the rule that,one who misappropriates the property of another is not entitled to deduct any of the costs of the transactions by which he accomplished his wrongful conduct.id.at.the court also noted a separate reason for not allowing the defendants to deduct had not met their burden to produce evidence of the costs they had incurred,and therefore it was impossible to verify their alleged expenses,fn.
omg did not misappropriate and sell bailey leasehold it wrongfully occupied it and then enabled lamar to wrongfully occupy it.in other words,omg did not represent that it was the sublessor and on that basis collect rent from lamar for its use and occupation of bailey leasehold.until section was amended in,the damages recoverable for the wrongful use of real property belonging to another were measured by the reasonable rental value of the property.by amending section to include the benefits obtained as a measure of damages,the legislature did not intend to punish the wrongful occupier.the legislative history,recounted above,indicates that the purpose of the amendment was to discourage the dumping of toxic waste on vacant land with little or no rental value by eliminating the financial benefit gained by that dumping.
bailey contrary view notwithstanding,a person or business entity is not likely to wrongfully occupy land and operate a business merely in order to break even at the end of the effort.our conclusion that the profit omg generated while wrongfully occupying bailey property is the benefit it obtained is consistent with the legislature intent in enacting section.in other words,we can not say that,as a matter of law,and without regard to any other circumstance,the benefit obtained is necessarily and in all instances the gross revenue generated by a trespassing business enterprise.in reaching this conclusion,we do not place the burden on bailey to prove omg profit.we hold only that when,as in this case,the defendant presents credible evidence of the expenses it incurred,the trial court may offset those expenses against the gross income generated and award the profit as the benefit obtained under section.conversely,when the trespassing defendant does not present such evidence,a trial court may award damages based on gross revenue as the benefit obtained by the wrongful occupation of land for the purpose of operating a business.
damages recoverable from omga.omg net profit on billboard leases 
because we can not say as a matter of law that benefits obtained means gross revenue,we can not say that the trial court erred in this case by awarding bailey damages against omg based on the net revenue,or profit,generated by its wrongful occupation of bailey leasehold interest.nor do we agree with bailey assertion that even if not correct as a matter of law,gross revenue should be the measure of the benefit obtained in this case given omg outrageous conduct.in other words,bailey contends we should conclude that a punitive measure of damages is warranted under the facts of this case.as discussed above,the legislative history of section does not support an interpretation that the benefits obtained measure of damages is intended to punish the wrongful occupier.but even if a punitive interpretation were appropriate under certain circumstances,the trial court in this case denied bailey request for punitive damages,and in doing so effectively resolved the factual issue underlying bailey argument.in another case,the facts might support a trial court award of gross revenue as the benefit obtained as a result of the wrongful occupation of property.however,the trial court in this case found otherwise,and we must affirm that finding because it is supported by substantial evidence.hill national collegiate athletic cal th,d.
our conclusion that the phrase benefits obtained as used in section,subdivision b means net revenue or profit,and omg presented evidence to show its net profit,evidence that bailey does not challenge on appeal,requires us to affirm this aspect of the damage award.the remaining issue is whether the proceeds of omg sale of the billboards to lamar are also benefits omg obtained as a result of its wrongful occupation of bailey property.
proceeds of omg sale to lamar 
bailey claimed in the trial court,as he does on appeal,that the proceeds from omg sale of the billboards to lamar are a benefit obtained by omg by reason of its wrongful occupation of bailey leasehold,and as such should have been included in the damages the trial court awarded to bailey.the trial court found that the proceeds of the sale were not a benefit obtained by reason of omg occupation of bailey land but rather as a result of omg fraudulent representation to lamar that it had a valid leasehold interest in the property that it could assign to lamar.in other words,the trial court found there was no causal connection between omg wrongful occupation of land and the benefit obtained.we agree with the trial court.
because the pertinent facts are undisputed,we may resolve the causation issue as a question of law.see kurinij hanna morton th,d although causation generally presents question of fact,it becomes question of law when facts are undisputed and there is no room for a reasonable difference of opinion.
there was no causal connection between omg wrongful occupation of bailey leasehold and lamar willingness to purchase omg billboards.lamar interest in purchasing the billboards was the result of omg representation that it had the right to keep the billboards in place on bailey leasehold until,when the purported sublease expired.lamar not only purchased the billboard structures but also omg future right to occupy bailey leasehold.therefore,the purchase price omg received from lamar was not a benefit obtained by reason of omg wrongful occupation of bailey leasehold.rather,the purchase price was a benefit omg obtained as a result of its wrongful representation that it had the right to occupy the leasehold in the future and therefore could assign that right to lamar.
omg misrepresentation to lamar regarding its right to occupy bailey property most likely increased the value of the billboards and presumably affected the price lamar paid omg.if lamar paid more for the billboards than they were worth because of omg misrepresentation,that is a matter for lamar to resolve with omg.bailey is not entitled to the proceeds of omg sale of the billboards to lamar because those proceeds are not a benefit omg received by reason of its wrongful occupation of the property.accordingly,and for the reasons discussed above,we will affirm the damage award against omg.
damages recoverable from lamar 
the trial court found that bailey could only recover damages against lamar measured by the reasonable rental value of the property,as specified in section,subdivision b,because bailey was equitably estopped from applying the benefits obtained measure of damages against lamar,and in any event lamar occupancy of the property was the result of a mistake of fact,that fact being lamar belief that omg had a valid sublease agreement with bailey that omg,in turn,had assigned to lamar.bailey challenges both findings on various grounds.we agree with his assertion that the trial court incorrectly found that bailey was equitably estopped from claiming damages under the benefits obtained measure of damages because the evidence is insufficient to support application of the doctrine.
equitable estoppel 
equitable estoppel,originally known as estoppel in pais,and also called estoppel by conduct,is simply stated.whenever a party has,by his own statement or conduct,intentionally and deliberately led another to believe a particular thing true and to act upon such belief,he is not,in any litigation arising out of such statement or conduct,permitted to contradict it.citations.the doctrine is defensive in nature only,and operates to prevent one party from taking an unfair advantage of another.citation.whether there is an estoppel is chiefly a question of fact.citation.there must be a representation or concealment of material facts made with knowledge,actual or virtual,of the facts,to a party ignorant,actually and permissibly,of the truth,with the intent,actual or virtual,that the latter act upon it,and the party must have been induced to act upon it.citation.san diego mun.credit union smith d,citing,among other things,witkin,summary of cal.law ed.equity.
the trial court found with respect to lamar that bailey was equitably estopped from utilizing the benefits obtained measure of damages under section.bailey sent countless letters to lamar,returning their rent checks and pointing out that no lease existed,but never asked them to take down the advertising from the billboards,or to remove the billboards.bailey testified that he wanted to negotiate a lease with lamar but it was clear from the evidence that he made it impossible to negotiate by demanding var
