after obtaining habeas relief from the missouri supreme court,joseph amrine brought this action under against prison investigator george brooks deputy sheriff john hemeyer,prosecutor thomas brown,iii,and prosecution investigator richard lee for their roles in the investigation which led to his conviction for murder and sentence to death.the district court denied amrine leave to file a third amended complaint and granted summary judgment to defendants brown and lee on the basis of prosecutorial immunity and to brooks and hemeyer on the basis of qualified immunity.amrine appeals from the dismissal of his claims against brooks and hemeyer.we affirm.
amrine was convicted in april of the murder of fellow inmate gary barber in the missouri state penitentiary.barber was stabbed to death at approximately on october,in a multipurpose room,in which he as well as amrine and to other inmates were spending their recreation period.amrine had learned from inmate terry russell the previous week that barber had been spreading a rumor about having had sex with amrine when he was passed out from drinking alcohol.when amrine and russell confronted barber about the rumor,russell and barber ended up fighting.both barber and russell were placed in detention cells and not released until on october,the day of the killing.
at the time barber was stabbed officer john noble was guarding a locked door which was the only entrance in and out of the multipurpose room.amrine claims that russell was also in the room,but appellees contend that he was not.around officer noble saw barber chase another inmate from the back of the room to the front near where noble was standing.noble saw an type weapon in barber hand and only realized that barber had been stabbed when he collapsed near him.noble retrieved the weapon from the floor,opened the locked door,and called for sergeant dobson who was stationed just outside the room.dobson went in and ordered an immediate lockdown of the room so that no inmate could either leave or enter.prison guidelines required officers to compile a list of every inmate in a lockdown room.the rest of the prison was also locked down.
officer danny bowers entered the multipurpose room after the lockdown,and noble pointed out russell as the inmate whom barber was chasing.officer bowers took russell from the room out into the hall,searched him,and later escorted him to an office for questioning.the parties disagree about whether noble correctly identified the person barber was chasing.noble asked the inmate barber was chasing for his name he replied russell.brooks and hemeyer contend,however,that it was amrine who answered with russell name.the two men apparently had similar skin tone,physical characteristics,and hairstyle.officer noble testified in a deposition that he was certain that the person barber was chasing was russell.
appellee george brooks,an investigator for the missouri department of corrections,learned of the stabbing almost immediately.he spoke to officer noble,who told him that barber had been chasing russell,that barber and russell had been fighting,and that both had just been released from confinement earlier that day.officers searched the multipurpose room several times while the inmates were still in the room,and no blood or other physical evidence was found except where barber collapsed.brooks performed his own search of the room and found nothing.brooks ordered that all inmates be searched as they left the room and that the room be searched again afterwards.officers also searched the area outside the room without success.
brooks then went to talk with russell.he stripsearched him,found nothing suspicious,and did not question him about the stabbing.after brooks received information from a confidential source saying that he should investigate amrine for the murder because there had been talk that morning that he would attack barber,brooks verified that amrine was on the list of inmates who had been in the multipurpose room.he then spoke with captain hallford,an officer in the supermax unit where the incident had occurred,who told him that amrine was the man we should be looking at.brooks then spoke with amrine.he stripsearched him and observed a small red spot on his pants and three spots on his undershirt.brooks took amrine clothing into custody the spots appeared to be blood,but they were not fresh and were never identified as barber blood.
deputy john hemeyer,cole county deputy sheriff,arrived shortly after brooks took amrine clothing into custody.hemeyer was involved in all the interviews and investigation from that point forward.brooks and hemeyer began to question amrine at amrine denied stabbing barber and said that he had never gotten close to barber so the spots on his clothing could not be from him.they terminated his interview without asking death penalty qualifying questions although hemeyer later testified that they had intended to ask them but forgot.amrine was placed in a detention cell for the investigation of murder.
brooks and hemeyer interviewed russell at russell admitted to his fight with barber the previous week.he also said that amrine had wanted to stab barber to pay him back for spreading rumors about him but could not do it when barber was in isolation.although officer noble had told brooks that he saw barber chase russell,the two investigators did not ask russell any questions about the stabbing.at they took a formal statement from him.he admitted to being in the multipurpose room at the beginning of the recreation period,but he claimed that he was not inside at the time of the stabbing.he stated that he had asked noble for permission to leave the room to get aspirin and that noble gave him permission and opened the door for him russell said that he went to the control center where the sergeant on duty gave him aspirin in a brown medicine bag and that he had been talking with another inmate named peebles at the time sergeant dobson yelled for a stretcher.russell returned to the multipurpose room,and noble initially refused to let him enter.russell also claimed that he asked amrine why he had stabbed barber and that amrine said,i had to do it.
hemeyer later testified that he had had doubts about russell story at the time,but he and brooks never located the brown medicine bag which russell claimed to have obtained after noble let him out of the multipurpose room.they also did not talk to the sergeant who purportedly gave russell the aspirin,did not identify the inmate called peebles,and never questioned officer noble about the inconsistencies between his identification of russell and russell claim that he was not in the room or between russell statement that noble let him back in the room after the lockdown and noble testimony that he let no one reenter.
at on october brooks and hemeyer began their second interview with amrine and asked the death penalty qualifying questions overlooked earlier.amrine denied stabbing barber and said that he had been playing cards with other inmates at the time of the attack.after this interview,amrine was returned to a detention cell and remained in segregated confinement until his trial in april.
on october brooks and hemeyer interviewed inmate jerry poe,a schizophrenic who told them he feared for his life.poe said that he believed that his life was threatened because of barber killing and that he would only give a statement if he were moved to protective custody.poe gave a statement about the stabbing which conflicted with other evidence.he was the only witness to testify that someone wiped blood off of barber face with a towel,and no towel was ever found.brooks and hemeyer showed poe pictures of inmates and asked him to identify the person chased by barber.on the day of the stabbing poe had seen the officers take amrine from his cell,and he knew that amrine was a suspect.when poe was shown an eight year old picture of amrine,he stated i want to say that he the one that stabbed barber,but i ca be positive from this picture.brooks asked him to flip over the picture where poe saw amrine name,prison number,and the date of the picture.when asked if he was sure about his identification of barber murderer,poe indicated that he was.after he spoke to brooks and hemeyer,he was transferred to the county jail.
russell took a polygraph exam on october.brooks final investigative report indicates that russell polygraph was truthful,but russell later testified at an evidentiary hearing that the polygraph indicated a conflicted answer as to whether or not he had been in the multipurpose room when the stabbing occurred.this evidence was not presented in the jury trial.the polygraph also showed that russell gave a truthful answer when he denied stabbing barber.at a later evidentiary hearing russell stated that he had not wanted to testify against amrine at his murder trial because he did not know if amrine had actually stabbed barber,but that brooks and hemeyer threatened to charge him with the murder if he did not.
brooks and hemeyer also interviewed inmates dodson,willis,jordan,crume,ball,and hines on october,but none of them said they had seen the stabbing.while inmates crume and hines said they had seen barber chase amrine,ball said that amrine had been playing cards with him when barber was stabbed,and jordan said that amrine was standing next to him at the poker table at the time.
despite the inconsistencies,brooks and hemeyer did not do any further investigation before brooks submitted his investigative report dated december.his report concluded that it appeared that amrine had stabbed barber.subsequently on january,brooks met with inmate jordan who changed his earlier story and now said that amrine had stabbed barber and then was chased around the room by him.brooks and prosecution investigator lee interviewed inmate wayne garrison on april.at first garrison said that he had not seen the stabbing but had seen barber chasing amrine later in the interview he said that he saw amrine stab barber.lee and brooks interviewed inmate henry belk on april,belk also stated that barber had been chasing amrine.they also interviewed randy ferguson,who refused to say anything on tape until prosecutor brown agreed to drop a weapon charge against him he then told brooks and lee that amrine stabbed barber and was the man being chased.
a jury convicted amrine of barber murder on april,and he was sentenced to death on may.the state case rested on the testimony of inmates russell,poe,and ferguson.officer noble testified that he saw barber chase russell across the room,and six inmates testified that amrine was playing poker with them in a different part of the room when the stabbing occurred.three of those inmates identified russell as the person barber had been chasing.none of the six named amrine.amrine conviction and sentence were upheld on direct appeal,state amrine,and he unsuccessfully sought post conviction relief.amrine state.at an evidentiary hearing during post conviction proceedings both russell and ferguson had recanted their trial testimony,but poe did not appear or testify.
amrine then filed a federal habeas petition.after the petition was denied by the district court,amrine obtained new counsel who located poe and produced an affidavit from him.in that affidavit poe completely recanted his trial testimony and swore that he had not seen amrine stab barber and that he had falsely identified amrine.after reviewing the voluminous record,we concluded that amrine had made a showing of actual innocence.amrine bowersox,cir en banc.we therefore reversed and remanded for an evidentiary hearing in the federal district court.
on remand the district court heard testimony from poe,as well as from russell,ferguson,another inmate named kevin dean,and officer noble.after finding that poe testimony was unreliable,the district court again denied the petition.we affirmed,based on the district court credibility findings.amrine bowersox,cir.the missouri supreme court later concluded that there was clear and convincing evidence that amrine was actually innocent of barber murder,granted him habeas relief,and set aside his conviction and sentence.state ex rel amrine roper.
amrine filed this action in december,alleging violation of procedural due process,conspiracy,and malicious prosecution.after defendants moved for summary judgment and amrine moved to file a third amended complaint asserting a substantive due process claim,the district court denied amrine motion and granted that of the defendants.it dismissed the claims against brown and lee on the basis of prosecutorial immunity and concluded that the actions of brooks and hemeyer were supported by probable cause or at least arguable probable cause and that they were therefore entitled to qualified immunity.since amrine had not pled substantive due process,his reckless investigation claim was dismissed,and the district court determined that brooks and hemeyer had not violated amrine procedural due process rights by bad faith withholding of exculpatory evidence from the prosecutors.amrine appeals the summary judgment granting brooks and hemeyer qualified immunity on his procedural due process claim,which the district court had construed to allege a fourth amendment violation 
amrine contends on appeal that the only reliable evidence showed that he was actually innocent of the stabbing and that the district court erred by granting qualified immunity to brooks and hemeyer because they had violated his clearly established right not to be arrested without probable cause.amrine also argues that his due process claim stated a substantive due process violation even though it was labeled as procedural and that the district court erred by denying him leave to file a third amended complaint.he asserts that any delay would not have unfairly prejudiced appellees and that the amendment would not have been futile.

qualified immunity is a defense available to government officials if they have not violated clearly established statutory or constitutional rights of which a reasonable person would have known.young selk,cir citation omitted see harlow fitzgerald,d.it allows officers to make reasonable errors so that they do not always err on the side of caution for fear of being sued.habiger city of fargo,cir.citation omitted,cert.denied,d see davis scherer,d.this defense provides ample room for mistaken judgments by protecting all but the plainly incompetent or those who knowingly violate the law.malley briggs,d.
when considering whether a state official is entitled to qualified immunity,we first determine whether the alleged facts,viewed in the light most favorable to the injured party,demonstrate that the official conduct violated a constitutional right.see saucier katz,d.if the answer to that inquiry is yes,we next ask whether the constitutional right was clearly established at the time so that a reasonable officer would have understood that his conduct violated that right.id.at.amrine submits that his placement in restrictive confinement by brooks and hemeyer on october,following their miranda warnings was an arrest violating his fourth amendment right to be free from unreasonable seizure because it was not supported by probable cause 
prison officials may place inmates in segregated confinement without implicating protected liberty interests so long as the confinement does not impose atypical and significant hardship on the inmate in relation to the ordinary incidents of prison life.sandin conner,d.sandin involved application of a state prison regulation rather than an alleged deprivation of a fundamental right,however,and we have not had occasion to consider whether placement in a detention cell within a prison on suspicion of commission of a crime qualifies as an arrest for the purpose of the fourth amendment probable cause requirement.cases from other circuits suggest tha
