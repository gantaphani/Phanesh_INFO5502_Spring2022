background 
prior to the operation at issue,malmberg suffered from symptoms primarily in his left arm weakness,numbness and tingling.he did not demonstrate any symptoms typically associated with spinal cord compression.on november,malmberg underwent surgery at the va to remove a degenerative disc and osteophytes bony outgrowths usually associated with cartilage degeneration.when he awoke from anesthesia,malmberg complained that his legs were weak.and an mri revealed that he suffered from mild cord impingement at several points in his spine,with excessive edema in the spinal cord.he was diagnosed with incomplete quadriplegia.
persons wishing to sue the federal government for money damages for personal injury must do so pursuant to the ftca,which requires putative plaintiffs to first file an administrative claim.a.malmberg filed his administrative claim in january.the va effectively denied the claim by failing to act on it within six months.id.the failure of an agency to make final disposition of a claim within six months after it is filed shall,at the option of the claimant any time thereafter,be deemed a final denial of the claim for purposes of this section.in august,malmberg sued the united states for the injuries he sustained.the district court bifurcated the trial at malmberg request,and found the va liable for malmberg injuries after the first portion of the trial.malmberg united states,d.
in december,the district court held a bench trial to set the amount of damages.the plaintiff evidence indicated that before the november surgery,malmberg lived independently,although he was not employed because of the radiculopathy.he testified that prior to the surgery,he enjoyed an array of activities,socialized regularly and did not have problems with his legs,right arm,bladder or bowel,malmberg has no use of his legs,can not stand,and is confined to a wheelchair for the rest of his life.he must now use a catheter,which needs to be inserted up to times a day,gets repeated urinary tract infections and lacks control over his bowels.malmberg testified that he suffers from pain daily,ranging from a to on a to scale.as his condition is not expected to improve,and will likely worsen,he will need assistance with daily living tasks for the rest of his life.
the district court ultimately awarded malmberg for past pain and suffering,million for future pain and suffering,and in economic damages.the district court offset the economic damages award for future medical care by subtracting out for medical care and supplies that would be provided for free by the.the district court declined to offset the award for the costs of home health services provided by contractors but paid for by the.finally,the district court denied malmberg renewed motion to increase his ad damnum clause.this appeal followed.
discussion 
following a bench trial,we review the factual findings of the district court for clear error and its legal conclusions de novo.petereit thomas,cir.
offset for medical care and supplies to be provided by the va.
the district court offset malmberg economic damages award by both the amount of past services provided by the va,as well as the cost of future services that the va will continue to provide free of charge.the district court found that the government should not be forced to pay for services that the va could provide for free,although it is not clear whether it relied on federal or state law in reaching its conclusion.because of this,and because the government argues that such an offset is required by both federal and state law,we address each.
as he did below,malmberg concedes that the offset for past medical services he received is proper.however,malmberg challenges the district court offset against the award for future medical services,arguing such an offset is not required under either federal or state law,and that he should not be forced by financial constraints to receive medical care from the tortfeasor responsible for his injuries.whether such an offset against an award for future medical costs is required in our circuit is an open issue.there are competing rationales militating for and against such an offset.on the one hand,as the government reminds us,it is axiomatic that the government does not pay twice for the same injury.brooks united states.on the other hand,it is,as this court has recognized,particularly unseemly to force a plaintiff to receive medical services from the tortfeasor responsible for his injuries.ulrich veterans admin,cir.
ulrich also involved a veteran who suffered an injury as a result of malpractice while being treated at a veteran administration medical center.there,the district court refused without explanation to award future medical damages.in urging reversal,the appellant argued that he was denied future medical expenses in part because the trial court believed the va will provide him with free medical care in the future.id.unable to discern from the record the reason for the district court decision to withhold such an award,the ulrich court remanded with directions 
it should be pointed out that any award for future medical expenses should not be limited on the ground that,as a veteran,plaintiff is entitled to free va medical care,hospitalization,and institutionalization.he is not obligated to seek medical care from the party whose negligence created his need for such care simply because that party offers it without charge.moreover,it is not relevant that ulrich has sought treatment from va hospitals in the past.he has a right to select a doctor or private hospital of his own choice for his future medical needs.thus,the district court failure to award future medical expenses was erroneous if and to the extent it relied on the premise that the va will provide plaintiff free care in the future.that this might result in a windfall for him is a matter for congress,not the courts.

the government,viewing the language in ulrich as dicta,urges reliance on a later case,morgan united states,cir.in morgan,the plaintiff was also a veteran awarded damages after he sought to recover under the ftca for injuries as a result of medical malpractice at a va hospital.this court held that the damages award must be reduced by any amount awarded to the plaintiff under now,which requires the government to make certain disability benefits payments to veterans injured through the fault of the.id.at.the morgan court so held because section required that when a veteran received a judgment as the result of such a disability,disability payments made pursuant to section were to be withheld until the aggregate amount of benefits which would be paid but for this sentence equals the total amount included in such judgment,settlement,or compromise.at quoting.the issue in morgan was whether the phrase total amount included in such judgment was intended,as the government argue d,to encompass the total amount of any ftca award to a veteran for injuries resulting from va medical treatment or was intended instead,as plaintiffs argue d,to refer only to that portion of such an ftca award which represents the veteran lost earnings.id.at.the court concluded that total amount means the total,not merely the lost earnings component.id.in so doing,it relied on the express language of the statute,coupled with legislative history for section stat ing that the goal of the setoff provision was to preclude duplicate recoveries for the same disability or death.id.at.the government argues that morgan requires an offset here,because allowing an award for future medical care that could be provided by the veteran administration represents a potential duplicate recovery.
however,morgan is distinguishable.morgan addressed only the scope of the statutorily required setoff for section then section benefits.section disability benefits are a separate category of benefits,provided only to veterans injured as a result of care provided by the veteran administration,from the medical care provided to all veterans by virtue of their service to the united states,which is provided for in.the statutory language and legislative history of section both express a clear desire by congress to limit duplicative recoveries.this desire makes sense,given that section disability benefits are an administrative remedy for veterans injured or killed while receiving care at veteran administration hospitals,and a recovery under the ftca is essentially the same remedy.absent from the language and legislative history for section is the language prohibiting duplicative recoveries found in section.it is one thing to require an offset for benefits that are meant to provide an alternative to tort damages,and another thing entirely to require an offset that would force a veteran to continue to receive medical care from his tortfeasor.
nor do we find support for the government position in brooks united states.there,the supreme court considered whether service members,who may not sue the united states for injuries received during their service,may sue for injuries not incident to their service.id.at.answering in the affirmative,the court remanded the case to the fourth circuit to consider,in the first instance,whether an offset should be taken for past medical care or disability benefits,noting that its holding 
does not mean that the amount payable under servicemen benefit laws should not be deducted,or taken into consideration,when the serviceman obtains judgment under the tort claims act.without the benefit of argument in this court,or discussion of the matter in the court of appeals,we now see no indication that congress meant the united states to pay twice for the same injury.certain elements of tort damages may be the equivalent of elements taken into account in providing disability payments.it would seem incongruous,at first glance,if the united states should have to pay in tort for hospital expenses it had already paid,for example.
id.at.on remand,the fourth circuit held that it was proper to offset any award for hospital or medical expenses which the government has paid or on account of loss of earning power for the period for which he has drawn army pay.it seems equally clear that the award should be diminished by the amount which he has received or is to receive from the government by way of disability benefits.united states brooks,cir.the fourth circuit made no mention of an offset for future medical costs.
the seventh circuit examined the supreme court decision in brooks in molzof united states,cir.there,plaintiff was injured as a result of medical malpractice at a va hospital,suffering irreversible brain damage that required continued hospitalization.id.at.the district court,relying on brooks,found that requiring the government to pay for care that the va could provide for free would constitute punitive damages,which are barred by the ftca.id.the seventh circuit affirmed,but the supreme court reversed,concluding that the ftca bars the recovery only of what are legally considered punitive damages under traditional principles.molzof united states,d.on remand,the seventh circuit found 
brooks is not controlling.in the present case,the supreme court decided,at least implicitly,that nothing under the ftca or other provision of federal law prohibited the government from paying twice for future medical expenses.the court concluded that awarding future expenses in the light of free care was not punitive.whether such an award is permissible,the court indicated,was a matter of state law.thus,the issue with which we are confronted on remand is not what congress intended,but rather whether state law,in particular,wisconsin law,permits double payment.

we agree,and hold that federal law does not require an offset against a veteran damages award for future medical care that could be provided at a va facility.federal law disfavors an outcome whereby a litigant is obligated to seek medical care from the party whose negligence created his need for such care simply because that party offers it without charge.ulrich,at.see also feeley united states,cir same.as aptly stated by the third circuit 
a victim of another tort is entitled,we think,to choose,within reasonable limits,his own doctor and place of confinement,if such care is necessary.to force a plaintiff to choose between accepting public aid or bearing the expense of rehabilitation himself is an unreasonable choice.the plaintiff may not be satisfied with the public facilities he may feel that a particular private physician is superior in the future because of conditions he may not even be able to receive timely care.these are only a few of many considerations with which an individual may be faced in selecting treatment.the plaintiff past use of the government facilities does not ensure his future use of them.he will now have the funds available to him to enable him to seek private care.he should not be denied this opportunity.
our analysis,however,does not end there.damages in ftca actions are determined by the law of the state in which the tort occurred,ulrich,at,so even if federal law does not require an offset we must next consider whether such an offset is warranted under state law.in new york,collateral source payments are governed by cplr,which,at the time malmberg commenced the instant suit,provided in relevant part that 
in any action brought to recover damages for personal injury where the plaintiff seeks to recover for the cost of medical care,dental care,custodial care or rehabilitation services,loss of earnings or other economic loss,evidence shall be admissible for consideration by the court to establish that any such past or future cost or expense was or will,with reasonable certainty,be replaced or indemnified,in whole or in part,from any collateral source such as insurance except for life insurance,social security except those benefits provided under title xviii of the social security act,workers compensation or employee benefit programs except such collateral sources entitled by law to liens against any recover of the plaintiff.if the court finds that any such cost or expense was or will,with reasonable certainty,be replaced or indemnified from any collateral source,it shall reduce the amount of the award by such finding,minus an amount equal to the premiums paid by the plaintiff for such benefits for the period immediately preceding the accrual of such action and minus an amount equal to the projected future cost to the plaintiff of maintaining such benefits.
c mckinney 
at common law,a plaintiff award for economic damages such as medical costs was not offset by payments from collateral sources such as insurance.oden chemung cty.indus.dev.agency.the traditional rule was based on the premise that a negligent defendant should not,in fairness,be permitted to reduce its liability by the proceeds of insurance or some other source to which that defendant has not contributed.id.at.the rule was abrogated by statute,and as section c is a statute enacted in derogation of the common law it is to be strictly construed in the narrowest sense that its words and underlying purposes permit.id.at.
section is silent as to the issue before us whether an injured plaintiff is subject to an offset because he is entitled to receive services from a tortfeasor responsible for his injuries.the parties do not cite,and we have not found,any cases dealing with the applicability of section to medical services provided by the veteran administration.
the plain language of section,however,suggests that a tortfeasor offer to provide a plaintiff with free medical services at the torfeasor facility does not warrant an offset against the damages award.section provides for a reduction of the damages award with respect to costs of medical care i f the court finds that any such cost or expense was or will,with reasonable certainty,be replaced or indemnified from any collateral source.if the plaintiff seeks medical care from a provider which,as discussed,is his prerogative the costs of that medical care can not be regarded as replaced or indemnified merely because the plaintiff elected not to accept the opportunity to receive free medical care from the.indeed,the government has not demonstrated that,under these circumstances,plaintiff future medical care costs will,with reasonable certainty,be replaced or indemnified from any collateral source.
moreover,in an analogous context,several new york trial courts have declined to offset awards intended to provide plaintiffs with medical services in the future,in part because such an offset would deprive plaintiffs of the ability to choose their own medical services caregiver.in andrialis snyder,an infant injured as a result of the defendants medical malpractice was awarded damages to provide for future medical services,including physical,occupational and speech therapy.misc d.defendants sought an offset pursuant to section on the ground that the infant plaintiff would be eligible under certain circumstances to receive physical therapy,occupational therapy,speech therapy and psychotherapy provided for free from her school district.id.the trial court declined to offset the damages on the grounds that the provision of such services by the state was not reasonably certain,noting that such an offset would mean that 
the parents could not select the therapist.the infant plaintiff would be treated only by those practitioners approved by the board of education and the state education department who would be paid a contractual rate arrived at by competitive bidding.
id.the andrialis court further observed that 
a distinction can be made between insurance policies or statutes that provide payment for medical services by practitioners or institutions selected by the patient and a statute which may provide services by practitioners or institutions selected by a government agency.should a plaintiff who may be entitled to medical services without charge at a veteran administration facility be precluded from recovering for future medical or hospital expenses

the second department expressed a similar reluctance to cabin future treatment choices in the context of considering whether section required an offset where the plaintiff health insurance coverage flowed through her husband employer.kihl pfeffer,dep t.in considering whether it was reasonably certain the insurance coverage would be available in the future,the appellate division noted that her receipt of future collateral source benefits is not within her own control,but rather,is wholly dependent upon the continued employment of her husband.id.while section aimed to prevent double recoveries,it was not meant to enslave a health care beneficiary to a particular employer or insurance provider.id.taking into account that concern,along with other factors,the second department affirmed the trial court decision not to offset,noting that i n many cases,no one factor,standing alone,will necessarily support the grant or denial of collateral source reductions.id.instead,e ach case involving potential future collateral source reductions to awards for economic loss must be judged on its own unique facts and merits.id.
based on the plain language of section,and the unique facts and merits presented here,we vacate the district court decision insofar as it offset malmberg award for future medical services and supplies that could be provided by the va for free.there is,as the andrialis court noted,a difference between insurance policies that allow patients to select their own providers and reimburse payments for those services,and programs that allow government forced by virtue of his finances to continue to accept medical care from the tortfeasor responsible for his injuries.see also molzof,at w e share the reluctance of other courts addressing this issue to deny the plaintiff the freedom to choose his medical provider and,in effect,to compel him to undergo treatment from his tortfeasor.
finally,we find that malmberg satisfaction or lack thereof with the care being provided by the va is simply not relevant to the analysis of whether there should be an offset for future medical services we recognize,as other courts have,that there is some risk of a double recovery to the extent malmberg elects to continue receiving services from the va,but any such concern is for congress and not this court.see ulrich,at feeley,at.as we find that the district court improperly offset malmberg damages award to the extent that it offset for future medical services and supplies that could be provided by the va for free,we need not reach malmberg arguments that either the government waived its right to an offset by not seeking one until after malmberg rested in the damages trial or that the district court abused its discretion in accepting a late expert report from the government raising the issue for the first time.on remand,the district court shall adjust its damages calculations to no longer offset for the costs of future medical services and supplies.in addition,both parties have noted certain mathematical errors in the district court final damages award,which the district court should correct on remand.

before filing a personal injury lawsuit,the ftca requires a plaintiff to first file an administrative claim with the appropriate federal agency.a.if the federal agency denies the claim,a plaintiff may bring such a lawsuit in federal court,but the damages sought in such a lawsuit may not exceed the amount sought in the administrative claim
