beyond innovation technology company limited bitek,spi electronic company limited and fsp group collectively,and lien chang electronic enterprise company limited lien chang appeal a final judgment by the united states district court for the eastern district of texas.micro int l beyond innovation tech,wl.a jury found that willfully induced the infringement of claims,and of patent the patent,claims and of patent the patent,and claims,and of patent the patent,all of which are owned by micro international micro.the district court entered a final judgment and permanent injunction.for the reasons explained below,we vacate and remand for further proceedings.
background 
the are directed to converter circuits,which convert low voltage direct current dc into higher voltage alternating current ac.also called inverter controllers,these circuits may be used to control the amount of power delivered to cold cathode fluorescent lamps ccfls that are used to backlight the screens of laptop computers and televisions.when powered by a battery or other dc power source,a ccfl uses a converter circuit because ccfls are designed to run on ac power.the describe a converter circuit that employs a feedback control loop to control the amount of power delivered from the dc power source the drive to the ccfl the load.
as shown in figure of the patent,the converter circuit includes a number of switches placed between the drive and the load.drive circuitry associated with each switch determines when and how long a given switch will be turned on on time.if a pair of switches along a conduction path are on simultaneously,the circuit will deliver more power to the load.thus,by adjusting the overlap between switches on times,the circuit can precisely control the amount of power delivered to the load.
patent figure 
the converter circuit uses a feedback control loop to affect the switches on times.to the feedback control loop,the converter circuit provides a feedback signal fb indicative of the total current and,thus,power at the load and a reference voltage ref indicative of the desired load conditions for example,the desired total current at the load.an error amplifier compares the feedback signal fb and the reference voltage ref to produce a comparison signal cmp.during normal operation,the drive circuitry receives the comparison signal and may use it to adjust the switches on times,thereby regulating the power to the load.
to protect the circuitry from damage during an condition such as when a ccfl breaks or becomes disconnected,the feedback signal fb may also be compared to a reference value not shown in figure at the current sense comparator.this reference value preferably reflects the minimum or maximum current permitted by the system.thus,when the value of the feedback signal fb is within a permitted range,during normal operation,the current sense comparator allows the comparison signal cmp to flow through switch however,when the value of the feedback signal is outside that range,during an open circuit or short circuit condition,the current sense comparator substitutes a minimum voltage vmin for the comparison signal cmp at switch.in the latter case,the minimum voltage minimizes the overlap of the switches on times,reducing the power to a safer level while avoiding shutdown if the lamp remains operable.
during prosecution of the application,the examiner rejected the patent under as unpatentable over a combination of patent to kawabata kawabata and patent to gradzki gradzki.the examiner observed that the feedback loop described in the originally filed claims was obvious,stating that gradzki et teaches the utilization of the technique for a feedback loop circuit between the load and the drive circuitry supplying a feedback signal indicative of power being supplied to the load.the examiner found that,like the application pending claims,gradzki discloses an inverter controller that regulates lamp power irrespective of the level of the feedback signal.
in response to the examiner rejection,micro added a limitation to each of the independent claims.specifically,micro amended claim of the patent to require that the feedback control loop circuit control the conduction state of the switches only if said feedback signal is above a predetermined threshold the only if limitation.micro provided little explanation for the amendment,stating that i n contrast to the prior art,applicant invention of independent claim requires,inter alia,a converter circuit that includes a feedback control loop circuit adapted to generate a second pulse signal only if said feedback signal is above a predetermined threshold.after receiving this amendment,the examiner issued a notice of allowance.
claim of the patent is representative of the asserted claims for the issues presented by this appeal.as issued,it requires,in relevant part,a converter circuit comprising 
a feedback control loop circuit receiving a feedback signal indicative of power being supplied to said load,and adapted to generate a second signal pulse signal for controlling the conduction state of said second plurality of switches only if said feedback signal is above a predetermined threshold 
accused devices 
bitek manufactures and sells inverter controllers.and lien chang manufacture and sell inverter modules incorporating bitek inverter controllers.micro alleged that four of bitek products,and infringe one or more of the.the parties concede that,for the purposes of this litigation,the first three products,and are the same,and the fourth differs from the others in only one material respect.
bitek inverter controllers have feedback control loops.the controllers are capable of shutting off the feedback signal control over power when a feedback signal falls below a predetermined threshold.the parties dispute whether this feature satisfies the only if limitation recited by the asserted claims,which requires a feedback control loop circuit adapted to generate a second signal pulse signal for controlling the switches only if said feedback signal is above a predetermined threshold.emphasis added.
bitek submits that its inverter controllers do not satisfy this limitation in two circumstances because,during those circumstances,the feedback signal in bitek switch continues to control the power delivered to the load even though the feedback signal falls below the predetermined threshold.the first circumstance is when an unlit lamp lights up called or ignition.bitek asserts that,during the ignition period,the feedback signal is below the predetermined threshold,but the feedback circuit still controls power delivered to the load,in violation of the claims requirements.this first circumstance applies to all four products.the second circumstance applies only to the product,which implements a delay.during this delay period,the feedback circuit is designed to continue to rely on the feedback signal to control the power for microseconds after the feedback signal falls below the predetermined threshold.such a delay was purposely created to ensure that the feedback signal would not cease to control the power to the load because of a temporary fall below the threshold.
on appeal,bitek relies exclusively on these two circumstances to avoid infringement under the claim,asserting that the only if limitation is therefore not satisfied.micro,on the other hand,asserts that this limitation is satisfied by the accused devices.first,micro argues that the claims do not apply in the two circumstances identified by bitek.second,micro disputes bitek allegations regarding the operation of its devices during those circumstances and,consequently,asserts that,even if the claims apply,the accused devices still infringe.
district court proceedings 
in january,micro filed suit against bitek,and lien chang in the united states district court for the eastern district of texas.micro alleges that bitek inverter controllers infringe several claims of the patent,the patent,and the patent.while are foreign entities that operate abroad,inverter controllers and modules are used in monitors sold in the united states.
the district court held a markman hearing in august.the parties agreed,for the most part,that a previously issued claim construction order from a different case pending before the same court controlled in this case.see micro int l sumida,claim construction order construing claim language in the same patents.however,the parties presented a handful of additional terms for the court to construe.the claim term only if one of the additional terms disputed by the parties is the only term whose construction was appealed to this court.
at the markman hearing,argued that the district court should construe the claim term only if,but disagreed regarding what specific meaning should be ascribed to it.bitek and lien chen asserted that only if should mean exclusively or solely in the event that,while defendant asserted that it should mean never except when.in spite of the differences in word choice,seemed to agree that these constructions are substantially identical in meaning.micro,on the other hand,maintained that no construction was necessary because the claim term only if consists of two simple,plain english words.during the hearing,the district court astutely summarized the dispute as concerning whether or not there can be an exception to the only if language.however,in its markman order,the district court ruled that this term needs no construction because it has a definition,capable of application by both the jury and this court in considering the evidence submitted in support of an infringement or invalidity case.micro int l beyond innovation tech.
during proceedings,bitek filed a motion in limine seeking to prevent micro from alleging infringement under the doctrine of equivalents as to the only if limitation,asserting that prosecution history estoppel barred that theory.the district court originally granted this motion,instructing micro to first approach the bench before offering any evidence relating to infringement of the only if limitation under the doctrine of equivalents.micro int l beyond innovation tech.may.however,after considering supplemental briefing,the district court changed course,ruling that micro was allowed to argue that the only if limitation is infringed under the doctrine of equivalents.micro int l beyond innovation tech.may.without any analysis,the district court opinion simply stated,the court is persuaded by argument that the amendment bears only a tangential relationship to the equivalent at issue.id.also citing insituform,cat contracting.
at trial,the only if limitation was a key issue disputed by the parties.micro presented evidence that the accused devices satisfied the only if limitation both literally and under the doctrine of equivalents.presented evidence to the contrary.moreover,both parties presented arguments regarding whether or not the only if claim language allows exceptions.
after trial,the parties submitted proposed verdict forms that asked separate questions regarding literal infringement and infringement under the doctrine of equivalents.the district court generated a jury form containing general questions regarding infringement and included jury instructions explaining that a claim limitation may be satisfied either literally or under the doctrine of equivalents.after deliberations,the jury found that each had induced infringement of each asserted claim of each patent.the jury also found that lien chang contributorily infringed and all three willfully infringed.timely appealed to this court.we have jurisdiction pursuant to a.
ii.discussion 
as noted above,the district court provided a general verdict form that asked the jury whether each defendant infringe d each of the asserted claims.the corresponding jury instructions explained that infringement may be found either literally or under the doctrine of equivalents.on appeal,allege error in both theories of infringement liability.first,contend that the district court failure to construe the claim term only if was legal error that infected the literal infringement inquiry.second,assert that the jury should not have been permitted to find infringement under the doctrine of equivalents.we address each of these arguments in turn.
claim construction 
with respect to literal infringement,the parties dispute whether the district court failure to construe the claim term only if was legal error.as a threshold matter,however,micro argues that waived any challenge to the construction of only if by failing to object to the jury instructions as lacking a construction of that claim term and offering a different construction of the claim term on appeal than was presented to the district court.before addressing the claim construction issue on the merits,we turn to these waiver arguments.
first,micro contends that have waived any challenge to the construction of only if because failed to object to the jury instructions as lacking a construction of that term.micro acknowledges that presented these arguments during the markman hearing and that the district court issued a claim construction order months before trial.micro asserts,however,that a party waives its objections to a claim construction by not objecting to the jury instructions containing or,in this case,lacking that construction.
in response,argue that the purpose of a markman hearing is to determine the meaning of claim terms.a claim construction order always dictates how the court will instruct the jury regarding a claim scope.because these issues were fully litigated and decided at the markman stage of the litigation,assert that no objection to the jury instruction was required to preserve error.we agree.
when the claim construction is resolved,and the patentee presented the same position in the markman proceeding as is now pressed,a further objection to the district court ruling may indeed have been not only futile but unnecessary.cardiac pacemakers,jude,under seventh circuit law.the same holds true in the fifth circuit.taita chem.westlake styrene,lp,cir stating that there is no need to object where a litigant had previously filed sufficient objections rizzo children world learning,cir failure to object to a proposed jury instruction may be disregarded if the party position has previously been made clear to the court and it is plain that a further objection would have been unavailing.bender brumley,cir finding oral objections to the jury charge were not required to preserve objection where appellant had earlier filed written objections to the proffered jury instructions.the district court in this case,as in cardiac pacemakers,rendered a claim construction order following a markman hearing during which the parties positions were fully litigated.because position was previously made clear to the district court and the district court did not clearly indicate that it was open to changing its claim construction,need not have renewed their objections by reasserting them when jury instructions were given.
second,micro also asserts that have waived their proposed claim constructions of only if by asserting a new construction on appeal.contending that current construction is that only if allows for no exceptions,micro notes that the word exception was never used in claim construction briefs.respond by the construction proposed to the district,only if means solely or exclusively in the event that.argue that,while the arguments advanced in support of their construction may have changed,the construction itself remains the same.note that these new arguments simply recognize that the effect of their proposed construction is to prohibit exceptions to the only if limitation.
we agree with that no waiver has occurred.while a waiver may occur if a party raises a new issue on appeal a waiver will not necessarily occur if a party simply presented new or additional arguments in support of the scope of its claim construction ccs fitness,brunswick,citation omitted.propose the same construction on appeal as was presented to the district court.while employ different arguments in support,these new arguments simply incorporate an understanding of the parties dispute that has developed through the course of litigation.at the claim construction hearing,the district court astutely recognized that the dispute boils down to whether the court believe s there can be an exception.thus,we conclude have not waived these arguments.
accordingly,we turn to the merits of appeal of the district court failure to construe the claim term only if.on appeal,argue that the district court failure to construe the claim term only if was error because the parties disputed whether or not this claim language allows for exceptions.assert that,because this presents an issue of claim construction,it is a question of law that must be decided by the court.in view,by failing to provide a construction of this term,the district court effectively submitted a legal question to the jury.also argue that the district court erred by allowing the jury to reach a verdict based upon an erroneous legal,that only if allows exceptions.
micro counters that the claim term only if does not need to be construed because the parties agree that the term is a common term with a common meaning.micro notes that this court has repeatedly held that a district court is not obligated to construe terms with ordinary meanings lest trial courts be inundated with requests to parse the meaning of every word in the asserted claims.
the purpose of claim construction is to determin e the meaning and scope of the patent claims asserted to be infringed.markman westview instruments,en banc,aff,d.when the parties raise an actual dispute regarding the proper scope of these claims,the court,not the jury,must resolve that dispute.see id.at holding that claim construction is a matter of law.
words of a claim are generally given their ordinary and customary meaning,which is the meaning a term would have to a person of ordinary skill in the art after reviewing the intrinsic record at the time of the invention.phillips awh,en banc.in some cases,the ordinary meaning of claim language may be readily apparent even to lay judges,and claim construction in such cases involves little more than the application of the widely accepted meaning of commonly understood words.id.at.however,in many cases,the meaning of a claim term as understood by persons of skill in the art is not readily apparent.id.
in this case,the parties dispute whether or not the only if limitation allows for exceptions.micro asserts that the claims would be understood by one of ordinary skill in the art to only apply to the steady state operation of the switching circuit.disagree and submit that the claims apply at all just to steady state no exceptions.there are two circumstances in which assert that the only if limitation is not satisfied the,phase,and a delay.accordingly,seek a construction that specifies that only if has no exceptions and is not limited to steady state operation.
during the claim construction hearing,the district court acknowledged that this dispute over the scope of the asserted claims boils down to whether i believe there can be an exception.however,the district court declined to construe this term,stating 
the term only if needs no construction aside from the construction previously adopted by the court for the phrases in which the term appears.it is true,as defendants argue,that elekta instrument,scientific international,applies the ordinary meaning of only being solely exclusively to a claim term and evaluates the evidence in that light.nothing in elekta instrument,however,requires the court to construe claim terms that have a meaning.only if has a definition,capable of application by both the jury and this court in considering the evidence submitted in support of an infringement or invalidity case.
micro int l beyond innovation tech,slip op.at.we find this decision to be in error because,while elekta instrument may not require the court to construe this claim term,we find that markman does.
the parties presented a dispute to the district court regarding the scope of the asserted do the patents mean when they say that the feedback signal controls power only if said feedback signal is above a predetermined threshold micro contends that this only if limitation only applies during steady state operation,while contend that the only if limitation applies at all times without exception.this dispute over the scope of the asserted claims is a question of law.in deciding that only if needs no construction because the term has a definition,the district court failed to resolve the parties dispute because the parties disputed not the meaning of the words themselves,but the scope that should be encompassed by this claim language.
a determination that a claim term needs no construction or has the plain and ordinary meaning may be inadequate when a term has more than one ordinary meaning or when reliance on a term ordinary meaning does not resolve the parties dispute.in this case,for example,the parties agreed that only if has a common meaning,but then proceeded to dispute the scope of that claim term,each party providing an argument identifying the alleged circumstances when the requirement specified by the claim term must be satisfied,at all times or during steady state operation.in this case,the ordinary meaning of a term does not resolve the parties dispute,and claim construction requires the court to determine what claim scope is appropriate in the context of the.this court has construed other ordinary words for these and other related reasons.see,nystrom trex,construing board in light of intrinsic record unitherm food,construing golden brown even though colors are commonly used terms with plain definitions that rarely need construction,rev on other grounds,d toro white consol,construing cover,included,attachment,and removable.
when the district court failed to adjudicate the parties dispute regarding the proper scope of only if,the parties presented their arguments to the jury.by failing to construe this term,the district court left the jury free to consider these arguments.micro presented expert testimony to support its argument that the claim limitation only if applies only during certain periods of operation normal operation and that this claim limitation has nothing to do with.micro also brought the inventor of the to testify regarding the meaning of only if 
q what did the additional language,only if said feedback signal is above a predetermined threshold,pertain to 
a actually,in my opinion,specification did not change.only if,between my patent lawyer and examiner,they added in to try to clarify,make the entire invention more easier to understand.i think that what it is.to me,there no change to my original invention intent.
q so if the only time it makes any sense to use feedback to control power to a lamp is after it lit,after this threshold is reached,what did you give up,if anything,by adding the only if language to the claims 
a i do think i gave up anything.i think it just make it clear that you and i can understand.
only when the lamp is lit we control power at that time.
likewise,argued to the jury that only if does not allow for exceptions.for the reasons stated,the parties arguments regarding the meaning and legal significance of the only if limitation were improperly submitted to the jury 
we,however,recognize that district courts are not and should not be required to construe every limitation present in a patent asserted claims.see,biotec biologische naturverpackungen gmbh.kg biocorp,deciding that disputed issue was the proper application of a claim term to an accused process rather the scope of the term surgical ethicon,claim construction is not an obligatory exercise in redundancy.rather,c laim construction is a matter of resolution of disputed meanings and technical scope,to clarify and when necessary to explain what the patentee covered by the claims,for use in the determination of infringement.surgical,at.when the parties present a fundamental dispute regarding the scope of a claim term,it is the court duty to resolve it.because we determine that the district court is in the best position to determine the proper construction of this claim term in the first instance,we remand for further proceedings consistent with this opinion 
doctrine of equivalents 
we turn now to arguments with respect to the doctrine of e
