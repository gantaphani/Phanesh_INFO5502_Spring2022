the united states appeals from the final decision of the united states court of federal claims that awarded energy capital energy capital in lost profits in its suit against the united states for breach of contract.energy capital united states,fed.cl,amended by energy capital united states.after holding that energy capital had established its entitlement to lost profits,the court computed energy capital damages award by discounting its anticipated lost profits to present value as of the date of judgment using a discount rate.we see no error in the court award of lost profits damages and its reduction of the award to present value as of the date of judgment.we conclude,however,that under the circumstances of this case,use of a discount rate was required in arriving at the present value of the damages award.accordingly,we,and remand.
background 
the court of federal claims made detailed findings of fact in a thorough and opinion.we recite here those facts necessary for an understanding of the case.
a.the lack of financing for improvements to reduce the cost of heating hud properties 
the department of housing and urban development hud subsidizes and regulates a significant portion of the multifamily housing industry in the united states.energy capital united states,fed.cl.at.the federal housing administration fha,which is part of hud,provides financial assistance to various types of housing programs.id.
a continuing problem for hud has been the fact that the multifamily housing in its portfolio consumes an inefficient amount of energy.the reason for that is that many hud properties were constructed during the late and early when neither the government nor the builder was concerned with energy costs.hud housing frequently was built under stringent cost restraints.consequently,the housing commonly was heated with electric baseboard resistance heating a type of heating that is inexpensive to install,but very expensive to operate.id.
most of the hud properties at issue in this case are referred to as field notice properties.typically,a field notice property was financed by the federal national mortgage association fannie mae or one or more private lenders,with repayment of the resulting indebtedness being secured by a first mortgage on the property and the mortgage being insured by fha.the mortgage and accompanying fha regulations restricted the owner ability to encumber the property beyond the first mortgage.because owners could not place additional mortgages on their properties,they had difficulty raising capital to make physical improvements to their properties,including improvements to reduce heating costs.id.consequently,very little hud housing received any financing to reduce energy costs during the and.id.
energy capital and the ahelp agreement 
energy capital was formed in the middle of.thereafter,it provided financing to allow various institutions to optimize their energy consumption.for example,energy capital provided financing for improvements to college dormitories and to commercial office buildings.in that capacity,it originated approximately million in loans id.
eventually,energy capital came to recognize that there was a significant need for energy improvements in hud properties and that the primary obstacles to financing loans for such improvements were the regulatory restrictions noted above.energy capital believed that if it could solve the regulatory problem,it would be able to originate a significant number of loans that would provide financing for improvements to reduce energy costs in hud properties.id.
over a period of approximately months,energy capital negotiated an agreement with hud to eliminate the regulatory barriers to financing energy improvements in hud properties.the agreement became known as the affordable housing energy loan program ahelp agreement.under the ahelp agreement,energy capital could originate loans to owners of hud properties for years,or until a cap of million in loan originations was reached.id.in exchange,hud promised to treat ahelp loans in a way that gave energy capital,as a lender,security for its loans.specifically,the ahelp agreement allowed energy capital to include in its energy efficiency loans to field notice properties what was referred to as a springing subordinated lien and a provision.id.pursuant to these provisions,if a property owner defaulted on an energy efficiency loan originated under the ahelp agreement,then the first mortgage on the property,which was the mortgage,would also go into default.at the same time,energy capital energy efficiency loan would spring into the senior mortgage position,ahead of the loan secured by the mortgage.id.at.of course,before energy capital could make such a loan,it would have to obtain the consent of the holder of the first mortgage on the property the first mortgagee to the springing subordinated lien and provisions.id.at.
energy capital agreed to structure loan payments so that,in the case of each loan,the anticipated savings in utility costs due to the energy improvements being financed would cover of the annual loan payment.thus,it was contemplated that the energy loan would pay for itself and would give the property owner additional savings in the form of reduced energy costs.the ahelp agreement also set the interest rate at which energy capital would lend money the treasury rate plus percent.energy capital agreed in principle to obtain capital from fannie mae at the treasury rate for the loans that energy capital would be originating.as the ahelp loans were repaid,fannie mae would be repaid at the treasury rate plus percent.energy capital would keep the remaining percent over treasury rate as its profit on the loan.in a separate agreement,fannie mae promised energy capital that it would fund up to million in ahelp loans and would purchase the loans back from energy capital.id.
the process for originating an ahelp loan was to begin when energy capital received an application,called a property eligibility checklist pec,from a property owner.the pec would contain certain information about the physical structure and energy systems of the property.based upon this preliminary data,energy capital would determine whether an ahelp loan was viable.viable meant that the proposed improvement would generate enough savings to pay for itself within the loan repayment period.id.at.if the property appeared viable,an energy service company esco would conduct an energy audit to confirm the usefulness of the contemplated energy efficiency measure from an engineering perspective.id.at.energy capital would also evaluate the financial stability of the property,and it was expected that it would submit some of the loans to hud for a limited review.the hud review was limited to days by the ahelp agreement.after loan closing,energy capital would oversee construction and would continue to service the loan by administering the loan proceeds and receiving payments on the loan.id.
execution and then termination of the ahelp agreement 
fha and energy capital executed the ahelp agreement in september of.its maximum duration was years.shortly thereafter,hud issued a notice to the hud field staff for multifamily housing and to owners and managing agents of hud properties.in the notice,hud reviewed the need for energy efficiency measures and announced that the department had endorsed the ahelp program.the notice suggested that interested staff or property owners could contact representatives of energy capital for further information.id.
approximately two months after the ahelp agreement was signed,two training programs were held for hud officials and for staffers in hud field offices in connection with the ahelp program.witnesses from energy capital testified at trial that hud had asked that energy capital train its field office representatives before marketing ahelp to building owners,so that the field staff would be knowledgeable and capable of responding to inquiries from the property owners.id.at.
following the training programs,energy capital began to market ahelp to property owners and managers.in its marketing efforts,energy capital focused in particular on the two largest owners of multifamily housing in hud housing portfolio insignia and national housing partners.together,these two entities controlled nearly properties in the hud portfolio.energy capital representatives presented ahelp to representatives from insignia and national housing partners at two different meetings in november of.id.at.
in addition to making presentations to insignia and national housing partners,energy capital made sales presentations to various property in the boston,massachusetts area.these presentations prompted owners to apply for ahelp loans by submitting pecs.id.in conjunction with its activities directed to owners,energy capital also developed its internal resources to support ahelp.for example,it retained a search firm to hire a chief operating officer,a chief underwriter,a head of sales,and a sales force.in addition,it selected an energy consulting company as the engineering firm that would evaluate properties for energy viability.as energy capital had already received pecs,it retained six escos to conduct energy audits.by february of,energy capital had received pec forms and had completed the process for approximately properties.id.
however,on february,there appeared on the front page of the wall street journal an article stating that energy capital had received the ahelp contract in return for significant efforts for president clinton by certain principals of the firm.id.at.on monday,february,the wall street journal,in its corrections amplifications section,noted that the february article had failed to state that no one has said that hud officials knew that the two men were major democratic.id.
hud terminated the ahelp agreement on february,approximately months after it had been signed.in those months,energy capital had not completed the process of originating any loans.the ahelp agreement did not have a termination for convenience clause.id.
energy capital action in the court of federal claims 
energy capital filed a complaint in the court of federal claims on april,and an amended complaint on november.in its suit,energy capital sought to recover damages from the united states for breach of contract.after the government conceded liability for breach of contract,a trial was held on damages.the proceedings focused on the parties differing views as to the measure of recovery to which energy capital was entitled.energy capital took the position that it was entitled to lost profits damages,while the government urged that it should only be required to pay reliance damages.id.
the court of federal claims started from the premise that in order to demonstrate entitlement to lost profits,energy capital was required to establish the elements of causation,foreseeability,and reasonable certainty.id.at.in addition,the court took the position that because ahelp was a new venture,energy capital would have a difficult burden establishing that its lost profits were reasonably certain.id.
following a trial,the court concluded that energy capital had carried its burden of proving that its lost profits were reasonably certain.id.at.in reaching this conclusion,the court resolved various fact issues relevant to the proper measure of damages.on appeal the government does not challenge any of the court findings of fact.we note the court pertinent findings as follows 
i eligibility of properties with tenant paid utilities 
the first issue addressed by the court of federal claims was whether properties having apartments with utilities would have received ahelp loans.id.at.the government argued that owners of such properties would have had no incentive to apply for ahelp loans because they would not have stood to benefit from any reduced utility expenses.id.at.
the court rejected the government argument for several reasons.first,it noted that there was nothing in the ahelp agreement or the ahelp procedures manual that expressly excluded properties with utilities.id.at.second,the court found that owners of such properties could have taken over from their tenants the obligation of paying utility charges.in that event,the owners would have had an incentive to apply for ahelp loans,since the owners then would have benefited from decreased utility bills id.third,the court noted that before the ahelp agreement was terminated by hud,energy capital had received pecs from property owners with utilities and had not rejected these pecs out of hand.id.at.the court concluded that this contemporaneous conduct was indicative of the parties understanding of the ahelp agreement.id.at.fourth,the court determined that it was unlikely that hud would have found the ahelp program attractive if properties with utilities were excluded,since excluding such properties would have reduced the number of eligible properties by percent.id.
ii eligibility of section properties 
the next issue addressed by the court of federal claims was whether,in addition to field notice properties,section properties were eligible to receive ahelp loans.a section property takes its name from section of the housing act of.housing act of.a section property carries a first mortgage that is owned directly by fha,rather than being insured by fha.the ahelp agreement specified that section properties were eligible for ahelp.at the time when the ahelp agreement was executed,however,the documentation and procedures for issuing ahelp loans to section properties had not yet been finalized.energy capital,fed.cl.at.the agreement therefore stated that certain elements of this agreement,the ahelp loan documents and the ahelp procedures manual must be modified to reflect the structure of transactions.prior to initiating an ahelp transaction for a section development,the lender shall submit document modifications to fha for review and approval.id.at.the government argued that section properties should not be included in the damages calculation because,before any loans to section properties could have been made,new legal documents would have had to have been drafted and approved by fha.id.at.
the court of federal claims disagreed.first,it pointed out that the ahelp agreement stated on its face that section properties were eligible for ahelp loans.id.second,it noted that prior to hud termination of the ahelp agreement,energy capital sent two letters to hud that evinced a consistent intent to make loans to owners of section properties.id.third,the court found that fha approval of a modification of the ahelp documents to reflect the structure of section loans would have been obtained in a short amount of time because the financing arrangements for section properties were actually simpler than for field notice properties.id.at.fourth,hud assistant secretary nick retsinas testified at trial that he was interested in seeing the ahelp program succeed.based upon that testimony,the court concluded that it was unlikely that ahelp would have foundered by reason of legal technicalities.finally,the court determined that once fha stated in the ahelp agreement that section properties were eligible for ahelp loans,the government had a duty of good faith to make this promise a reality.for all of these reasons,the court concluded that section properties were eligible to receive ahelp loans.id.at.
iii number of energy viable properties 
the court of federal claims next addressed the issue of the number of eligible properties that were energy viable,the number of properties that would have realized sufficient utility bill savings through improved energy efficiency to cover the cost of converting from electric heat to gas heat.the court relied on three overlapping methods provided by energy capital experts to determine the number of such properties.id.although the court determined that there was an error in each of the three methods,it concluded that the overall analysis of each method was reliable.the court was able to correct for the error in each approach using the evidence in the record.after correction,all three methods produced a number in the range of to percent.accordingly,the court found that percent of the eligible properties were viable from a technological and perspective.id.at.
iv willingness of hud property owners to obtain ahelp loans 
an important evidentiary issue addressed by the court of federal claims was the extent to which owners of hud properties would have been willing to participate in ahelp.in that regard,energy capital presented the testimony of david smith.smith was the founder of recapitalization advisors,a consulting firm that energy capital had retained during the development of ahelp on account of its extensive knowledge of hud housing portfolio.smith testified that he estimated that just percent of the owners of hud properties would not have been willing to participate in ahelp.the court found his testimony to be credible and accepted his estimate as reasonable.id.
the court found that smith estimate was supported by the testimony of owners of hud properties.their testimony confirmed smith opinion that most owners would have been interested in ahelp loans.id.as mentioned previously,the two largest of properties in the hud portfolio were insignia and national housing partners.a former of insignia and a former asset manager for national housing partners testified at trial.both stated that their respective organizations would have been very interested in participating in ahelp despite some of the potential risks,such as lack of guaranteed energy savings,the need to obtain first mortgagee consent,and the interest rate in repaying the ahelp loans.both insignia and national housing partners were concerned that energy consumption was draining too much cash flow,but they had found that large scale energy improvements were too expensive.thus,ahelp was very attractive to them.insignia desire to participate was further supported by its submission of approximately pecs before the ahelp agreement was terminated.the court noted that the willingness of property owners to participate in ahelp was especially important because owners would risk their entire investment in the property.in other words,if property owners were willing to participate,then other entities,such as first mortgagees,who had less to lose as discussed below also would have been likely to participate.id.at.
v energy capital evaluation of creditworthiness 
david smith testified that energy capital would have rejected percent of the potentially eligible field notice properties because of the lack of creditworthiness of the owner or the low quality of the property.finding smith to be credible,the court accepted his estimate as reasonably accurate.id.
vi first mortgagee consent 
the court of federal claims also considered the question of first mortgagee consent.the court noted that it was possible that first mortgagees would have been reluctant to consent to an ahelp loan because,in general,a second loan could increase the chance of default on the loan secured by the mortgage they held.furthermore,under the provision contemplated by the ahelp agreement,a property owner default on the ahelp loan would put the first mortgage into default as well,depriving the first mortgagee of its anticipated interest payments during the term of the mortgage 
neither party presented testimony from a first mortgagee.instead,the parties presented evidence of incentives or disincentives for first mortgagees to consent.the court decided not to draw an adverse inference against either party for failing to call a witness because both parties had first mortgagee witnesses equally available but declined to call them.id.at.
with regards to fannie mae,which held approximately percent of the first mortgages on field notice properties,the court of federal claims found that the most probative evidence was fannie mae promise to fund up to million of ahelp loans and also to purchase the loans back from energy capital.id.at.the court found that fannie mae would have consented to second mortgages to secure ahelp loans being placed on all of the properties where it held the first mortgage,because it had risked its own money in support of the program.furthermore,the court found that because increasing energy efficiency was consistent with fannie mae goals,it was reasonable to conclude that fannie mae would have tolerated some risk to its capital.thus,the court concluded that fannie mae would have consented to ahelp loans on of the properties where it was the first mortgagee,which amounted to percent of the total number of properties at issue.id.
with regards to other first mortgagees,david smith estimated that slightly more than percent of the mae first mortgagees would have consented to the ahelp program.the government expert,david hisey,testified that zero percent of mae first mortgagees would have consented.id.
the court of federal claims noted that first mortgagees risked losing the future interest income on their loan in the event of a default.id.at.the court also noted,however,that the energy savings provided by ahelp energy improvements were designed to exceed the cost of the loan,thereby potentially providing the property owner with increased income.the court noted that this could potentially reduce the probability of default,although the court recognized that energy savings were not guaranteed and that utility rates were unpredictable.id.
the court concluded,based on the evidence,that of the mae first mortgagees percent would have consented to ahelp loans.id.at.the court arrived at this figure by initially finding that it was as likely as not that first mortgagees would consent.expressing this mathematically as a percent consent rate,the court added a percentage to account for the following incentives to consent i first mortgagees were likely to follow the example of fannie mae,the largest holder of first mortgages ii first mortgagees were likely to be influenced by fha,the insurer of its mortgages and iii energy capital was willing to pay a fee to first mortgagees to purchase their consent,a standard practice.the court noted that the percent number was further compelling because it was the average number between two reasonable estimates of percent and percent proposed by energy capital expert.the court dismissed the government estimate of zero percent,finding it unreasonable.id.
vii determination of the amount of lost profits 
based on its findings,the court of federal claims determined that the total dollar amount of loans that would have been originated by energy capital had the ahelp agreement not been breached would have been,which was more than the maximum amount allowed under the agreement.id.at.consequently,the court found that energy capital would have originated the full amount of.id.
based on this figure,the court then determined energy capital total revenue and deducted energy capital expenses to arrive at a value of lost profits in the amount of,to be earned over years.id.at.the court then discounted the damages award to present value.the government argued that the court should i discount the damages award to the date of breach and ii use a discount rate.the court rejected this approach,concluding that precedent mandated i discounting to the date of judgment and ii using a discount rate.following this approach,the court arrived at a final discounted damages award of.id.at.
after the court issued its decision,energy capital moved to alter or amend the judgment pursuant to rcfc b and d,arguing that the court should correct two mathematical computations contained within the opinion.energy capital united states,slip op.at.the court granted energy capital motion with respect to one of the computations and denied the other.after recalculating and discounting to present value,the court determined that energy capital lost profits amounted to.id.at.
the government timely appealed the trial court decision.we have jurisdiction over the appeal pursuant to a.
discussion 
in reviewing a decision of the court of federal claims following a trial,we review findings of fact for clear error and conclusions of law de novo.bd.of county supervisors united states.the government asserts that it does not seek to overturn the lower court factual findings.rather,the government argues that the trial court engaged in a degree of speculation that is not permitted as a matter of law.according to the government,the court of federal claims made three errors of law i awarding damages in the form of lost profits in the case of a new venture that never was performed ii engaging in speculation in concluding that the ahelp agreement would have yielded profits for energy capital and iii applying a discount rate and discounting future profits to the date of judgment rather than to the date of the government breach of contract.we address each of these contentions in turn.
whether lost profits may be awarded for a new venture 
the government urges us to adopt a per se rule that lost profits may never be recovered for a new business venture that was not performed.for the reasons explained below,we decline to adopt such a rule.
one way the law makes the party whole is to give him the benefits he expected to receive had the breach not occurred.glendale fed.bank,fsb,united states,citing restatement second of contracts a.the benefits that were expected from the contract,expectancy damages,are often equated with lost profits,although they can include other damage elements as well.id.citing restatement second of contracts.to recover lost profits for breach of contract,the plaintiff must establish by a preponderance of the evidence,see knapp shoes,sylvania shoe,cir,that the loss was the proximate result of the breach the loss of profits caused by the breach was within the contemplation of the parties because the loss was foreseeable or because the defaulting party had knowledge of special circumstances at the time of contracting and a sufficient basis exists for estimating the amount of lost profits with reasonable certainty.see chain belt united states,restatement second of contracts damages are not recoverable for loss that the party in breach did not have reason to foresee as a probable result of the breach when the contract was made.see also california fed.bank united states,cal fed lost profits are a recognized measure of damages where their loss is the proximate result of the breach and the fact that there would have been a profit is definitely established,and there is some basis on which a reasonable estimate of the amount of the profit can be made.quoting neely united states,neely i.
the government contends that because energy capital was engaged in a new business that had never been performed,the court of federal claims award of lost profits was speculative and erroneous as a matter of law.in making this argument,the government relies on neely i.in that case,the government breached its agreement to allow the plaintiff to certain leased lands for coal,and the plaintiff sought lost profits damages.the government quotes the following passage from neely i 
p rofits are uncertain they depend on so many contingencies,especially in a new enterprise,that it is,in most cases,impossible to say that the breach was the proximate cause of the loss of them,or that a profit would have been realized,in any event nor is there any basis to determine what they might have amounted to.this is especially true where the breach occurred before operations had begun.
suffice it to say that almost always,in the case of a new venture,the fact that there would have been a profit,had there been no breach,is too shrouded in uncertainty for loss of anticipated profits to form a reliable measure of the damages suffered.
although the above excerpt articulates the principle that lost profits are difficult to establish in the case of a new venture,the subsequent history of neely is not helpful to the government,as was noted by the trial court.the neely i court,after explaining that lost profits are rarely available for a new venture,went on to make it clear that,in fact,lost profits damages could be recovered by the plaintiff.the court of claims noted that the plaintiff eventually assigned the lease at issue to a third party,who was allowed to mine the property.id.the court stated that the profit realized from these operations by the third party,if,indeed,there were profits,would furnish some basis for a fairly reliable estimate of what plaintiff profits would have been.id.the court remanded the case to the trial commissioner for additional regarding the profits earned by the third party.after remand,the trial commissioner awarded lost profits to the plaintiff and the court of claims affirmed the decision.neely united states,wl neely ii.
the government argues that the present case is distinguishable from neely because in neely a third party actually performed the contract at issue,whereas in the present case the lower court did not have evidence of any entity ever having engaged in ahelp lending.as far as the factual differences between neely and this case are concerned,the government is correct.where we disagree with the government is in our conclusion that neely is not limited to circumstances where the contract has been performed by another party.we recently rejected an argument similar to the government in cal fed.there,the court of federal claims held that enactment of the financial institutions reform,recovery,and enforcement act,stat.firrea,breached the government promise to cal fed bank to allow a favorable accounting treatment in return for the acquisition of failing thrifts.before trial,the court denied cal fed claim for lost profits on summary judgment,concluding that profits would be too speculative as a matter of law.fed.cl.the court distinguished neely by noting that,in neely,another party actually performed the contract which thereby provided such precise information as to permit a determination of damages through simple mathematical calculations.id.the court also distinguished chain belt,which was relied upon by cal fed.the court stated that,in chain belt,there was detailed damages information available to the court that was striking by comparison to the evidence before the court in cal fed,fed.cl.at.
we vacated the summary judgment and remanded for trial on the issue of lost profits,holding that the lower court had erred in ruling at the summary judgment stage that proof of lost profits would be too speculative.we stated both the existence of lost profits and their quantum are factual matters that should not be decided on a motion for summary judgment if material facts are in dispute.cal fed,at.we noted that cal fed submitted considerable evidence,including documents and expert testimony,that more than sufficed to create a genuine issue of material fact as to the existence and quantum of lost profits.id.we concluded that i f a reasonable probability of damage can be clearly established,uncertainty as to the amount will not preclude recovery.id.quoting locke united states.
the government argues that cal fed is distinguishable from the present case because it did not involve a new venture.the government reiterates its position that because ahelp was a new venture and because no evidence was presented of historical performance of a type of business similar to ahelp,it is impossible to measure lost profits with reasonable certainty.
we do not agree that lost profits should be precluded as a matter of law for new ventures that have not previously been performed by a third party.whether or not one considers ahelp to have been a new venture or merely an extension of energy capital existing loan business,energy capital was required to demonstrate its entitlement to lost profits by showing the same elements that any business must show causation,foreseeability,and reasonable certainty.see chain belt.at.at.while the nature of a new venture may make it difficult to recover lost profits by establishing all of the elements of the general rule,such damages are not barred as a matter of law.this is consistent with the weight of modern authority,as explained in robert dunn,recovery of damages for lost profits ed 
most recent cases reject the once generally accepted rule that lost profits damages for a new business are not recoverable.the development of the law has been to find damages for lost profits of an unestablished business recoverable when they can be adequately proved with reasonable certainty what was once a rule of law has been converted into a rule of evidence.
id.in a similar vein,the seventh circuit has quoted approvingly the following statement by the alabama supreme court 
t he weight of modern authority does not predicate recovery of lost profits upon the artificial categorization of a business as unestablished,existing,or new particularly where the defendant itself has wrongfully prevented the business from coming into existence and generating a track record of profits.instead the courts focus on whether the plaintiff has adduced evidence that provides a basis from which the jury could with reasonable certainty calculate the amount of lost profits t he risk of uncertainty must fall on the defendant whose wrongful conduct caused the damages.

the cases cited by the government do not stand for the proposition that a per se bar exists for lost profits for new ventures.rather,they simply represent instances in which the claimant failed,as an evidentiary matter,to establish entitlement to such profits.see plaza properties,united states,finding that the evidence was insufficient to show all three prongs of reasonable certainty,causation,and foreseeability northern paiute nation united states,stating that the problem of speculation is insurmountable see also bluebonnet savings bank,united states,affirming the court of federal claims decision not to award lost profits because the evidence was insufficient to determine the quantum of damages to a reasonable certainty.
similarly,the cases cited by the government from other circuits also do not establish a per se bar to lost profits for new ventures,but merely recite the presumptive rule that lost profits are difficult to establish for new ventures.see computrol,newtrend,cir affirming the district court ruling denying lost profits damages to the plaintiff because i a limitation of liability clause in the contract precluded recovery of lost profits and ii evidence of lost profits presented was unduly speculative scheduled airlines traffic offices,objective,cir affirming the district court judgment as a matter of law denying lost profits damages to the plaintiff because there was no evidence by which to estimate damages hollywood fantasy gabor,cir holding that a jury verdict awarding lost profits as damages was not supported by substantial evidence,because there was no evidence at trial that plaintiff had firm reasons to expect a profit.
in this case,the court of federal claims properly recognized that while the evidentiary hurdles to recovering lost profits for a new venture are high,such profits may be recovered if the hurdles are overcome.because the court found as a matter of fact that energy capital had established causation,foreseeability,and reasonable certainty,and because the government does not challenge the court findings of fact,we will not disturb the court holding that energy capital is entitled to recover lost profits.
whether energy capital showed that it would have realized profits from the ahelp venture 
the government further argues that the court of federal claims erred as a matter of law by engaging in rampant and unsupported speculation in arriving at its determination that energy capital would have realized profits from the ahelp venture.the government contends that speculative expectancy damages may not be awarded against the united states,citing wells fargo bank united states,remote and consequential damages are not recoverable in a suit for breach of contract especially in suits against the united states for the recovery of damages.
the government asserts that,before energy capital could have closed an ahelp loan,a number of steps would have had to have been completed and a number of parties hud,the first mortgagees,and property owners all would have had to agree to the transaction.the government thus argues that the trial court prediction that each of these steps would have occurred amounted to a level of speculation that was erroneous as a matter of law.
we do not agree that the energy capital lost profits were overly remote and speculative as a matter of law.according to wells fargo,
i f the profits are such as would have accrued and grown out of the contract itself,as the direct and immediate results of its fulfillment,then they would form a just and proper item of damages,to be recovered against the delinquent party upon a breach of the agreement but if they are such as would have been realized by the party from other independent and collateral undertakings,although entered into in consequence and on the faith of the principal contract,then they are too uncertain and remote to be taken into consideration as a part of the damages occasioned by the breach of the contract in suit.
quoting ramsey united states.
in the present case,energy capital anticipated profits flowed directly from the ahelp agreement and not from other independent and collateral undertakings.as the court of federal claims found,the express purpose of the ahelp agreement was to permit energy capital to make up to million worth of loans to property owners.energy capital,fed.cl.at.when the government breached the ahelp agreement,energy capital was no longer able to issue those loans,and its resulting loss of profits flowed directly from the government breach.see cal fed,at distinguishing wells fargo by pointing out that the government promise to provide favorable regulatory treatment to cal fed was a central focus of the contract and the subject of the government breach,and stating that profits on the use of the subject of the contract itself,here supervisory goodwill as regulatory capital were recoverable as damages.
to the extent that a decision to award lost profits could be so remote and speculative as to be incorrect as a matter of law,we do not have such a case here.what we have before us is a case in which the trial court drew reasonable inferences based upon the evidence,not a case in which the trial court engaged in unsupported speculation.see locke united states,certainty of damages is sufficient if the evidence adduced enables the court to make a fair and reasonable approximation of the damages.in circumstances such as these we may act upon probable and inferential as well as direct and positive proof.citations omitted.
when asked at oral argument to name the most egregious example of speculation by the court of federal claims,counsel for the government cited the issue of first mortgagee consent.counsel pointed out that i energy capital presented no testimony from first mortgagees ii fannie mae never consented to any ahelp loans in its capacity as first mortgagee fannie mae had simply agreed to provide the funding for the ahelp loans iii the government expert,david hisey,testified that virtually none of the first mortgagees would consent to participate in the ahelp program and iv energy capital testifying expert had a financial stake in the ahelp program.
counsel argument seems to be an indirect attack on the sufficiency of the evidence,rather than a legal argument.in any event,we conclude that the court of federal claims drew reasonable inferences based on all of the evidence discussed at length above to arrive at its finding that percent of first mortgagees would have consented to ahelp loans.the trial court also reasonably inferred that if fannie mae had agreed to fund ahelp,it also would have consented to allow ahelp loans on those properties for which it was first mortgagee.
as for the consent of the mae first mortgagees,the court of federal claims took into account the various incentives and disincentives to consent,including the fees that energy capital was willing to pay to first mortgagees to purchase their consent.although energy capital failed to provide any witnesses from first mortgagees,it did present the testimony of david smith,who was intimately familiar with the properties in the hud portfolio.as for the relative weight given to the testimony of both sides expert witnesses,we accord the trial court broad discretion in determining credibility because the court saw the witnesses and heard their testimony.see commercial contractors,united states.
for the above reasons,we do not find the trial court finding that percent of first mortgagees would have consented to ahelp loans to be clearly erroneous.nor do we find the court overall determination that energy capital was entitled to lost profits to be speculative as a matter of law.
c.the computation of damages 
finally,the government contends that the court of federal claims made the following two errors when it discounted the damages award i discounting damages to the date of judgment instead of the date of breach of contract and ii using a discount rate rather than a discount rate.
i date of discounting 
the government argues that by discounting to the date of judgment,the trial court effectively awarded prejudgment interest against the united states a practice which is prohibited by library of congress shaw,d,unless there has been an explicit waiver of sovereign immunity.we disagree.
the time when performance should have taken place is the time as of which damages are measured.reynolds united states.in many cases,the appropriate date for calculation of damages is the date of breach.see estate of berg united states.that rule does not apply,however,to anticipated profits or to other expectancy damages that,absent the breach,would have accrued on an ongoing basis over the course of the contract.in those circumstances,damages are measured throughout the course of the contract.to prevent unjust enrichment of the plaintiff,the damages that would have arisen after the date of judgment future lost profits must be discounted to the date of judgment.see northern helex united states,discounting anticipated profits to the date of judgment.discounting future lost profits to the date of judgment merely converts future dollars to an equivalent amount in present dollars at the date of judgment it is not an award of prejudgment interest and does not violate sovereign immunity.
almost all of energy capital lost profits would have been earned after the date of judgment.energy capital,fed.cl.at.accordingly,we hold that the trial court did not err in discounting energy capital lost profits to the date of judgment instead of the date of breach.
ii discounting for risk 
the government also argues that the trial court incorrectly applied a discount rate of percent,the rate of return on year treasury notes with constant maturity.the government contends that the discount rate represents the return an investor would require in order to risk investing capital in a particular venture and that such a rate must incorporate any risk that cash flows would not be realized.
before deciding this issue,we review the pertinent evidence presented at trial.energy capital retained an expert,jerry arcy,to calculate the damages suffered by energy capital as a result of hud termination of the ahelp agreement.at the time of trial,arcy was a partner with the accounting firm of pricewaterhousecoopers,where he was in charge of corporate finance and corporate value consulting for all financial service entities in north america.arcy testified based upon his experience in the valuation of cash flows relating to various types of mortgage instruments and portfolios of loans.
arcy prepared an expert report and testified at trial about the value of the ahelp venture prior to the breach.to calculate this value,he used what is referred to as the discounted cash flow dcf method.the dcf method is currently in wide use in the analysis of capital stock,acquisition candidates,capital projects,financial instruments,and contract rights.the dcf method measures the value of a business by forecasting its anticipated net cash flows.such cash flows are then discounted to present value to account for both i the time value of money and ii business and financial risks.
in applying the dcf method,arcy began by calculating that the ahelp venture would have produced million in profits absent the breach.arcy then discounted the million amount to present value using a discount rate.he determined that the most appropriate discount rate was based on the average rate of return on mortgage real estate investment trusts reits.an reit is a legal entity recognized by the internal revenue code.a mortgage reit is a reit that chooses to own mortgage interests in real estate,as opposed to owning the encumbered real estate itself.
arcy relied on mortgage reits because a mortgage reit would be interested in acquiring ahelp loans.during the appropriate time,the average dividend yield the rate of return for mortgage reits was approximately percent.arcy then added percent to that rate in order to account for the debt component and profit component,thereby arriving at a discount rate of percent 
the government presented its own accounting expert,david hisey,who also testified regarding the value of the ahelp venture prior to the breach.hisey agreed with arcy that a discount rate was appropriate,but opined that a higher discount rate of should be used.hisey considered the ahelp program to be a form of specialized lending.hisey,accordingly,averaged the returns of five specialized lending companies.
in briefing,energy capital backed away from a portion of the valuation method used by its own expert,arcy.specifically,energy capital objected to the use of a discount rate energy capital argued instead that lasalle talman bank united states,fed.cl,mandates the use of a rate of return,which lasalle suggests is the current rate of interest on treasury securities see energy capital,fed.cl.at.
the court of federal claims,relying on northern helex,at,agreed with energy capital that the appropriate discount rate was the rate of return on conservative investment instruments.energy capital,fed.cl.at.the court thereby took judicial notice of the rate of return on year treasury notes with constant maturity on the date of judgment and discounted the damages award to present value using this conservative discount rate.the court also stated,however 
notwithstanding northern helex,the defendant presents a cogent argument for why the discount rate should consider the riskiness of the endeavor.undoubtedly,the defendant will present its argument to the federal circuit,a court with the authority to overrule northern helex.
the federal circuit may determine that,as a matter of law,trial courts should consider the riskiness of the project in establishing the discount rate.the defendant cites in re lambert,cir douglass hustler magazine,cir and schonfeld hilliard,d,all cases where the discount rate was affected by the risks.this court believes that the assessment of the riskiness of the investment is a question of fact.hence,the court will make findings of fact related to this issue.these findings,however,are useful only if the federal circuit holds that the discount rate is something other than the rate on conservative investment instruments.
the court proceeded to make alternative findings of fact as to an appropriate discount rate.the court found that,if the discount rate should reflect the riskiness of the ahelp venture,then the discount rate should be percent,the rate proposed by energy capital expert,arcy.id.the court expressly rejected the discount rate percent offered by the government expert,hisey,because it found his methodology far from credible.id.we hold that arcy proposed discount rate of percent is the appropriate discount rate to be used in this case.
the appropriate discount rate is a question of fact.see,robert dunn,recovery of damages for lost profits ed.the applicable discount rate is a fact question that should be raised.monessen southwestern railway morgan,d holding that when discounting an injured employee award under the federal employers liability act,the present value calculation is to be made by the trier of fa
