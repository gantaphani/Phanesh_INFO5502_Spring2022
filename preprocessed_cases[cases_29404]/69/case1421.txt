martin mulhall mulhall,an employee at the hollywood greyhound track,mardi gras gaming mardi gras,appeals from the district court dismissal of his complaint against mardi gras and unite here local unite,a labor union,for violations of of the labor management relations act lmra.mulhall sued unite and mardi gras to enjoin enforcement of a memorandum of agreement moa,whereby unite agreed to spend money in support of mardi gras public campaign to obtain a gaming license,in exchange for mardi gras assistance in making unite the exclusive bargaining agent for mardi gras currently workforce.appellant mulhall,who vigorously opposes being unionized,claims that the organizing assistance promised by mardi gras violates of the lmra,which makes it illegal for an employer to deliver,or for a union to receive,any thing of value,subject to limited exceptions.a b.the district court dismissed mulhall complaint for lack of standing,holding that he lacked a cognizable injury.after thorough review,we conclude,however,that mulhall has standing to prosecute this claim in federal court,and therefore that the case is justiciable.accordingly,we reverse and remand for further proceedings.
mulhall grievance stems from a memorandum of agreement concluded between mardi gras and unite on august.the substance of the agreement was as follows.the local union,unite,promised to lend financial support to a ballot initiative regarding casino gaming that would benefit mardi gras,and,if recognized as the exclusive bargaining agent for mardi gras employees,to refrain from picketing,boycotting,striking,or undertaking other economic activity against mardi gras in exchange,mardi gras promised to help unite organize the company workforce.this assistance notably included providing complete lists of mardi gras employees,including their job classifications,departments,and home addresses the use of mardi gras property,including areas,for organizing a neutrality agreement which mulhall calls a gag clause that prohibits any speech or actions by mardi gras or its agents that state or imply opposition to the union a waiver of mardi gras right to seek secret elections to verify the union majority status,and an agreement to abide by a less formal procedure instead and a promise not to file unfair labor practice charges against unite for violations of employee rights during the union organizing campaign 
pursuant to the moa,unite spent over campaigning for the ballot initiative favored by mardi gras.thereafter,in may and july,unite sent mardi gras written notices of its intent to organize mardi gras employees,and demanded that mardi gras provide the organizing assistance promised in the moa.mardi gras,however,refused to provide the assistance,claiming,with the advice of new legal counsel,that the moa was illegal and unenforceable.
unite responded in late september by filing a petition to compel arbitration,pursuant to the moa arbitration clause,in the united states district court for the southern district of florida.see unite here local hollywood greyhound track,case unite requested enforcement of the moa,but also made clear that if the moa were found unlawful,it would request restitutionary damages from the arbitrator or court based on quantum meruit for the time and money the union and its members spent on the political campaign to obtain a gaming license for mardi gras estimated at over and over in business which mardi gras would have lost from a boycott.joint scheduling,february,at.mardi gras filed an answer and counterclaimed for a declaration that the moa was invalid.
on april,the district court entered an order compelling arbitration of the parties dispute,including mardi gras claim that the moa was unenforceable.the matter was arbitrated,and on august,an arbitrator returned a ruling in favor of unite,finding the moa enforceable and requiring mardi gras to provide the requested organizing assistance.mardi gras then moved the district court to vacate the award,and unite moved to confirm it.see hollywood greyhound race track,unite here local,case.the district court denied mardi gras motion and confirmed the award in most material respects.the court granted mardi gras motion to vacate the award only insofar as the arbitrator had unilaterally extended the terms of the moa by one year,apparently as an equitable remedy for mardi gras breach in failing to provide the contractually promised organizing assistance.see hollywood greyhound race track,unite here local,case order granting in part and denying in part motions to vacate and to confirm arbitration award,at.
all the while,mulhall was pursuing his own effort to block enforcement of what he characterized as an illegal and collusive arrangement between a union and an employer.not long after mardi gras filed its counterclaim for declaratory relief,mulhall filed his own action the instant case seeking an injunction pursuant to e of the lmra,e,claiming that the moa violated a b of the statute.on april,one week after ordering mardi gras and unite to arbitrate the validity of the moa,the district court dismissed mulhall complaint for lack of standing,holding that he had failed to show an that was actual or imminent,since it was possible that he would never be unionized even if unite received all of the specified organizing assistance from the hollywood greyhound track.
mulhall timely filed this appeal,claiming to have both article iii and prudential standing to seek to enjoin the moa pursuant to.unite disagrees,and also says that mulhall claim is not ripe for review because mardi gras has refused to provide organizing assistance,and may never do so.
we consider first whether mulhall has article iii standing.as the party invoking federal jurisdiction,mulhall bears the burden of demonstrating his standing to sue.pittman cole,cir.to do so,he must show that he has suffered,or imminently will suffer,an the injury is fairly traceable to the defendants conduct and a favorable judgment is likely to redress the injury.harrell v.the florida bar,cir.at the pleading stage,general factual allegations of injury resulting from the defendant conduct may suffice,for on a motion to dismiss we presum e that general allegations embrace those specific facts that are necessary to support the claim.lujan defenders of wildlife,d quoting lujan wildlife fed n,d whether mulhall has standing to seek an injunction of the moa pursuant to is a legal issue subject to de novo review.region forest serv.timber purchasers council alcock,cir.
to demonstrate an,mulhall is required to show that he has a legally cognizable interest that has been or is imminently at risk of being invaded.lujan,at.this requirement merely ensures that mulhall,like any plaintiff,has alleged such a personal stake in the outcome of the controversy as to assure that concrete adverseness which sharpens the presentation of issues.flast cohen,d quoting baker carr,d.importantly,therefore,the relevant question is not whether mulhall has a legal right to be free from involuntary unionization,or is legally entitled to enjoin the moa.s tanding in no way depends on the merits of the plaintiff contention that particular conduct is illegal,warth seldin,d it focuses on the party seeking to get his complaint before a federal court and not on the issues he wishes to have adjudicated,flast,at.at issue today is only whether mulhall has a stake in this controversy that is real enough and concrete enough to entitle him to be heard in a federal district court concerning his claim,nothing more.
mulhall has a cognizable associational interest under the first amendment to challenge the alleged collusive arrangement between the employer and the union under.if unite is certified as the majority representative of mardi gras employees,mulhall will have been thrust unwillingly into an agency relationship,where the union is his exclusive representative for the purposes of collective bargaining in respect to rates of pay,wages,hours of employment,or other conditions of employment under a of the national labor relations act nlra,a.this arrangement creates a fiduciary relationship,akin to that between a trustee and beneficiary.see chauffeurs,teamsters,and helpers,local terry,d.moreover,regardless of whether mulhall can avoid contributing financial support to or becoming a member of the union.const.art.i,the right of persons to work shall not be denied or abridged on account of membership or in any labor union or labor organization,its status as his exclusive representative plainly affects his associational rights.his views,for example,like those of any employee,may be at variance with 
a wide variety of activities undertaken by the union in its role as exclusive representative.his moral or religious views about the desirability of abortion may not square with the union policy in negotiating a medical benefits plan.one individual might disagree with a union policy of negotiating limits on the right to strike,believing that to be the road to serfdom for the working class,while another might have economic or political objections to unionism itself.an employee might object to the union wage policy because it violates guidelines designed to limit inflation,or might object to the union seeking a clause in the agreement proscribing racial discrimination.the examples could be multiplied.

just as t he first amendment clearly guarantees the right to join a union,hobbs hawkins,cir citing thomas,at,it presupposes a freedom not to associate with a union,roberts jaycees,d citing abood,at.this freedom of course may be outweighed by other important governmental interests,such as the promotion of productive relations.in this instance,for example,although the right of a union to supersede an employee direct bargaining relationship with his employer amounts to compulsory association,rivera,cir,that compulsion has been sanctioned as a permissible burden on employees free association rights,based on a legislative judgment that collective bargaining is crucial to labor peace,abood,at.
the relevant point here,however,is that employees like mulhall have such an associational interest.see scott,at holding that first amendment interests of nonunion employees to work in nonunion environment were invaded by conspiracy see also rivera,at.in other words,while compulsory affiliation with a union does not,without more,violate the first amendment rights of employees,lehnert ferris faculty ass n,d addressing both private and contexts,it is no less true that compelling an employee to belong to a union implicates that person first amendment right not to associate,romero colegio de abogados de,cir emphasis added we conclude that mulhall has a legally cognizable associational interest.we do not purport to assess the strength of mulhall interest we say only that it is enough to allow him to get his ticket stamped for admission to the federal court in order to be able to argue that the arrangement between mardi gras and unite is illegal under.
mulhall has also adequately alleged that this associational interest is at imminent risk of invasion,because mardi gras provision of considerable and varied organizing assistance pursuant to the moa will substantially increase the likelihood that mulhall will be unionized against his will.under controlling law,a plaintiff faces an imminent harm when there is a realistic danger of sustaining a direct injury as a result of the challenged action.state conf.of naacp browning,cir quoting babbitt united farm workers union,d.how likely is enough is necessarily a qualitative judgment,but,under our law,probabilistic harm is enough injury in fact to confer standing in the undemanding article iii sense,id.at citation and alteration omitted.
mulhall has adequately alleged that the organizing assistance promised by mardi gras in the moa is valuable,and indeed essential,to unite effort to gain recognition.as an initial matter,the complaint says that the provision of lists showing the classifications,departments,and home addresses of mardi gras employees permits local to target employees during organizing campaigns and send union organizers to employees homes,complaint b that access to mardi gras facilities,including areas of the gaming facility during hours,is objectively useful to local for organizing nonunion employees,id.b that the neutrality agreement is also useful to local because,among other things,it silences potentially persuasive opponents of unionization within the company,including all managers and supervisors who otherwise might discuss the disadvantages of unionization,id.b and that mardi gras waiver of its right to demand a secret,election,complaint,a a method which has acknowledged superiority in ascertaining whether a union has majority support,linden lumber division,summer nlrb,d similarly figured into the quid pro quo exchange with unite,id.
the complaint in this case,moreover,highlights unite own belief that the employer organizing assistance is essential to its effort to gain majority status.the complaint contains the following quotation from unite own allegations in parallel litigation 
t he employer failure to abide by the agreement provisions has caused and will cause serious irreparable injuries to the union and its members.without a list the union is unable to provide information to many of the employer workers,and hence unable to obtain recognition as the employees representative as contemplated by section of the agreement,and unable to find out from workers whether the employer is complying with other provisions of the agreement the resulting delay in recognition means a delay in obtaining the financial benefits of union representation for employees,and increased organizing expenses and lost revenues for the union,but the amount of such damages is extraordinarily burdensome to calculate,and also there are advantages to recognition which can not be put into monetary terms.the union is also suffering irreparable injuries in loss of standing with employees and loss of bargaining power.
complaint quoting unite here local hollywood greyhound track,case.complaint.also noteworthy,of course,is the consideration unite offered for the organizing assistance it promised not to picket,boycott,strike,or take other economic action against mardi gras,and that it would expend monetary and other resources to support a ballot proposition favored by mardi gras.id.unite ultimately spent on the initiative campaign,suggesting that the organizing assistance it bargained for was significant in a monetary sense.
taken together,the allegations in mulhall complaint yield a strong inference that the organizing assistance is a critical ingredient for unite success,and that,if provided,it will substantially increase the likelihood that mulhall will be unionized against his will.that probabilistic harm is a cognizable injury for purposes of standing.browning,at 
for obvious reasons,mulhall claim also satisfies the causation element of the standing inquiry.mulhall claimed injury flows from mardi gras imminent provision of organizing assistance under the moa,in response to unite demands.this injury is fairly traceable to the defendants conduct.lujan,at.alteration omitted.
finally,mulhall allegations satisfy the redressability requirement.redressability is established when a favorable decision would amount to a significant increase in the likelihood that the plaintiff would obtain relief that directly redresses the injury suffered.harrell,at citation omitted.if mulhall obtains a judgment enjoining enforcement of the moa,the substantial increase in the risk of unionization attributable to the moa will have been eliminated.
unite local also appears to suggest that mulhall claim is barred by the prudential standing doctrine,which comprises three,limitations on the availability of judicial review.am.iron and steel inst.osha,cir.the doctrine requires that the plaintiff complaint fall within the zone of interests protected by the statute or constitutional provision at issue that the complaint not require the court to pass on abstract questions or generalized grievances better addressed by the legislative branches and that the plaintiff assert his or her own legal rights and interests rather than the legal rights and interests of third parties.harris evans,cir en banc.mulhall easily satisfies the second and third requirements.the only real dispute here is whether mulhall meets the test,which limits judicial review to claims of injury that are sufficiently related to the core concerns of a given statute.
the test does not require the plaintiff to show an identifiable legal interest that may entitle him to relief.church of scientology flag serv,city of clearwater,cir quoting ass of data processing serv,camp adapso,d.rather,the plaintiff need only show that the relationship between his alleged interest and the purposes implicit in the substantive provision is more than marginal,city of clearwater,at quoting clarke sec.indus.ass n,d.see also adapso,at.
the relationship between mulhall alleged interest and the purposes of is more than marginal.section is a statute,united states browne,cir it bans the exchange of anything of value between a union and an employer,subject to a strictly limited set of exceptions,see a c.its purpose is to protect employees in dealings between the union and employer,jackson purchase rural coop.ass local union,int l of workers,cir,and specifically to protect them from the collusion of union officials and management,mosley maritime union pension and welfare plan.indeed,the legislative history of demonstrates that the provision was intended to prohibit,among other things,the buying and selling of labor peace,see,reprinted in,something that the moa at issue here at least arguably does,see complaint moa.mulhall complaint thus falls within the zone of interests that was designed to protect.
in sum,mulhall has adequately pleaded facts supporting article iii standing,and his claim raises no prudential standing concerns.
unite next argues that mulhall claim is not ripe,because his alleged injury is contingent on the outcome of mardi gras own lawsuit against unite to void the moa.specifically,unite suggests that mardi gras lawsuit,if successful,would shield mulhall from the agreement allegedly illegal effects,and from the concomitant increase in the likelihood of unionization.we remain unpersuaded.
the ripeness doctrine is one of the several strands of justiciability doctrine that go to the heart of the article iii case or controversy requirement.harrell,at quotation marks and citation omitted.while standing concerns the identity of the plaintiff and asks whether he may appropriately bring suit,ripeness concerns the timing of the suit.id.at.the function of the ripeness doctrine is to protect federal courts from engaging in speculation or wasting their resources through the review of potential or abstract disputes.id.at citation and quotation marks omitted.to determine whether a claim is ripe,we assess both the fitness of the issues for judicial decision and the hardship to the parties of withholding judicial review.id.at emphasis omitted.the fitness prong is typically concerned with questions of finality,definiteness,and the extent to which resolution of the challenge depends upon facts that may not yet be sufficiently developed.id.citation and quotation marks omitted.the hardship prong asks about the costs to the complaining party of delaying review until conditions for deciding the controversy are ideal.id.
unite argument,which goes to the fitness prong of the ripeness inquiry,has some appeal,for it is generally true that the existence of contingencies raises fitness concerns that militat e in favor of postpon ing review.id.at quoting fcc.specifically,if a plaintiff claimed injury depends on the resolution of other judicial proceedings,there may well be fitness concerns that render the plaintiff claim presumptively unripe.see,in re lowenschuss,cir holding that claim in bankruptcy dependent on judgment in parallel proceedings in new jersey was unripe,where third circuit had not yet ruled on an appeal lincoln house,dupre,cir 
yet,to determine whether a future contingency creates fitness and ultimately ripeness concerns,a court must assess the likelihood that a contingent event will deprive the plaintiff of an injury.see pittman,at.in other words,it is not merely the existence,but the degree of contingency that is an important barometer of ripeness.riva massachusetts,cir emphasis added.see also united steelworkers of,local cyclops,cir in undertaking a ripeness analysis,we pay particular attention to the likelihood that the harm alleged by plaintiffs will ever come to pass.
in this case,it is extremely unlikely that mardi gras parallel litigation,in its present posture,will deprive mulhall of an injury.as recounted above,the district court granted unite motion to compel arbitration of the dispute over the validity of the moa,and the arbitrator rendered a judgment in favor of unite.mardi gras moved to vacate the award,but the district court confirmed the award in all respects but one.thus,despite its unwillingness to comply with the disputed provisions of the moa,mardi gras is now under compulsion of the law to do just that.
we can divine only one theoretical scenario in which mulhall could be deprived of an injury at this point,namely,if mardi gras appealed the district court order confirming the arbitration award,obtained a stay of the district court judgment pending appeal,and prevailed on appeal.but that scenario is a decidedly remote possibility under the circumstances,because mardi gras is very unlikely to succeed in an appeal of the judgment confirming the arbitration award.the federal arbitration act authorizes a federal court to vacate an arbitral award in only four instances 
where the award was procured by corruption,fraud,or undue means 
where there was evident partiality or corruption in the arbitrators,or either of them 
where the arbitrators were guilty of misconduct in refusing to postpone the hearing,upon sufficient cause shown,or in refusing to hear evidence pertinent and material to the controversy or of any other misbehavior by which the rights of any party have been prejudiced or 
where the arbitrators exceeded their powers,or so imperfectly executed them that a mutual,final,and definite award upon the subject matter submitted was not made.
a frazier citifinancial,llc,cir holding that statutory grounds for vacatur are exclusive.aside from its claim that the arbitrator exceeded his authority by extending the term of the moa for one claim upon which the district court granted gras never argued that the arbitral award was subject to vacatur on any of the enumerated statutory grounds.
furthermore,although mardi gras might argue on appeal that the validity of the moa should not have been arbitrated in the first instance,mardi gras is very unlikely to prevail on that claim,either.as the district court observed in granting unite motion to compel arbitration,federal law required arbitration of the subject dispute,pursuant to the moa arbitration clause,unless it could be said with positive assurance that the arbitration clause was not susceptible of an interpretation that cover ed the asserted dispute,with any doubts about arbitrability resolved in favor of coverage.at t techs.commc ns workers of,d citations omitted.the clause at issue here broadly covered any disputes over the interpretation or application of the moa,a phrase that seems at least arguably expansive enough to cover a dispute over whether certain parts of the agreement were legal and could be applied at all.
it is also exceedingly unlikely that mardi gras could successfully obtain a stay of the district court judgment confirming the arbitral award pending appeal.to be sure,a stay is theoretically and procedurally possible a rbitration awards are not,but must be given force and effect by being converted to judicial orders on an appropriate motion to confirm or vacate,blair gottdiener,cir internal quotation marks omitted,and a district court may enter a stay of any judgment pending a
