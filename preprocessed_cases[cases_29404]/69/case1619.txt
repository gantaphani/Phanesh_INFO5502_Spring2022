go medical industries,and alexander collectively go appeal from a final judgment of the united states district court for the northern district of georgia.go challenges orders granting its motion for summary judgment of patent infringement but finding,inter alia,that the asserted claims were invalid as anticipated because go was not entitled to claim the priority date of an earlier application,go medical indus,inmed.july,sj order denying its motion for prejudgment interest,go medical indus,inmed,prejudgment interest order and reducing the jury award of damages on go claims for trademark infringement and breach of contract upon granting judgment as a matter of law jmol,go medical indus,inmed,first jmol order.specifically,go argues that the district court erred in granting summary judgment on the patent claim because there were factual disputes as to whether the earlier patent application met the requirements of prejudgment interest should have been awarded because the contract damages were liquidated and the damages award should not have been reduced.
inmed corporation,doing business as rüsch,international rüsch,and alpine medical,formerly known as medical marketing group,mmg,separately.rüsch contends that the district court erred in entering a permanent injunction,go medical indus,inmed,injunction order,because go had no trademark rights in the surname.mmg,on the other hand,asserts that public policy bars go claims the district court erred in denying its second motion for jmol requesting elimination of all the contract damages,go medical indus,inmed,second jmol order and there can be no implied trademark license of a surname that has not achieved secondary meaning.
as described in further detail below,we conclude that the district court misapplied the doctrine first set forth by lear,adkins,d,in reducing the damages for mmg breach of contract.on all other issues,however,we find no reversible error.we thus,and remand for a recalculation of damages.
background 
urinary catheters typically increase the risk of urinary tract infections because inserting a catheter can push bacteria into the normally sterile bladder.most of the bacteria are concentrated in the first cm to cm of the urethra,due to a natural pressure barrier located about cm from the outer end.
invented a catheter with a sheath that does not extend beyond this pressure reducing the likelihood of contamination caused by the sheath obtained united states patent the patent in.the patent was issued from a application that claimed the priority date of an application filed on september,the claims of the patent recite the use of a stop member to limit the insertion of the sheath to either about cm or moving the sheath along the urethra such that the distal end is in a known position of maximum pressure,but not beyond that position.
go medical industries,founded by in,is an australian limited liability company that manufactures and markets the type of urinary catheters described in the patent.go products were initially distributed in the united states by penine healthcare,a medical manufacturing and supply company based in the united kingdom.
in,go and mmg entered into a contract that gave mmg the exclusive right to distribute such catheters within the united states.the agreement provided that go and mmg would share the net profits equally.at first,mmg purchased products from go,but,for various reasons,soon started manufacturing catheters itself and selling them as neil catheters.mmg registered the neil trademark on january.
starting in,mmg began paying go of gross sales on the neil catheters in lieu of of net profits,although it was later revealed that this amount was not equivalent.in,the agreement was amended.significantly,the parties agreed that of the gross sales represent ed go medical usa net profit share.the term of the contract was also reduced from years to the life of the patent.finally,the amendment explicitly provided that the parties would share any intellectual property enforcement costs.both the agreement and the amendment were silent on whether mmg was also licensing the right to use the name on its catheters.
in,mmg urged go to sue when bard entered the market with a competing catheter.go alleges that mmg refused to share in the costs of litigation,despite their contractual obligation to do so.in march,the district court granted summary judgment in favor of bard,finding the patent unenforceable due to inequitable conduct and invalid as anticipated on august,this court reversed and remanded for further proceedings.go medical indus,bard,wl unpublished table decision.that case settled shortly thereafter.
meanwhile,in a letter dated june,mmg notified go that it believed they no longer ha d a contract since the district court had found the patent invalid.consequently,it started placing its royalty payments in escrow around april.in august,go terminated the agreement and demanded that mmg cease using the trademark.mmg refused and continued to sell neil catheters even after it sold its assets to rüsch in february for million.in,however,rüsch changed the name of its catheters to rüsch mmg.
on february,go sued mmg and rüsch in the united states district court for the northern district of georgia.go alleged patent infringement,breach of contract,tortious interference with contract,conspiracy to breach fiduciary duty,trademark infringement,and unfair competition.
on july,the district court granted summary judgment in favor of mmg and rüsch,finding the patent infringed,but invalid as anticipated.the parties agreed that a article written by anticipated the patent if go could not claim the priority date.sj order,slip op.at.the court concluded that go was not entitled to claim the benefit of that filing date because the application did not satisfy the written description or best mode requirements under,slip op.at.it denied summary judgment on the issue of enablement,however,because there remained a genuine factual dispute whether the amount of experimentation required to practice the invention was undue,slip op.at.
in addition,the court granted summary judgment in favor of go on the inequitable conduct issue,concluding that there was insufficient evidence to support a finding of material misrepresentation in light of the federal circuit decision in the previous litigation,slip op.at.the district court further granted summary judgment in favor of mmg and rüsch on lost profits,finding that go could not satisfy the test for recovering lost profits for patent infringement,slip op.at.
as for the trademark claims,mmg and rüsch had themselves asserted a likelihood of confusion between and neil in their trademark counterclaims the court found this to constitute a judicial admission on that issue,slip op.at.yet,the district court denied summary judgment because there remained questions of triable fact as to whether had acquired secondary meaning,whether the agreement between the parties included an implied trademark license,and whether the mark was abandoned due to naked licensing,slip op.at.
in february,the case proceeded to trial.at the close of plaintiff case,the district court granted jmol on go claims for the breach of fiduciary duty and tortious interference with contract.this ruling is not being appealed.at the close of evidence,mmg and rüsch made motions for jmol under rule a,which were denied.the jury returned a verdict in favor of go.on the breach of contract claim against mmg,the jury awarded.on the trademark infringement claim against mmg,the jury awarded as a reasonable royalty,for unjust enrichment,and in punitive damages.as for the trademark infringement claim against rüsch,the jury awarded as a reasonable royalty and for unjust enrichment.mmg and rüsch both challenged these damages awards with renewed motions for jmol under rule b.
on september,the district court denied go motion for prejudgment interest.the court found that the contract claim was not a liquidated claim it further declined to award prejudgment interest on the lanham act claim.prejudgment interest order,slip op.at.the same day,the court granted go motion for a permanent injunction and prohibited mmg and rüsch from using or any confusingly similar mark.injunction order,slip op.at.
on january,mmg motion for jmol was and rüsch motion was also granted.see first jmol order.the district court applied the lear doctrine to preclude royalties owed after march when the patent was found invalid in the litigation against bard and reduced mmg contract damages accordingly,slip op.at.
as for the trademark damages,the court characterized the jury reasonable royalty award as recovery based on profits rather than actual damages and thus subject to reduction in accordance with the principles of equity because it was based on a wholly speculative royalty rate that go expert arbitrarily pulled out of the air,slip op.at.the court also exercised its discretion under the lanham act to set aside the jury award of lost profits,slip op.at,and expressly rejected go argument that the jury awarded lost profit damages under common law,slip op.at.the court further reasoned that the award of punitive damages against mmg which allegedly infringed for six months,but not rüsch which allegedly infringed for forty months,suggested that the jurors were punishing mmg for actions relating to its breach of contract,which was not permitted by,slip op.at.the court concluded that the jury,which had not been told that the patent was ruled invalid,was obviously swayed by counsel argument that mmg had stolen invention as well as the mass of irrelevant and prejudicial evidence that was admitted during the trial,slip op.at.
in a separate order,also dated january,the court found that this case was not exceptional and denied go motion for attorney fees.this ruling is not being challenged on appeal.
on february,final judgment was entered.a timely appeal and followed.on february,however,mmg filed another jmol motion,challenging the breach of contract damages.in april,this court deactivated the notice of appeal to allow the district court an opportunity to dispose of this last outstanding motion.on august,the district court rejected mmg additional arguments concerning various contractual provisions and denied the motion.second jmol order,slip op.at.the notice of appeal was reactivated on august.we have jurisdiction pursuant to a.
ii.discussion 
patent invalidity 
a district court grant of summary judgment on the issue of patent invalidity is reviewed without deference.augustine,gaymar.here,go conceded that a article written by fully anticipated the patent if it was not entitled to claim the filing date of its original application.whether a patent is entitled to an earlier priority date is also reviewed without deference.in re daniels.
a patent application for an invention disclosed in a application in a manner that satisfies all the requirements of is entitled to the benefit of the earlier filing date.a application contains subject matter from a prior application and may also contain additional matter not disclosed in the prior application.augustine,at.new subject matter does not receive the benefit of the earlier priority date.id.
the claims of the patent require the catheter sheath to be inserted about cm or up to but not beyond a known position of maximum pressure.the specification of the application discloses that the stop means can be set at a predetermined distance along the sheath depending on the usual extent of bacteria within the passage.figure,shown here,is a schematic diagram showing the distribution of bacteria in a female urethra.the specification further discloses that the sheath should be inserted to an extent whereby its distal end penetrates beyond bacteria disposed adjacent the proximal end of the passage,such that in at least one embodiment,the distal end of the cover is at the area marked x in figure.
in determining whether the best mode requirement of,is met,we first determine whether subjectively considered a particular mode of practicing the invention to be superior to all other embodiments at the time the application was filed.see,liquid dynamics vaughan.if so,we then ask whether he provided a sufficient disclosure to allow others to practice that best mode.id.
as to the first prong of this test,admitted during his deposition that at the time he filed his patent application in,he had already made sample catheters where the distance from the stop member to the distal end of the sheath was cm.he further characterized it as the preferred embodiment at that stage.dep.the patent,at,describes this distance as crucial to preventing bacteria from being pushed into the bladder by the catheter or by the sheath itself.the district court thus correctly concluded that possessed a best,a sheath length of cm.sj order,slip op.at.
we also agree with the district court that the application lacked sufficient disclosure to allow others to practice the best mode,slip op.at.there is no dispute that the preferred length of cm was not expressly disclosed.even testified at his deposition that when drafting the application,he purposely avoid ed any comment with relation to length because he was aware that numbers would become limiting themselves.dep.
nor were the drawings submitted with the application sufficient.there is no indication that figure was drawn to any particular scale,much less one where the distance between the x and the outer end of the urethra is exactly cm.p atent drawings do not define the precise proportions of the elements and may not be relied on to show particular sizes if the specification is completely silent on the issue,avia group.int l,see also in re wright,absent any written description in the specification of quantitative values,arguments based on measurement of a drawing are of little value.
moreover,also testified that i t took him a few weeks of experiments to define the distance and others would have to do a small amount of experimental work to reach the same conclusion.dep.in other words,one of ordinary skill would not know from reading the application that the preferred length between the stop member and the distal end of the sheath was cm.
in sum,we conclude that the invention of the patent was not disclosed in the application in a manner that satisfies the best mode no reasonable jury could find that go is not entitled to claim the priority date of that application.thus,the article anticipates.in light of this ruling,we need not address whether the district court erred in finding that the application also failed to meet the written description requirement.we affirm the grant of summary judgment of patent invalidity.
prejudgment interest 
on procedural issues not unique to patent law,we apply the standard of review of the regional circuit.sulzer textil picanol.the denial of prejudgment interest is reviewed for abuse of discretion.smith am.int l life assurance,cir.
the relevant statute provides 
in all cases where an amount ascertained would be the damages at the time of the breach,it may be increased by the addition of legal interest from that time until the recovery.
ann.emphasis added.because an award of prejudgment interest is intended to be compensatory rather than punitive,equitable considerations should be evaluated by the district court.osterneck barwick,cir.
the district court did not err in concluding that the alleged contract damages were not liquidated because the amount owed to go was not ascertained until the jury verdict was rendered.in other words,the royalties due under the license,profits versus gross sales,depending on how the contract was interpreted by the jury was in dispute.neither the agreement nor the amendment contained a liquidated damages provision.we also find that the district court did not abuse its discretion in declining to award prejudgment interest on go claim under the lanham act.we therefore affirm the denial of prejudgment interest.
we now consider whether the district court erred in reducing the jury contract and trademark damages.judgment as a matter of law is appropriate when a party has been fully heard on an issue and there is no legally sufficient evidentiary basis for a reasonable jury to find for that party on that issue.a.we review the grant or denial of jmol de novo,by reapplying the same standard used by the district court.telecom tech.servs.rolm,cir.
as a preliminary matter,go argues that a district judge may not rely on new grounds not raised in a rule a to set aside the jury verdict.ross rhodes furniture,cir.it would have been impossible,however,for mmg and rüsch to challenge the jury award of damages as excessive in a rule a motion.by definition,such a motion is made before submission of the case to the jury.a.moreover,go failed to object to the rule b motions on this procedural ground and can not do so for the first time on appeal.
breach of contract 
in lear,the supreme court held that a licensee was not estopped from challenging the validity of the licensor patent.at.for various policy reasons,a licensee may cease payments due under a,contractual royalty provisions will not be the time it is challenging patent validity in the courts.id.at.our court has since clarified that the lear doctrine does not prevent a patentee from recovering royalties until the date the licensee first challenges the validity of the patent.studiengesellschaft kohle,shell oil.in other words,a licensee can not invoke the protection of the lear doctrine until it i actually ceases payment of royalties,and ii provides notice to the licensor that the reason for ceasing payment of royalties is because it has deemed the relevant claims to be invalid.id 
the district court erred in applying the lear doctrine to relieve mmg of the obligation to pay any royalties after the finding of patent invalidity during go litigation against bard in march.that ruling had no effect on the contractual relationship between go and mmg.although the amendment tied the term of the contract to the life of the patent,the license did not automatically terminate with the district court ruling,as mmg believed,because the invalidity finding was still pending appeal.in fact,mmg june,letter to go stated that it was placing its royalty payments in an escrow account until such time as the appeal is decided emphasis added.this was an implicit acknowledgment that go was entitled to the royalty payments,meaning the funds would be transferred out of escrow,in the event that the district court invalidity finding was reversed.
moreover,mmg june,letter did not state that its reason for ceasing payment of royalties was that it deemed the patent to be invalid.instead,it merely indicated that mmg was placing its royalty payments in escrow until the validity of the patent was resolved on appeal.even if it had been sufficient to constitute the requisite notice,the district court still erred in finding that lear relieved mmg from all royalty payments after march instead of the date of this,june.
mmg is trying to have it both ways.as the exclusive distributor of the urinary catheter described in the patent,mmg not only urged go to sue bard,but was the primary beneficiary when we later reversed the invalidity finding from that litigation.significantly,it did not file its own declaratory judgment suit to challenge the patent validity after it learned about the district court march ruling.indeed,until the agreement was terminated by go in august,mmg was contractually obligated to share the costs of enforcing the patent,including the costs of pursuing the appeal.
because the district court misapplied the lear doctrine,we vacate and remand for a recalculation of the contract damages.
trademark infringement 
the relevant section of the lanham act provides 
a profits damages and costs attorney fees.when a violation of any right of the registrant of a mark shall have been established in any civil action arising under this act,the plaintiff shall be entitled,subject to the provisions of,and subject to the principles of equity,to recover defendant profits,any damages sustained by the plaintiff,and the costs of the action.the court shall assess such profits and damages or cause the same to be assessed under its direction.in assessing profits the plaintiff shall be required to prove defendant sales only defendant must prove all elements of cost or deduction claimed.in assessing damages the court may enter judgment,according to the circumstances of the case,for any sum above the amount found as actual damages,not exceeding three times such amount.if the court shall find that the amount of the recovery based on profits is either inadequate or excessive the court may in its discretion enter judgment for such sum as the court shall find to be just,according to the circumstances of the case.such sum in either of the above circumstances shall constitute compensation and not a penalty.the court in exceptional cases may award reasonable attorney fees to the prevailing party.
emphasis added.
first,we agree with the district court that does not allow for a downward adjustment of actual damages.the jury award of a reasonable royalty,however,was not based on substantial evidence of actual damages.there was no evidence of an explicit agreement setting forth a royalty rate for use of the name on catheters.rather than analyze how much mmg would have agreed to pay as a trademark royalty in a hypothetical negotiation,go expert merely considered mmg excess earnings and attributed to the trademark and the remaining to other factors.this was correctly characterized as a recovery based on mmg profits,rather than actual damages in the amount of lost royalties.as such,the district court had discretion under to adjust this portion of the jury award.
go expert provided no explanation for how he assigned the figure as a reasonable royalty for use of the trademark in fact,the district court thought it seemed to be arbitrarily pulled out of the air.first jmol order,slip op.at.the court also pointed to the abundance of evidence in the record that the success of mmg catheters was more likely due to its marketing and advertising efforts,the superiority of the product,its eligibility for medicare reimbursement,and other factors,not to the name.id.we find no abuse of discretion in the court reduction of this award.
as to the jury award of profits,gives district courts broad latitude to adjust this amount the district court pointed to numerous equitable considerations which we do not repeat here weighing against an award of profits,slip.likewise,the district court gave sufficient reasons why the jury punitive damages award was properly set aside,slip op at.in short,we find no abuse of discretion here.
permanent injunction 
on,mmg and rüsch challenge the district court grant of a permanent injunction,although rüsch voluntarily dropped the designation and has been calling its products üsch catheters since.as such,the permanent injunction,it seems,may have no impact on its operations.
to the extent that we need to reach the merits,however,we find that substantial evidence supports the jury findings that had acquired secondary meaning that the agreement between go and mmg included an implied trademark license and that the mark was never abandoned by go.thus,permanent injunctive relief was an appropriate remedy.
we have considered the remaining arguments made by each party on the appeal and and find them to be unpersuasive.
iii.conclusion 
for the aforementioned reasons,we,and remand for further proceedings consistent with this opinion.
and remanded.
the original application was not limited to urinary catheters instead,the claims were drafted broadly to include a variety of medical instruments for insertion into a body passage.the examiner repeatedly rejected the claims as anticipated or obvious over the prior art,and the application was subsequently abandoned.also filed continuation applications in and,but both were eventually abandoned as well.
during the course of that litigation,go corrected two gaps in of the chain of applications leading up to the patent so it could claim the benefit of the filing date.go had conceded that the patent was otherwise anticipated by the publication of patent application.bard alleged that misrepresented when he first became aware that the application had been abandoned,such that his petition to revive that application was not timely filed.see go medical indus,bard,wl,at unpublished table decision.
during oral arg
