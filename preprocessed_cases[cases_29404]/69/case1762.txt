introduction 
defendants and appellants inland empire patient health and wellness center,et inland empire center appeal from a judgment entered in favor of plaintiff and respondent,the city of riverside riverside,after the trial court found that inland empire center medical marijuana dispensary mmd constituted a public nuisance per se and issued a preliminary injunction enjoining inland empire center from operating its mmd in riverside.
inland empire center contends riverside ordinance banning mmd throughout riverside is preempted by state law specifically,the compassionate use act of cua health,and the medical marijuana program mmp.we conclude riverside ordinance banning mmd is not preempted by state law.we therefore affirm the preliminary injunction and judgment.
factual and procedural background 
inland empire center is a nonprofit mutual benefit corporation established for the purpose of facilitating an mmd located in riverside.inland empire center mmd is a nonprofit collaborative association of patient members,who collectively cultivate medical marijuana and redistribute it to each other.inland empire center has operated its mmd in riverside since.
defendant lanny swerdlow swerdlow is a registered nurse and manager of an adjacent,separate medical clinic,thcf medical clinic,unassociated with the mmd.defendant william joseph sump ii is an inland empire center board member and general manager of inland empire center riverside mmd.defendants meneleo carlos and filomena carlos the carloses own the property upon which the mmd is located and lease the property to swerdlow.defendant angel city west,angel provides management services for the property.
in january,riverside community development department planning division sent swerdlow a letter stating that riverside zoning code prohibits mmd in riverside.in may,riverside filed a complaint against angel,swerdlow,sump the carloses,east west bancorp,and thcf health and wellness center for injunctive relief to abate public nuisance.the complaint alleges inland empire center mmd constitutes a public nuisance,in violation of riverside zoning code,riverside municipal code rmc section q.riverside notified swerdlow of the violation.nevertheless,swerdlow continues to operate the mmd.
riverside complaint includes two causes of action,both alleging public nuisance,and prays for injunctive relief enjoining inland empire center from operating its mmd in riverside.riverside alleges in the complaint that inland empire center is located in a commercial zone.under riverside zoning code,mmd are prohibited.rmc.riverside zoning code further states that any use which is prohibited by state federal law is strictly prohibited in riverside.rmc.any violation of riverside municipal code is deemed a public nuisance under rmc sections and q.inland empire center mmd violates riverside zoning code and is therefore a public nuisance subject to abatement.
riverside filed a motion for a preliminary injunction,seeking to close inland empire center mmd in riverside.riverside police detective darren woolley woolley concluded in his supporting declaration that the medical clinic,thcf medical clinic,where swerdlow worked as a nurse,was connected to inland empire center mmd and referred patients to the mmd.riverside requested the trial court to take judicial notice of various documents,including a report entitled,california police chiefs association task force on marijuana dispensaries and a report by the riverside county district attorney office,entitled,medical marijuana history and current complications.inland empire center objected to judicial notice of these documents.the court did not rule on the judicial notice request.
in support of inland empire center opposition to riverside motion for a preliminary injunction,swerdlow states in his declaration that he managed the medical clinic woolley claimed was associated with the mmp.according to swerdlow,the medical clinic is not connected with the mmd.woolley erroneously referred to inland empire center mmd as the thcf medical clinic,which is at a different location nearby.
inland empire center general manager,sump,also provided a declaration supporting inland empire center opposition,stating that inland empire center had advised riverside that it would be operating an mmd in riverside.sump further stated that inland empire center had been lawfully operating its mmd and it did not constitute a nuisance to the surrounding community.
on november,the trial court heard riverside motion for a preliminary injunction and granted the motion,concluding city of claremont kruse th kruse controlled and therefore riverside could use zoning regulations to prohibit mmd,especially given the conflict between state and federal law.the trial court added it was not finding that federal law preempted state law in this instance.the court acknowledged there was case law holding that there was no federal law preemption.the trial court entered a written order enjoining inland empire center from operating its mmd on the carloses property.
standard of review 
in this appeal,inland empire center challenges the trial court order granting riverside request for a preliminary injunction.we review an order granting a preliminary injunction,under an abuse of discretion standard,to determine whether the trial court abused its discretion in evaluating the two interrelated factors pertinent to issuance of a preliminary injunction the likelihood that the plaintiffs will prevail on the merits at trial,and the interim harm that the plaintiffs are likely to sustain if the injunction were denied as compared to the harm the defendant is likely to suffer if the preliminary injunction were issued.citation.abuse of discretion as to either factor warrants reversal.citation.alliant ins.services,gaddy th.w e interpret the facts in the light most favorable to the prevailing party and indulge in all reasonable inferences in support of the trial court order.citations.citations.id.at.
here,the validity of the injunction and likelihood inland empire center will prevail at trial turn on a question of law whether riverside zoning code banning mmd in riverside is valid and enforceable.the underlying facts demonstrating a violation of the zoning code are undisputed.inland empire center was operating an mmd on riverside property,owned,leased,used managed by the inland empire center defendants.inland empire center argues the zoning code prohibiting mmd is invalid and unenforceable because it is preempted by state law the cua and mmp.whether state law preempts a local ordinance is a question of law that is subject to de novo review.citation.citation.the party claiming that general state law preempts a local ordinance has the burden of demonstrating preemption.citation.citation.kruse,supra,th at.
since the material facts relevant to preemption are undisputed,this is a question of law which we review de novo.kruse,supra,th at.inland empire center bears the burden of demonstrating preemption.we conclude inland empire center has not met this burden and therefore the trial court did not abuse its discretion in granting a preliminary injunction enjoining inland empire center from operating its mmd in riverside.
preemption principles 
the general principles governing state statutory preemption of local land use regulation are well settled.big creek lumber county of santa cruz cal th,big creek lumber kruse,supra,th at.under article xi,section of the california constitution,a county or city may make and enforce within its limits all local,police,sanitary,and other ordinances and regulations not in conflict with general laws.if otherwise valid local legislation conflicts with state law,it is preempted by such law and is void.sherwin williams city of los angeles cal th,sherwin williams,quoting candid enterprises,grossmont union high school dist.cal d.three types of conflict give rise to state law preemption a local law duplicates state law,contradicts state law,or enters an area fully occupied by state law,either expressly or by legislative implication.kruse,at action apartment,city of santa monica cal th.
where,as here,there is no clear indication of preemptive intent from the legislature,we presume that riverside zoning regulations,in an area over which local government traditionally has exercised control,are not preempted by state law.kruse,supra,th at.w hen local government regulates in an area over which it traditionally exercised control,such as the location of particular land uses,california courts will presume,absent a clear indication of preemptive intent from the legislature,that such regulation is not preempted by state statute.citation.kruse,supra,th at,quoting big creek lumber,supra,cal th at.this court thus must presume,absent a clear indication the legislature intended to regulate the location of mmd,that such regulation by local government is not preempted by state law.
california medical marijuana laws 
in determining whether riverside zoning code banning mmd is preempted by state law,we first consider the scope and purpose of california medical marijuana laws,specifically the cua and mmp.
in,california voters approved a ballot initiative,proposition,referred to as the compassionate use act of.the cua is intended to ensure that seriously ill californians have the right to obtain and use marijuana for medical purposes where that medical use is deemed appropriate and has been recommended by a physician who has determined that the person health would benefit from the use of marijuana,subd.b a.the cua is also intended to ensure that patients and their primary caregivers who obtain and use marijuana for medical purposes upon the recommendation of a physician are not subject to criminal prosecution or sanction,subd.b b.in addition,the cua is intended to encourage the federal and state governments to implement a plan to provide for the safe and affordable distribution of marijuana to all patients in medical need of marijuana,subd.b c.the cua provides a limited defense from prosecution for cultivation and possession of marijuana.the cua is narrow in scope.ross ragingwire telecommunications,cal th,kruse,supra,th at.it does not create a statutory or constitutional right to obtain marijuana,or allow the sale or nonprofit distribution of marijuana by mmd.ross at,kruse,at people urziceanu th,urziceanu.
in,the legislature added the mmp.the purposes of the mmp include promoting uniform and consistent application of the cua among the counties within the state and enhancing the access of patients and caregivers to medical marijuana through collective,cooperative cultivation projects.citation.county of los angeles hill th,hill.the mmp includes guidelines for the implementation of the cua.among other things,it provides that qualified patients and their primary caregivers have limited immunity from prosecution for violation of various sections of the health and safety code regulating marijuana including section,the drug den abatement law.
with regard to drug den abatement,the mmp provides a new affirmative defense to criminal liability for qualified patients,caregivers,and holders of valid identification cards who collectively or cooperatively cultivate marijuana.citation.kruse,supra,th at.for instance,section of the mmp provides qualified patients,persons with valid identification cards,and the designated primary caregivers of qualified patients and persons with identification cards,who associate within the state of california in order collectively or cooperatively to cultivate marijuana for medical purposes,shall not solely on the basis of that fact be subject to state criminal sanctions under section,or.in addition,section provides limited immunity for transporting,processing,administering,and cultivating medical marijuana.
applicable riverside municipal code provisions 
chapter of the rmc enumerates permissible and impermissible land uses.rmc section states that table a of section identifies those uses that are specifically prohibited.uses not listed in tables are prohibited unless,the zoning administrator,pursuant to chapter interpretation of code,determines that the use is similar and no more detrimental than a listed permitted or conditional use.any use which is prohibited by state federal law is also strictly prohibited.rmc.table a states that mmd constitute a prohibited use throughout riverside.rmc.riverside zoning code further states that persons vested with enforcement authority shall have the power to use whatever judicial and administrative remedies are available under the riverside municipal code to enforce the zoning code.rmc.
rmc further provides that any condition caused or permitted to exist in violation of any of the provisions of this code,or the provisions of any code adopted by reference by this code,shall be deemed a public nuisance and may be abated by the city,rmc,e.rmc section,enumerating acts constituting nuisances,states it is unlawful and is hereby declared a nuisance for any person owning,leasing,occupying or having charge or possession of any property in the city to maintain the property in such a manner that any of the following conditions are present any other violation of this code pursuant to section this encompasses a violation of riverside zoning code,such as the provision banning mmd.under the rmc,inland empire center mmd is a zoning violation,constituting a public nuisance which is amenable to abatement and injunctive relief by civil action.
preemption 
generally a municipal zoning ordinance is presumed to be valid.stubblefield construction city of san bernardino th.inland empire center argues that,while cities and counties may zone where mmd may be located,riverside can not lawfully ban all mmd from the city.this court must presume riverside zoning ordinance banning mmd in riverside is valid unless inland empire center demonstrates the ordinance is unlawful based on state law preemption of riverside zoning ordinance.
federal preemption of state law 
inland empire center argues that under qualified patients city of anaheim th qualified,local municipalities can not enact a total ban of mmd based solely on federal law preemption.the court in qualified stated the city may not justify its ordinance solely under federal law citations,nor in doing so invoke federal preemption of state law that may invalidate the city ordinance.the city obstacle preemption argument therefore fails.qualified,at,fn.omitted.in other words,the city can not rely on the proposition that federal law,which criminalizes possession of marijuana,preempts state law allowing limited use of medical marijuana and mmd.
we agree that under qualified federal preemption of state medical marijuana law is not a valid basis for upholding riverside zoning ordinance banning mmd.the key issue in determining whether riverside zoning ordinance is legally enforceable is whether state medical marijuana statutes,such as the cua and mmp,preempt riverside zoning ordinance banning mmd.if the local ordinance is not preempted by state law,the ordinance is valid and enforceable.
state law preemption of local law 
we reject the proposition that local governments,such as riverside,are preempted by the cua and mmp from enacting zoning ordinances banning mmd.riverside zoning ordinance does not duplicate,contradict,or occupy the field of state law legalizing medical marijuana and mmd.
duplicative and contradictory rules 
a duplicative rule is one that mimics a state law or is coextensive with state law.city of stockton cal th,habitat trust for wildlife,city of rancho cucamonga th,fourth dist,div.two.a contradictory rule is one that is inimical to or can not be reconciled with a state law.habitat trust for wildlife,at,at.
riverside zoning ordinance regulating mmd does not mimic or duplicate state law and can be reconciled with the cua and mmp.riverside zoning ordinance banning mmd differs in scope and substance from the cua and mmp.sherwin williams,supra,cal th at.the cua is narrow in scope.kruse,supra,th at.it provides medical marijuana users and care providers with limited criminal immunity for use,cultivation,and possession of medical marijuana.the cua does not create a constitutional right to obtain marijuana,or allow the sale or nonprofit distribution of marijuana by medical marijuana cooperatives.id.at.
the mmp merely implements the cua and also provides immunity for those involved in lawful mmd.the cua and mmp do not provide individuals with inalienable rights to establish,operate,or use mmd.the state statutes do not preclude local governments from regulating mmd through zoning ordinances.the establishment and operation of mmd is thus subject to local zoning and business licensing laws.there is nothing stated to the contrary in the cua or mmp.the cua and mmp do not expressly mandate that mmd shall be permitted within every city and county,nor do the cua and mmp prohibit cities and counties from banning mmd.the operative provisions of the cua and mmp do not speak to local zoning laws.kruse,supra,th at.although the mmp provides limited immunity to those using and operating lawful mmd,the mmp does not restrict or usurp in any way the police power of local governments to enact zoning and land use regulations prohibiting mmd.
inland empire center argues riverside ordinance banning mmd is invalid because it is inconsistent with the mmp,which provides limited immunity for operating and using mmd.for instance,section of the mmp provides immunity for a nuisance claim arising from a violation of section,which encompasses operating an mmd.section provides civil nuisance liability every building or place used for the purpose of unlawfully selling,serving,storing,keeping,manufacturing,or giving away any controlled substance and every building or place wherein or upon which those acts take place,is a nuisance which shall be enjoined,abated,and prevented,and for which damages may be recovered,whether it is a public or private nuisance.italics added.section of the mmp provides qualified patients,persons with valid identification cards,and the designated primary caregivers of qualified patients and persons with identification cards,who associate within the state of california in order collectively or cooperatively to cultivate marijuana for medical purposes,shall not solely on the basis of that fact be subject to state criminal sanctions under section,or.italics added.
as inland empire center notes,section,unlike the other statutes listed in section,does not provide criminal sanctions.nevertheless,inland empire center argues that under qualified,supra,th at pages,section provides immunity from a nuisance claim for operating an mmd in violation of section.the court in qualified states sections and of the mmpa immunize operators of medical marijuana dispensaries from prosecution under state nuisance abatement law solely on the basis that they use any building or place for the purpose of unlawfully selling,serving,storing,keeping,manufacturing,or giving away any controlled substance 
inland empire center claims that section demonstrates the legislature intent to bar cities from declaring mmd a nuisance and banning them.inland empire center argues that,by enacting section,which refers to section,the legislature expressly prohibits cities from bringing civil nuisance claims under civil code section for operating mmd.urziceanu,supra,th at.civil code section provides that nothing which is done or maintained under the express authority of a statute can be deemed a nuisance.
inland empire center asserts that,because section exempts an operator of an mmd from liability for nuisance,riverside zoning ordinance,banning mmd and declaring them a nuisance,is preempted by state law.we disagree.here,inland empire center is prosecuted for a zoning violation,and not solely on the basis inland empire center used the premises for operating an mmd.although section allows lawful mmd,a municipality can limit or prohibit mmd through zoning regulations and prosecute such violations by bringing a nuisance action and seeking injunctive relief.protection under civil code section is applied very narrowly,only where the alleged nuisance is exactly what was lawfully authorized.jacobs cabo,western farm service,th,italics added.inland empire center reliance on civil code section is misplaced since,here,the legislature did not expressly prohibit cities from enacting zoning regulations banning mmd or from bringing a nuisance action enforcing such ordinances.therefore riverside zoning ordinance banning mmd does not duplicate or contradict the cua and mmp statutes.
expressly occupying the field of state law 
local legislation enters an area that is fully occupied by general law when the legislature has expressly manifested its intent to fully occupy the area.kruse,supra,th at.here,the cua and mmp do not expressly state an intent to fully occupy the area of regulating,licensing,and zoning mmd,to the exclusion of all local law.
in kruse,supra,th,the court stated that the cua did not expressly preempt the city zoning ordinance which temporarily prohibited mmd the cua does not expressly preempt the city actions in this case.the operative provisions of the cua do not address zoning or business licensing decisions.the statute operative provisions protect physicians from being punished,or denied any right or privilege,for having recommended marijuana to a patient for medical purposes,subd.c,and shield patients and their qualified caregivers from criminal liability for possession and cultivation of marijuana for the patient personal medical purposes if approved by a physician,subd.d.the plain language of the statute does not prohibit the city from enforcing zoning and business licensing requirements applicable to defendants proposed use.kruse,supra,th at.
the kruse court further explained that the city temporary moratorium on mmd was permissible because the cua does not authorize the operation of a medical marijuana dispensary citations,nor does it prohibit local governments from regulating such dispensaries.rather,the cua expressly states that it does not supersede laws that protect individual and public safety nothing in this section shall be construed to supersede legislation prohibiting persons from engaging in conduct that endangers others,subd.b.the cua,by its terms,accordingly did not supersede the city moratorium on medical marijuana dispensaries,enacted as an urgency measure for the immediate preservation of the public health,safety,and welfare.kruse,supra,th at.
the kruse court also concluded the city zoning ordinance was not expressly preempted by the mmp.the kruse court noted,the operative provisions of the mmp,like those in the cua,provide limited criminal immunities under a narrow set of circumstances.kruse,supra,th at.furthermore,m edical marijuana dispensaries are not mentioned in the text or history of the mmp.the mmp does not address the licensing or location of medical marijuana dispensaries,nor does it prohibit local governments from regulating such dispensaries.rather,like the cua,the mmp expressly allows local regulation nothing in the text or history of the mmp precludes the city adoption of a temporary moratorium on issuing permits and licenses to medical marijuana dispensaries,or the city enforcement of licensing and zoning requirements applicable to such dispensaries.ibid.as in kruse,the cua and mmp do not expressly preempt riverside zoning ordinance regulating mmd,including banning them.
impliedly occupying the field of state law 
riverside zoning ordinance banning mmd is not impliedly preempted by state law since riverside ordinance does not enter an area of law fully occupied by the cua and mmp by legislative implication.kruse,supra,th.l ocal legislation enters an area that is fully occupied by general law when the legislature has impliedly done so in light of one of the following indicia of intent the subject matter has been so fully and completely covered by general law as to clearly indicate that it has become exclusively a matter of state concern the subject matter has been partially covered by general law couched in such terms as to indicate clearly that a paramount state concern will not tolerate further or additional local action or the subject matter has been partially covered by general law,and the subject is of such a nature that the adverse effect of a local ordinance on the transient citizens of the state outweighs the possible benefit to the locality citat
