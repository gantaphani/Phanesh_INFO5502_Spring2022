robert freeman,shine appellant,appeals the order of the district court directing him to pay in restitution to four individuals the purported victims as part of his sentence for obstructing federal bankruptcy proceedings.on appeal,appellant argues the district court erred because the purported victims to whom he was ordered to pay restitution are not victims of the offense to which he pled guilty.rather,he contends,the purported victims suffered losses when appellant caused them to take out significant loans for the benefit of his church conduct with which he was not charged or convicted.the government contends that the purported victims are entitled to restitution because appellant untruthfulness during his bankruptcy proceedings rendered them otherwise unable to be repaid for their loans recoup their ensuing losses.
we hold that,because the specific conduct that is the basis for appellant conviction did not cause the purported victims losses,they are not entitled to restitution.therefore,we reverse the judgment of the district court to the extent it orders restitution.given that the district court ordered restitution in lieu of a fine,we remand this matter so that it may consider whether or not to impose a fine.
on november,appellant was charged by a superseding indictment with two counts of obstruction of an official proceeding,two counts of making false statements in a bankruptcy proceeding,and one count of providing false records in a bankruptcy proceeding.on july,appellant pled guilty to one count of obstructing an official proceeding,pursuant to c.the plea agreement generally stated,this court may order appellant to make restitution pursuant to,and,but it did not evince an agreement between appellant and the government with regard to restitution.
the statement of facts addendum to the plea agreement the statement of facts provided the following appellant purported to be a minister,and between and he incorporated save the seed ministry,save the seed international church,and seed faith international church.he served as pastor and leader of all three.shortly after forming these entities,appellant began using church funds to accumulate substantial assets,including a million residence and luxury automobiles,in the names of members of the church.for example,appellant caused one church member to buy a bentley arnage and lease a maybach luxury automobile,valuing more than combined,and another to buy a million home,in which appellant and other church members lived.the government contends that for each of these purchases,the church members understood that although their names were on the loan documents,appellant the church would take care of the appropriate payments.
by october,appellant and his spouse owed debts in their names totaling more than million,including in back rent more than in lease payments on a jet airplane more than for payments on musical instruments and in loan payments on a bus.
appellant and his spouse filed for chapter bankruptcy on october.in addition to the information recounted above,the statement of facts also set forth the following ways in which appellant obstructed the bankruptcy proceedings 
he reported no real property in which he had any legal,equitable or future interest.
he reported no personal property of whatever kind,including property being held for the debtor by someone else.
he reported no property owned by another that the debtor held or controlled.
he reported that his occupation was consultant of a maintenance company.
he reported receiving no gross income from employment,trade,or profession,or from operation of a business in and,and only receiving for.he reported receiving no other income during the two years immediately preceding the filing of bankruptcy.
emphases supplied.
on december,appellant attended a creditors meeting.at that meeting,he testified that he and his spouse rented a house at a certain address,which was not true.he further testified,we lost our ministry,went out of business,but i n fact,freeman had not lost his ministry,which had not gone out of business.appellant also presented to the trustee seven documents purporting to be earning statements from a business called automatic data processing,but in fact,the statements were wholly fictitious.id.
on december,appellant chapter petition was converted to a chapter petition,and the bankruptcy court granted the chapter petition on march,resulting in the discharge of hundreds of thousands of dollars in debt.appellant was neither charged with nor convicted of any conspiracy or scheme to defraud the purported victims.
the presentence report psr,which was filed august,did not recommend restitution.to the contrary,it stated,the government has advised there is no restitution or forfeiture in this case.the psr also stated,there are no specific victims in this case.the defendant actions,however,jeopardized the integrity of the united states bankruptcy court.id.at.the government filed no objections to the psr.
nonetheless,on june,the government submitted to the district court a number of victim impact statements,including statements from the purported victims.about a month later,on july,the government filed its sentencing memorandum,requesting for the first time on the record that the court order appellant to pay restitution as part of his sentence,theorizing 
the church members who acted as nominees to purchase luxury automobiles and a mansion for the defendant suffered significant losses as a result of the defendant causing them to purchase expensive assets under the mistaken belief that the defendant,through the church,would pay for the assets.as a result of the defendant failure to pay for the assets purchased by the nominee victims,several of the nominee victims suffered harm to their credit scores,lost properties they had owned,had to file bankruptcy.
on the day of sentencing,july,the government filed a more specific request for restitution,for the first time mentioning the victims names in a public court filing the request stated,
the government requests that the defendant be ordered to pay the following amounts 
brenton and wendy cloud collectively,the clouds.and cloud owned their residence prior to serving as nominees for the defendant.as a result of serving as nominees for the defendant,however,and cloud incurred significant debts.ultimately,the clouds had to sell their residence at a short sale to pay the debts they had incurred on behalf of the defendant.represents the equity that the clouds lost as a result of having to sell their residence in order to repay the debts they incurred as nominees for the defendant.
cecil dixon.dixon was employed as an investigator with wmata washington metropolitan area transit authority prior to serving as a nominee for the defendant.as an investigator,dixon earned per year.after serving as a nominee for the defendant,dixon incurred significant debts that ultimately forced him to resign from his job.although dixon is currently employed,he now earns only per year.represents five years worth of the wages dixon lost as a result of being victimized by the defendant.
scott washel.washel owned his residence prior to serving as a nominee for the defendant.as a result of serving as a nominee for the defendant,however,washel incurred significant debts.ultimately,washel had to sell his residence to pay the debts he had incurred on behalf of the defendant.represents the equity that washel lost as a result of having to sell his residence in order to repay the debts he incurred as a nominee for the defendant 
id.at.the government did not cite a statutory basis for its restitution request.
at sentencing on july,the district court calculated appellant offense level at and criminal history category at his sentencing guideline range was,thus,months.the court sentenced appellant to months.notably,the court also ordered three years of supervised release and imposed total restitution of to the purported victims,in the exact amounts requested by the government.the court stated,i impose the mandatory and standard conditions of supervision,with the additional provision that appellant make payments to the clerk of this court for distribution to the victims in the monthly amount of at least a month.the district court did not,however,cite a statutory basis for the restitution award.the court also noted that no fine would be imposed because of the restitution award appellant timely appealed,challenging only the legality of the order of restitution.
we review a district court restitution order for abuse of discretion.see united states leftwich,cir.federal courts do not have the inherent authority to order restitution,but must rely on a statutory source to do so.united states davis,cir internal quotation marks and alteration omitted.indeed,a restitution order that exceeds the authority of the statutory source is no less illegal than a sentence of imprisonment that exceeds the statutory maximum.id.internal quotation marks omitted.discretion in ordering restitution is circumscribed by the procedural and substantive protections of the statute authorizing restitution.leftwich,at internal quotation marks omitted.
we must first address which statutory provision is implicated in the district court order of restitution,as the district court did not mention a statute in its sentencing colloquy or judgment order there are four possible statutory provisions which could be implicated the victim and witness protection act of the vwpa,the mandatory victims restitution act the mvra,id.and the provisions governing restitution imposed as a condition of probation,id.b,and supervised release,id.d.
after a close review of the sentencing transcript and judgment documents,it becomes clear that the district court imposed restitution as a condition of supervised release.at the sentencing hearing,the district court first announced that it would impose restitution in lieu of a fine when discussing the factors set forth in a.the court stated,
finally,i required to consider the need to provide restitution to any victims of the offense.in this case i think a restitution order is appropriate.
there is no question that loose money lending practices in this case helped this crime get committed,but the essence of the crime was to take unwitting people relying upon the notion of doing things for their church to go out and incur substantial debts when money was easy to get and provide those assets directly for the benefit principally of the defendant on trial before me 
accordingly,i am going to lieu of a fine,i going to enter an order of restitution to the victims identified in the government memorandum that was filed before the court.
the court went on to impose the sentence of months,but returned to the specifics of the restitution award when discussing the supervised release conditions.the court stated,
i going to impose a sentence of months of incarceration.
i will impose a period of supervised release of three years.
i impose the mandatory and standard conditions of supervision,with the additional provision that appellant make payments to the clerk of this court for distribution to the victims in the monthly amount of at least a month.that is within his ability to pay as reflected by the financial statement attached to which is part of the psr.
i will not impose any fine,in light of the large restitution obligation that i be imposing as i previously indicated.
furthermore,the judgment order specifies the restitution amount under the section heading supervised release additional conditions.the schedule of payments also provides,the restitution in the amount of shall be paid in monthly installments of at least per month over the period of year s to commence when the defendant is placed on supervised release.id.at emphasis supplied.reading the judgment order and the transcript together,it is clear restitution was imposed as a condition of supervised release.therefore,we must view the arguments of the parties through the lens of d 
ascertaining the meaning and context of d involves applying several.section d itself provides,the court may order,as a further condition of supervised release,any condition set forth as a discretionary condition of probation in section b d.the reference to b invokes the statute allowing the imposition of restitution as a condition of probation,which states,
the court may provide,as a further condition of a sentence of probation that the defendant 
make restitution to a victim of the offense under section but not subject to the limitation of section a or c a.
id.b emphasis supplied.in turn,provides,the court,in imposing a sentence on a defendant who has been found guilty of an offense shall order restitution in accordance with section the mvra,and may order restitution in accordance with section the vwpa.id.therefore,by operation of,an order of restitution imposed as a condition of supervised release shall be made in accordance with vwpa and mvra,but not subject to the limitation therein 
having discussed the applicable statutes,we now turn to the crux of this appeal whether the purported victims are victims of the offense for the purposes of b.
we first discuss whether the statute requires the purported victims to be victims only of the offense of conviction.as explained below,we conclude it does.
in,the supreme court held,the language and structure of the vwpa make plain congress intent to authorize an award of restitution only for the loss caused by the specific conduct that is the basis of the offense of conviction.hughey united states,emphasis supplied.this concept was later extended to cases such as this,in which the restitution was ordered as a condition of supervised release.see,united states batson,cir we now join our sister circuits in holding that an award of restitution ordered as a condition of supervised release can compensate only for the loss caused by the specific conduct that is the basis of the offense of conviction,so long as that offense does not involve an element of scheme,conspiracy or pattern of criminal activity.citing hughey,at emphasis supplied united states varrone,cir we now join our sister circuits in concluding that hughey construction of the vwpa is applicable to the restitution provision of the supervised release statute.we hold that restitution can be ordered as a condition of supervised release under d,b only to compensate for losses caused by the specific conduct that is the basis for the offense of conviction.united states frith,cir united states romines,cir per curiam gall united states,cir.
in the face of this overwhelming authority,the government essentially conceded at oral argument that in order to collect restitution,the purported victims must be victims of the offense for which appellant was convicted.see oral argument at,united states freeman,available at the government is only arguing that the basis of the restitution award was based on the offense of conviction,not on the relevant conduct.we nonetheless pause to consider this issue,as it is one we have not yet addressed in a published opinion 
persuaded by our sister circuits reasoning,we join them in holding that awards of restitution ordered as a condition of supervised release must compensate only for the loss caused by the specific conduct that is the basis of the offense of conviction.hughey,at.
the plain reading of the applicable statutory language compels this result.section b states that a district court may,as a condition of probation or supervised release,make restitution to a victim of the offense.b emphasis supplied.further,restitution as a condition of probation and supervised release is to be ordered under section.id.section refers to orders of restitution pursuant to the vwpa and the mvra,which provide,t he court,when sentencing a defendant convicted of an offense under listed titles or statutes may order restitution to any victim of such offense,id.a a,and when sentencing a defendant convicted of an offense described in subsection c,the court shall order that the defendant make restitution to the victim of the offense,id.a emphases supplied see also batson,at.
as batson explains,the natural reading of these provisions is that restitution is authorized for the offense of conviction and not for other related offenses of which the defendant was not convicted.batson,at.indeed,these statutes do not allow restitution for relevant conduct,a related offense,or a factually relevant offense,but rather,the offense,which can only be read to mean the offense of conviction.see hughey,at h ad congress intended to permit a victim to recover for losses stemming from all conduct attributable to the defendant,including conduct unrelated to the offense of conviction,congress would likely have chosen language other than the offense,which refers without question to the offense of conviction.to hold otherwise would be to improperly read the words of the offense out of the statute.see united states nordic,declining to adopt a construction that would violate the settled rule that a statute must,if possible,be construed in such fashion that every word has some operative effect.
in sum,regardless of whether restitution is ordered pursuant to the vwpa,the mvra,or as a condition of supervised release or probation,the alleged victims must be victims of the offense of conviction.see united states newsome,cir t he focus of the court in applying the mvra must be on the losses to the victim caused by the offense.emphasis supplied id.i tis the offense of conviction,not the relevant conduct,that must be the cause of losses attributable as restitutionary liability.united states blake,cir for a person to be considered a victim under the vwpa,the act that harms the individual must be conduct underlying an element of the offense of conviction emphasis supplied 
therefore,we must next address whether the purported victims losses were caused by the specific conduct that is the basis of the defendant offense of conviction.hughey,at.the government bears the burden of showing the causal connection and the amount of the loss.see e the burden of demonstrating the amount of the loss sustained by a victim as a result of the offense shall be on the attorney for the government.emphasis supplied see also united states kieffer,cir demonstrating that it is the government burden to prove alleged victims are victims of defendant criminal conduct.internal quotation marks omitted.we conclude that the government fell far short of meeting its burden in this matter.
this court has overturned restitution awards in which the government could not show the requisite causal connection between the specific conduct underlying the offense of conviction and the victims losses.for example,in united states broughton jones,cir,the defendant was indicted on four counts of perjury and one count of wire fraud in connection with a fraudulent brokerage scheme.see id.at.broughton jones pled guilty to one count of perjury,based upon false testimony she provided to a federal grand jury.at sentencing,the district court ordered her to pay restitution in the amount of,the amount of an advance payment she obtained from a client under false pretenses,which served as the basis for the wire fraud charge.see id.
pursuant to hughey,we held broughton jones did not have to pay restitution to her unwitting client because the restitution order did not compensate a victim of broughtonjones perjury for some loss caused by that offense.broughton jones,at emphasis supplied.after examining the specific conduct underlying the conviction of grand jury perjury,we held,a lthough there is a factual connection between broughton jones perjury and her alleged financing scheme,that connection is legally irrelevant.id.at.therefore,we vacated the entire sentence and remanded for resentencing.
in united states blake,cir,we again concluded that alleged victims losses were not caused by a defendant offense of conviction and vacated the restitution award to those individuals.in that case,blake pled guilty to using unauthorized access devices,stolen credit cards,and the district court ordered him to pay restitution to the owners of the credit cards.see id.at.again citing hughey,we overturned the award of restitution with regard to that stemmed from expenses related to lost property and document replacement,pocketbooks,wallets,and other items blake took when he stole the cards,reasoning that the district court was required to look at the specific conduct that is the basis of the conviction.id.at.we explained,
for a person to be considered a victim under,the act that harms the individual must be either conduct underlying an element of the offense of conviction,or an act taken in furtherance of a scheme,conspiracy,or pattern of criminal activity that is specifically included as an element of the offense of conviction.but,if the harm to the person does not result from conduct underlying an element of the offense of conviction,or conduct that is part of a pattern of criminal activity that is an element of the offense of conviction,the district court may not order the defendant to pay restitution to that individual.
id.at citations omitted.we then explained that the elements of the crime to which blake pled guilty using the stolen credit cards did not include the theft of the credit cards,and thus,the loss to the robbery victims was not caused by blake offense of conviction.id.at emphasis supplied.
more recently,we held that a homeowner could not collect restitution under the vwpa where the defendant broke into a home and stole a firearm,but pled guilty only to possession of a stolen firearm.see united states davis,cir.the homeowner requested restitution of for his insurance deductible for the unrecovered stolen firearm,and for damage caused when davis broke the window to enter the residence.see id.at.the district court ordered davis to pay in restitution to the homeowner,but we reversed.relying on blake,we explained,
like blake credit card theft,davis burglary and theft of the firearm represent necessary step s in the accomplishment of his objective,here,possession of a stolen firearm.but,like blake,the factual connection between these necessary step s and davis offense of conviction is legally irrelevant for the purpose of restitution.
id.at quoting blake,at.therefore,restitution was improper because the loss to the alleged victim was not caused by possession of a stolen firearm,the sole offense of conviction.id.internal quotation marks omitted.
in,the court was presented with an award of restitution imposed as a condition of supervised release under d.see united states oceanpro,cir.
oceanpro industries,oceanpro was a seafood wholesaler business operating in maryland and virginia.see oceanpro,at.oceanpro and two of its buyers were convicted of purchasing untagged and oversized striped bass and giving a false statement to law enforcement officers during the investigation related to the same.see id.the district court ordered oceanpro and two of its fish buyers to,inter alia,pay in restitution,jointly and severally,to maryland and virginia.see id.oceanpro restitution was made a condition of probation,and the fish buyers restitution was made a condition of supervised release.all three appealed the restitution order.see id.
this court recognized the analysis for ordering restitution as a condition of probation and supervised release is similar to that of the vwpa.see oceanpro,at.it noted that the vwpa defines victim as a person directly and proximately harmed as a result of the commission of an offense for which restitution may be ordered,but also recognized that b specifically indicates that the restitution to a victim of the offense for purposes of supervised release or probation is not subject to the limitation of the vwpa.id.at quoting a emphasis in original.this fact indicat es that the definition of victim in this context is even broader than the definition of victim under the vwpa.id.emphasis in original.
but the court did not say how much broader,nor did it need to.indeed,the court concluded that under the vwpa,the mvra,and as a condition of supervised,the district court was authorized to require the defendants to make restitution to the victims.oceanpro,at emphasis in original.it went on to declare virginia and maryland merely had to have interests that were harmed as a result of the defendants criminal conduct,and because the states had a legitimate and substantial interest in protecting the fish
