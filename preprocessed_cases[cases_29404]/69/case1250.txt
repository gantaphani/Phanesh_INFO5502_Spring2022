tim oey oey appeals a preliminary injunction preventing him from making any comments that could be construed as to disparage upon the freecycle network possible trademark and logo and requiring that he remove all postings from the i nternet and any other public forums that he has previously made that disparage the freecycle network possible trademark and logo.the freecycle network,oey,no.cv,order at may,emphasis added.we have jurisdiction under and,for the following reasons,vacate the injunction and remand.
the freecycle network tfn is a nonprofit arizona corporation dedicated to encouraging and coordinating the reusing,recycling,and gifting of goods.through its website,tfn coordinates the efforts of over freecycle groups worldwide.via the local groups webpages,individuals can post goods they no longer want.if another member wants the item offered,an exchange is arranged between the parties and the item thus avoids the landfill.
although tfn claims to have consistently used the marks freecycle and the freecycle network,and the freecycle network logo since may to refer to tfn,it also admits that it initially used the term freecycle and its various derivations,freecycling,freecycler to refer more generally to the act of recycling goods for free via the internet.in,based on the advice of oey,tfn decided to more actively police its use of the term freecycle and to formally pursue trademark protection for it,filing a trademark registration application on august.shortly thereafter,tfn instituted a strict usage policy,drafted by oey,preventing use of the term freecycle in any sense other than to refer to tfn or tfn services.on january,tfn proposed mark was published for opposition in the official gazette.an opposition was filed the next day and the mark currently remains unregistered 
a member of tfn since february and active in the corporation early development,oey initially supported tfn claim to the freecycle mark.experiencing a change of heart and convinced that the term should remain in the public domain,oey later urged tfn to abandon its efforts to secure the mark,conveying his feelings in an august,email to fellow tfn group moderators in the following weeks,oey made various statements on the internet that tfn lacked trademark rights in freecycle because it was a generic term,and he encouraged others to use the term in its generic sense and to write letters to the united states patent and trademark office pto opposing tfn pending registration.
not surprisingly,tfn took issue with oey views and,on september,asked him to sever ties with the company.in the ensuing months,oey continued to make statements on the internet challenging the validity of tfn claimed trademark in the term freecycle and encouraging others to use the term in its generic sense.
in april,tfn sued oey,seeking an injunction and damages,alleging that oey statements constituted contributory trademark infringement and trademark disparagement under section a of the lanham act,a,as well as injurious falsehood,defamation,and intentional interference with a business relationship under arizona law.the district court granted a preliminary injunction based solely on tfn a claims,apparently conflating tfn allegations of contributory trademark infringement and trademark disparagement.oey timely appealed,and,on july,we stayed the district court injunction pending the outcome of this appeal.
we review a district court grant of a preliminary injunction for an abuse of discretion.perfect,cir.a district court abuses its discretion in granting an injunction if its decision is based on either an erroneous legal standard or clearly erroneous factual findings.clear channel outdoor,city of los angeles,cir internal quotations and citations omitted.a district court decision is based on an erroneous legal standard if the court did not employ the appropriate legal standards that govern the issuance of a preliminary injunction or in applying the appropriate standards,the court misapprehended the law with respect to the underlying issues in the litigation.id.
we have established two sets of criteria for evaluating a request for a preliminary injunction.earth island inst.united states forest,cir.
under the traditional criteria,a plaintiff must show a strong likelihood of success on the merits,the possibility of irreparable injury to plaintiff if preliminary relief is not granted,a balance of hardships favoring the plaintiff,and advancement of the public interest in certain cases.alternatively,a court may grant the injunction if the plaintiff demonstrates either a combination of probable success on the merits and the possibility of irreparable injury or that serious questions are raised and the balance of hardships tips sharply in his favor.
id.at internal quotations and citations omitted.thus,under either criteria,where a plaintiff fails to even raise serious questions about its likelihood of success,an injunction may not issue.
although the district court correctly identified the traditional criteria for granting a preliminary injunction,it issued the injunction based solely on tfn lanham act claims of trademark infringement and trademark disparagement.as we detail below,the district court likelihood of success analysis did not adequately analyze the necessary elements for trademark infringement,see clear channel outdoor,at,and the district court misapprehended the law insofar as the lanham act contains no cause of action for trademark disparagement.
a trademark infringement 
the district court order characterized tfn a claims as allegations of trademark infringement.to be liable for trademark infringement under a,a person must use in commerce any word,false designation of origin,false or misleading description,or representation of fact,which is likely to cause confusion or misrepresents the characteristics of his or another person goods or services.a.the core element of trademark infringement is the likelihood of confusion,whether the similarity of the marks is likely to confuse customers about the source of the products.abercrombie fitch moose creek,cir internal quotations omitted.we have identified eight nonexclusive factors relevant to evaluating likelihood of confusion.amf sleekcraft boats,cir in its order,the district court did not mention,let alone analyze,these critical factors in evaluating tfn likelihood of success on its trademark infringement claim.rather,the district court simply concluded that tfn appears to have a legitimate mark oey at one time acknowledged tfn mark and sought to protect it and after his separation from the organization,oey began to publicly encourage the disparagement of the freecycle trademark.contrary to the district court conclusion,these if true simply do not demonstrate that tfn has a likelihood of success on its a infringement claim.
as a threshold matter,oey actions likely did not constitute a use in commerce,a,as the record in this case does not indicate they were made to promote any competing service or reap any commercial benefit whatsoever.see defining use in commerce mattel,mca records,cir trademark law use in commerce refers to a use of a famous and distinctive mark to sell goods or services other than those produced or authorized by the mark owner.rather,based on his view that the term was generic,oey simply expressed an opinion that tfn lacked trademark rights in the term freecycle and encouraged individuals to continue to use the term in its generic sense and to inform the pto of their opinions 
furthermore,even if oey statements could somehow be construed to be a use in commerce,such use was not likely to cause confusion,mistake,or deceive anyone as to the connection of oey services or any other with tfn.id.a a.although the district court did not examine the relevant sleekcraft factors,our review of the record identifies no potential likelihood of confusion resulting from oey activities.oey simply did not use tfn claimed mark or a similar mark in any manner likely to confuse the relevant public his statements neither mention any competing service or product,nor claim any affiliation with tfn.
finally,oey statements also do not satisfy the requiremen
