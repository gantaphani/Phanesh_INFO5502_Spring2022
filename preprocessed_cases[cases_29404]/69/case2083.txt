plaintiffs pedro marron and maria marron,individually and as successors in interest of lidia marron together the marrons,filed this petition for writ of mandate challenging the trial court order granting the motion of defendant regents of the university of california ruc for summary adjudication of the marrons dependent adult abuse cause of action against it.the marrons contend the trial court erred by concluding government code section,which exempts public entities from liability for punitive or exemplary damages,precludes their cause of action against ruc for enhanced remedies under welfare and institutions code section 
factual and procedural background 
on august,lidia marron,then years old,entered ucsd medical center the hospital for a liver biopsy.the hospital is owned and operated by ruc,which is a division of the state of california.complications arose during the procedure when the biopsy needle perforated lidia middle colic vein,causing damage to her abdominal viscera and requiring emergency surgery.following surgery,lidia was admitted to the hospital intensive care unit.during her subsequent stay at the hospital,she suffered complications,including fungus infections in her blood and lungs,peritonitis,and pelvic abscesses,sepsis syndrome,hypotension,fevers,abdominal pain and hemorrhaging.
on october she was discharged from the hospital.on october she returned to the hospital because of a spiking fever.on november she was discharged from the hospital,but returned within hours because of fevers,chills and severe pain.a ct scan showed an abscess.she became progressively septic and was diagnosed with enterocutaneous fistula.
on december lidia died.
the marrons,as lidia parents and successors in interest,filed a complaint against defendants ruc and tarek hassanein,alleging causes of action for wrongful death and section dependent adult abuse.the dependent adult abuse cause of action alleges the defendants failed to exercise the requisite degree of care but rather acted with recklessness in the failure to appropriately and adequately care for,monitor,and treat lidia marron declining health condition from august through december.it further alleges the defendants failed to recognize and treat obvious signs of uncontrolled hemorrhage,failed to protect lidia from health and safety hazards,failed to assist in personal hygiene,failed to provide an adequate environment for the level of care that was needed,ignoring obvious signs of stress and disease,causing her to suffer protracted pain,discomfort,mental suffering,indignity and humiliation up to the time of her death.the complaint seeks damages for lidia pain and suffering and an award of reasonable attorney fees and costs pursuant to section.
ruc filed a motion for summary adjudication of the dependent adult abuse cause of action,asserting,inter alia,that government code section provided it with immunity against section damages and attorney fees and costs the marrons opposed the motion,arguing that because section does not provide for punitive damages,government code section does not bar an award of section enhanced remedies against ruc.
the trial court granted ruc motion for summary adjudication,stating 
t he dependent adult abuse cause of action impermissibly seeks punitive damages against a public entity in violation of government code section t he pain and suffering lidia suffered was personal to her and ceased to be an element of compensation upon her death.as a result,the legislature decision in section to abrogate code of civil procedure section as a result of a caregiver reckless neglect is punitive in nature,as it is intended to award damages in excess of just compensation.the same logic applies the recovery of attorney fees,as this is an award in excess of just compensation for lidia injuries.
during oral argument on the motion,the trial court further stated to me section enhanced remedies constitute a penalty.they are an amount of money in addition to compensation and they penalize someone for reckless conduct 
the marrons filed this petition for writ of mandate,challenging the trial court order granting the motion for summary adjudication.ruc filed a response,arguing the trial court correctly concluded it was immune under government code section from liability for section enhanced remedies.we issued an order to show cause,stayed trial of this matter and heard oral argument.

iconsideration of the petition 
the marrons contend we should consider their petition for writ of mandate because they have an inadequate remedy at law and will suffer irreparable injury if their petition is not granted.they argue the trial court order has the effect of barring a substantial portion of their case on the merits and a second trial would be a waste of judicial and litigant resources.furthermore,they assert the instant issue is one of law that is of first impression and of public interest.

elder abuse and dependent adult civil protection act 
the elder abuse and dependent adult civil protection act et,hereinafter the act provides for both criminal and private civil enforcement of elder and dependent adult abuse laws.delaney baker cal th,d.o ne of the major objectives of the act was the protection of residents of nursing homes and other health care facilities.id.at,d.section defines abuse of an elder or dependent adult as 
a physical abuse,neglect,financial abuse,abandonment,isolation,abduction,or other treatment with resulting physical harm or pain or mental suffering or 
b the deprivation by a care custodian of goods or services that are necessary to avoid physical harm or mental suffering.
the act definition of neglect includes the negligent failure of any person having the care or custody of an elder or a dependent adult to exercise that degree of care that a reasonable person in a like position would exercise,subd.a.the act definition of care custodian includes members of the support staff of health facilities as defined in health and safety code sections,and,subd.a.the act definition of a dependent adult includes any person between the ages of and years who is admitted as an inpatient to a health facility,as defined in sections,and of the health and safety code,subd.b.
in the act was amended to allow in certain circumstances awards of heightened or enhanced remedies that would not otherwise be recoverable in an ordinary private,civil action for elder or dependent adult abuse.ara living,superior court th,d delaney baker,supra,cal th at,d.those enhanced remedies include awards of reasonable attorney fees and costs and limited damages for a decedent pain and suffering.ara living,supra,at,d delaney,supra,at,d.section provides 
where it is proven by clear and convincing evidence that a defendant is liable for physical abuse as defined in section,neglect as defined in section,or financial abuse as defined in section,and that the defendant has been guilty of recklessness,oppression,fraud,or malice in the commission of this abuse,in addition to all other remedies otherwise provided by law a the court shall award to the plaintiff reasonable attorney fees and costs.the term costs includes,but is not limited to,reasonable fees for the services of a conservator,if any,devoted to the litigation of a claim brought under this article.b the limitations imposed by section of the code of civil procedure on the damages recoverable shall not apply.however,the damages recovered shall not exceed the damages permitted to be recovered pursuant to subdivision b of section of the civil code.c the standards set forth in subdivision b of section of the civil code regarding the imposition of punitive damages on an employer based upon the acts of an employee shall be satisfied before any damages or attorney fees permitted under this section may be imposed against an employer.italics added.
interpretation of section and government code section 
the marrons contend the trial court erred by concluding as a matter of law that ruc could not be found liable for section enhanced remedies because they are precluded by government code section prohibition of awards of exemplary and punitive damages against public entities.as the parties note,this issue is a question of law that appears to be one of first impression in the california courts.
government code section provides notwithstanding any other provision of law,a public entity is not liable for damages awarded under section of the civil code or other damages imposed primarily for the sake of example and by way of punishing the defendant.italics added.government code section in context means that a plaintiff who alleges injury caused by a public entity may be entitled to actual damages for that injury,but not punitive damages.citations.kizer county of san mateo cal d.punitive damages and compensatory damages serve different purposes.state farm mut.auto.ins.campbell,d cooper industries,leatherman tool group,d.compensatory damages are intended to redress the concrete loss that the plaintiff has suffered by reason of the defendant wrongful conduct.citations.cooper industries,supra,at,italics added.in contrast,punitive damages operate as private fines intended to punish the defendant and to deter future wrongdoing.ibid.in determining compensatory damages,a jury assessment of the extent of a plaintiff injury is essentially a factual determination,whereas its imposition of punitive damages is an expression of its moral condemnation.citations,italics added.punitive damages are not compensation for loss or injury.gertz robert welch,d piscitelli friedenberg th,d nakamura superior court th,d punitive damages do not compensate for loss.punitive damages must bear a reasonable relationship and be proportionate to the actual harm suffered by the plaintiff,compensatory damages.state farm,supra,at.at bmw of north america,gore,d.therefore,section of the government code,in referring to damages imposed primarily for the sake of example and by way of punishing the defendant contemplates punitive damages that are designed to punish the defendant rather than to compensate the plaintiff.punitive damages are by definition in addition to actual damages and beyond the equivalent of harm done.citations.state of corrections workmen.bd.cal d,italics added.
compensatory damages are described in civil code section for the breach of an obligation not arising from contract,the measure of damages,except where otherwise expressly provided by this code,is the amount that will compensate for all the detriment proximately caused thereby,whether it could have been anticipated or not.italics added.those damages compensate the victim for injury suffered.citation.applied equipment litton saudi arabia cal th,d,italics added.compensatory damages generally include damages for pain and suffering caused by a defendant breach of a noncontractual obligation,capelouto kaiser foundation hospitals cal d,pain and suffering is a genuine detriment that requires compensation.t he unitary concept of pain and suffering has served as a convenient label under which a plaintiff may recover not only for physical pain but also for fright,nervousness,grief,anxiety,worry,mortification,shock,humiliation,indignity,embarrassment,apprehension,terror or ordeal.citations.capelouto,supra,at.the term pain and suffering reflects a consequence of a victim personal and physical injury and a subjective loss for which money could compensate the victim.nakamura superior court,supra,th at,d.punitive damages are dissimilar to pain and suffering and other compensatory damages.id.at,d.
although a victim ordinarily may be entitled to compensation for pain and suffering sustained from a defendant breach of a noncontractual obligation,that compensation generally can not be recovered after the victim death because of code of civil procedure section,which provides 
in an action or proceeding by a decedent personal representative or successor in interest on the decedent cause of action,the damages recoverable are limited to the loss or damage that the decedent sustained or incurred before death,including any penalties or punitive or exemplary damages that the decedent would have been entitled to recover had the decedent lived,and do not include damages for pain,suffering,or disfigurement.italics added.
that statute distinguishes between a decedent pain and suffering damages and a decedent punitive or exemplary damages.because a decedent representative or successor in interest may pursue a cause of action for recovery of punitive damages to which the decedent would have been entitled had the decedent lived,but may not recover damages for pain and suffering the decedent sustained before his or her death,it appears the decedent pain and suffering damages are distinct and different from punitive or exemplary damages.
we conclude the enhanced remedies available under section are not punitive or exemplary damages under government code section,and the trial court erred by granting ruc motion for summary adjudication on the marrons section cause of action.had lidia lived despite the alleged dependent adult abuse,she would have been entitled to recover any and all pain and suffering damages in a section action against ruc ara living,superior court,supra,th at,d.however,lidia died before she could file an action and obtain an award for the pain and suffering she allegedly sustained.although code of civil procedure section ordinarily would bar lidia successors in interest from recovering her pain and suffering damages,section expressly allows recovery of those pain and suffering damages subject to civil code section,subdivision b limitation.ara living centers,supra,at,d.if the marrons prove by clear and convincing evidence that ruc committed reckless neglect in caring for lidia,section allows them to recover all remedies provided by law,including reasonable attorney fees and costs and lidia pain and suffering damages subject to civil code section,subdivision b limitation.section expressly provides that t he limitations imposed by section of the code of civil procedure on the damages recoverable shall not apply,subd.b.
ruc argues,and the trial court concluded,that section express exception to code of civil procedure section general preclusion of awards of a decedent pain and suffering damages equates to an award of punitive or exemplary damages under government code section.however,considering the language of those statutes and the general statutory and common law regarding compensatory and punitive damages,we conclude section enhanced remedies are not punitive or exemplary in nature or damages imposed primarily for the sake of example and by way of punishing the defendant under government code section an award of lidia pain and suffering damages that code of civil procedure section otherwise would preclude is based on,and measured by,lidia actual loss or injury.lidia alleged pain and suffering damages are part of the compensation for all the detriment proximately caused by ruc alleged reckless neglect.an award of lidia alleged pain and suffering damages would provide the marrons with compensation for the injury lidia sustained.applied equipment litton saudi arabia,supra,cal th at,d.compensatory damages include damages for pain and suffering caused by a defendant breach of a noncontractual obligation,capelouto kaiser foundation hospitals,supra,cal d at,pain and suffering is a genuine detriment that requires compensation.in contrast,punitive damages are not compensation for loss or injury.gertz robert welch,supra,at.piscitelli friedenberg,supra,th at,d nakamura superior court,supra,th at,d punitive damages do not compensate for loss.matter of of denton,p ain and suffering damages are compensatory,not punitive.furthermore,p unitive damages are by definition in addition to actual damages and beyond the equivalent of harm done.citations.state of corrections workmen,supra,cal d at,italics added.because lidia pain and suffering damages are based on the harm done by ruc alleged reckless neglect,they are not beyond the equivalent of harm done and therefore can not be considered punitive damages people ex rel.younger superior court cal d,civil penalties imposed to more fully compensate the state are not punitive damages under government code section if they are not beyond an amount equivalent to the harm done levine weis th,d because award of statutory double backpay under government code section serves to more fully compensate the employee for the incalculable risk he takes when he threatens to disclose or discloses his employer false claim,it is not punitive damages under government code section.
punitive damages are dissimilar to pain and suffering and other compensatory damages.nakamura superior court,supra,th at,d.furthermore,under code of civil procedure section,a decedent representative or successor in interest may pursue a cause of action for recovery of punitive damages to which the decedent would have been entitled had the decedent lived,but may not recover damages for pain and suffering the decedent suffered before his or her death.the decedent pain and suffering damages are therefore distinct from punitive or exemplary damages.under government code section,a plaintiff who alleges injury caused by a public entity may be entitled to actual damages for that injury,but not punitive damages.citations.kizer county of san mateo,supra,cal d at,italics added.
ruc argues that section,subdivision c incorporation of the standard for holding employers liable for punitive damages under civil code section,subdivision b shows section enhanced remedies were intended to be,and are,punitive damages.section,subdivision c provides the standards set forth in subdivision b of section of the civil code regarding the imposition of punitive damages on an employer based upon the acts of an employee shall be satisfied before any damages or attorney fees permitted under this section may be imposed against an employer.civil code section,subdivision b provides an employer shall not be liable for damages pursuant to subdivision a,where,by clear and convincing evidence,plaintiff shows defendant breach of a noncontractual obligation is done with oppression,fraud,or malice,based upon acts of an employee of the employer,unless the employer had advance knowledge of the unfitness of the employee and employed him or her with a conscious disregard of the rights or the safety of others or authorized or ratified the wrongful conduct for which the damages are awarded or was personally guilty of oppression,fraud,or malice.with respect to a corporate employer,the advance knowledge and conscious disregard,authorization,ratification or act of oppression,fraud,or malice must be on the part of an officer,director,or managing agent of the corporation.we are not persuaded by ruc argument.section,subdivision c incorporation of civil code section,subdivision b standard for holding an employer liable for punitive damages based on an employee outrageous conduct does not show section enhanced remedies are intended to be punitive damages.rather,incorporation of that standard is merely a simple statutory means for setting forth what actions of an employer suffice for holding that employer liable for an employee reckless neglect or other egregious conduct under section.section,subdivision c incorporates a standard of conduct rather than the remedy or damages to be awarded if that conduct is found to have occurred.because section and civil code section provide for different remedies,their use of a common standard for initially determining an employer liability is irrelevant in determining whether section enhanced remedies are to be considered punitive damages.furthermore,ruc argument does not apply to section cases that do not involve employers.the characterization of section enhanced remedies presumably should not change based on whether the defendant is an individual or an employer of that individual.
we also conclude that an award of reasonable attorney fees and costs under section can not be considered punitive or exemplary damages under government code section.section authorization of awards of attorney fees and costs was intended to act as an incentive for attorneys to accept elder or dependent adult abuse cases that involve recklessness or more egregious conduct.in enacting the amendments to the act that included section,t he legislature pointed out that few civil actions were being brought in connection with elder or dependent adult abuse due in part to lack of incentives.it then provided some incentives,reasonable attorney fees and costs and limited pain and suffering damages.ara living,superior court,supra,th at,d.section,subdivision h states the legislature further finds and declares that infirm elderly persons and dependent adults are a disadvantaged class,that cases of abuse of these persons are seldom prosecuted as criminal matters,and few civil cases are brought in connection with this abuse due to problems of proof,court delays,and the lack of incentives to prosecute these suits.section,subdivision j states it is the further intent of the legislature in adding section et to this chapter to enable interested persons to engage attorneys to take up the cause of abused elderly persons and dependent adults.delaney noted 
as was stated in the senate rules committee analysis of senate bill,in practice,the death of the victim and the difficulty in finding an attorney to handle an abuse case where attorneys fees may not be awarded impedes many victims from suing successfully.this bill would address the problem by authorizing the court to award attorney fees in specified cases and by allowing pain and suffering damages to be awarded when a verdict of intentional and reckless abuse was handed down after the abused elder dies.rules,analysis of bill,reg.sess.as amended may.delaney baker,supra,cal th at,d.
