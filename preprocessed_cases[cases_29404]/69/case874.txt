vanesse fort sued keller trucking,for the wrongful death of her husband,eric fort.before trial,the plaintiff received million under the terms of a loan receipt agreement with ryder integrated logistics.at trial the jury awarded vanesse fort approximately million.keller asked the district court to setoff the jury award by the million.the district court rejected that request and on appeal,keller asserts that setoff is warranted because the million advanced is not a loan.specifically,keller argues that fort and ryder never intended full repayment of the loan,and in any case the jury award was too small to allow for full repayment.because we find that the parties intended full repayment such that the money advanced was truly a loan,and because money received under loan receipt agreements is generally not subject to setoff,we affirm the district court ruling.keller also raises claims relating to the admissibility of the loan receipt agreement,the sufficiency of the evidence,and improper jury instructions,which we also reject.
background 
in,keller trucking,was approved by toyota motor corporation to haul parts to toyota kentucky plant as a subcontractor for ryder integrated logistics.keller earned approximately per mile and retained control over the trucks used to haul parts.additionally,ryder had an agreement with trucking,under which trucking provided drivers and leased three tractors to ryder,and in exchange received about cents per mile to haul toyota parts to the same kentucky plant as keller.
that same year,trucking entered into an assets purchase agreement with keller,acquiring keller stock and trucks,as well as keller permits,licenses,and certificates necessary for the trucks operation.trucking also obtained keller interstate common carrier icc authority and canadian counterpart,in addition to keller subcontractor agreement with ryder.following this transaction,trucking operated its trucks using keller placards and icc authority,and was legally entitled to use the name trucking keller trucking.
on march,eric fort died after his car was hit by a truck driven by jacob nance.although nance had been assigned to a truck with keller placards and icc authority,it broke down the day before the accident,and nance used a truck with ryder placards and icc authority.ryder asserts that use of this truck was unauthorized.
vanesse fort eric fort widow sued ryder,nance,trucking,and keller for wrongful death.fort then entered into a loan receipt agreement with ryder releasing all defendants except keller.under this agreement,fort received million,but promised to pay ryder of the money recovered from keller or keller insurer up to a maximum of million.
fort suit against keller went to trial.the only issues in dispute were whether keller was legally responsible for nance negligence and if so,how much money the plaintiff should receive.a ryder representative testified that even though nance used a truck owned by ryder,keller was responsible for the trip as ryder subcontractor.keller argued that it was not in business at the time of the accident,and was therefore not nance employer.also,keller objected to the court refusal to admit evidence of the loan receipt agreement to establish that brad scroggins,a ryder employee,was biased against keller.at the close of evidence,the court instructed the jury regarding the difference between keller and trucking liability.the jury found keller liable for fort death and awarded fort estate slightly over million.
following the jury verdict,keller filed a motion for,arguing that as a matter of law the jury award should be offset by the amount that fort retained from the loan receipt agreement.the district court determined that keller was not entitled to a setoff and denied the motion.keller appeals this ruling,and also contests the district court refusal to introduce the loan receipt agreement into evidence,the sufficiency of the evidence establishing that keller was in business at the time of the accident,and the jury instructions regarding the laws governing separate corporate entities.
ii.analysis 
setoff from the loan receipt agreement 
indiana courts encourage the use of loan receipt agreements,see,scott county vaughn,and define such agreements as follows 
a loan receipt agreement,in its simplest form,provides that one with potential liability to a claimant will advance funds in the form of a loan to the claimant in order that the claim may be prosecuted against another who is also potentially liable for the claim.in return for the funds advanced,the claimant agrees that he will not sue or will not seek to enforce a judgment against the lender and will repay the loan according to some formula based upon the claimant recovery against the other party.such an agreement,then,serves to limit the liability of one against whom a claim might be pressed and,at the same time,gives the claimant an immediate bird in hand instead of forcing him to await but possible recovery following protracted litigation.

it is against this backdrop that keller contests the district court denial of its motion for setoff.specifically,keller points out that under the terms of the agreement at issue,fort received million from ryder,but had to pay back of the amount of any jury award.the jury award was slightly over million thus requiring fort to repay ryder approximately.keller reasons that the approximately million left over subtracted from million should be used to offset keller million jury award to fort thus reducing keller payment to zero because this amount will never have to be repaid.we are unpersuaded by this argument.
despite keller contentions to the contrary,under indiana law,whether setoff is warranted generally does not depend on whether all funds advanced under the terms of the loan receipt agreement were repaid.rather,a setoff entitlement hinges on whether the contract at issue can properly be construed as a loan receipt agreement in the first place if so,no setoff is allowed.see american transp,at sanders cole mun,if the agreement is found to be a loan receipt agreement,the funds received by the plaintiff are not to be credited against a subsequent judgment.barker cole,
we thus examine whether fort and ryder entered into a loan receipt agreement,look ing to the express terms of the agreement to determine the intent of the parties as to the true nature of the agreement.barker,at see also sanders,at in determining the correct characterization of the agreement,the intention of the parties to the transaction is relevant.however,once the type of transaction is identified,the effect is established by law.citation omitted.the agreement states in part that 
ryder will advance to the estate million all of which will be repayable without interest only in the event and to the extent that the estate recovers from keller or its insurer by trial or settlement and in that event and a third percent of all monies received by the estate shall be repaid to ryder until the full amount is repaid.
this type of contract,which contemplates full repayment,is clearly a loan receipt agreement.the fact that repayment is based on a formula of the jury award rather than repayment does not make it any less so.burkett,at noting that loan receipt agreements involve repay ment of the loan according to some formula based upon the claimant recovery against the other party emphasis added see,bymaster bankers life ins,contract construed as loan receipt agreement even though repayment of a loan was required only if plaintiff recovered more than from other tortfeasors barker,at contract construed as loan receipt agreement even though repayment of a loan was required only if plaintiff recovered more than from another tortfeasor.thus,keller is not entitled to setoff.
keller contends that notwithstanding the agreement express terms,neither ryder nor fort ever intended full repayment because fort lawyer only asked for million at trial,and fort would have had to recover million to repay ryder in full.we are unconvinced.the record reveals that fort initially sought million in damages,and keller has not shown that thi
