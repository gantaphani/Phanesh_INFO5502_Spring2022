civil code section provides all contracts which have for their object,directly or indirectly,to exempt anyone from responsibility for his own fraud or violation of law,whether willful or negligent,are against the policy of the law.
in this case,we are called upon to resolve whether section invalidates a contractual clause that prohibits any recovery of damages but not equitable relief for any violation of statutory or regulatory law not made part of the parties contractual obligations.based on the clear intent of section,as expressed in its plain language,and consistent with the case law,we find that section prevents a party from imposing such a contractual prohibition against the recovery of damages for any future violations of statutory or regulatory law.
plaintiff health net of california,health net contracted with the california department of health services dhs to be one of two health plans providing managed care services to patients in tulare county.but in violation of welfare and institutions code section,subdivision j,and its implementing regulations,dhs assigned all default enrollees that is,those who failed to select a the competing health plan,blue cross of california blue cross over a period.although the trial court issued a writ of mandate directing dhs to redistribute future default enrollees,it denied damages for the violation based on a provision in health net contract added at dhs insistence which prohibited the recovery of damages as a remedy for any violation of law not expressly incorporated into the contract.health net appeals.
while courts have often observed that the application of section is not as broad as its language suggests,they have nonetheless held that under the statute,a party can not contract away liability for his fraudulent or intentional acts or for his negligent violations of statutory law.gardner downtown porsche audi d.we see no reason why this settled interpretation of section should not be extended to cover regulatory violations in light of the fact that regulations,by definition,merely implement,interpret,or make specific statutory law,and given that the language of section is not limited to statutory violations but more broadly refers to any violation of law.it also makes no difference that the contractual clause here bars only the recovery of damages,and not equitable relief,because section can apply to a limitation on liability klein asgrow seed d.klein,at least where the limitation rises to the level of an exempt ion from responsibility for a violation of law in the words of section.an unqualified prohibition against the recovery of damages in the context of a commercial transaction certainly qualifies as such an exemption.
since the exculpatory provision imposed by dhs on health net is unenforceable as against public policy under section,we shall reverse and remand for further proceedings.
factual and procedural background 
i.the model 
the program,which is california version of the federal medicaid program,offers managed care,using,among other things,what is known as the model.under the model,in regions designated by dhs,health services are provided to beneficiaries through no more than two prepaid health plans a commercial plan and a local initiative,tit,subd.a,subd.ll.
the commercial plan is a prepaid health plan,which dhs awards through a competitive bidding process,tit,subd.b,subd.g.the local initiative is likewise a prepaid health plan,but it is organized or designated by a county government,to which dhs awards a contract,subd.b,subd.v.
dhs designated tulare county as one of the regions subject to the model.health net operates the commercial plan in tulare county pursuant to an agreement with dhs called the standard agreement.blue cross was designated to operate the local initiative.
ii.the contractual provision at issue 
in,dhs began proposing amendments to the standard agreement.the parties eventually agreed to seven amendments.although health net strenuously objected to the last ultimately and reluctantly signed the amendment in because dhs insisted that health net sign as a condition of receiving a legally required retroactive rate increase.
amendment revised section of the standard agreement hereinafter section the contractual clause at issue here.
section,headed interpretation of contract,provides in its revised form as follows if it is necessary to interpret this contract,all applicable laws may be used as aids in interpreting the contract.however,the parties agree that any such applicable laws shall not be interpreted to create contractual obligations upon dhs or contractor health net,unless such applicable laws are expressly incorporated into this contract in some section other than this section,interpretation of contract.except for section,sanctions and section,liquidated damages provision,the parties agree that any remedies for dhs s or contractor with laws not expressly incorporated into this contract,or any covenants implied to be part of this contract,shall not include money damages,but may include equitable remedies such as injunctive relief or specific performance.in the event any provision of this contract is held invalid by a court,the remainder of this contract shall not be affected.this contract is the product of mutual negotiation,and if any ambiguities should arise in the interpretation of this contract,both parties shall be deemed authors of this contract.italics added.
amendment also deleted former section of the standard agreement the pertinent effect of this deletion was to eliminate any reference in the agreement to the sections of the welfare and institutions code regarding the model welf,and the related regulations promulgated by dhs,tit,et,which the trial court found dhs had violated here.and as a result,section operated to prohibit the recovery of damages for dhs violation of these statutory and regulatory provisions because that section bars the recovery of damages for the failure to comply with any laws not expressly incorporated into the contract.
iii.background underlying health net suit 
health net began operating in january in tulare county.blue cross started a month or two later.
under the model,eligible individuals had days to choose in writing among the available prepaid health plans in the region.welf,subd.c.a person who failed to make the choice was assigned to,and enrolled in,an appropriate prepaid health plan,subd.e.dhs informed health net and blue cross that these default enrollees were to be assigned to health net until blue cross began operations,and then to blue cross until a minimum enrollment was reached,which dhs set at.
however,in making those assignments,welfare and institutions code section,subdivision j,required that t o the extent possible,the arrangements for carrying out default enrollments shall provide for the equitable distribution of beneficiaries among participating prepaid health plans,or managed care plans.
and while that section did not define equitable distribution,dhs adopted a regulation that required default enrollees to be assigned to the local initiative until it reached its enrollment minimum,and thereafter required assignments to be evenly distributed between the local initiative and the commercial plan until the latter reached its enrollment maximum,at which time further assignments to the commercial plan would be discontinued,tit,subd.g.the regulations also provided for the calculation of the enrollment minimum for the local initiative,subd.b and the enrollment maximum for the commercial plan,subd.b.dhs set the maximum enrollment for health net at.
iv.health net suit 
in may,health net filed an action against dhs for injunctive relief,breach of contract,and mandamus.health net alleged that as a result of dhs enrollment practices,health net had not received any default enrollees in tulare county in april and may,whereas blue cross had received,in violation of welfare and institutions code section,subdivision j.health net sought and obtained a temporary restraining order prohibiting dhs from assigning any further default enrollees to blue cross.
after briefing and a hearing,the trial court found that dhs had applied an invalid enrollment minimum of for the local initiative,which calculation was based on a article in a medical journal,rather than the formula prescribed by the regulations.the trial court therefore issued a writ of mandamus compelling dhs to recalculate the local initiative minimum enrollment and the commercial plan maximum enrollment in accordance with the applicable regulations.the writ also required that if the recalculated enrollment minimum for the local initiative indicated that dhs had assigned an excessive number of default enrollees to blue cross,then dhs should assign all presently unassigned default enrollees and all future default enrollees to the health net cp commercial plan until such time as the distribution of default enrollees between the li local initiative and the cp matches the distribution which would have existed had dhs applied the correct li enrollment minimum in the first place.the court also issued a permanent injunction to a similar effect.
but the trial court did not grant any damages sustained from the loss of enrollees prior to the redistribution.indeed,the trial court denied,without further explanation,health net request for an evidentiary hearing as to damages pursuant to code of civil procedure section still,the court specifically noted that its decision did not pertain to health net cause of action for breach of contract against dhs.
in compliance with the writ,dhs recalculated the minimum enrollment level for the local initiative and determined it to be.dhs then informed health net that blue cross had received default enrollments after attaining this level and that therefore health net was entitled to of the defaults,or,tit,subd.g.
thereafter,health net and dhs filed for summary adjudication and summary judgment,respectively,addressing health net right to damages.health net sought summary adjudication against dhs for its right to damages under code of civil procedure section its claim for breach of contract based on dhs statutory and regulatory violations concerning the allocation of default enrollees between health net and blue cross and its claim for breach of contract based on dhs violation of the applicable regulation regarding default assignments when health net was operating but blue cross was not.in its reply brief,health net limited its summary adjudication motion to its entitlement to damages and a finding that section of the agreement was unenforceable pursuant to section and otherwise.
dhs,in turn,moved for summary judgment,asserting that section was valid and precluded an award of damages on any of health net claims.
observing that the parties had made for summary disposition of the issue of health net entitlement to damages,the trial court denied health net motion and granted dhs.the court took as undisputed,for purposes of the motions,health net claims of financial losses resulting from dhs violation of its regulations concerning the assignment of default enrollees,the lost profits that would have been generated from the default enrollees had dhs timely assigned them to health net.and the court reasoned that health net may maintain a claim for damages unless such a claim is excluded by contract.but the court then found that section is enforceable as written and thus bars health net claims for monetary damages.accordingly,the court ruled against health net and in favor of dhs 
judgment was entered in favor of dhs,from which health net appeals.
discussion 
standard of review 
on appeal,we review the record independently to determine whether summary judgment was appropriate.see aguilar atlantic richfield cal th,d.
additionally,the issue of whether a contractual provision is contrary to public policy,or a statute which embodies such public policy,is a question of law that we may independently determine,bovard american horse enterprises,d.
ii.section invalidates the exculpatory clause here 
health net contends that under section,s ection is invalid to the extent that it purports to exculpate dhs from any liability for monetary damages caused by statutory violations,even if unintentional.
section provides all contracts which have for their object,directly or indirectly,to exempt anyone from responsibility for his own fraud,or willful injury to the person or property of another,or violation of law,whether willful or negligent,are against the policy of the law.
pursuant to established principles,our first task in construing a statute is to ascertain the intent of the legislature so as to effectuate the purpose of the law,fair employment housing com.cal d.and t he statutory language,of course,is the best indicator of legislative intent.citation.williams superior court cal th,d.further,in construing the words of a statute,we giv e to the language its usual,ordinary import and accord significance,if possible,to every word,phrase and sentence in pursuance of the legislative purpose,fair employment housing,supra,cal d at.
based on these canons of statutory construction,we can not construe section to invalidate all contracts that seek to exempt a party from responsibility for any violation of law,including any common law or contractual violation otherwise,there would be no need for the statute to separately identify fraud or willful injury,in addition to any violation of law,as prohibited objects of an exculpation.further,d espite its purported application to a ll contracts,section does not bar either contractual indemnity or insurance,notwithstanding that aside from semantics the practical effect of both is an exempt ion from liability for negligence.farnham superior court th,d farnham section is not strictly applied.accordingly,d espite its broad language,section does not apply to every contract or every violation of law.see vilner crocker national bank d.farnham,supra,th at,d.
in tunkl regents of university of california cal d,tunkl,the california supreme court observed that the courts interpretations of section have been diverse the recent case of mills ruppert d,apparently limits n egligent violation of law exclusively to statutory law.fn.omitted.other cases hold that the statute prohibits the exculpation of gross negligence only fn.omitted still another case states that the section forbids exemption from active as contrasted with passive negligence.fn.omitted.
our state supreme court concluded in tunkl,however,that i n one respect,the decisions are uniform.the cases have consistently held that the exculpatory provision may stand only if it does not involve the public interest.fn.omitted.tunkl,supra,cal d at.finding that a contract between a hospital and an entering patient affects the public interest,the state high court thereupon invalidated a clause in a hospital admission form that released the hospital from liability for any negligence of its employees.tunkl,at.
as summarized by witkin,the present view is that a contract exempting from liability for ordinary negligence is valid where no public interest is involved and no statute expressly prohibits it citation.citations.limitation of liability provisions are valid in similar circumstances.citations.but there can be no exemption from liability for intentional wrong,gross negligence,or violation of law.witkin,summary of cal.law ed.contracts,italics added.
it is now in full accord with the language of the notwithstanding its different treatment of ordinary negligence,under section,a party can not contract away liability for his fraudulent or intentional acts or for his negligent violations of statutory law,regardless of whether the public interest is affected.gardner downtown porsche audi,supra,d at.accord,blankenheim hutton d.same nunes turfgrass,seed d.nunes turfgrass same mills ruppert,supra,d at,see gavin ymca of metropolitan los angeles th,d same werner knoll d.
a law review comment on the tunkl case also reads the plain text of section to prohibit unqualifiedly exculpatory provisions that exempt responsibility for any statutory violations the section would seem to bar contractual exculpation only for fraud,injuries,and the willful or negligent violation of a statute.comment,contractual exculpation from tort liability in true rule steps forward cal,hereinafter contractual exculpation.
the statute prohibition against contractual provisions that exculpate violations of statutory law has also been construed to include regulatory violations,halliday greene d.general industry safety order requiring two escape exits from work area see delta air lines,douglas aircraft d.faa regulations.this makes sense since regulations,by definition,are rules,orders,and standards of general application that implement,interpret,or make specific the statutory law,south coast air quality management dist.th,d.there is no principled basis upon which to distinguish a violation of statute from a violation of a regulation that implements the statute in the context of prohibited exculpatory provisions.
accordingly,despite differences in the interpretation of the scope of section,california courts have construed the statute for more than years to at least invalidate contract clauses that relieve a party from responsibility for future statutory and regulatory violations.see,union constr.western union.cal,statute requiring telegraph company to use great care and diligence in the transmission and delivery of messages in re marriage of fell th,d statute requiring financial disclosures prior to marital settlement agreement halliday greene,supra,d at.general industry safety order requiring two escape exits from work area hanna lederman d.municipal code section specifying sprinkler system alarm requirements see delta air lines,douglas aircraft,supra,d at.faa regulation.
in this instance,dhs has invoked section of the agreement to exculpate it from liability for damages to health net for the violation of statutory law welf,subd.j,as defined by its implementing regulations,tit,subds.b,g.such an exculpatory clause violates section.
the trial court had reasoned to the contrary that section was not violated because the exculpatory clause was not part of a transaction that affected the public interest within the meaning of the supreme court decision in tunkl.but as shown,section prohibits the enforcement of any contractual clause that seeks to exempt a party from liability for violations of statutory and regulatory law,regardless of whether the public interest is affected.
accordingly,assuming that but for the exculpatory clause in section,dhs would be otherwise liable for damages for the violation of law issue we have not been asked to exculpatory clause here can not serve to bar the recovery of damages and is unenforceable.
iii.alternatively,section invalidates the exculpatory clause because the public interest is affected 
alternatively,even if section is more narrowly interpreted to invalidate exculpatory clauses only where the public interest is affected,the exculpatory clause here can not stand.
as noted earlier,in tunkl,the california supreme court ruled that an exculpatory provision may stand only if it does not involve the public interest tunkl,supra,cal d at,fn.omitted although it did not suggest that an exculpatory clause that did not affect the public interest was necessarily enforceable ibid.the exculpatory clause here does affect the public interest and thus can not stand under tunkl.
addressing the concept of public interest,the high court in tunkl observed no definition of the concept of public interest can be contained within the four corners of a formula.the concept,always the subject of great debate,has ranged over the whole course of the common law rather than attempt to prescribe its nature,we can only designate the situations in which it has been applied.tunkl,supra,cal d at.
the tunkl high court then sought to specify the characteristics of the type of transaction that was affected with a public interest such that an associated exculpatory clause would be held invalid in placing particular contracts within or without the category of those affected with a public interest,the courts have revealed a rough outline of that type of transaction in which exculpatory provisions will be held invalid.thus the attempted but invalid exemption involves a transaction which exhibits some or all of the following characteristics.it concerns a business of a type generally thought suitable for public regulation.fn.omitted.the party seeking exculpation is engaged in performing a service of great importance to the public,fn.omitted which is often a matter of practical necessity for some members of the public.fn.omitted.the party holds himself out as willing to perform this service for any member of the public who seeks it,or at least for any member coming within certain established standards.fn.omitted.as a result of the essential nature of the service,in the economic setting of the transaction,the party invoking exculpation possesses a decisive advantage of bargaining strength against any member of the public who seeks his services.fn.omitted.in exercising a superior bargaining power the party confronts the public with a standardized adhesion contract of exculpation,fn.omitted and makes no provision whereby a purchaser may pay additional reasonable fees and obtain protection against negligence.fn.omitted.finally,as a result of the transaction,the person or property of the purchaser is placed under the control of the seller,fn.omitted subject to the risk of carelessness by the seller or his agents.tunkl,supra,cal d at.
based on the foregoing discussion in tunkl,we have no hesitation in concluding that an exculpatory clause that is part of a transaction that provides managed health care for beneficiaries affects the public interest because such an exculpation deters,and makes more expensive,commercial plans participation in such services.
directing our attention to the first tunkl factor,the exculpation clause here is part of a transaction that concerns a health services for is not only thought suitable for public regulation tunkl,supra,cal d at,but which is regulated.
second,party seeking engaged in performing a service of great importance to the public,which is often a matter of practical necessity for some members of the public.tunkl,supra,cal d at,fns.omitted.after all,the legislature has specified that t he means employed in providing health care for those without sufficient resources should allow,to the extent practicable,eligible persons to secure health care in the same manner employed by the public generally,such as access to health care through enrollment in organized,managed care plans of the type available to the general public.welf,subds.a,c.dhs award to commercial prepaid health plans,and its regulation of that arrangement,is a service of great importance to,and of practical necessity for,needy members of the public.even the equitable distribution of default enrollees between the commercial plan and the local initiative in the specific statutory and regulatory matter at issue the public interest by encouraging participation by commercial plans in the model.it follows that the exculpation of responsibility for compliance with this statutory and regulatory scheme affects the public interest.
the third tunkl the party seeking exculpation holds itself out as willing to perform the service for qualified members of the public tunkl,supra,cal d at,may not literally apply here because dhs seeks exculpation in its transaction with health care providers,not with the public directly.but the transaction in which the exculpatory clause appears does provide a service to members of the public by making prepaid health plans available to beneficiaries.
in any event,not all of the tunkl factors need be satisfied in order for an exculpatory clause to be deemed to affect the public interest.the supreme court in tunkl conceded that n o definition of the concept of public interest can be contained within the four corners of a formula and stated that the transaction must only exhibit some or all of the identified characteristics.tunkl,supra,cal d at,accord,gardner downtown porsche audi,supra,d at.thus,the ultimate test is whether the exculpatory clause affects the public interest,not whether all of the characteristics that help reach that conclusion are satisfied.
turning to the fourth tunkl factor,dhs has a decisive
