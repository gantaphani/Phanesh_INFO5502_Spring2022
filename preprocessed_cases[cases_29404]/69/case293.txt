this appeal presents a novel issue arising in the context of interpreting a stipulation of settlement between private and governmental parties that is equivalent to a consent decree do terms of the stipulation that recite provisions of state statutes in force at the time of the stipulation bind the governmental defendants to continue those provisions into the future notwithstanding later changes by a state legislature this issue arises on an appeal by various new york state officials collectively the state from two orders of the united states district court for the southern district of new york denny chin,district judge entered in the course of protracted litigation concerning new york sex offender registration act sora or the act.the plaintiffs are a group of convicted sex offenders required to register pursuant to the sora.the district court orders,entered april,and july,explained in detail below,have the effect of preventing the state from applying to the plaintiffs recent statutory changes that a extended the time that many of the plaintiffs are subject to the act registration requirements,and b broadened for some of the plaintiffs the extent of the community notification required by the act.we conclude that the stipulation was negotiated to avoid litigation over the procedures by which the plaintiffs risk levels would be redetermined,that the plaintiffs are entitled to the benefit of those procedures,that the plaintiffs did not bargain to have the stipulation assure them the continued scope of state statutes existing at the time of the stipulation,and that the stipulation can not be interpreted to preclude the application of subsequent legislative changes on matters distinct from the subject matter of the litigation.we therefore vacate the challenged orders.
background 
the sex offender registration act.new york enacted the sora,new york version of a megan law,in july.see laws codified at correct.law to mckinney.the sora aims both to protect members of the public,especially vulnerable populations,from sex offenders by notifying them of the presence of sex offenders in their communities and to enhance law enforcement authorities ability to investigate and prosecute sex offenses.see id.at.to achieve these goals,the act requires all convicted sex offenders the registrants to register with law enforcement authorities and provides for the disclosure of information about the registrants to local law enforcement authorities,entities with vulnerable populations,and the public at large in enumerated circumstances.
all registrants remain in the sora database for at least ten years,see correct.law,and the public may find out whether any particular individual is in the database,see id.beyond these basic provisions,the act varies the duration of registration and the extent of public notification depending on which of three risk categories is applicable.state officials place registrants in a risk category based on the perceived risk that a sex offender will commit another offense,see id.under the original version of the act,or level one offenders,were obliged to remain registered for ten years,see id,and public notification was limited to responding to an inquiry concerning a particular individual,the database itself could not be searched,and information about level one offenders could not be disseminated to a member of the public without a specific inquiry,or level two offenders,also registered for ten years,see,and local law enforcement agencies,without awaiting inquiry from the public,could disseminate certain information about level two offenders to entities with vulnerable populations,see id.b,or level three offenders,were subject to a lifetime registration requirement,see id,and certain information about them was contained in a publicly accessible subdirectory of the database,in addition to being disseminated by law enforcement authorities to vulnerable entities,see id.c.level three offenders received the right to petition for relief from the registration and notification requirements after thirteen years.see id.the act specified procedures for the determination of a sex offender risk level.
since its enactment,the sora has undergone several amendments relevant to this litigation.in,following the district court ruling that the act original procedures for determining risk levels violated sex offenders procedural due process rights,see doe pataki iii,d,the new york legislature amended the sora to incorporate the procedural due process protections required by iii,see laws codified at scattered sections of correct.law et.the amendment applied prospectively to all risk determination hearings conducted after its effective date but did not provide for redetermination of risk levels previously assigned.
next,in,the sora was again amended to create the classifications of sexual predator,sexually violent offender,and predicate sex offender.see laws codified at scattered sections of correct.law et.after march,effective date of the sex offender classification as a sexual predator,sexually violent offender,or predicate sex offender required lifetime registration,regardless of risk level.see correct.law.a registration period applied to all other sex offenders whose risk levels were determined after march.see id.sex offenders already classified as level one or level two risks as of march,retained the registration requirement.see id.similarly,sex offenders already classified as level three risks continued under an obligation to register for life.see id.the amendment specified that the amended procedures for calculating the duration of an offender registration requirement did not apply to the group of sex offenders whom the legislature considered to be members of the plaintiff class in the pending litigation see laws.
in january,as the registration period for many level one and level two registrants was approaching an end,the legislature amended the sora to increase the length of the registration requirement to enhance public safety and provide better tracking and monitoring of sex offenders.laws.the january amendment,which prompted the pending round of litigation,increased the registration requirement for level one offenders from ten to twenty years and required level two offenders to register for life,effective as of january.see id.to be codified at correct.law.the january amendment gave level two offenders who are not designated as sexual predators,sexually violent offenders,or predicate sex offenders the right to petition for relief after thirty years.see id.at,to be codified at correct.law.
the most recent amendment,effective june,changed the scope of community notification about level one and level two offenders.see laws.under the june amendment,law enforcement agencies may disseminate information about level one offenders to entities with vulnerable populations,as previously authorized for level two offenders.see id.a to be codified at correct.law.a.in addition,information about level two offenders will now be maintained in the publicly accessible subdirectory that previously contained information only about level three offenders.see id.b to be codified at correct.law.b.
to summarize,the sora,as it currently exists,provides the following.level one offenders,other than those who have been classified as sexual predators,sexually violent offenders,or predicate sex offenders,must register for twenty years,and information about all level one offenders can be distributed to entities with vulnerable populations but is not maintained in the publicly accessible subdirectory.level two and level three offenders and all offenders who have been classified as sexual predators,sexually violent offenders,or predicate sex offenders,regardless of risk level,must register for life,though level two offenders who have not received such classifications may petition for relief after thirty years.level two and three offenders are identified in a publicly accessible subdirectory.
the pending litigation.in march,the sex offenders who were incarcerated,on parole,or on probation when the original sora took effect on january,a class action in the district court,alleging that the act violated the ex post facto clause of the constitution and deprived the plaintiffs of their due process and equal protection rights.on for summary judgment,the district judge concluded that the sora community notification provisions violated the ex post facto clause and enjoined enforcement of these provisions against the plaintiffs.see doe pataki i.on appeal,this court reversed the district judge ruling that the community notification procedures violated the ex post facto clause and remanded the case for consideration of the plaintiffs other claims.doe pataki ii,cir 
on remand,the plaintiffs again moved to enjoin enforcement of the sora,this time on procedural due process grounds.the district judge concluded that the registration and community notification provisions of the sora implicated protected liberty interests,see iii,d at,and that the procedures by which risk levels were assigned did not provide adequate due process for protecting these interests,see id.at.the district judge entered an injunction requiring that an offender be given a court hearing receive advance notice of the hearing,its purpose,and the recommended risk level classification be given the right to retain counsel or the right to have counsel appointed if he can not afford to retain counsel himself be given discovery of the evidence on which the risk level recommendation is based and be given the right to appeal.see id.at.moreover,the judge concluded,the state must bear the burden of proof and must prove the facts supporting the risk level recommendation by clear and convincing evidence.see id.at.the district judge enjoined the state from classifying the plaintiffs at a risk level other than level one until it reclassified them in accordance with the procedures required by the ruling.see id.at.
after the district judge procedural due process ruling in iii,the parties began settlement discussions.on november,having received no report of a final settlement,the district judge issued an order dismissing the case without prejudice to reinstatement within sixty days if the parties were unable to reach a final settlement agreement.the parties neither reached agreement within sixty days nor requested an extension of time.nonetheless,as was represented at the first of two oral arguments,the parties continued to operate as if the injunction was in effect notwithstanding the termination of the case.the parties completed settlement negotiations in june,at which time they jointly moved for reinstatement of the case and approval of a stipulation of settlement the stipulation the district judge reinstated the action and so ordered the stipulation on june.
the stipulation,the stated purpose of which was to settl e the disputes between the parties and avoid further litigation,specified detailed procedures for conducting redetermination hearings for level two and level three plaintiffs and for notifying them of their right to such hearings.of particular importance to the pending appeal is paragraph fifteen of the stipulation,set out in full in the margin which provides,among other things,that a plaintiff whose risk level is determined to be at level will be considered to be a level two offender as of march,and that,therefore,the duration of the registration requirement will be years from the date of his or her original registration.attached to the stipulation were a general notice of settlement to be sent to the plaintiffs and specific notices to be sent to level two and level three plaintiffs,which explained level two and level three plaintiffs right to redetermination hearings,the procedures by which redetermination hearings would take place,and the and requirements for those classified under level one,two,or three.
following the january amendment increasing the duration of the registration requirement for level one and level two offenders,the plaintiffs filed a motion in the district court for an order enforcing the stipulation and enjoining the state from requiring level one or level two plaintiffs to register beyond ten years.the plaintiffs contended that paragraph fifteen of the stipulation and the attached notices bound the state to a registration requirement for level one and level two plaintiffs and that the application of the amendment to these plaintiffs therefore breached the stipulation.see doe pataki iv,d.in response,the state argued that the district court lacked jurisdiction to enforce the stipulation,and that,in any event,the stipulation could not be construed to impose a limit on registration because it was concerned with the procedures for assessing risk levels,not the substantive consequences of such assessments,id.at.the district judge,after first rejecting the state jurisdictional argument see id.at,concluded that the parties had bargained for a registration period and that application of the january legislative amendment to level one and level two plaintiffs therefore breached the parties agreement,id.at.the district judge enjoined enforcement of the january amendment to level one and level two offenders covered by the stipulation,see id.at,but stayed his order pending appeal.the state filed a timely notice of appeal.
after the june amendment took effect,expanding the scope of community notification,the plaintiffs sought clarification of the district court stay of the order in iv granting injunctive relief.in particular,the plaintiffs sought to confirm that the stay,which had allowed the state,pending appeal,to apply to the plaintiffs the january amendment,extending the duration of registration,did not allow the state to apply to the plaintiffs the june amendment,extending the scope of community notification.in an order entered july,the district judge granted the plaintiffs motion,thereby enjoining the state from applying the june amendment and any subsequent amendments to level one and level two plaintiffs.see doe pataki v,d,noting that the stay of the april,injunction was granted only because there was a risk that class members who were permitted to come off the registry would be difficult to locate for in the event of a reversal.the district judge subsequently denied the state motion for clarification of the july injunction and later denied the state motion for a stay of that injunction.in denying the state stay motion,the district judge reasoned that the stipulation,by referring to the attached notices specifying the community notification provisions applicable to each risk level,bound the state to the community notification provisions in effect in when the stipulation was approved.he concluded,the new june a mendment would increase the extent of public notification for both level and level class members beyond what the parties bargained the court so ordered in the stipulation.the state timely appealed the july injunction.this court granted the state motion to consolidate the two appeals from the injunctions in iv and v and denied its motion for a stay,leaving in effect the district judge stay.after hearing an initial argument,we granted the request to hear oral argument in,the appeal from the injunction in v,concerning the scope of community notification.
as a result of the district court various rulings and its stay,the current situation is that,pending appeal,the january legislative amendment,extending the requirements,is effective against the plaintiffs,but the state is enjoined from enforcing against the plaintiffs the june legislative amendment,expanding the requirements.
plaintiffs waivers of redetermination hearings.as explained above,the stipulation provides that level two and level three plaintiffs are entitled to have their risk levels redetermined pursuant to the procedures ordered by the district court.the stipulation also provides for notice to the level two and level three plaintiffs,informing them of their option to contest the original risk level at a redetermination hearing or to accept the original risk level.the notice included a form for exercising the option and also informed the affected plaintiffs that failure to return the form would be deemed a waiver of the right to a redetermination hearing.after the january amendment extending the duration of registration,the plaintiffs,in their injunction request,complained to the district court that the waiver provision had become unfair to level two plaintiffs because some of them who were nearing the end of their period of registration had waived a redetermination of risk level without awareness of the extension of the registration period to lifetime registration.after the initial oral argument of this appeal,the state advised this court that it will afford all level two plaintiffs who waived their redetermination hearing a new opportunity to request such a hearing.
discussion 
the basic principles governing interpretation of consent decrees and their underlying stipulations are well known.such decrees reflect a contract between the parties as well as a judicial pronouncement,and ordinary rules of contract interpretation are generally applicable.see united states itt continental baking,d crumpton bridgeport education ass n,cir.often deference is given to the interpretation made by the district judge who approves the decree,a precept especially appropriate in circumstances where the judge has played a role in supervising the negotiation of the terms of the decree.see,audiovisual publishers,cenco,cir united states local,united seafood workers,cir 
in the pending case,the plaintiffs and the district judge are of the view that these principles and only these principles dictate the outcome of the appeal.in their view,the state is bound to apply the provisions of sora,including those governing the duration of registration and the scope of community notification,as they existed at the time the decree was entered,because the stipulation for the decree and the attached notices explicitly mention the duration of registration and the scope of community notification for the various risk levels as they then existed.
we recognize that the duration of registration and the scope of community notification,as they existed under state law at the time of the stipulation,are explicitly set forth in the stipulation or incorporated by the attached notices,and there is no dispute as to the meaning of the words in these recitations,ten years means ten years.what is in dispute is the operative effect of these recitations,whether these recitations are included only for informational purposes to reflect state law,as the state contends,or as binding commitments precluding application of subsequent legislative changes to the plaintiff class,as the plaintiffs contend this issue requires construction of the stipulation,a matter to be considered de novo on review.see lee bsb greenwich mortgage,cir.moreover,the normal rules of construction may vary depending on the nature of the parties and the effect of enforcement.in the pending matter,one of the parties is a state,and the effect of enforcement of the language reciting the duration of registration and the scope of community notification would be to prohibit the state from applying subsequent legislation on these topics to the plaintiff class.
proper construction of the recitations at issue,we believe,depends not only on the words of the stipulation,but also,and more importantly,on whether the parties intended to place those words in the agreement as part of a resolution of disputed matters for which the parties had bargained,or only to illustrate the provisions of state law.that intent,properly assessed based on objective indicia,see klos polskie linie lotnicze,cir,can be ascertained initially in this case from the nature of the litigation.after losing their ex post facto clause challenge to the sora,the plaintiffs returned to the district court solely to challenge the procedures for determining offender risk levels.there is no indication,however,that the plaintiffs sought to have the or the requirements remain unaltered by subsequent state legislation.maintenance of these requirements was neither the subject of any claim in the lawsuit nor the subject of any bargaining between the parties in the course of settling the lawsuit the plaintiffs successfully litigated their procedural due process claim and ultimately secured the agreement of the state to incorporate into a consent decree the hearing procedures they had sought.
the limited nature of the litigation strongly indicates that the recitations concerning duration of registration and scope of community notification were not included to secure a prohibition on subsequent state legislation on these topics.indeed,had the case proceeded to final adjudication in favor of the plaintiffs,instead of settlement,it is extremely doubtful that the plaintiffs would have been entitled to a judgment that prohibited the state from amending the provisions concerning duration of registration and scope of community notification 
moreover,in a case such as this,how a court should determine what the parties intended the operative effect of their duration and scope recitations to be should reflect traditional concerns regarding a federal court authority to restrict a state inherent powers.there is no doubt that a federal court is obliged to determine whether properly challenged state legislation violates the constitution,a responsibility that the district court discharged in this litigation in ruling that sora was unconstitutional for lack of procedures required by the due process clause of the fourteenth amendment.we need not review the correctness of that ruling because it is not challenged on this appeal.moreover,the parties subsequently incorporated those procedural requirements into a consent decree and,indeed,the state legislature itself enacted legislation that also incorporated those procedures.
however,although federal courts have authority to abrogate state laws on the grounds of claimed unconstitutionality or preemption pursuant to paramount federal legislation,they have only the most limited role when determining whether a state has surrendered some inherent authority,such as its authority to modify state statutory law.we assume that in the course of settling a federal lawsuit,parties could bargain for the continued force of a state law provision as it existed at the time of their agreement.in some circumstances,a state might obtain substantial benefits by narrowing the scope of a ruling of unconstitutionality or lessening the scope of a federal court remedy in exchange for its commitment not to alter a provision of state law but proper regard for state authority requires a federal court to have a clear indication that a state has intended to surrender its normal authority to amend its statutes 
in other contexts concerning state authority,the supreme court has similarly instructed federal courts not to impair state authority absent a clear statement that the relevant governing principle applies.for example,the supreme court has frequently instructed that a state will not be deemed to have waived its sovereign immunity unless the waiver is express and unequivocal.college savings bank florida prepaid postsecondary education expense board,d see port authority feeney,d general consent to suit provision insufficient to waive eleventh amendment immunity pennhurst state school hospital halderman,d state consent must be unequivocally expressed edelman jordan,d waiver of immunity only by the most express language or by such overwhelming implications from the text as will leave no room for any other reasonable construction alteration in original internal quotation marks omitted.similarly,the court has insisted that an act of congress purporting to abrogate a state sovereign immunity under section of the fourteenth amendment will not be effective unless congress intent to abrogate is unmistakably clear.nevada dep t of human resources hibbs,d see kimel florida board of regents,d same dellmuth muth,d same.in the same vein,the court has ruled that when congress imposes a condition on a state receipt of federal funds,it must do so unambiguously to ensure that the state acceptance of the contract is voluntar y and knowing.pennhurst state school hospital halderman,d.
more pertinent to our issue is the court development of what it has called the unmistakability doctrine,united states winstar,d plurality opinion,whereby sovereign power will remain intact unless surrendered in unmistakable terms,merrion jicarilla apache tribe,d.in winstar,congress had changed the relevant law and prevented the government from honoring certain contractual agreements it had entered into with several financial institutions.see winstar,at.although the supreme court held that the government was liable for breach of contract,id.at,the court emphasized that the unmistakability doctrine was inapplicable because the plaintiffs were claiming that the government had assumed the risk that it might have to pay damages in the event of subsequent changes in federal law,not that it must be enjoined from applying those changes to the plaintiffs,see id.at.in iv,the district judge concluded that the unmistakability doctrine as described in winstar was not relevant to the stipulation because the contracts in winstar were not entered into to resolve judicial proceedings.iv,d at.we believe that a clear statement of intent to surrender a state legislative authority is even more appropriate when the alleged restrictions on future power are part of an agreement authorized and enforced by a federal court.in the pending case,the state can not be held to have surrendered in a consent decree its authority to amend its statutes unless the decree clearly indicates that intention.in the absence of such clear indication,the recitation of existing statutory provisions is properly construed to do no more than serve as notice of what the state law then provided.
the recitation in the stipulation of the duration and notification requirements served a helpful purpose of clarity.the parties needed to know that the plaintiffs risk levels would be redetermined under the regime existing before the amendment,that the duration requirements would extend from the date of an offender original registration,and that the notification requirements would currently apply.the stipulation and its accompanying notices provided this useful information,but the stipulation and the decree can not properly be construed to surrender the state power to modify the recited requirements 
conclusion 
the orders of the district court,enjoining the state from applying the january and june amendments,are vacated.
i respectfully dissent.i believe the majority has reached a wrong conclusion because it has ignored basic principles of contract law.while the majority references the guiding principles of contract law,the majority opinion discusses them in only the most limited detail.in another very brief section,which cites only generally inapposite constitutional law,the majority opinion attempts to explain why the state should be treated differently from any other contracting party.
while the district court below devoted substantial analysis to this problem and the relevant doctrine,iv,d at citing,inter alia,united states trust new jersey,d on appellate review the majority has eschewed this approach,and instead focused on discerning the intentions of the parties.this approach is problematic,since as even had initially argued,the stipulation is not ambiguous,and we can not ignore the lack of ambiguity merely because its plain meaning does not correspond with the parties alleged intentions.
this court can not merely point to the absence of additional language specifying the allocation of risk in the event of changed circumstances as a basis for shifting that risk onto the obligee.this approach,along with the imposition of a new clear statement rule retroactively,so as to shift the burden of changed circumstances away from the party who would traditionally bear it,are radical departures from our earlier jurisprudence and the longstanding principles of the common law.furthermore,if the agreement was ambiguous,the only prudent approach would be to remand to the district court for further fact finding,given the paucity of the record.instead,the majority opinion relies on the absence of evidence,inapplicable principles of contract interpretation,and faulty analogies to inapposite constitutional law to establish a basis for reformation of the stipulation.
under new york law and the principles embodied in this circuit caselaw,the stipulation at issue is not ambiguous 
a dispute over the meaning of a provision in a written instrument after it is executed does not generate ambiguity.it is the text of the agreement itself which must be ambiguous before a court can construe the contract in view of the objective evidence of the parties shared intentions.however,the majority opinion does not identify the words,syntax or punctuation that render the stipulation ambiguous,stating only that while there is no dispute as to the meaning of the words in these recitations,there is a dispute as to their operative effect.the first question before us is whether this dispute is legitimate.the majority opinion does not address this question.rather than pointing to internal textual inconsistencies that might illustrate the purported ambiguity,it proceeds immediately to the determination of how the stipulation should be construed.
this court has and before resorting to indicia of intent,we must determine that an ambiguity is present on the face of the contract it is not sufficient for the contract to merely appear ambiguous in the light of the previous dealings between the parties.this foundational principle applies equally to consent decrees w hen the language of a consent decree is unambiguous,the scope of a consent decree must be discerned within its four corners.united states broad.music,cir.
this plain meaning approach to contract construction is the law of the circuit.roberts consolidated rail,cir a bsent an ambiguity in a written contract,courts will not look to the underlying intent of the parties in executing the contract see also ret.plan for salaried employees of rko,cir holding that the question of w hether contract language is ambiguous is resolved by reference to the contract alone internal quotation marks omitted accord collins,cir noting that u nder new york law,the question of ambiguity vel non must be determined from the face of the agreement,without reference to extrinsic evidence 
conversely,the majority reasons,without even mentioning the question of ambiguity,that the p roper construction of the recitations at issue,we believe,depends not only on the words of the stipulation,but also,and more importantly,on whether the parties intended to place these words into the agreement as part of a resolution of disputed matters.majority op.emphasis added.this approach is contrary to our precedent and the principles of contract law,which the majority agrees should govern.majority op.
the importance of our steadfast adherence to the plain meaning rule becomes clear when we consider the unbridled freedom an appellate court has when it is abandoned we could then rewrite any contract to correspond with what we believe to be the intentions of the parties,utilizing the exceptional equitable remedy of reformation under the guise of contract construction.however,t here is no power at common law to reform a written instrument.reformation of interests see also ivinson hutton.accordingly,a court may neither rewrite,under the guise of interpretation,a term of the contract when the term is clear and unambiguous,nor redraft a contract to accord with its instinct for the dispensation of equity upon the facts of a given case.terwilliger terwilliger,cir.
despite this governing precedent,the reformation of the stipulation is precisely what the majority opinion effects.here,the majority recharacterization of the operative effect of these a mere reference to the state of the existing inserts a new provision of critical importance into the agreement.the contract,as rewritten by the majority,now contains a new provision in the sections referring to sora notice and duration of registration requirements that reads these terms are included only to provide an indication of the existing statutory provisions the state of new york reserves the right to modify the scope and term of your registration as a sex offender,despite the fact that a promise with a reserved right to deny or change the effect of the promise,is an absurdity.murray charleston.
ii.the district court factual findings were not clearly erroneous 
even if the stipulation is ambiguous,we would be required to address the district court factual findings,to which we owe considerable deference,in far more detail to be confident that vacatur is required.however,the majority opinion does not address this issue squarely,relegating to a footnote the finding that to whatever extent the district court might have made finding s they would be clearly erroneous.majority op.however,since w here there are two permissible views of the evidence of the parties intent,the court pure findings of fact can not be termed clearly erroneous,united states naval institute charter communications,cir,the majority opinion implicitly holds in the alternative that the district court and thoughtful opinions below contained findings that were not even plausible.the reviewing court oversteps the bounds of its duty under rule a if it undertakes to duplicate the role of the lower court.in applying the clearly erroneous standard to the findings of a district court sitting without a jury,appellate courts must constantly have in mind that their function is not to decide factual issues de novo t he court of appeals may not reverse it even though convinced that had it been sitting as the trier of fact,it would have weighed the evidence differently.anderson bessemer city,d.
the district court found that had agreed to,and indeed bargained for the notification procedures applicable to each class of sora registrants,as embodied in the consent decree.v,d at,see also iv,d at considering how the circumstances of the litigation illuminate the parties intentions.while the majority opinion contains a discussion of why the external evidence of the parties intentions can be cast in a different light so as to reach a different finding,it does not address the pertinent question,of whether the district court factual findings are so implausible as to constitute an impermissible view of the same record.majority op.consequently,even if this court could demonstrate that the stipulation was ambiguous on its face,vacatur would not be warranted,because the district court conclusion is a permissible view of the evidence.
the majority opinion notes that there was no objective evidence that the parties intended the duration and scope recitations to have the effect of prohibiting the state from applying future legislation on these topics to the plaintiffs.majority op.however,the district court relied on the very same type of evidence that the majority argues is dispositive the context provided by the earlier litigation.see,iv,d at.if this is not the sort of objective evidence that is adequate to support the district court holding,it is not apparent why it would provide a more sufficient basis for this court fact finding,particularly as few persons are in a better position to understand the meaning of a settlement than the district judge who oversaw and approved it.united states local,united seafood workers,cir.
the majority opines further that there is no indication that the district judge participated in developing any of the terms of the stipulation that resulted in the decree.majority op.that may be true,but it does not establish that the district court was not familiar with the specifics of the dispute between the parties and their attempts at resolution.the district judge below the span of ten challenges made to sora,litigation which the majority believes to provide it with the necessary context for its construction of the consent decree.see iii,d chin,i.chin,doe pataki.chin.accordingly,the principle of deference this court announced in local applies a fortoiri in the instant case there is no compelling argument in the majority opinion why it should be set aside.
iii.the majority relies on the fact that one party is a state,without specifying precisely why this is central to construing the contract winstar is inapplicable 
the majority believes that the most important features of the context of the agreement are that one of the parties is a state,and that the designated forum for its enforcement is a federal court.while this is not unreasonable in itself,it leads the majority to another departure from this circuit precedent by inspiring the creation of an unprecedented clear statement rule.while the majority opinion presents this new rule as a straightforward application of supreme court precedent,it misconstrues the leading case.
the majority notes that federal courts exhibit a traditional concern for restrict ing a state inherent powers.majority op.accordingly,it reasons that a court construing a consent decree must have a clear indication that a state has intended to surrender its normal authority to amend its statutes.id.at.however,what is at issue here is not a wholesale surrender of the police power or an implicit disavowal of the right to amend the statutes that exercise it,but rather whether a state may make a binding promise to certain of its citizens not to subject them to those future amendments.
the majority relies on united states winstar to support the novel clear statement rule,which it retroactively applies to,but the opinion does not engage in the analysis deemed critical by the supreme court in that case whether the particular agreement at issue is of the type to which the unmistakability the doctrine that requires that a contract purportedly binding a state to contractual obligations despite later legislative amendments to clearly indicate its intent to be so properly applicable 
injecting the opportunity for unmistakability litigation into every common contract action would,however,produce the untoward result of compromising the government practical capacity to make contracts,which we have held to be of the essence of sovereignty itself.from a practical standpoint,it would make an inroad on this power,by expanding the government opportunities for contractual abrogation,with the certain result of undermining the government credibility at the bargaining table and increasing the cost of its engagements.
d plurality opinion accordingly,the majority invocation of the unmistakability doctrine here in support of deference to state sovereignty is perplexing.the state also exercised a sovereign power when executing the stipulation the majority opinion does not consider whether a federal court declaration that this sovereign act was implicitly limited is consistent with the principles of federalism 
winstar establishes that when no clear statement rule such as the unmistakability doctrine is properly applicable,a sovereign may be held liable for its abrogation of a contractual agreement,because in that event,a bedrock principle of the common law dictates this outcome.the applicable principle is that a party assumes the risk that it will not be able to perform its obligation under the contract.day united states.holmes,one who makes a contract never can be absolutely certain that he will be able to perform it when the time comes,and the very essence of it is that he takes the risk within the limits of his undertaking.although the majority opinion states that there is no indication,however,that the plaintiffs sought to have the or the requirements remain unaltered by subsequent state legislation,majority op,this absence merely indicates that there was no provision in the contract stating that the government will be liable in the event that it can not perform,because it would have been superfluous.
the supreme court reaffirmed in winstar that the government can not ignore the principle that a party responsible for the changed circumstances that make performance of its contractual obligations impossible can not evade responsibility by pointing to the changed circumstances,or by asserting that the contract did not specify what should occur in that event.at.put simply,i f the adverse event is due to the fault of the obligor,the offending party can not be heard to cry that performance is impracticable.williston on contracts ed.see also restatement second of contracts
