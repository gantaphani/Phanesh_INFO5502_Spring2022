in a marital dissolution proceeding to divide the community property,where the nonmanaging spouse has prima facie evidence that community assets of a certain value have disappeared while in the control of the managing spouse should the managing spouse have the burden of proof to account for the missing assets the answer is yes.
husband and wife separated after a year marriage and,for postseparation years,continued to handle their joint finances as before husband had complete control of substantial community investment accounts and paid all the bills wife trusted him to manage their finances for their mutual benefit.just before trial,however,husband disclosed for the first time that the investment accounts were virtually empty.without any corroborating evidence,he attributed the dissipation of account values to proper expenditures and stock market losses.
at trial,wife argued the court should charge husband with the missing funds unless he proved he did not misappropriate the money.her only evidence of missing funds was a financial statement husband prepared three years after separation and nine years before trial.the trial court concluded the document was insufficient evidence the accounts had contained the stated amounts postseparation,and declined to charge husband with the missing funds.the ensuing property division required wife to make a large equalizing payment to husband.
based on relevant family code provisions,equitable principles,and case law,we conclude the trial court erred in failing to shift to the managing spouse the burden of proof concerning the missing community assets.once a nonmanaging spouse makes a prima facie showing of the existence and value of community assets in the other spouse control postseparation,the burden of proof shifts to the managing spouse to prove the proper disposition or lesser value of those assets.failing such proof,the court should charge the managing spouse with the assets according to the prima facie showing.
factual and procedural background 
alan and elaine margulis separated after more than years of marriage.on august,alan moved out of the family residence in irvine and relocated to chicago to start a new job.elaine remained in the family home the sycamore house,while the couple two adult children lived elsewhere.
marital finances from separation through filing of dissolution petition 
during the marriage,alan had been the sole breadwinner and exercised complete control of the couple finances.he managed several community checking accounts from which he paid the bills.he also managed their investment portfolio,which included brokerage accounts at various institutions,including sutro company,john hancock clearing corporation,and charles schwab,the custodian of two community ira held in alan name.
as explained more fully below,the record contains limited documentary evidence of the value of the community investment accounts alan was managing at separation,or afterward the joint income tax returns alan submitted into evidence provide some inkling of value.the margulis schedule d,the statement of their capital gains and losses,reported that between january and july of,they sold worth of short and stock holdings,and two other investments that generated another.
the size of the community estate grew larger due to several substantial infusions of community cash.this increase consisted of in severance pay related to alan preseparation employment,from the sale of the couple palm desert house,and from cashing out a life insurance policy collectively,these additional sums amounted to.
after alan moved to chicago,he continued to manage the community investments and to pay elaine bills,including all the expenses for the sycamore house,and other community obligations.on a number of occasions,alan also wrote a check directly to elaine,typically for to.
initially,alan paid the bills with checks drafted from the couple merrill lynch money market checking account.in september,alan began paying his,the community,and elaine bills from a new separate property account,identified as his chevy chase bank account.in testimony,alan acknowledged that he freely transferred community property funds into his chevy chase account and other separate bank accounts.
both parties appeared content with the postseparation status quo since neither filed for divorce,and elaine did not seek a temporary support order.during the separation,as before,elaine left management of their joint finances entirely to alan.she received no account statements from the various banks or brokerage firms holding the community assets.
the petition for dissolution and alan property disclosures 
in,elaine began paying the mortgage on the sycamore house and also began earning income as an actress.on june,nearly six years after separation,elaine filed a marital dissolution petition.alan waited until february,to file his response.neither document disclosed the extent of the marital property.elaine declaration regarding community assets listed only the sycamore house and miscellaneous art and jewelry,but stated she would amend the petition to add community assets as they became known.alan claimed in his declaration that t he nature and extent of community property has not yet been ascertained and that he would amend the petition as the property is discovered.
the mandatory settlement conference briefs,exchanged in october,more than years after separation,gave the first inkling of the dispute brewing.the two briefs painted dramatically different views of the community property subject to division.
elaine brief identified the following community assets within alan possession and control,and thus chargeable to him in the division proceeds from the sale of the palm desert house proceeds from a bank of america line of credit severance package from his preseparation employer proceeds from the ira and securities sale and when alan cashed out a life insurance policy.elaine estimated the total community property chargeable to alan as approximately.elaine asserted the court could achieve an equal property division if it allowed her to retain the sycamore house,with in equity,and cash received from refinancing the property in,and she paid an outstanding tax obligation of,with alan providing her a equalizing payment.
alan settlement conference brief identified the sycamore house as the main remaining community asset and proposed that it be sold and the proceeds divided equally between the parties.he asserted the court could achieve an equal property division by halving any community retirement or pension benefits and allowing each party to keep the car,bank accounts,and other financial accounts in his or her name since the date of separation.
alan brief failed to mention any of the community property investment accounts that had existed at date of separation,such as the sutro company account or the john hancock and charles schwab accounts.nor did his brief mention the merrill lynch bank account or the in community funds alan received postseparation from the severance package,desert house sale,and life insurance policy.
the parties obtained a status only judgment of dissolution on april,and a trial date to resolve the reserved property division issues.
the parties trial briefs simply expanded on their settlement briefs.elaine trial brief asserted higher values for the investment accounts chargeable to alan,based on a key document she would later offer into evidence as exhibit.she contended alan had received from charles schwab ira accounts and from sutro eq account 
alan trial brief asserted the only presently existing community property consisted of the sycamore house,the personal property within it,and an irs tax loss of.as for the various financial accounts alan maintained postseparation,he asserted these had been depleted over the ensuing years by paying community expenses,elaine daily maintenance and expenses,and by stock market losses.he claimed he would introduce evidence of both the expenditures and market losses that depleted the accounts.
evidence and findings on the community assets chargeable to alan 
though the parties clashed at trial on a number of issues relating to the value of the community assets chargeable to alan the most significant dispute concerned whether to charge alan with the value of the stock brokerage and money market accounts in alan postseparation control,namely,the sutro company,john hancock,charles schwab,and merrill lynch accounts.
except as to the charles schwab ira,alan presented no evidence on the value of these community accounts at any time.instead,alan generally testified that these community accounts were now virtually empty except for at charles schwab due to stock market losses and expenditures for the community or elaine benefit.alan argued that the only community assets chargeable to him were the remaining in the charles schwab ira.
contrary to the representation in his trial brief,alan produced no evidence at trial to show how he disposed of the funds under his control.nor did he produce evidence tracing funds from community accounts to a community expenditure or purchase.the only specific evidence he offered concerning the disposition of any community funds was his testimony about withdrawing funds from the charles schwab iras in,and,in amounts collectively totaling,as reported on the couple joint tax returns.alan testified that he withdrew these ira funds because he needed money to pay current expenses and wanted to avoid further losses in a declining market.alan did not offer any evidence to corroborate this claim.
in closing argument,alan claimed that his general assertion of ira withdrawals corresponded to the tax loss identified as a community asset in his trial brief.alan counsel asserted,the remaining balance in those investment accounts would have been in the tax loss carried forward in other words,he argued that after subtracting alan expenditures for the community and for elaine,all that remained in the investment accounts was,a sum that was lost in the market as evidenced by the carry forward that existed at time of trial.
elaine introduced evidence to prove the value of the investment accounts in alan control postseparation.she testified that,as the nonmanaging spouse,she had no personal knowledge or records of the value of the accounts at any particular time.but she offered into evidence as exhibit a document entitled confidential personal financial statement for margulis,dated february,reflecting total assets of.the itemized list of assets included in a money market identified on the second page as the merrill lynch account in the charles schwab iras in marketable securities presumably the sutro company account,real estate and other investments.alan admitted under that he had prepared and signed this document in february.elaine counsel argued the trial court should accept the values of the merrill lynch,charles schwab,and sutro company accounts as stated on exhibit unless alan proved he properly disposed of those assets for community purposes or the stock holdings lost value due to market decline.in other words,elaine argued the burden of proof should shift to alan to disprove the values stated on exhibit because he controlled those accounts and therefore was the only one with the personal knowledge or records to prove the value and disposition of the community funds postseparation.the trial court admitted exhibit into evidence.
in closing argument,alan counsel argued exhibit should be given little weight because elaine presented no testimony explaining the document alan created,and the document was unreliable because it failed to distinguish between community and separate property.alan also argued exhibit was outdated and therefore shed little light on the value of the community assets present now.
the trial court ultimately did not rely on the account values listed in exhibit.the court explained,i do believe it supports,standing alone,that your assets listed did,in fact,exist.without exhibit,the trial court had no evidence on the value of any specific investment accounts,except for the charles schwab ira.as for the ira,charles schwab account statements showed a combined value in december of,tax records reported alan withdrawal of from those accounts in,and current account statements showed remaining in the ira.based on that evidence,the trial court charged alan with in ira funds.the trial court made no findings on the value of the other investment accounts at separation or later,and did not charge alan with any of those funds,impliedly accepting alan assertion that he spent the money from these accounts on the community and elaine,and lost the remainder in market downturns.
the trial court also charged alan with the community cash he received from the desert property,life insurance policy,and severance pay.the trial court rejected elaine argument that alan should be charged with the bank of america line of credit or the for unused vacation,concluding alan used both sums for the community benefit.
evidence and findings on alan right to reimbursement for postseparation payments 
the other major trial issue concerned alan right to be reimbursed from the community property for his postseparation payments on community debts or for elaine benefit.the parties stipulated that dennis sperry,a certified public accountant,would serve as the court forensic accountant,to conduct a tracing and analysis of both parties claims for credits regarding postseparation payments on community property obligations or for the benefit of the other party.in the stipulation,the parties agreed to provide sperry with all documents previously produced in discovery and to cooperate with any reasonable requests for additional information.
sperry asked alan to produce a ll personal bank statements and check registers for all bank accounts alan held in his own name or jointly with another from the date of separation through the present.sperry also asked for a ll brokerage statements for any investments owned individually or jointly for the same time period.
in response,alan gave sperry bank documents for only two accounts,merrill lynch and chevy chase,although he admitted at trial that he maintained various other community and separate property accounts and freely commingled them.the bank documents alan provided for the two accounts were incomplete.he gave sperry merrill lynch check registers but no bank statements.alan provided check registers for the chevy chase account from september,through november,but the chevy chase bank statements he provided were from december,forward.
alan gave sperry no brokerage statements for the sutro company,john hancock,or charles schwab community investment accounts mentioned in the tax records,or for alan own brokerage accounts,such as raymond james or another account referred to in a check register as lfg trading account.
despite sperry initial charge to conduct a tracing and analyze alan claim for reimbursement,his eventual report merely recorded and summarized all the checks listed on the merrill lynch and chevy chase check registers alan provided.as sperry explained at trial,he could not substantiate or disprove alan claim for reimbursement for postseparation payments because alan failed to provide the complete documentation needed for such an analysis.sperry conceded that his report shed little light on the validity of alan claim for credits.
alan retained his own forensic accounting expert,jack white,to testify on the issue of credits.white report,accepted into evidence,purported to do what sperry did not it stated the total amount of credits due alan for payments made for the benefit of the community or elaine.white testified that,based on the check registers and alan verbal explanations,he tallied the checks alan wrote from the merrill lynch and chevy chase accounts and characterized each payment as a community expense,elaine expense,or alan expense.in his report,white concluded that postseparation alan paid for community expenses,for elaine separate expenses and directly to elaine.adding these sums together,white concluded alan should be credited with reimbursable payments totaling.
at trial,elaine objected to white testimony and report as lacking proper foundation.she argued white had no basis for concluding that particular payments were for the benefit of the community or her,and thus reimbursable,based on merely check registers and alan explanations.she argued white could only conclude a payment was reimbursable if it was made from separate funds,and alan admitted he commingled funds to such an extent that he could not trace the source of any payments.consequently,she argued,the trial court should exclude white opinion that alan was due reimbursement for payments totaling.
the trial court overruled elaine objections.the trial court stated it found white testimony persuasive,and awarded alan all the credits white recommended.
the findings on alan breach of fiduciary duty 
the trial court specifically found alan breached the fiduciary duty he owed to elaine to maintain proper records of all community assets which he had exclusive control and management over the court noted that alan,as managing spouse,had the best knowledge of where the assets and accounts were located in spite of his protestations otherwise h ad alan taken the opportunity to avail himself of the possibility of locating the documentation it might have enabled the financial experts to present a more detailed analysis of the financial issues in this matter.instead,alan produced few records and his failure to keep adequate records hampered the equitable disposition of assets the court concluded that the evidence is insufficient to support what really happened to these accounts.accordingly,the trial court ordered alan to pay elaine in sanctions for the breach of fiduciary duty and as a contributed share of elaine attorney fees and costs 
the property division 
the trial court awarded the sycamore house to elaine,but ordered her to make an equalizing payment to alan of,after subtracting the he owed her for the sanctions and attorney fees.the court furthered ordered elaine to sell the house if she could not make the equalizing payment in days.
elaine appealed from the judgment ordering her to make the equalizing payment or sell the house.alan filed a from the finding he breached his fiduciary duty and from the resulting award to elaine of sanctions and attorney fees.
discussion 
elaine appeal 
elaine argues the trial court erred in its community property division,both undervaluing the community assets chargeable to alan and him for payments purportedly made for the community and elaine benefit.she is correct on both counts.
the trial court erred in tallying the community assets chargeable to alan 
elaine contends the trial court erred when it excluded from the community property chargeable to alan the investment account funds he controlled postseparation but which were unaccountably missing at time of trial.we agree the trial court erred in refusing to count these missing assets,and,more fundamentally,in refusing to shift the burden of proof to alan to show the disposition and valuation of community assets in his control postseparation.
though alan never stated a value for the community investment accounts at separation or otherwise except the charles schwab iras,the tax records he offered into evidence suggest that in these accounts likely held more than million and,by the end of,potentially an additional million exhibit,which alan prepared in early,acknowledged a total value in just three of the couple accounts sutro company,charles schwab,and merrill lynch stood at.collectively,the brokerage and checking accounts were the most valuable community assets the couple owned.by the time of trial,however,alan claimed that all that was left of this community property was a mere in the charles schwab ira.
while the judgment did charge alan with a portion of the ira funds he had controlled the he admittedly removed and the that remained it made no provision for the rest of the community funds alan had managed postseparation.the trial court was explicit about its reason for refusing to charge alan with any of these other missing funds elaine only proof that money was missing was exhibit,and the court considered the exhibit insufficient to establish the account values.the court stated i do believe exhibit supports,standing alone,that your assets listed did,in fact,exist.the judgment further noted the court finds there was no showing as to the total amounts of funds available to alan and it has not heard any evidence to support argument on elaine part that alan should be charged with the receipt of the community assets listed on exhibit.
in other words,the trial court concluded that elaine,the nonmanaging spouse who lacked both personal knowledge and records concerning the assets listed on exhibit,failed to meet the difficult burden of proving these now missing assets had existed,there had been in sutro company,in merrill lynch,in charles schwab ira in.
the trial court failure to place the burden of proof on alan relieved him of the duty to account for his postseparation management of these assets.thus,alan did not have to prove the amounts that had been in these accounts or that he had properly disposed of those sums.this lack of accountability poses a risk of abuse and runs afoul of the statutory scheme imposing broad fiduciary duties of disclosure and accounting on a managing spouse.
we thus adopt a rule advocated by amici curiae but not fully articulated in any published case to date.we conclude that once a nonmanaging spouse makes a prima facie showing concerning the existence and value of community assets in the control of the other spouse postseparation,the burden of proof shifts to the managing spouse to rebut the showing or prove the proper disposition or lesser value of these assets.if the managing spouse fails to meet this burden,the court should charge the managing spouse with the assets according to the prima facie showing.as we explain in detail below,we find support for this rule in general case law explaining the circumstances and equitable principles that justify shifting the burden of proof,family code provisions that impose fiduciary duties of disclosure and accounting on spouses,and family law cases addressing the problem of missing community assets.
principles governing the decision whether to shift the burden of proof 
we begin by reviewing the principles relevant to deciding whether to shift the burden of proof on a particular issue.ordinarily,a party has the burden of proof as to each fact the existence or nonexistence of which is essential to the claim for relief or defense that he is asserting.this general rule applies e xcept as otherwise provided by law.ibid.c ourts may alter the normal allocation of the burden of proof based on considerations of fairness and policy.amaral cintas.th,amaral.
indeed,california courts consistently approve shifting the burden of proof where circumstances make it impossible for a plaintiff to prove his or her case as,for example,in the context when employers inadequate records prevent employees from proving their claims for unpaid overtime hours citation and unpaid meal and rest breaks citation.amaral,supra,th at see also fowler seaton cal d,applying res ipsa loquitur in case of small child injured at preschool.
these decisions recognize that determining the incidence of the burden of proof is merely a question of policy and fairness based on experience in the different situations.citations.adams murakami cal d,original italics adams.in deciding the issue,fundamental fairness must be the lodestar for our analysis.id.at.
the factors relevant to the analysis are well established in determining whether the normal allocation of the burden of proof should be altered,the courts consider a number of factors the knowledge of the parties concerning the particular fact,the availability of the evidence to the parties,the most desirable result in terms of public policy in the absence of proof of the particular fact,and the probability of the existence or nonexistence of the fact.citations.lakin watkins associated industries cal th.
given that bedrock concerns of policy and fairness drive the analysis adams,supra,cal d at,it is not surprising that a common trigger for is when the parties have unequal access to evidence necessary to prove a disputed issue.where the evidence necessary to establish a fact essential to a claim lies peculiarly within the knowledge and competence of one of the parties,that party has the burden of going forward with the evidence on the issue although it is not the party asserting the claim.citations.citation.amaral,supra,th at see also wolf superior court th,where essential financial records are in the exclusive control of the defendant who would benefit from any incompleteness,public policy is best served by shifting the burden of proof to the defendant,thereby imposing the risk of any incompleteness in the records on the party obligated to maintain them.
concerns over unequal access to evidence amaral,supra,th at are particularly pressing in the context of a marital dissolution where financial records can be crucial to ensuring the equal division of property required by family code section.all further statutory references are to the family code unless otherwise indicated.undoubtedly,in marriages and separations like the margulis where one spouse exercised exclusive control over community property,the parties will have vastly unequal access to evidence concerning the disposition of that property.when this occurs,fairness requires shifting to the managing spouse the burden of proof on missing assets.moreover,as explained in the next section,the statutory fiduciary duties of disclosure and accounting owed between spouses further justify that result.
fiduciary duties of disclosure and accounting under the family code 
family code provisions detailing the fiduciary obligations between spouses provide strong support for shifting the burden of proof to the managing spouse when determining the value and disposition of missing assets.the starting point is section,which provides that accountability for the management of community assets is a fundamental aspect of the fiduciary duties owed between spouses.
section,subdivision b,states,in relevant part i n transactions between themselves,a husband and wife are subject to the general rules governing fiduciary relationships which control the actions of persons occupying confidential relations with each other.this confidential relationship imposes a duty of the highest good faith and fair dealing on each spouse,and neither shall take any unfair advantage of the other.this confidential relationship is a fiduciary relationship subject to the same rights and duties of nonmarital business partners,as provided in sections,and of the corporations code,including,but not limited to,the following providing each spouse access at all times to any books kept regarding a transaction for the purposes of inspection and copying.rendering upon request,true and full information of all things affecting any transaction which concerns the community property.nothing in this section is intended to impose a duty for either spouse to keep detailed books and records of community property transactions.accounting to the spouse,and holding as a trustee,any benefit or profit derived from any transaction by one spouse without the consent of the other spouse which concerns the community property.
section specific incorporation of the same rights and duties of nonmarital business partners,as provided in section of the corporations code,makes clear that the duty to disclose relevant information concerning transactions affecting the community property is an affirmative and broad obligation.corporations code section requires each partner to furnish to a partner without demand,any information concerning the partnership business and affairs reasonably required for the proper exercise of the partner rights and duties under the partnership agreement or this chapter,subd.c,italics added.
section further delineates the scope of a managing spouse accountability.that statute not only prohibits a spouse from engaging in certain conduct,such as making a unilateral gift of community personal property or disposing of it for less than fair and reasonable value,without the written consent of the other spouse,subd.b,but it also requires each spouse to act as a fiduciary toward the other in the management of community assets in accordance with the general rules governing fiduciary relationships as specified in section,until such time as the assets and liabilities have been divided by the parties or by a court.this duty includes the obligation to make full disclosure to the other spouse of all material facts and information regarding the existence,characterization,and valuation of all assets in which the community has or may have an interest,subd.e.
importantly,section creates a right of action and specific remedies for the breach of fiduciary duty between spouses.subdivision a of section gives each spouse a claim against the other spouse for any breach of the fiduciary duty that results in impairment to the claimant spouse present undivided interest in the community estate the statutory remedies for a breach of fiduciary duty,specifically including a breach of those duties set out in sections and,include a mandatory award of percent of any asset undisclosed or transferred in breach of the fiduciary duty plus attorney fees and court costs,subd.g.if the nondisclosure or wrongful disposition of community property falls within the ambit of civil code section punitive damages upon clear and convincing evidence of oppression,fraud or malice,the court must award to injured spouse the entire value of the asset,subd.h.
finally,section makes clear that these fiduciary obligations of disclosure and accounting continue to bind spouses after separation until final distribution of assets.section states a full and accurate disclosure of all assets and liabilities in which one or both parties have or may have an interest must be made in the early stages of a proceeding for dissolution of marriage or legal separation of the parties moreover,each party has a continuing duty to immediately,fully,and accurately update and augment that disclosure to the extent there have been any material changes so that at the time the parties enter into an agreement for the resolution of any of these issues,or at the time of trial on these issues,each party will have a full and complete knowledge of the relevant underlying facts,subd.c,italics added see also,subd.a from date of separation to date community assets are distributed,spouses are subject to fiduciary duty to disclose assets and update material changes.
taken together,these statutes impose on a managing spouse affirmative,duties to disclose and account for the existence,valuation,and disposition of all community assets from the date of separation through final property division.simply put,these statutes require the spouse to account for his or her management of the property.the managing spouse must reveal if the community property changes value,ceases to exist,or is transferred for less than its worth,thereby depriving the nonmanaging spouse of his or her.because of the fiduciary relationship between spouses,the managing spouse must reveal any or other conduct that impaired the value of the property and entitles the other spouse to compensation.
applying these statutes to the facts of this case,a trial court could conclude alan breached his fiduciary duties of disclosure and accounting.a court could find he breached his duty to provide full and accurate disclosure of all community assets when in pretrial exchanges he failed to inform elaine that was in the charles schwab ira,asserting that the only existing community property was the sycamore house.a trial court similarly could find alan breached his duty to disclose immediately and fully any material changes in the community property,subd.c,by failing to tell elaine until just before trial that all the community investment and checking accounts he had managed were virtually empty.additionally,by refusing to provide elaine with any documentary or other corroborating proof of what actually happened to the money that had once been in those accounts,alan may have breached his duty to furnish to elaine any information concerning the community business and affairs reasonably required for the proper exercise of her rights,subd.c,subd.b,which included her right to pursue a claim against alan for impairment to her interest in the community estate,subds.a,g h.
the trial court,however,found a single,narrow breach of duty by alan a breach of the duty to keep and provide adequate records.in so ruling,the trial court impliedly found alan did not owe broader fiduciary duties of disclosure and accounting.the trial court erroneous finding on the scope of alan duties led it to apply the wrong remedy.instead of awarding elaine at least percent of the value of undisclosed or wrongfully transferred assets,subds.g percent,h percent upon proof of oppression,fraud or malice,the trial court ordered alan to pay elaine as sanctions,plus attorney fees.
the trial court failure to find alan breached his broader fiduciary duties of disclosure and accounting stemmed from the court denial of elaine request to charge alan with the exhibit asset values unless he disproved those values or proved he properly disposed of those assets.although the trial court found that elaine had satisfied the requisite foundation to admit the exhibit,it accorded the document little or no weight because elaine had not prepared it and had no evidence to support it.consequently,according to the trial court,elaine failed to carry her burden of proving the accounts itemized in exhibit ever had the values listed in that document,and alan could not be charged with wrongfully disposing of assets he never possessed.but,as discussed above,the trial court misapplied the burden of proof.
elaine introduction of exhibit,which alan conceded he prepared,satisfied her initial burden.the statutory fiduciary duties of disclosure and accounting then effectively shifted the burden to alan to rebut the presumption he should be charged with the assets listed on exhibit,a document that was prima facie evidence of the account values it stated.
alan duty to make full and accurate disclosure of all community assets,subd.c and of all material facts regarding the existence,characterization and valuation of those assets,subd.e,his duty to immediately,fully and accurately update and augment that disclosure,subd.c,and to furnish w ithout demand information concerning the community business and affairs reasonably required for the proper exercise of elaine community property rights,subd.c,imposed on alan the duty to produce evidence of the existence and value of the community accounts he controlled.see also in re marriage of feldman th,managing spouse has sua sponte duty of disclosure regarding existence and valuation of community assets in re marriage of brewer federici th,managing spouse has affirmative duty to acquire and disclose information concerning valuation of community assets.shifting the burden to alan under these circumstances simply enforces this statutory duty of production.
this statutory framework also supports shifting to alan the burden of proof on the proper disposition of the assets in his control specifically,section,the lead statute articulating the fiduciary duties owed between spouses,imposes on each an affirmative duty to produce full information of all things affecting any transaction which concerns the community property,subd.b.the statute also requires the managing spouse to a ccount to the spouse,and hold as a trustee,any benefit or profit derived from any transaction which concerns the community property,subd.b.the statute goes yet further in requiring a spouse to produce full information concerning his or her management of community assets by specifically incorporating from the corporations code a mandate that the spouse furnish w ithout demand,any information concerning the community business that the other spouse requires for the exercise of his or her rights,subd.c,subd.b.together,these requirements compel a spouse to produce evidence as to the disposition of community property,or,stated differently,to account for the property in his or her control.see haines,at is a statute of mutual accountability,requiring each spouse to show his or her conduct in connection with an interspousal transaction conformed to the legal standard applicable to fiduciaries.as with requiring the managing spouse to establish the value of community assets,shifting the burden to the managing spouse to prove proper disposition of assets simply enforces this statutory duty of production.
in summary,these family law statutes imposing broad fiduciary duties of disclosure and accounting on spouses from separation onward justify shifting to the managing spouse the burden to establish the value and disposition of missing assets.
cases addressing the problem of missing community assets 
although there is a lack of case law addressing the specific problem of proof this case presents,three cases lend support to our conclusion that the managing spouse should bear the burden of proving the proper disposition of missing assets if the nonmanaging spouse makes the requisite prima facie showing.of these three opinions,two reversed trial court judgments which failed to take into account missing assets in the division of marital property,thereby clarifying the trial court duty to make findings on all community assets under a spouse control postseparation.see williams williams d williams in re marriage of ames d ames.the third opinion,in re marriage of valle d valle,affirmed a judgment that charged the managing spouse with missing property because he failed to prove its proper disposition.in other words,valle shifted the burden of proof to the managing spouse to show the proper disposition of community property a key aspect of the approach we adopt here.while none of these three cases addresses the added problem of proving the value of missing assets,they provide support for the approach we adopt.
the rationale for shifting the evidentiary burden concerning missing assets to the managing spouse arises from the simple fact that an accounting of all community property is required so the court may divide it equally.in williams,supra,d,the appellate court reversed an interlocutory judgment dividing the community property because the trial court failed to include missing assets in the property division,the same failure that occurred here when the court erroneously rejected elaine prima facie showing and required no rebuttal by alan.
the husband and wife in williams were married almost years when,with divorce imminent,husband withdrew from community accounts from savings and from a stock fund.williams,supra,d at.an accountant appointed to audit the couple financial records was unable to trace of the withdrawn funds,and the accountant could not determine whether the husband spent the balance on community or separate debts.the trial court made no findings concerning the,and disregarded it in dividing the community estate.the appellate court reversed,agreeing that in failing to require the husband to account for the missing funds,the trial court failed to perform its duty to equally divide the community property.id.at.
the court noted,the in dispute here was intact immediately prior to the filing of the action.under these circumstances,the husband would obtain an unfair advantage over his wife if he is not required to account for that portion of the money which was community property and to reimburse the wife for her share of any of the community property not shown to have been used for community purposes.williams,supra,d at.the court remanded for a retrial of the issue of community property includ ing all sums of money received and disposed of by the husband when the divorce action was imminent.id.at.
ames,supra,d is the second case where the court reversed a partial judgment dividing community property because the trial court failed to award the nonmanaging spouse her share of missing community funds.ames concluded the trial court abused its discretion in finding husband had properly accounted for of community property.id.at.the appellate court found,through its own most benign reading of an incredibly vague record,that husband failed to sustain his burden to account for community funds by a very large amount,fn.specifically,the court concluded about remains unexplained by george.id.at.though the discussion in ames is relatively cryptic,the lesson is clear a judgment for marital dissolution must take into account all community property in a spouse management and control postseparation,and the property disappearance at time of trial does not excuse the court from making the necessary findings on its disposition.
significantly,justice thompson concurrence in the williams case sought to provide the trial court with additional guidance rather than merely remanding the matter with instructions to make findings on the missing funds.unlike the majority,justice thompson viewed the question in williams as one of burden of proof and of producing evidence.williams,supra,d at conc.opn.of thompson.he explained his reasoning as follows in a dispute over disposition of property in a divorce action,the wife has the burden of proof of establishing the existence of community property,and except as she may be aided by presumptions must produce evidence which carries that burden.citations.where,as here,the wife has concededly established the existence of community assets,has established that certain of those assets are missing,and has presented evidence from which it may be inferred that the husband wrongfully disposed of them,she has,in my opinion,met her burden of proof.the issue then shifts to the validity of dispositions of community property by the husband.on that issue,whether dispositions of community property by the husband are proper on the one hand or fraudulent or illegal on the other,i think the better rule would place the burden of producing evidence of the nature of the dispositions upon the husband.id.at.
justice thompson cited the equitable principle of burden based upon superior knowledge of the facts as justification for shifting to the managing spouse the burden of proof on the unexplained disappearance of community funds williams,supra,d at conc.opn.of thompson,citing see see cal d.justice thompson explained it is appropriate to place the burden of producing evidence upon the party who has access to the facts where those facts are inaccessible to the other party to the litigation.citation.t he husband,as manager and controller of the community property,has access to the facts from which it may be determined whether a disposition of community assets by him was proper or improper.conversely,the wife,as the nonmanaging spouse has little if any access to those facts.williams,at.
although no published case has adopted the concurring view in williams,the opinion in valle,supra,d implicitly endorsed the approach justice thompson advocated.in valle,supra,d,the husband appealed the community property division,arguing the trial court improperly charged to him the value of an automobile and mexican realty that he lost in satisfaction of community debts.id.at.in affirming the judgment,the appellate court approved the trial court decision to place upon the husband the burden of proving the proper disposition of these two community assets.
the valle court explained its reasoning as follows the uncontroverted evidence discloses that these items were community property and were in manuel possession at the time of separation.under these circumstances it was incumbent upon manuel to persuade the trial court that the assets in dispute had been lost by reason of discharging community debts citation.the record,however,is consistent with the conclusion,implicit in the court ruling,that manuel fell short of sustaining the burden of proof.although he testified at the trial that the pontiac automobile had been given to his brother in return for a loan and that the real property had been lost due to default in making the monthly payments thereon,he failed to substantiate these allegations in any manner in this situation,the trial court was fully justified in disregarding manuel uncorroborated testimony and in including the assets in question in the community property.valle,supra,d at.
although valle provides support for placing the burden of proof on the managing spouse to show the disposition of missing community assets,it is justice thompson concurrence in williams that best articulates the equitable basis for shifting the burden of proof,namely,the principle of burden based on superior knowledge of the facts williams,supra,d at conc.opn.of thompson.here,alan,as managing spouse,had full access to the facts concerning the disposition of funds in the community accounts,both as to his own withdrawals and expenditures and the purported losses from stock market downturns.elaine had neither personal knowledge nor access to records establishing those facts.alan superior knowledge of the disposition and value of the accounts in his control require that he bear the burden of proof on both issues.
alan objects to this approach,arguing that it erroneously presumes the managing spouse breached a fiduciary duty from the mere fact that assets are missing at time of trial.alan argues a managing spouse should not be charged with missing assets unless there is evidence of mismanagement or misappropriation.but there is no statutory or equitable basis for imposing such a prerequisite on the nonmanaging spouse before shifting the burden of proof to the managing spouse.as a practical matter,alan proposal increases the risk of an unfair property division because a nonmanaging spouse who lacks personal knowledge and records of the disposition of missing community assets would find it extremely difficult to make the initial showing of mismanagement or fraud to shift the burden of proof.no sound policy reason supports the adoption of alan proposed rule indeed,the rule would contradict a managing spouse obligation to provide the full disclosure and accounting owed to a nonmanaging spouse.
as authority for requiring a predicate showing of fraud or mismanagement before shifting the burden of proof,alan cites bono clark th bono.the case does not persuade us to adopt the rule he proposes.
in bono,supra,th,the husband and wife separated in and their dissolution action was still pending in,when the husband died.the wife sued her husband estate for declaratory relief,asserting she was entitled to her share of certain personal property assets of the community that the husband controlled at separation,but were missing from the estate inventory list.the assets consisted of approximately worth of livestock or cows and four horses and a few vehicles.id.at.at trial,the wife argued her husband must have disposed of the assets in violation of his fiduciary duties under the family code.the trial court rejected the wife claim for half of the missing assets,finding she failed to carry her burden of proving decedent breach of fiduciary duty.id.at.
the court of appeal affirmed on the ground that the wife offered no evidence showing her husband had disposed of the items in contravention of his fiduciary duties and t he mere absence of the assets four years after separation is insufficient to raise an inference that decedent disposed of them inappropriately.with respect to the cows and horses,for example,it might be equally reasonable to infer that they had died in the intervening years.bono,supra,th at.
we believe bono has limited applicability here,given its unusual circumstances involving an action against an estate for missing livestock and farm vehicles.the equitable principle of burden based on superior knowledge did not apply because the managing spouse had died,leaving the estate at a disadvantage in explaining what had happened to the livestock and vehicles.thus,bono does not support alan argument that proof of mismanagement or fraud should be a prerequisite to shifting the burden of proof on missing community assets to the managing spouse.
alan other arguments similarly lack merit.first,he argues that allowing elaine to use exhibit as prima facie evidence of the value of the assets that should be charged to him violates the rule that,for purposes of marital property division,assets should be valued as near as practicable to time of trial,citing section,subdivision a.alan argument ignores subdivision b of that statute,which allows the trial court to use an alternate valuation date where fairness requires.see in re marriage of duncan th,court has broad discretion to determine valuation date to accomplish equitable division in re marriage of reuling th,same.
alan argument also ignores the statutory remedies for breach of fiduciary duty in the management of community property set forth in section.that statute mandates that,for purposes of awarding the injured spouse percent of the value of an undisclosed or wrongfully transferred asset or percent,in the event of oppression,fraud,or malice,the trial court must value the assets at the highest of three possible dates the value of the asset shall be determined to be its highest value at the date of the breach of the fiduciary duty,the date of the sale or disposition of the asset,or the date of the award by the court,subd.g.these statutes clearly authorize a trial court to use valuation date that best provides adequate compensation to the injured spouse.
alan reliance on in re marriage of priddis d is likewise fruitless.alan cites priddis for the proposition that the mere passage of time alone between the dates of separation and trial is an insufficient basis for setting the valuation date at a time other than as near as practicable to the time of trial.id.at.the present case,however,involves more than simply the mere passage of time,as was the case in priddis.instead,elaine points to the unexplained postseparation disappearance of substantial community funds as apt justification for an alternate valuation date.
finally,alan argues that shifting to the managing spouse the burden of proof on the disposition of missing assets is overly burdensome in the circumstances of a long separation,such as the year separation involved here,and it conflicts with section admonition that n othing in this section is intended to impose a duty for either spouse to keep detailed books and records of community property transactions,subd.b.the argument lacks merit.
requiring a managing spouse to account for the disposition of missing assets does not entail a detailed accounting.to the contrary,the managing spouse simply must show by competent evidence management of assets in his or her control in accord with the fiduciary obligations set forth in sections and.the trial court undoubtedly will take into account the length of the separation and the attendant difficulties of proof in determining whether the account made is satisfactory.
nevertheless,it remains clear that the duty to account for the disposition of community property exists from separation to final distribution of assets,subd.e,subd.c,subd.a.the duty to account does not dissipate over the course of an unusually long separation.weighing equities,the property in issue belongs to both spouses and the nonmanaging spouse right to an accounting outweighs the burden on the managing spouse to account.
we do not address elaine specific challenges to the trial court finding that alan should not be charged with possession of two other community assets,a payment of for unused vacation and proceeds from a bank of america line of credit.we need not discuss these issues because the trial court erroneous placement of the burden of proof as to the disposition of assets necessitates a complete retrial of the community property issues.
the trial court erred in reimbursing alan from the community property for postseparation payments 
elaine contends the trial court erred in ordering that alan be reimbursed from community property a total of for payments he made for the benefit of the community and elaine after separation.she contends the trial court improperly relied on opinion testimony from alan expert,jack white,which she moved to strike as lacking a proper basis.see.elaine argument has merit.
in the seminal case of in re marriage of epstein cal d epstein,superseded by statute on other grounds,the california supreme court recognized a spouse right to reimbursement from community property for payment of postseparation community expenses from the spouse separate funds.the high court adopted the view expressed in in re marriage of smith d smith,as follows a s a general rule,a spouse who,after separation of the parties,uses earnings or other separate funds to pay preexisting community obligations should be reimbursed therefor out of the community property upon dissolution epstein,at,quoting smith,at.conversely,if the managing spouse uses community money to pay a community obligation,there is no basis for reimbursing the spouse for that payment.see smith,at judgment reimbursing husband for postseparation payments on community debts reversed because there is no showing these payments by husband were made with his separate funds court ordered retrial rather than entry of judgment for wife because evidence suggested some of the funds came from husband separate property.
white opinion lacks a proper basis because white testified that alan was entitled to reimbursement from the community property for postseparation payments without knowing whether alan used his separate funds to make the payments in issue.in fact,alan himself admitted it would be impossible to trace his payments to either a community or separate property source because after the separation he freely commingled community property with separate property in his various checking accounts.
consequently,in his testimony and report,white did not trace individual payments to separate property sources.rather he simply concluded alan was entitled to reimbursement for particular payments based on the nature and purpose of the payment.in other words,if white determined a payment was for the benefit of either the community or elaine,based on the corresponding check register entry and alan explanation,then he concluded alan should be reimbursed.but the purpose of a payment is only part of the equation.as epstein and smith make clear,the source of the postseparation payment is crucial.a spouse is entitled to reimbursement for payment of community obligations only if those payments are made from the spouse separate property.
because there is no evidence alan postseparation payments for the community or for elaine came from separate funds,we must reverse the judgment giving alan a substantial credit for those payments in the community property division.smith,supra,d at.on remand,the trial court must limit any reimbursement to payments that alan proves came from separate property.
we note that alan evidentiary burden on retrial will be difficult because he commingled community and separate property funds.commingling creates a rebuttable presumption that all the funds in the account are community property.t he mere commingling of separate property and community property funds does not alter the status of the respective property interests,provided that the components of the commingled mass can be adequately traced to their separate property and community property sources.citation.but if the separate property and community property interests have been commingled in such a manner that the respective contributions can not be traced and identified,the entire commingled fund will be deemed community property pursuant to the general community property presumption of section.citation.in re marriage of braud th.
of course,a spouse who has commingled community and separate funds can defeat the presumption with evidence,employing traditional family law tracing methods,such as direct tracing or the family expense method of tracing.see in re marriage of mix cal d,in re marriage of cochran th.thus,to obtain reimbursement for any postseparation payments made from his commingled accounts,alan should employ one of these tracing methods.
tracing undoubtedly will raise additional
