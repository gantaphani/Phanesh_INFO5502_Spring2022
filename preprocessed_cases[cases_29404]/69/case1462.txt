this appeal requires that we engage in an exercise of statutory interpretation.the statute at issue is the driver privacy protection act,et.dppa.having considered the plain text of the statute,we conclude that a plaintiff need not prove actual damages to recover liquidated damages for a violation of the dppa.since the district court reached a contrary conclusion,we reverse and remand.
background 
in,congress enacted the dppa to limit the release of an individual personal information contained in his driver license record to those who had a legitimate and lawful need for the information.originally,the dppa implemented an procedure for driver license information disclosed for marketing purposes.under the procedure,a state could release or sell an individual driver license information without the individual permission so long as the individual was given an opportunity to opt out by requesting that the information not be released.on october,congress amended the dppa to require an procedure.the effective date of this amendment was june.as a result of this amendment,a state department of motor vehicles can not disclose an individual driver license information without express permission from the individual about whom the information pertains.
states immediately passed legislation to ensure compliance with this amendment to the dppa.florida was the only state that did not immediately comply.instead,florida waited until may,to amend its public records statute to comply with the dppa.see.stat.aa.sess.law west.
fidelity is a publicly owned and locally operated savings bank.from june,to june,on a monthly basis,fidelity purchased from the state of florida department of highway safety and motor vehicles florida dmv the names and addresses of individuals who had registered new motor vehicles or used motor vehicles less than three years old within the preceding month in palm beach,martin,and broward counties.fidelity paid the florida dmv one cent for each name and address provided.the florida dmv then forwarded the information electronically to a mass mailing service provider retained by fidelity.the mass mailing service provider mailed the solicitations to individuals to refinance their motor vehicle loans.over the course of the three years at issue,fidelity paid the state of florida approximately for the names of approximately individuals.
on july,james kehoe,on behalf of himself and others similarly situated,filed this putative class action.the gravamen of kehoe complaint is that fidelity purchased his personal information from the florida dmv without his consent.at the conclusion of his complaint,kehoe requested the following relief liquidated damages in the amount of for each instance in which fidelity obtained or used personal information concerning kehoe and members of the class punitive damages should the court find that fidelity acted in willful or reckless disregard of the dppa attorney fees and costs the destruction of any personal information unlawfully obtained from the florida dmv and such other relief as the court deems appropriate.
fidelity responded to kehoe complaint by filing a motion to dismiss the complaint or,alternatively,enter summary judgment in favor of fidelity.the district court summarily denied fidelity motion to dismiss the complaint and deferred ruling on the summary judgment motion until after the completion of discovery.after discovery,fidelity renewed its motion for summary judgment.the district court concluded that a plaintiff must prove some measure of actual damages to maintain a claim under the dppa.because kehoe had not asserted that he incurred any actual damages,the district court granted summary judgment in fidelity favor and denied kehoe motion for class certification as moot.
on appeal,kehoe argues that the district court erred in holding that the dppa requires proof of actual damages prior to the award of liquidated damages.additionally,kehoe argues that the district court erred in granting summary judgment without considering his requests for class certification and injunctive relief 
ii.standard of review 
we review the district court grant of summary judgment de novo,applying the same legal standards as the district court.see hilburn murata elecs,cir.the interpretation of a statute is a question of law subject to de novo review.directv,brown,cir.
iii.discussion 
b,the dppa remedies provision 
the main issue in this case is whether a plaintiff must prove actual damages before he may recover a liquidated damages award under the dppa.this is an issue of first impression for our circuit.in reaching the conclusion that kehoe could not maintain a claim for liquidated damages under b without proving that he had suffered actual damages,the district court relied upon what it termed the sum of several legal principles.see kehoe fidelity federal bank trust,wl,at.june.considering the relevant text of the dppa as buttressed by instructive dicta in doe chao,d,we reach the opposite conclusion.a plaintiff need not prove a measure of actual damages to recover liquidated damages under the dppa,and certainly need not prove actual damages to recover the other types of remedies listed in b 
textual analysis of the dppa 
in construing a statute we must begin,and often should end as well,with the language of the statute itself because we presume that congress said what it meant and meant what it said.harry marchant,cir en banc internal quotations and citations omitted.w e need not resort to extrinsic evidence,such as legislative history,to discern a statute meaning if the statute meaning is unambiguous.in re paschen,cir.any ambiguity in the statutory language must result from the common usage of that language,not from the parties dueling characterizations of what congress really meant.cbs primetime joint venture,cir.
the sections of the dppa that are relevant to our analysis are and.section states,in pertinent part a procurement for unlawful shall be unlawful for any person knowingly to obtain or disclose personal information,from a motor vehicle record,for any use not permitted under section b of this title.a.fidelity does not dispute that a violation of the dppa purchased and used kehoe personal information for a purpose that is not permitted under b.since a violation occurred,kehoe can bring this action pursuant to.section,states,in its entirety 
civil action 
a cause of person who knowingly obtains,discloses or uses personal information,from a motor vehicle record,for a purpose not permitted under this chapter et shall be liable to the individual to whom the information pertains,who may bring a civil action in a united states district court.
b court may award 
actual damages,but not less than liquidated damages in the amount of 
punitive damages upon proof of willful or reckless disregard of the law 
reasonable attorney fees and other litigation costs reasonably incurred and 
such other preliminary and equitable relief as the court determines to be appropriate.
specifically,at issue is the interpretation of b of.fidelity and the district court interpret the language in b to mean that proving actual damages is a condition precedent to receiving liquidated damages in the amount of.kehoe,however,interprets b as permitting a minimum damages award of regardless of whether a plaintiff suffered any actual damages.in other words,kehoe reads b in the he may receive the greater of his actual damages or.
at the heart of this case is a disagreement over what effect the phrase but not less than and the comma preceding that phrase has on kehoe ability to recover liquidated damages.specifically,at issue is whether the clause after the comma is dependent upon the proof of actual damages.the placement of the comma and but not less than does not necessarily mean that the second clause is dependent upon proof of the first clause.accord pichler unite,holding that pursuant to b,a plaintiff need not prove actual damages to be awarded liquidated damages there is no language in b that confines liquidated damages to people who suffered actual damages.for example,if b instead said liquidated damages in the amount of,but not less than actual damages,
