after the collapse of enron corporation,the attorney general concluded wholesale energy companies,including powerex corporation,had engaged in schemes damaging california energy consumers.he sued powerex,alleging violations of the unfair competition law bus,et,ucl and the california commodity law of,et,ccl seeking damages,penalties and injunctive relief.
the trial court sustained powerex demurrer without leave to amend on the ground the claims were barred by the federal power act et,fpa which grants the federal energy regulatory commission ferc exclusive jurisdiction over the wholesale energy market.
several ninth circuit decisions arising out of the energy crisis have concluded that claims similar to the attorney general are barred by the fpa,specifically by implied preemption field and conflict preemption,and by the filed rate doctrine.field preemption exists when a federal scheme is comprehensive,leaving no room for state regulation conflict preemption exists when state regulation would conflict with federal regulation the filed rate doctrine bars claims which assume rates different from a federal tariff.see public utility dynegy power marketing cir snohomish public,grays harbor,wa idacorp cir grays harbor california ex rel.lockyer dynegy,cir dynegy.
we conclude the filed rate doctrine bars all of the attorney general monetary and injunctive claims.further,no injunction is warranted because there is no threat that the misconduct will continue.because the attorney general does not explain how his complaint might be amended,we shall affirm.
standard of review 
because this case arises on demurrer,for purposes of this appeal we must accept as true the allegations in the complaint.we accept the facts alleged in the complaint and matters judicially noticeable,but not rhetoric or conclusions of law.we consider de novo whether the complaint states a viable claim for relief.schifando city of los angeles cal th,d,faulkner cal.toll bridge authority cal d.
background 
a.the complaint 
the california independent system operator iso is a corporation established through california deregulation legislation.the iso is responsible for operating the transmission grid serving most of california.the area encompassing this transmission grid is known as the iso control area.
powerex sells wholesale energy within the iso control area.it engaged in fraudulent trading or gaming schemes which used false and misleading information.
we quote from a decision summarizing background facts which are also alleged in the complaint 
before,ferc reviewed electricity rates that were.the primary factor in setting the rate was the cost of producing and transmitting the electricity.power suppliers proposed rates by adding up their costs and accounting for an expected rate of return.ferc reviewed and approved tariffs that contained detailed breakdowns of costs and specified rates of return 
in,california changed this system of setting wholesale electricity rates to a system,where the rate was determined in a structured market.the california legislature passed assembly bill,cal.pub.et,in an effort to reduce the price of electricity by replacing rate regulation with rates that were determined by competitive forces.citations.the legislation created two entities to operate markets and otherwise manage the sale of electricity the california power exchange px and the iso.these entities were subject to ferc regulation.citation.
the px operated a market for the purchase and sale of electricity in the and markets.the price in these markets was set by evaluating bids submitted by market participants.a seller could submit a series of bids that consisted of pairs representing offers to sell units at each,but units if the price is each.similarly,a buyer could submit a series of bids that consisted of pairs representing offers to buy.the px would then establish aggregate supply and demand curves and set the market clearing price at the intersection of the two curves.then every exchange would take place at the market clearing price,even though some buyers had been willing to pay more and some sellers had been willing to sell for less.
the iso managed the transmission network,managing imbalances between supply and demand and maintaining the reliability of the transmission grid.as part of these responsibilities,it operated a or spot market used to balance supply and demand at precise points in time.for example,if customer demand for a particular hour was not met,then the iso was required to procure power on the spot market to maintain the stability of the grid.in the markets the px and iso managed,rates for wholesale electricity rose dramatically during and.this caused consumer utilities to pay record high prices to traders and generators.snohomish,supra,at see also dynegy,supra,at united states reliant energy d.
in may the price of wholesale power rose sharply,buyers incurred massive losses,and the two largest utilities,southern california edison and pacific gas electric,defaulted on payments to the px and iso by march the px had declared bankruptcy.meanwhile,governor gray davis had declared an emergency and authorized the state,through the california department of water resources to purchase electricity,which it did to the tune of billion.these costs were passed on to california consumers.
beginning in powerex had employed fraudulent schemes to justify congestive relief payments for taking actions that did not relieve any congestion,to receive payment for excess generation through the submission of false schedules,and to circumvent the iso price cap by falsely representing the source of the energy.these schemes came to light in connection with the collapse of enron and are widely known as the enron trading strategies but were in fact employed by several market participants,including powerex.
these schemes acquired colorful names,such as death star,get shorty,fat boy and ricochet.the details of each scheme are not important,but we will describe two for illustration.
in ricochet,powerex exploited an iso rule which allowed payments above the price cap for power generated outside the state in times of shortage.powerex would export power outside the iso area,then import it back to california,representing it as power and exempt from the price cap even though no energy ever left or the state.
in death star,powerex submitted false energy schedules in one schedule,energy is imported into the iso control area through a transmission interface.this energy is scheduled to flow in a direction opposite to congestion and is then exported over another transmission interface.the counterflow created by this schedule is supposed to relieve congestion,and the market participant receives a congestion relief payment.however,in a second schedule,the same energy is then circled back to the iso control area along transmission lines outside of the iso system as a result no congestion is relieved because no energy is put onto or taken off of the iso grid.
the attorney general alleged these and similar schemes were unlawful and unfair business practices proscribed by the ucl and alleged that they represented unlawful artifices and false statements in violation of the ccl.in particular the attorney general alleged powerex violated both laws by 
a willfully and fraudulently offering to sell ancillary services to the iso without having any physical resources backing up the sale,and collecting payment for ancillary services it did not provide and had no intention of providing 
b willfully and fraudulently misrepresenting sales of power to iso as imports,and collecting payment for sales at prices above the price cap,when in fact the power never left or california 
c willfully and fraudulently overstating the amount of load it expected to serve,and thereby collecting payment for the excess generation at the market clearing price 
d willfully and fraudulently scheduling energy in the opposite direction of congestion to a point outside the iso control area without having any intention of delivering the power,collecting payment for purportedly relieving congestion,and then cutting the schedule before putting any energy on the grid 
e willfully and fraudulently scheduling power in the opposite direction of congestion without having any intention of delivering the power,and collecting payment for purportedly relieving congestion,when in fact no congestion was relieved.
californians were subjected to the risks and dangers of power supply interruptions,rolling blackouts and other adverse consequences.the complaint sought an injunction,restitution,disgorgement,civil penalties and damages.
federal court 
powerex removed the case to federal court,alleging the complaint raised questions about violations of the fpa,which fell within the exclusive jurisdiction of federal courts.see.powerex also claimed it was an arm of the canadian government,interposing the foreign sovereign immunities act of et,fsia.the district court remanded the case.the ninth circuit dismissed powerex appeal.powerex petitioned for a writ of certiorari on the fsia claim.powerex california.the united states supreme court recently held in related litigation that a statutory bar on appeals from remand orders applied in fsia cases.powerex reliant energy services,d.the court then denied powerex petition in the federal portion of this case.powerex california,dkt,cert.den.june.
c.the demurrer in state court 
powerex demurred,claiming preemption and the filed rate doctrine barred the attorney general claims.the parties submitted lengthy supporting and opposing papers.
the trial court sustained the demurrer,finding it could not grant any remedy that would assume a rate different from that determined by ferc.the filed rate doctrine and federal preemption apply to market based rates at issue here.
the attorney general timely appealed.
discussion 
the attorney general acknowledges ferc authority over wholesale energy rates but states this action at best,has only a tenuous,remote,or peripheral effect on rates,and therefore it would not impinge on ferc jurisdiction.he also asserts he does not allege unreasonable electricity rates or seek a determination of the reasonableness of rates charged by powerex.we disagree with these characterizations.
the gist of the complaint is that had powerex acted fairly the amount charged for wholesale energy would have been less.the propriety of what was charged falls within ferc bailiwick.not only did ferc issue tariffs used by powerex to charge or overcharge the iso,ferc is adjudicating refunds based on its findings of what would have been just and reasonable,amending the tariffs.to impose further amounts would in effect raise those adjusted tariffs beyond what ferc finds is appropriate.
we will first summarize ninth circuit cases applying the filed rate doctrine in the context of the fpa,and then apply the doctrine to the attorney general claims in this case.
i.the filed rate doctrine 
in transmission agency,north.cal.sierra pacific cir tanc,tanc had a deal with the bonneville power administration and others collectively,bpa which in part called for tanc to build an intertie to move energy between california and oregon.bpa then made a deal with sierra pacific to build another intertie.tanc protested to ferc,claiming the new intertie would reduce the energy carried by its intertie.ferc approved the new intertie,but began hearings on the issue.before those hearings were over tanc sued bpa and others,alleging breach of contract and related theories.id.at.the court concluded some of tanc claims were preempted by the fpa and others were barred by the filed rate doctrine,which it viewed as a species of preemption 
t he filed rate doctrine provides that state law,and some federal law antitrust law,may not be used to invalidate a filed rate nor to assume a rate would be charged other than the rate adopted by the federal agency in question t he supreme court has extended the doctrine to the fpa and to electricity rates.
in utilities northwestern public service,the supreme court held that a plaintiff in a case involving electricity rates set by the federal power commission the precursor to ferc could claim no rate as a legal right that is other than the filed rate,whether fixed or merely accepted by the commission,and not even a court can authorize commerce in the commodity on other terms.the court has explained that this rule is without exception congress meant to draw a bright line easily ascertained,between state and federal jurisdiction this was done in the fpa by making federal power commission jurisdiction plenary and extending it to all wholesale sales in interstate commerce except those which congress has made explicitly subject to regulation by the states.citations.
as further developed,the filed rate doctrine has prohibited not just a state court or a federal court applying state law from setting a rate different from that chosen by ferc,but also from assuming a hypothetical rate different from that actually set by ferc.in arkansas louisiana gas hall.d,the court stated 
it would undermine the congressional scheme of uniform regulation of rate regulation to allow a state court to award as damages a rate never filed with the commission and thus never found to be reasonable within the meaning of the natural gas act.following that course would permit state courts to grant regulated sellers greater relief than they could obtain from the commission itself.
the court has also expanded the reach of the filed rate doctrine beyond just rates.in nantahala power light thornburg.d,the supreme court held that the filed rate doctrine is not limited to rates per se.at.instead,any allocation of power that directly affects rates is protected by the filed rate doctrine.id.at.thus,following nantahala power,we recognized that an allocation of natural gas is covered by the filed rate doctrine,just as if the allocation had been a decision on rates.
in the present case,the common theme in tanc claims against the utility company defendants for breach of contract,intentional interference with a contractual relationship,and intentional interference with a prospective economic advantage is the contention that tanc is,or would have been,entitled to mw of transfer capability 
for a district or state court to conclude that under state contract law the northwest parties breached the agreements by failing to increase the capacity of the northwest ac intertie to mw,the court would have to hold that under state contract law tanc was entitled to mw of transfer capacity.yet,state law can no more assume how ferc would allocate access to interstate transmission capacity than it can assume how ferc would set rates although this resolution may leave tanc state law claims unredressed,such a circumstance is not an unlikely result of preemption.at.
tanc thus establishes that claims which depend on assumptions contrary to rates or allocations approved by ferc are barred by the filed rate doctrine.the fact this may leave claims unredressed is no basis to depart from the doctrine.
dynegy,supra,arose from the energy crisis,and the attorney general was the plaintiff.the gist was that producers fraudulently sold energy on the spot market from reserve capacity that they had contracted to hold in reserve according to this theory,the companies unauthorized sale of ancillary services energy threatened the stability of the grid system and left residents of the state vulnerable to blackouts and other disruptions.id.at.the complaint sought injunctions,restitution,disgorgement,and civil penalties against multiple companies for reserve generation capacity in violation of the ucl.id.at.after holding the claims barred by preemption the court found they were also barred by the filed rate doctrine 
under the filed rate doctrine,the terms of the filed tariff are considered to be the law and to therefore conclusively and exclusively enumerate the rights and liabilities of the contracting parties.citations.as a result,the filed rate doctrine bars all and attempt to challenge the terms of a tariff that a federal agency has reviewed and filed.citations.thus,to the extent that california argues that the companies owe obligations beyond those set out in the filed tariffs such claim is also barred by the filed rate doctrine.citation.
t he filed rate doctrine purpose is to ensure that the filed rates are the exclusive source of the terms and conditions by which the regulated entity provides the services covered by the tariff.citation.to the extent that california is seeking to enforce the penalty provisions of the tariff,or to have them expanded,fn.this conflicts with the filed rate doctrine and the exclusive authority conferred to ferc to enforce its tariff.at,italics added.
in the footnote the court observed 
while the state concedes that the tariff prohibits of reserve capacity,it contends that restitution and disgorgement of the companies gains does not conflict with the filed tariff.but the tariff itself specifies the penalties to which companies are subject for violating their reserve capacity commitments.at,fn.
thus,dynegy held that the attorney general may not base ucl claims on violations of filed tariffs,inasmuch as ferc oversees such violations 
provides that upon a determination by ferc that any rate,charge,or classification,demanded,observed,charged,or collected by any public utility for any transmission or sale subject to the jurisdiction of the commission,or that any rule,regulation,practice,or contract affecting such rate,charge,or classification is unjust,unreasonable,unduly discriminatory or preferential,the commission shall determine the just and reasonable rate,charge,classification,rule,regulation,practice,or contract to be thereafter observed and in force,and shall fix the same by order.id.at,fn.
grays harbor 
grays harbor,supra,also dealt with claims arising out of the energy crisis.grays harbor contracted to buy power at a price to be set by the market.it later sued,seeking contract rescission or reformation.in essence,the complaint alleges that the market rate of per megawatt hour price was agreed to only because grays harbor believed that the rate was based on a properly functioning market,when in fact the price resulted from a dysfunctional,manipulated market.id.at.grays harbor also alleged unjust enrichment,to the extent it paid over what it would have paid in a fair market.after the case was removed the district court dismissed it because the relief sought would require the court to determine a fair price.id.at.
after finding field and conflict preemption barred the complaint grays harbor addressed the filed rate doctrine 
the relief sought by grays harbor would require the court to set damages by assuming a hypothetical rate,the fair value,in violation of the filed rate doctrine.citing tanc,supra,at.
grays harbor describes at length the reasons why the filed rate doctrine should not apply here,but its arguments all center on the nature of the rates at issue in this case.grays harbor contends that the per megawatt hour that was charged was not filed with ferc and approved by ferc before it was charged.in short,according to grays harbor,ferc simply did not set any rates.grays harbor contends that to apply the filed rate doctrine to rates that have not been filed with ferc would be an unwise and unprecedented expansion of the doctrine.
but,as described above,the rate regime established by ferc continues ferc oversight of the rates charged.ferc only permits power sales at rates after scrutinizing whether the seller and its affiliates do not have,or have adequately mitigated,market power in generation and transmission and can not erect other barriers to entry.citation.according to ferc,these conditions assure that the rates charged comply with the fpa requirement that rates be just and reasonable.citations.this oversight is ongoing,in this case requiring idaho power company to provide notice of any change in status,to file an updated market analysis every three years,and to file various sales agreements and transaction summaries.citation.
further,ferc contends that such procedures effectively constitute review of rates prior to their implementation.citation.ferc has clearly stated its belief that these procedures satisfy the filed rate doctrine for rates citations.grays harbor,on the other hand,provides no persuasive authority that the filed rate doctrine does not apply to rates.citation.
therefore,while rates may not have historically been the type of rate envisioned by the filed rate doctrine,we conclude that they do not fall outside of the purview of the doctrine.therefore,the relief sought by grays harbor is barred under the filed rate doctrine.at.
the majority went on to conclude that grays harbor should have been given leave to amend,stating,a complaint that merely seeks declaratory relief as to contract formation issues would not necessarily intrude upon the jurisdiction of ferc.at.although the court cautioned that an amended complaint must not require the district court to make a determination as to what the fair rate would have been id.at,the court did not explain how this would be possible,inasmuch as the claimed mistake was that grays harbor did not know the market price it paid resulted from a dysfunctional,manipulated market.id.at.
because the claimed mistake hinged on an unfair price,leave to amend should have been denied,as judge callahan explained in her separate opinion.grays harbor,supra,at conc.dis.opn.of callahan.
in snohomish,supra,the court discussed preemption and the filed rate doctrine together.snohomish sued wholesale energy sellers based on california state antitrust and consumer protection laws.snohomish charges that the defendants manipulated the market and restricted electricity supplies in order to cause artificially high prices in the market from which snohomish purchased power.id.at.snohomish upheld rates 
under the system at issue here,ferc has waived many of the requirements that applied under the system.for example the utilities do not provide ferc with detailed schedules of their costs.instead,the price of wholesale electricity is determined in the markets operated by the px and the iso.
ferc continued to oversee wholesale electricity rates,however,by reviewing and approving a variety of documents filed by the defendants,the px,and the iso.first,each seller was to file a umbrella tariff,which preauthorizes the seller to engage in sales and puts the public on notice that the seller may do so.citation.ferc approved these tariffs only upon a showing that the seller lacked or had mitigated its market power 
second,ferc required each seller to file quarterly reports,which contained certain required information including the minimum and maximum rate charged and the total amount of power delivered during the quarter.ferc has found this requirement necessary to ensure that rates will be on file as required by fpa c,c,to allow ferc to evaluate the reasonableness of the charges as required by fpa a,a,and to allow ferc to continually monitor the seller ability to exercise market power.citation.
third,ferc reviewed and approved detailed tariffs filed by the px and the iso,which described in detail how the markets operated by each entity would function.many of the rules governing market operations were originally submitted by the px and the iso for information purposes only,but ferc required that these protocols be filed with and approved by the commission as part of the px and iso tariffs.citation.each participant in the px and the iso markets was required to sign an agreement acknowledging that the tariff filed by either the px or the iso would govern all transactions in that market.
after the energy crisis unfolded,ferc ordered wholesalers to disgorge profits that resulted from the kinds of practices snohomish has alleged here.ferc found that many of these practices were prohibited by the protocols that were filed as part of the px and iso tariffs.citation.
this court has rejected snohomish argument that the doctrines at issue do not apply when rates are involved.grays harbor,we concluded that the district court was precluded from giving grays harbor the relief it sought because,to award that relief,the district court would have had to determine a fair price.id.at.we held that this would interfere with ferc exclusive jurisdiction to set wholesale rates and was therefore barred by field preemption,conflict preemption,and the f
