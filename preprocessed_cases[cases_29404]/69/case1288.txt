the santa clara county democratic central committee and its chair,steven preminger,are plaintiffs in this action.they challenge the department of veterans affairs va exclusion of preminger and others from va premises when they tried to register resident veterans to vote.plaintiffs claim that the va regulation used to justify their expulsion,which prohibits partisan activities on va premises,violates the first amendment.the district court denied plaintiffs request for a preliminary injunction against defendants,the department of veterans affairs and several of its employees.we hold that the district court did not abuse its discretion in concluding that plaintiffs failed to demonstrate probable success on the merits of their claim and,therefore,affirm the denial of a preliminary injunction.
factual and procedural background 
in april,about six months before the november presidential election,preminger and his lawyer,scott rafferty,along with another california resident,visited the va menlo park campus with the intent to register voters.the campus provides care for elderly,homeless,disabled,and psychologically impaired veterans.the veterans are housed in numerous buildings,including building,which provides nursing home care for up to residents.
the april visit was not rafferty first.on earlier occasions,he had tried to register voters but had been denied access by va employees.rafferty apparently had been disruptive and confrontational with the va staff when he was told that he could not register voters on the premises.after his first attempt was rebuffed,rafferty contacted various va officials and sought their advance permission to register voters at the campus.eventually,the director of the palo alto health care system,which oversees the campus,granted rafferty permission to register voters on the campus provided that his actions did not interrupt patient care and that the unit nursing manager agreed.
despite this advance permission,when preminger and rafferty entered building in april,a va employee recognized rafferty and told the group to leave.the employee then called the va police,who briefly stopped the men in the parking lot.
after the april incident,plaintiffs filed this action challenging the va refusal to allow them to register voters on the campus.plaintiffs sought a preliminary injunction to prohibit the va from enforcing a,the va regulation that bans partisan activity on va premises conditioning the right to visit va premises on a person expressed or assumed political affiliation or conduct requiring prior authorization for political expression by visitors and interfering with the receipt of political contributions on va grounds after a hearing,the district court denied plaintiffs motion.the court analyzed plaintiffs claim as an challenge to the regulation,rather than a facial one,and held that rafferty alleged inappropriate conduct justified plaintiffs exclusion from the campus.
plaintiffs timely appeal the denial of their motion for a preliminary injunction.

discussion 
jurisdiction 
before we address the merits of plaintiffs claim,we must first consider a threshold jurisdictional issue.plaintiffs mount both a facial and an first amendment challenge to va regulation a which bans partisan activity.the district court held that,although it retained jurisdiction to review an challenge to a,it lacked jurisdiction to review a facial challenge to the regulation.we agree.
generally,a federal court may review a facial challenge to a regulation promulgated by an agency under its broad jurisdiction.see providing for judicial review of agency proceedings in any court of competent jurisdiction in the absence of another congressionally mandated review process.but when congress provides for a special statutory review proceeding in one specific court,challenges to the administrative action must take place in the designated forum.id.we face just such a situation because congress has designated a judicial review path for challenges to va regulations under 
section gives the federal circuit exclusive jurisdiction to review challenges to most actions by the secretary of veterans affairs.in particular,applies to actions that require publication in the federal register,such as rules of procedure,substantive rules of general applicability,statements of general policy,and amendments,revisions,or repeals to those actions,under a and agency rulemaking,under.thus,congress explicitly has provided for judicial review of direct challenges to va rules and regulations only in the federal circuit.see chinnock turnage,cir under,va rulemaking is subject to judicial review only in the federal circuit.hall dep t veterans affairs,cir per curiam holding that a direct facial constitutional attack on a va regulation must be pursued in the federal circuit.the va regulation at issue here,was added as an amendment to an already existing rule,and it was published in the federal register as required by a e.see fed.reg,july,these regulation amendments clarify and update the rules governing the standards of conduct on property under the charge and control of the va.accordingly,any direct challenge to its validity must be brought in the federal circuit.
although we are statutorily barred from reviewing a facial challenge to a va regulation,we retain jurisdiction to review an challenge.the application of a rule that is deemed to be or that the federal circuit has held to be valid to a particular party or individual is neither rulemaking nor an action by the secretary that requires notice and publication.see griffin dep t of veterans affairs,cir griffin ii reviewing the constitutionality of va regulation as applied to the parties.
in fact,the fourth circuit has reviewed a similar first amendment challenge to the same regulation at issue here,a.in griffin dep t of veterans affairs,d,griffin i,the plaintiff filed a motion for a preliminary injunction to stop the va from prohibiting him,under a,from displaying a confederate flag at a cemetery.the district court held that it lacked jurisdiction to review a facial challenge to the regulation.griffin i,d at.the court did,however,exercise jurisdiction over the plaintiff challenge.id.at.on review,the fourth circuit did not disturb the district court holding that it lacked jurisdiction to hear a facial challenge,and went on to analyze the va regulation application to the plaintiff.griffin ii,at.thereafter,the plaintiff brought suit in the federal circuit to challenge the constitutionality of the regulation on its face.griffin sec y of veterans affairs,griffin iii.thus,plaintiffs have available judicial avenues in which to bring both and facial challenges to va regulations.
plaintiffs argue that,even if the district court lacked jurisdiction to review a facial challenge to,it nonetheless erred by failing to transfer that portion of the case to the federal circuit under.section requires a court that is without jurisdiction to hear a case to transfer that case to the correct forum if the interests of justice so demand we review for abuse of discretion the court decision not to transfer the case.taylor soc.sec,cir.
the federal circuit already has reviewed a facial challenge to and has held that the regulation is not unconstitutional on its face.griffin iii,at.moreover,plaintiffs could have followed the same procedure as the plaintiff in griffin,by asking that the va waive or amend a.if such a request had been made and denied,plaintiffs could have filed a separate action in the federal circuit to challenge the validity of the regulation.see griffin iii,at noting that the court had jurisdiction to review a facial challenge to the regulation because the va refusal to waive or amend a was a final agency action fed.cir.rule a providing for review of agency action under within days of a denial of a request for amendment or waiver of a rule or regulation.because the issue already has been addressed by the federal circuit and because plaintiffs could have brought an action themselves in the correct forum,the district court did not abuse its discretion by declining to transfer the case.see hill air force,per curiam noting that,in deciding whether to grant or deny a motion to transfer,a court should consider timeliness concerns for bringing suit in the alternate forum and whether certain claims could still be heard in the original forum.
accordingly,we now turn to the merits of plaintiffs challenge to.
preliminary injunction standards 
to prevail on their motion for a preliminary injunction,plaintiffs must demonstrate either a combination of probable success on the merits and the possibility of irreparable harm or that serious questions are raised and the balance of hardships tips in their favor.a m records,napster,cir.both of those approaches require us to assess the potential merits of the parties positions and the harm or hardship that they will face from a grant or denial of the preliminary injunction.sammartano,at.finally,we review whether the public interest will be advanced by granting preliminary relief.overstreet united of carpenters joiners,local union,cir.
building is a nonpublic forum 
plaintiffs contend that va regulation violates their first amendment right to free expression on government property.in order to assess their claim,we first must identify the nature of the forum,because the extent to which the government may limit access depends on whether the forum is public or nonpublic.cornelius naacp legal def.educ.fund,d.
public property,depending on its character,falls within one of three main categories for purposes of first amendment analysis.public fora are places,such as streets and parks,that have traditionally been devoted to expressive activity.perry educ.perry local educators,d.restrictions in public fora are justified only if they serve a compelling state interest that is narrowly tailored to the desired end.id.designated public fora are areas that the government affirmatively has opened to expressive activity,and exclusion from these fora must also satisfy strict scrutiny.id.at.nonpublic fora,areas that have not traditionally or explicitly been open to expressive activity,are subject to a more lenient standard.id.at.restrictions in nonpublic fora need only be reasonable and not an effort to suppress expression merely because public officials oppose the speaker view.id.
with that background,we must classify building plaintiffs contend that building is a designated public forum because the va itself characterizes the lobby and entrance ways as public and because the building acts as a home for veterans.
in a written guideline regarding partisan activity,the va has characterized the grounds,entrances,and lobbies of va premises as public areas.campaigning and other partisan political activities on va premises guidelines.but the va reference to public areas does not automatically transform those spaces into designated public fora for first amendment purposes.see cornelius,at.noting that,to create a designated public forum,the government must have acted intentionally to open up the space for public discourse.moreover,the mere fact that veterans reside in building does not render it a public is the government purpose,not the forum users,that informs the characterization of a forum.designated public fora are not created haphazardly,and the supreme court has found them to exist only in places where the government has expressly dedicated the property for expressive conduct.see,widmar vincent,d university meeting facilities se promotions,conrad,d municipal auditoriums.the purpose of building is not to facilitate public discourse to the contrary,the va has established the facility to provide for veterans who require nursing care.any meetings between those veterans and their visitors are ancillary to the facility primary aim of providing nursing services to veterans.consequently,we conclude that building is a nonpublic forum.
application of the regulation was reasonable and viewpoint neutral 
the va justified its exclusion of plaintiffs under a.that regulation prohibits certain expressive activity on va premises,specifically,partisan activities,which include commentary or actions in support of,or in opposition to,or attempt s to influence,any current policy of the government of the united states,or any private group,association,or enterprise.for purposes of briefing this appeal,plaintiffs have assumed that their voter registration effort was a partisan activity.the va restriction of plaintiffs expressive conduct in building,a nonpublic forum,does not violate the constitution as long as it is reasonable in light of the purpose served by the forum and viewpoint neutral.cornelius,at.
reasonableness 
the reasonableness inquiry requires us to examine the va actions in the light of the purpose of the forum and all the surrounding circumstances.id.at.the va must have more than a rational basis for its actions the restriction must reasonably fulfill a legitimate need.sammartano,at.yet,in a nonpublic forum,the restriction need not constitute the least restrictive alternative available.swarner united states,cir.
the va gave several reasons for excluding plaintiffs in light of building purpose as a nursing home.most persuasively,the va argued that it excluded plaintiffs in order to prevent the appearance of partisan affiliation.see mcconnell fed.election comm n,d noting that voter registration confers significant benefits on political candidates.in a nonpublic forum,the government may restrict expressive activity so as to avoid the perception that it favors one political group over another.see cornelius,at.a voiding the appearance of political favoritism is a valid justification for limiting speech in a forum.monterey county democratic cent.comm.united states postal,cir holding that the postal service desire to remain free from the appearance of involvement in the political process is a reasonable justification for regulating expressive activity in a nonpublic forum.the va cares for a large number of veterans,some of whom live permanently on va premises.in an effort to avoid alienating any of the veterans who are receiving treatment at its facilities,the va reasonably could conclude that limiting the appearance of partisan involvement is critical to its ability to carry out its mission.because the va has presented one clearly reasonable rationale for its decision to exclude plaintiffs,we need not address the many other reasons in support of its position.
viewpoint neutrality 
even if the application of to plaintiffs is reasonable,the va must still show that it excluded plaintiffs for reasons.the va allows other groups that it classifies as example,the league of women register voters on va premises.plaintiffs assert that the va exclusion of their voter registration effort was motivated by the nature of the message rather than the limitations of the forum or a specific risk within that forum,sammartano,at,because both plaintiffs and the nonpartisan groups are engaging in partisan activity by attempting to register voters.the va counters that its actions are because it excludes all political parties from registering voters on the campus.
the contours of viewpoint neutrality analysis are often difficult to discern.see id.at we freely admit that the supreme court concept of viewpoint neutrality in first amendment jurisprudence has not been easy to understand.in this instance though,we are aided by applicable precedents from both the supreme court and this circuit.
the supreme court has held that,in a nonpublic forum,the government has the right to make distinctions in access on the basis of subject matter and speaker identity.perry educ,at.id.at.noting that a school board decision to limit unio
