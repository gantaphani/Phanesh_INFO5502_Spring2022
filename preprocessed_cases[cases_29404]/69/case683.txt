philip ray workman is scheduled to be executed by the state of tennessee on may,at,for the murder of lieutenant ronald oliver.on may,workman filed a motion for a temporary restraining order in federal district court,claiming that the state protocol for implementing the death penalty violates the eighth and fourteenth amendment,and later that day the court granted the motion.still later that same day,the governor of tennessee and the other defendants filed an appeal from that order.early today,may,the governor and others filed a motion in this court to vacate the district court order.a little later this morning,workman filed a brief in response.
this dispute arises from a capital sentence,and the district court order,if upheld,would be workman sixth stay of an execution date set by the state over the last seven years.at no point until last friday,may,did workman challenge the state method of execution,even though the components of the procedure that workman challenges today have been in existence in the main since.he thus can not escape the supreme court and this court limitations on dilatory challenges to an execution procedure.
workman prospects for success on the merits also are dim.the supreme court has never invalidated a state chosen method of execution.no court has invalidated the protocol used by tennessee and other jurisdictions.several state and federal courts have upheld this same protocol including the tennessee supreme court in.our court vacated a similar stay decision in with respect to a similar challenge and permitted the state to execute the inmate under the protocol.notwithstanding the decision of the tennessee supreme court in and the decision of this court in,the state undertook an effort in to review and improve the procedure.workman acknowledges that the new procedure is only slightly different from the old procedure,and he offers no explanation how tennessee has done anything more than make the new procedure less prone to implementation errors.everything,indeed,the state has done in reviewing and revising the procedure shows that it is trying to prevent workman from suffering any pain during his execution,not that it is trying or willing to allow a procedure that imposes unnecessary and wanton pain.for these reasons and those elaborated below,we vacate the district court temporary restraining order.

on february,governor bredesen issued an executive order suspending tennessee protocol and asked the commissioner of corrections to review the state capital punishment administration procedures and to develop a new protocol by may.see state of tennessee,executive order by the governor.in late april april,the governor announced the new procedure for the state,which left the prior procedure unchanged in the main,though it formalized some components of the procedure and improved others.
on april,the district court granted workman a certificate of appealability to seek review of the district court denial of his rule b motion but denied workman request for a stay pending appeal.on may,workman filed an appeal from the rule b motion and sought a stay of his execution in this court.on may,we denied the motion for a stay,concluding that workman had not shown a likelihood of success in reversing the district court rule b decision.workman bell,cir.
that same day,workman filed a new complaint in a different federal middle district of tennessee.in an complaint,he challenged the constitutionality of the state protocol and sought a temporary retraining order suspending his may execution date.later that same day still may,the district court granted a temporary restraining order,set a preliminary injunction hearing for may regarding the constitutionality of the procedure and effectively stayed workman may execution date.
given the nature of workman challenge,a brief review of the history of tennessee execution procedures is in order.in,tennessee became a state,and its the first constitution mentioned capital offenses.the common law permitted the death penalty,which the state generally carried out by hanging.tennessee dep t of,capital punishment chronology,available at last visited may.the state adopted a criminal code in,which codified hanging as the sole method of imposing the death penalty.id.death by hanging remained the method of execution in tennessee until,when the state replaced the gallows with the electric chair.tennessee last execution by electrocution took place in.in the aftermath of furman georgia,d,the tennessee general assembly passed a new death penalty statute in,which the state supreme court later declared unconstitutional.the state enacted another law in,which still authorized electrocution as the state method of execution.tennessee dep t of,capital punishment chronology.
in,tennessee legislators made lethal injection an option for capital inmates though it continued to allow inmates to choose electrocution.abdur rahman bredesen,no,wl,at,see also.ann.a.the state general assembly vested the tennessee department of corrections with the authority to promulgate necessary rules and regulations to facilitate the implementation of death by lethal injection.c.the department of corrections decided to use a protocol modeled after the one that texas adopted because texas had the most experience with carrying out executions by lethal injection.abdur rahman,wl,at.
in,an inmate challenged the constitutionality of the state protocol under the eighth amendment.in,the tennessee supreme court rejected the challenge.see abdur rahman bredesen.
on february,the governor directed the department of corrections to engage in a comprehensive review of tennessee death penalty protocol and procedures,both for lethal injection and for electrocution.see executive order report on administration of death sentences in tennessee report at,see appendix a.the commissioner of the department formed a committee,which conducted research,obtained input from experts,sought information from other jurisdictions and updated its execution manual for carrying out the death penalty.report at.
the updated execution manual includes 
detailed descriptions of each step of the electrocution and processes.
detailed descriptions of the qualifications,selection processes,and training requirements for execution team members.
a detailed description of the services provided to family members of the condemned inmate victims.
enhanced requirements for contemporaneous documentation of each significant stage of an execution as it is carried out.
enhanced accountability in connection with the procurement,storage,and disposition of the chemicals.
in reviewing the state protocol,the committee focused on what chemicals should be used in the procedure and in what quantities,what training and qualifications the executioner and the iv team should possess,what method the iv team should use to administer drugs if unable to establish peripheral venous access,and what documentation should be required regarding the administration of the chemicals.report at.the committee met times from february through april and held a public hearing in april before issuing its findings.report at.
chemical selection and amounts.tennessee decided to retain the protocol it had adopted in,a protocol that other jurisdictions,including the federal government,employ.report at.the protocol involves the injection of grams of sodium thiopental followed by milligrams of pancuronium bromide pavulon followed by millequivalents of potassium chloride,all delivered intravenously.report at.the dose of sodium thiopental,a barbiturate that reduces oxygen flow to the brain and causes respiratory depression,execution procedures for lethal injection at,quickly anesthetizes the inmate and is sufficient to cause death in the absence of the two additional chemicals in the protocol.pancuronium bromide is a muscle paralytic that assist s in the suppression of breathing and ensure s death.id.the amount of pancuronium bromide the state administers also proves fatal on its own,and the state selected the drug because it hastens death and prevents involuntary muscular movement that may interfere with the proper functioning of the iv equipment,thus contribut ing to the dignity of the death process.report at.potassium chloride,a salt,interferes with heart function,causing cardiac arrest and rapid death.report at execution procedures for lethal injection at.if administered properly,the sodium thiopental anesthetizes inmates before they receive the remaining two drugs.report at.
before deciding to continue using the protocol,the committee considered two variations on this option and a option.the option would have eliminated pancuronium bromide from the protocol.the state rejected this approach after concluding that the administration of potassium chloride without a preceding dose of pancuronium bromide would typically result in involuntary movement which might be misinterpreted as a seizure or an indication of consciousness.report at.the state rejected a protocol,which would have used sodium thiopental alone,because it would slow down the death process and because the effect of the required dosage of sodium thiopental would be less predictable and more variable when it was used as the sole mechanism for producing death.id.on top of these concerns,the commission noted that no state had used a one or protocol to carry out an execution,leaving tennessee with no data or case studies to indicate that these options would work better and would operate more humanely than the protocol.id.
the state also considered the benefits of the the protocol had worked well in the past,that all courts that had reviewed the protocol had deemed it constitutional and that dozens of states had used it and thus could provide information,data and expertise about their experiences with it and refinements to it.the state balanced these considerations against the risks associated with the using three different chemicals is the most complicated of the three options,that there is a remote chance of an error in implementation that may cause the inmate to incur brief pain and that pancuronium bromide requires special attention because it must be refrigerated.report at.balancing these costs and benefits,tennessee chose to continue using the protocol.
training and qualifications of iv team and executioner.tennessee iv teams have always consisted of emergency medical technicians with iv certification or certified paramedics,report at,but the previous execution manual did not contain language requiring team members to possess this training and these qualifications.the state updated the manual to make these requirements express.see also execution procedures for lethal injection at.despite the fact the state has mandated that iv team members adhere to continuing education requirements to keep their licences and certification current,as well as required that team members regularly practice establishing iv access during execution training exercises,these requirements had not been contained in the execution manual.the state also made these requirements express.report at execution procedures for lethal injection at.
tennessee,finally,formalized its previously unwritten rule that executors must be trained in iv therapy so that they can recognize when they have failed to establish iv access.report at execution procedures for lethal injection at.
procedure.if the iv team can not locate a usable vein during an execution due for example to drug use by the inmate,see execution procedures for lethal injection at,tennessee uses a means that a physician makes an incision in order to obtain iv access.after reviewing the procedure and its alternatives with several experts,the state concluded that procedures are not particularly difficult for physicians to perform,and therefore decided to keep the procedure as its contingency plan during the process.report at execution procedures for lethal injection at.
documentation.tennessee revised its procedures to require enhanced documentation for procurement and storage of the chemicals used for lethal injection.report at.the state also amended its execution manual to include a contemporaneous documentation that a member of the iv team must document the administration of the protocol during an execution.id.at execution procedures for lethal injection at.
we have jurisdiction,as an initial matter,to review the district court temporary restraining order.see ohio coal.for homeless serv.employees int l union,local blackwell,cir.while we generally do not have jurisdiction to review temporary restraining orders,our jurisdiction is not controlled by the name that a claimant attaches to a motion or the name that a district court attaches to an order.rather than looking to the label attached by the trial court,we look to the nature of the order and the substance of the proceeding below to determine whether the rationale for denying appeal applies.id.were the shoe on the other foot,we suspect,workman would agree.
name aside,the salient question is whether the order effectively operates as an injunction which is what a permits us to review on an interlocutory basis.the tennessee supreme court set workman execution date for may the temporary restraining order runs through may and once may passes tennessee may not execute its judgment until a new execution date is set by order of the tennessee supreme court.see.e.to suggest,as workman does,that the district court order does not enjoin tennessee from executing workman on may,that the state has meaningful appellate options for imposing this sentence other than through interlocutory review and that the trial court order does not affect an important interest of the state is untenable.the order has the practical effect of an injunction,which simultaneously operates to stay workman execution and to give us authority to review it.ohio,at a see boltz jones,cir vacating temporary restraining order that stayed execution,reasoning that t hough the order is denominated a tro rather than an injunction,we have jurisdiction pursuant to a see also carson am.brands,d holding that an interlocutory order is immediately appealable when appellant can show that the order might have a serious,perhaps irreparable consequence,and that the order can be effectually challenged only by immediate appeal internal quotation marks omitted hill mcdonough,d noting the state strong interest in enforcing its criminal judgments without undue interference from the federal courts.
we review a district court decision to issue a temporary restraining order for abuse of discretion.see bowersox williams,d per curiam reviewing order involving stay of execution ohio,at see also alley little,cir explaining that we weigh the merits of the district court stay of an execution based on the reason furnished in its opinion.we will find an abuse of discretion only when left with a definite and firm conviction that the trial court committed a clear error of judgment.logan dayton hudson,cir.a district court abuses its discretion when it relies on clearly erroneous findings of fact,or when it improperly applies the law or uses an erroneous legal standard.tompkin philip morris usa,cir.
in reviewing the district court decision,we consider the same four factors that the district court considered whether the claimant has demonstrated a strong likelihood of success on the merits,whether the claimant will suffer irreparable injury in the absence of a stay,whether granting the stay will cause substantial harm to others,and whether the public interest is best served by granting the stay.ohio,at.
we have two objections to the district court that the district court briefly considered in its order whether tennessee protocol likely violates the eighth amendment and one that it did not whether workman has waited too long in bringing this challenge.before we reach these issues,however,we must address workman contention that the state has waived any right to challenge the district court decision on these two grounds.
after challenging our power to review the district court order,workman challenges the state power to contest the bases for it.last friday morning,on may,workman served a motion for a temporary restraining order on the state,and the court held a hearing on the motion.at the hearing,the state took the legitimate position that the court had no authority to grant the order because workman had not yet filed his complaint and that it would not respond to a complaint that it had not seen.after the hearing,workman filed his complaint,and an hour later the district court without holding a new hearing granted the motion.the state did not waive any challenges to the motion under these circumstances,and workman offers no relevant authority to suggest otherwise.
the state also did not waive these arguments in the motion that it filed in our court this morning.as to undue delay,the state makes that consideration one of the key points of the motion if not the key point of the motion.as to the likelihood that a court would strike down this procedure on constitutional grounds,the state throughout its motion relies heavily on our decision in alley and the tennessee supreme court decision in abdur of which found that this same claim had little likelihood of success on the merits,and the other of which rejected the claim on the merits.the state also specifically critiques the district court reliance on the opinions of heath as grounds for establishing a likelihood of success,objecting that the district court failed to address the alley and abdur rahman decisions,even though they addressed the same issue and even though they found unpersuasive the reports of this same doctor about the same procedure.motion at.again,no waiver occurred.
like a prior panel of this court that considered a challenge to tennessee procedure a year ago,we think that workman has a small likelihood of success with respect to this challenge because his contention is unsupported by current law,which offers no basis for finding lethal injection protocols unconstitutional.alley.at.and like that panel,we think that the district court abused its discretion in concluding otherwise.id.at.
in contending that tennessee protocol likely violates the eighth amendment prohibition on imposing cruel and unusual punishments,const.amend.viii,workman faces several obstacles.first,the supreme court has never invalidated a state or the federal government chosen method of execution.as best we can tell,the court has considered three such challenges under the eighth amendment,only one of which reached the merits.see wilkerson utah.holding that the use of a firing squad was not cruel and unusual in re kemmler.declining to apply the eighth amendment to the states state of ex rel.francis resweber.declining to apply the eighth amendment to the states.since these decisions,the court has had ample opportunities to constrain methods of execution that seem to raise far greater risk of cruel and unusual punishment than lethal injection,but it has declined to do so.see,campbell wood,d blackmun,dissenting from denial of certiorari hanging gomez dist.court for the dist.of,d stevens,dissenting from vacation of stay of execution gas chamber critiquing the majority for sanctioning the use of the gas chamber when most states had moved away from this method of execution because it caused unnecessary infliction of pain glass louisiana,d brennan,dissenting from denial of certiorari electrocution gray lucas,d marshall,dissenting from denial of certiorari gas chamber.
second,the experience of the lower state and federal courts is similar.no court to our knowledge has issued a final decision declaring a state protocol unconstitutional.and several lower courts have upheld this specific,protocol.see,abdur rahman,at aldrich johnson,cir lethal injection in texas people snow,cal th,d,sims state,so d,state webb,lagrand stewart,cir lethal injection in arizona hill lockhart,arkansas lethal injection protocol state hinchey,state deputy,state moen,or,hopkinson state.one can not credibly establish a likelihood of success in attacking a procedure when the theory of success has yet to succeed in a considerable number of cases over a considerable number of years.
third,one of the benchmarks the court uses to identify eighth amendment consideration of the evolving standards of decency that mark the progress of a maturing society,mccleskey kemp,d internal quotation marks omitted does not help workman.the clearest and most reliable objective evidence of contemporary values is the legislation enacted by the country legislatures.atkins virginia,d internal quotation marks omitted.as modern sensibilities have moved away from hanging,the firing squad,the gas chamber and electrocution as methods of carrying out a death sentence,so too have the procedures of the states and the federal government.while the supreme court has tolerated continuity in this area,the democratic processes have demanded change.the method of execution in of the states that authorize capital sentences has evolved to make lethal injection the preferred method of carrying out a death sentence with only nebraska clinging to electrocution.the federal government now uses lethal injection as well.see death penalty information center,lethal injections,available at.deathpenal tyinfo.org article.php did scid drugs last visited may,see also jones allen,cir noting that alabama also uses protocol.
not only is there a consensus among the states and the federal government that lethal injection is the most humane method of execution,but there also is a consensus among these jurisdictions that the protocol used by tennessee is the preferred form of lethal injection.states and the federal government use the same three drugs,while one state new jersey uses a combination of the first two drugs in the protocol,and the remaining seven,kentucky,nevada,new hampshire,pennsylvania,south carolina and do not specify what drugs they use.death penalty information center,lethal injections see also report at at least jurisdictions have a lethal injection protocol consisting of sodium thiopental,pancuronium bromide,and potassium chloride in varying amounts.if evolving standards of decency are the measure of constitutionality,tennessee has satisfied the requirement.
fourth,the other benchmark the court uses to identify eighth amendment the punishment involves the unnecessary and wanton infliction of pain,nelson,at.internal quotation marks omitted id.at.referring to the deliberate indifference standard does not help workman either.the whole point of the tennessee protocol is to avoid the needless infliction of pain,not to cause it.the idea is to anesthetize the individual with one drug before the state administers the remaining two drugs,so that the serial combination of drugs causes a quick and death.see abdur rahman,at noting that a dosage of five grams of sodium pentothal as required under tennessee lethal injection protocol causes nearly immediate unconsciousness and eventually death,that such a dose would cause an inmate to be unconscious in about five seconds and that the inmate would never regain consciousness and would feel no pain prior to dying.
no one debates these premises,or this purpose,of tennessee procedure.we thus do not have a situation where the state has any intent or anything approaching intent to inflict unnecessary pain the complaint is that the state procedure may fail because the executioners may make a mistake in implementing it.but no one has demonstrated that this problem has occurred in tennessee in the past,and as we have shown the state has extensive procedures in place to prevent this very thing from happening.the risk of negligence in implementing a procedure,particularly when the risk has not come to pass in the state,does not establish a cognizable eighth amendment claim.at some level,every execution procedure ever used contains risk that the individual death will not be entirely pain free.see beardslee woodford,cir obviously there are risks involved in virtually every method of execution.however,the supreme court has rejected eighth amendment challenges based on an unforeseeable accident,and has presumed that state officials have acted in a careful and humane manner.quoting louisiana ex rel.francis resweber.campbell wood,cir en banc t he risk of accident can not and need not be eliminated from the execution process in order to survive constitutional review.
fifth,even though tennessee has adopted a method of execution designed to eliminate rather than cause pain,even though the vast majority of executions carried out in modern times have moved progressively to this procedure,even though no state or federal court has issued a final decision invalidating the protocol under the eighth amendment,even though the tennessee supreme court in held that the protocol did not inflict unnecessary physical or psychological pain and suffering,abdur rahman,at,and even though our court in permitted the state to execute sedley alley under the protocol,alley.at,the state has not left it at that.in,the tennessee governor initiated a review of the procedure to ensure that death sentences are administered in a constitutional and appropriate manner.executive order,at.to that end,governor bredesen directed the corrections commissioner to undertake a comprehensive review of the manner in which death sentences are administered in tennessee and asked the commissioner to establish a revised protocol by may.id.at.
in response,the corrections commissioner appointed a committee to prepare a report on the administration of death sentences in tennessee.among other things,the committee reviewed available court decisions addressing lethal injection protocols spoke with officials in sister states regarding their experiences in implementing lethal injection attended an presentation by the federal bureau of prisons execution team consulted with anesthesiologists and held a public hearing,inviting representatives from the tennessee medical association,the tennessee bar association,the university college of medicine,and the southeastern pharmacology society,among others.see report at.
the most significant issue the committee faced was the selection of the chemicals and dosage to be used in lethal injection executions in tennessee.id.at.after considerable research and consultation with medical experts,it retained a protocol.id.while several considerations drove the committee decision including weaknesses in the and options,the paramount consideration was the reality that the protocol has been used in almost all of the lethal injection executions that have taken place in this country,allowing tennessee to draw upon the considerable experience of other jurisdictions in implementing the protocol.id.at.the committee also sought to improve tennessee practices by develop ing updated execution manuals for lethal injection that incorporate best practices from other jurisdictions.id.at.
call the requirements of the eighth amendment what you the unnecessary and wanton infliction of pain,refraining from deliberate indifference to the needs of inmates or keeping up with evolving standards of decency they do not prohibit the adoption,implementation and refinement of a procedure in as comprehensive manner as this.the efforts of the governor and the corrections department suggest a state intent not just on satisfying the requirements of the eighth amendment but on far exceeding them.
attempting to fend off this conclusion,workman maintains that the use of pancuronium bromide the second of the three drugs used by tennessee must be cruel and unusual because even veterinarians refuse to use it in euthanizing animals.on reflection,however,this contention is more of a debater point than a legitimate attack on the protocol.in euthanizing animals,veterinarians use just one barbiturate not unlike sodium thiopental the first drug used by tennessee,except that the barbiturate used on animals acts more slowly.the problem with using a barbiturate alone,tennessee determined,is that it takes too long,and no other state uses a barbiturate by itself.report at noting that a protocol likely result s in a more rapid death and that to date no other state has used a protocol.in its recent review of the protocol,tennessee also considered the other option for eliminating pancuronium bromide from the the first and third drugs.as the state explained,however,a protocol would lead to convulsions,a phenomenon the state understandably wished to avoid out of respect for the dignity of the individual and presumably out of respect for anyone,including the inmate family,watching the execution.id.at lethal injection without pancuronium bromide would typically result in involuntary movement which might be misinterpreted as a seizure or an indication of consciousness.like the vast majority of states and the federal government,as a result,tennessee uses pancuronium bromide to prevent this from happening.id.at p ancuronium bromide speeds the death process,prevents involuntary muscular movement that may interfere with the proper functioning of the iv equipment,and contributes to the dignity of the death process.
that employees of the corrections department,who are not physicians,perform the execution procedure in a typical case does not change matters.for one,no one alleges that running an iv requires a doctor.for another,the state has a doctor on hand to address any problems if the trained employee can not start the iv.execution procedures for lethal injection at a physician must be present at the precise time of execution and perform the procedure should the iv team be unable to find a vein adequate to insert the catheter.as the state recent review of its procedures confirms,moreover,it requires its employees to engage in considerable training to handle executions.report at.while workman claims that the employees and doctor should be next to him during the administration of the procedure rather than in an adjacent room,there are countervailing interests at work.as the state trial court observed in upholding this procedure 
a paramount concern in an execution is security.the condemned has committed a violent act,and he is facing termination of life.under these circumstances it is necessary to deviate from the surgical norm of physical proximity.it is necessary,for security reasons,to assure that the executioner is securely removed from the condemned.the separateness of the executioner and the syringes containing the lethal dosages,while it does decrease the executioner ability to monitor intake of the pentothal,is for good reason.to make up for the separateness of the executioner,the tennessee lethal injection method has a tv monitor in the execution room,a camera above the gurney,and the warden is located in the execution room within a foot of the condemned head.the warden has been trained on detecting problems such as crimping of the iv line,or failure of the injection to go into the vein.
abdur rahman sundquist,order at.ch.dist.june,available at cases rahman rahman.htm last visited may.for exceedingly practical reasons,no state can carry out an execution in the same manner that a hospital monitors an operation.
nor,relatedly,does the eighth amendment require an anesthesiologist to be on hand to monitor the inmate consciousness during every execution.while it may well be a good practice for a state to hire an anesthesiologist for each execution assuming one is willing to handle the task,the constitution does not require it.the risks of pain that workman complains about remain remote and do not occur when the procedure is properly implemented,and no one has shown that they have occurred in tennessee in the past.under its protocol,tennessee administers grams of sodium thiopental to anesthetize the inmate.see execution procedures for lethal injection at.that lethal dosage represents the highest level that other states use,and it renders the inmate unconscious nearly immediate ly,abdur rahman,at.this dose thus reduces,if not completely eliminates,any risk that workman would incur constitutionally excessive pain and suffering when he is executed.see id.at heath workman expert testified that a lesser dosage of two grams of sodium pentothal would cause unconsciousness in all but very rare cases and that a dosage of five grams would almost certainly cause death.the protocol also calls for certification and training requirements that reduce the risk of error in administering the drugs.although the protocol does not contain an explicit instruction to monitor workman consciousness,it does require the participation of a certified iv team and the presence of a doctor.this combination of factors suggests that there is ample recourse if the dosage of sodium times the dosage used to anesthetize hospital fails to render workman unconscious.
under these circumstances,we can not accept the district court conclusion that tennessee protocol creates a foreseeable and likely unnecessary risk that the plaintiff will incur constitutionally excessive pain and suffering when he is executed.temporary restraining order at.only one thing has changed since a panel of this court convincingly demonstrated that this challenge to the tennessee procedure has a small likelihood of success,alley.at,and accordingly vacated a similar stay state has reevaluated and improved its procedure.then,as now,it remains the case that no state or federal court has issued a final decision invalidating the protocol,and several decisions including the tennessee supreme court decision in have upheld this procedure.in its defense,the district court of course had just a half day to consider all of this,which brings us to our second objection to workman delay.
while the absence of any meaningful chance of success on the merits suffices to resolve this matter,workman faces a second problem he waited far too long to bring this five days before what is now the sixth execution date the tennessee has set for him.the district court did not consider this reason for denying the motion perhaps because it had too little time to do so and perhaps because it had only one party workman brief,even though the supreme court has indicated that in considering the equitable remedy of staying an execution,a district court must consider the extent to which the inmate has delayed unnecessarily in bringing the claim.nelson campbell,d emphasis added see tompkin,at abuse of discretion occurs when district court makes a mistake of law.
workman responds that he filed this lawsuit within four days of receiving the revised protocol.see tro motion at.but as workman acknowledges,the new protocol is only slightly different from the old protocol,complaint at,and he does not point to any revision that makes the protocol worse,only to revisions that could have been made but were not.workman problem,then,is not just that he waited until five days before his execution his challenge would have been late even had he filed it immediately before or after the governor set his most recent execution date on january.having refused to challenge the old procedure on a timely basis,he gets no purchase in claiming a right to challenge a better procedure on the eve of his execution.
there is a strong equitable presumption against the grant of a stay where a claim could have been brought at such a time as to allow consideration of the merits without requiring entry of a stay.nelson,at.even had workman filed this challenge on january,that still would have been too late in the day,hill mcdonough,d,to allow the trial and appellate courts to reach the merits of any subsequent challenge.see jones,at a djudicating jones claim would take much more than three months and a subsequent appeal would add months,if not years,to this litigation.internal quotation marks omitted harris johnson,cir the brief window of time between the denial of certiorari and the state chosen execution this case,four an insufficient period in which to serve a complaint,conduct discovery,depose experts,and litigate the issue on the merits.he thus can not revive a dilatory action when the only concrete challenges to the new procedure were features of the old procedure.
workman opportunities to avoid this the only way to litigate the validity of the protocol is to stay his many.the tennessee supreme court affirmed his death sentence in,see state workman,the state courts denied his petition for relief in,see workman state,and we denied his initial federal habeas petition in,see workman bell,cir see also neville johnson,cir a challenge to a method of execution may be filed at any time after the plaintiff conviction has become final on direct review.in,tennessee prescribed lethal injection as a lawful means of execution,see.pub.acts ch,and the state adopted a lethal injection protocol that included the use of three drugs,the same three drugs the state currently uses,abdur rahman bredesen,at.in,the legislature deemed lethal injection the presumptive method for all executions in the other words,the state will use that method of execution unless the individual affirmatively opts for electrocution.see.pub.acts ch.
by,workman had completed his state and federal direct and initial collateral attacks on his sentence,and he faced the prospect of imminent execution by lethal injection.nonetheless,from that year to the present,he chose not to challenge the procedure,whether in federal or state court.in april,workman came within two days of being executed by lethal injection but he did not challenge the procedure before or after a stay was issued.workman bell,cir en banc.in january,he came within five days of execution but did not challenge the procedure before or after a stay was issued.workman bell,cir,en banc.in march,he came within two hours of execution but did not challenge the procedure before or after a stay was issued.workman state.in september,he came within nine days of execution but did not challenge the procedure before or after an executive reprieve was granted.see workman bell.and in september,he came within days of execution but did not challenge the procedure before or after a stay was issued.workman bell.
by any measurable standard,workman has had ample time to challenge the procedure.while workman may be correct that his other litigation efforts during these seven state coram nobis petition and his federal rule b motion,among not require a challenge to the procedure in these actions,his suggestion that he had no way to challenge the procedure simultaneously in a separate action in federal or state court is simply mistaken.throughout this time,other tennessee inmates,though not workman,have challenged the constitutionality of the state lethal injection protocol.see alley.abdur rahman.nothing prevented workman from intervening in the abdur rahman case.see.civ.and our court told alley in that he had been dilatory in bringing his challenge.see alley little,cir vacating district court stay and noting that challenge was very late in coming.having waited until the eve of his sixth execution date to bring this challenge and having chosen to challenge the improved but not the inferior method of execution,workman must face the reality that this is the kind of dilatory suit from which federal courts can and should protect the states.hill.at.see jones,at noting that delay in filing challenge could not be justified on ground that inmate knew little about the procedure because the thrust of the challenge went to the impermissibility of the same procedure that most states use.
any balancing of hardships on this record strongly favors the state with respect to this sentence.a state interests in finality are compelling when a federal court of appeals issues a mandate denying federal habeas relief,calderon thompson,d an event which in workman case occurred in,see workman bell,cir,or at the latest.at that point,the state interest in finality acquired an added moral dimension.only with real finality can the victims of crime move forward knowing the moral judgment will be carried out.calderon,at.indeed,while we need not rely on the point,it bears adding that,whether one looks to the test for determining the timeliness of a action adopted by the majority or the dissent in our recent decision in cooey strickland,cir,a challenge by workman to the protocol in january seemingly would have been time barred under either approach.
it is true,as workman points out and as the district court pointed out,that a few courts have granted stays to litigate this question.but we have not seen a case,and workman has not pointed us to a case,where the inmate passed on as many opportunities to challenge the protocol as workman has and the inmate has waited so long after the completion of his first federal habeas petition to bring the action.
at some point in time,the state has a right to impose a just because the state interests in finality are compelling,but also because there is a powerful and legitimate interest in punishing the guilty,which attaches to the state and the victims of crime alike.calderon,at.internal quotation marks omitted.years after the imposition of this sentence,that time,it seems to us,has come.
for these reasons,we vacate the district court temporary restraining order.

tennessee department of correctionreport and administration of death sentences in tennesseeapril by tennessee department of correction 
executive summary 
in response to executive order,commissioner george little appointed a committee to review the administration of death sentences in tennessee and revise the department protocols and manual.the committee utilized a number of resources including,but not limited to,the following 
the office of the attorney general and reporter 
participants in past tennessee executions,including riverbend maximum security institution warden ricky bell,members of the iv team,and a physician 
corrections professionals and legal experts from other jurisdictions 
anesthesiologists 
an electrical engineer 
the final report of florida governor commission on administration of lethal injection 
court opinions in execution protocol cases from tennessee and other jurisdictions.
the department also held a public hearing on april,for the purpose of receiving input from persons with relevant expertise on the issue of how to best ensure that the department execution protocol provides constitutional and appropriate executions.two attorneys made presentations at the hearing,and comments were also taken from other attendees.
based upon its research and the input it receive from various sources,the department developed updated execution manuals for lethal injection and electrocution that incorporate best practices from the department own experience and that of other jurisdictions.highlights includes 
detailed descriptions of each step of the electrocution and lethal injection processes 
detailed descriptions of the qualifications,selection processes,and training requirements for execution team members 
a detailed description of the services provided to family members of the condemned inmate victims 
enhanced requirements for contemporaneous documentation of each significant stage of an execution as it is carried out 
enhanced accountability in connection with the procurement,storage,and disposition of the lethal injection chemicals.
the protocol for lethal injections employs the following chemicals in the sequence shown 
grams of sodium thiopental in cc of sterile water 
mg of pancuronium bromide 
ml of potassium chloride,for a total of meq.
after the infusion of each chemical,the iv line is flushed with cc saline solution.
at least other jurisdictions,including the federal bureau of prisons,have lethal injection protocols consisting of sodium thiopental,pancuronium bromide,and potassium chloride in varying amounts.sodium thiopental is a barbiturate that rapidly induces general anesthesia.pancuronium bromide is a neuromuscular blocking agent that induces paralysis and causes breathing to cease.potassium chloride is a salt that interferes with the electrical signaling essential to normal heart function.in the amounts listed above,each of the chemicals,independently,is lethal.
tennessee has chosen to use grams of sodium thiopental,the largest amount used by other jurisdictions,to provide enhanced assurance that the condemned inmate will be unconscious when the remaining chemicals are infused.
the revised lethal injection and electrocution manuals and protocols will provide further assurance that death sentences are administered in a constitutional and appropriate manner in tennessee.
introduction 
on february,governor phil bredesen issued executive order directing the department of correction to complete a comprehensive review of the manner in which the death penalty is administered in tennessee.the executive order provided as follows 
i hereby direct the commissioner of correction commissioner to initiate immediately a comprehensive review of the manner in which death sentences are administered in tennessee.this review shall specifically include the state protocols and any related procedures,whether written or otherwise,related to the administration of death sentences,both by lethal injection and by electrocution.in completing this review,the commissioner is directed to utilize all relevant and appropriate resources,including but not limited to scientific and medical experts,legal experts,and correction professionals both from within the outside of tennessee.as a component of this review,the commissioner is further directed to research and perform an analysis of best practices used by other states in administering the death penalty.
as soon as practical,but no later than may,the commissioner of correction is directed to establish and provide to me the new protocols and related written procedures for administering death sentences in tennessee,both by lethal injection and electrocution.in addition,the commissioner is directed to provide me with a report outlining the results of the review completed pursuant to paragraph one above.
in response to executive order,commissioner little appointed a committee to undertake the required review and prepare recommended protocols for the administration of the death penalty in tennessee.after extensive research and after receiving input from experts in relevant fields,the committee developed new execution manuals incorporating written procedures based on tennessee own experience and that of other jurisdictions,as well as input from medical experts.
this report describes the department methodology in developing the new manuals and the input it received from various sources,and summarizes the most significant issues addressed in the manuals.
methodology 
in response to executive order,commissioner george little appointed a committee to undertake the required review of the manual of procedures for electrocution and lethal injection in tennessee.the committee consisted of deputy commissioner gayle ray,assistant commissioner of operations roland colson,riverbend maximum security institution warden ricky bell,executive assistant to the commissioner julian davis,and general counsel debra inglis.
initially,the department received guidance from the state attorney general office concerning the legal challenges to execution protocols in tennessee and other jurisdictions and possible areas of inquiry for the committee.the committee reviewed the opinion issued by the tennessee supreme court in abdur rahman bredesen,denied.d,as well as the opinions filed by the chancey court for davidson county and the tennessee court of appeals in the same proceeding.it reviewed the complaint filed in harbison little.concerning tennessee previous protocol.it also reviewed court opinions and other documents filed in cases challenging execution from other jurisdictions.
the department identified several areas warranting particular focus in the review process.as to lethal injection,these areas included the selection and amounts of the chemicals to be used,requirements pertaining to the procurement and storage of the lethal injection chemicals,the qualifications and training required of the members of the iv team and the executioner,the method to be used for obtaining venous access when the iv team can not established peripheral venous access,and documentation requirements pertaining to the administration of the lethal chemicals.as to electrocution,the committee considered whether any modifications should be made to the settings on the electric chair control panel,as well as the requirements for regular testing and maintenance of the equipment.
the committee reviewed the department previous protocol and execution manual.ricky bell,warden of the riverbend maximum security institution,answered questions from other committee members about the process used in the state two recent lethal injection executions as well as questions about the electrocution process.the committee also met with other participants in tennessee two lethal injection executions about specific areas.
the committee consulted a number of other jurisdictions for information on their protocols,the development of their protocols,and their experiences in implementing those protocols.while some jurisdictions were unwilling to share information due to legal requirements for maintaining confidentiality,the committee was able to obtain information from several jurisdictions.particularly helpful was information obtained by the committee during two meetings with virginia department of corrections staff in greensville,virginia and with federal bureau of prisons staff at terre haute.
at the greensville correctional facility,the deputy warden,other institutional staff,and representatives of the virginia attorney general office answered questions about all aspects of virginia lethal injection process and provided a tour of the capital punishment area.
at terre haute,the federal bureau of prison execution team gave a comprehensive presentation to the committee and representatives of several other jurisdictions.the presentation included a discussion of lessons learned when carrying out lethal injection executions in several high profile cases.the federal execution team demonstrated its procedure while conducting training exercises.
the committee consulted with two anesthesiologists concerning lethal injection and an electrical engineer concerning electrocution.the committee also consulted with the physician who is present at tennessee executions to pronounce death and to perform a procedure,if necessary.
the committee reviewed the final report with findings and recommendations issued by florida governor commission on administration of lethal injection on march.
the department also held a public hearing on april.representatives of the tennessee medical association,tennessee bar association,university of tennessee college of medicine,southeastern pharmacology society,the federal public defender for the middle district of tennessee,the federal defender services of eastern tennessee,and specific members of the defense bar were invited to provide input on how to best ensure that the department execution protocol provides constitutional and appropriate executions.two attorneys made presentations at the hearing,and comments were also taken from other attendees.a transcript of hearing is attached.
the committee met on the following dates 
selected areas of injection 
the following issues relating to lethal injection were among those given particular attention in researching best practices 
lethal injection chemical selection 
the most significant issue to the department addressed was the selection of the chemicals and dosage to be used in lethal injection executions in tennessee.after considerable research and consultation with medical experts,the department has retained a protocol.
the following is a summary of the three best alternatives considered by the department,and its findings regarding the advantages and disadvantages of each.
three chemical protocol grams of sodium thiopental,mg of pancuronium bromide,and meq.of potassium chloride 
at least jurisdictions,including the federal bureau of prisons and tennessee under its previous protocol,have a lethal injection protocol consisting of sodium thiopental,pancuronium bromide,and potassium chloride in varying amounts.sodium thiopental is a barbiturate that rapidly induces general anesthesia.five grams of sodium thiopental given intravenously is,by itself,lethal.pancuronium bromide is a neuromuscular blocking agent that induces paralysis and causes breathing to cease.an intravenous injection of mg of pancuronium bromide is also lethal.potassium chloride is a salt that interferes with the electrical signaling essential to normal heart function.a meq dose administered intravenously causes cardiac arrest and rapid death.
the issues raised on behalf of death row inmates have generally focused on the potential for error in the administration of the protocol.it is generally agreed that if administered correctly and without error the protocol would result in a relatively painless death.in an amendment challenge to the protocol brought by a tennessee inmate under sentence of death,the tennessee court of appeals summarized the inmate position as follows 
the evidence is essentially uncontradicted that the injection of either pavulon pancuronium bromide or potassium chloride,by themselves,in the dosages required by tennessee protocol would cause excruciating pain.without sedation,the injection of potassium chloride would,in the words of the anesthesiologist testifying on abdur rahman behalf,deliver the maximum amount of pain the veins can deliver.similarly,persons receiving a massive dose of pavulon without sedation would be conscious while they asphyxiated.thus,the ultimate determination regarding whether tennessee protocol causes unnecessary physical suffering depends on the efficacy of the injection of sodium pentothal sodium thiopental that precedes the injections of pavulon and potassium chloride.
abdur rahman bredesen,wl,aff,abdur rahman bredesen.after reviewing the expert testimony presented in that case as well as the conclusions reached by courts in other jurisdictions,the court concluded 
in light of the evidence that the sodium pentothal is administered before the pavulon and the potassium chloride,and that it remains effective until death occurs,we agree with the trial court conclusion that abdur rahman failed to prove that the injection of chemicals in accordance with tennessee protocol would cause unnecessary physical pain or psychological suffering.
consistent with the findings of the court in abdur rahman,the experts consulted by the committee all agreed that the intravenous administration of grams of sodium thiopental in a person would be lethal,that it would render the person unconscious within a few seconds,and that its anesthetic effect would continue until death.accordingly,the department found that the three chemical protocol,when administered appropriately,will result in a humane death.
several factors weigh in favor of retaining the protocol.tennessee experience in implementing the protocol has been positive.tennessee protocol has been upheld by all courts that have ruled upon its constitutionality.in addition,the protocol has been used in almost all of the lethal injection executions that have taken place in this country,allowing tennessee to draw upon the considerable experience of other jurisdictions in implementing the protocol.
pancuronium bromide is included in the protocol because it speeds the death process,prevents involuntary muscular movement that may interfere with the proper functioning of the iv equipment,and contributes to the dignity of the death process.
the department also took into consideration several factors that weighed against retaining the protocol.the procedure is the most complicated of the three protocols,and there is a remote chance of an error in implementation that may cause the inmate to incur brief pain.finally,the protocol presents the greatest difficulty in accounting for the lethal injection chemicals,particularly because pancuronium bromide requires refrigeration.
protocol sodium thiopental and potassium chloride 
the department considered a protocol consisting of sodium thiopental and potassium chloride.this protocol has an advantage over the protocol in that it eliminates the use of pancuronium bromide.as a result,it would address the allegation that,although appearing unconscious,a condemned inmate might in fact be conscious and experience pain from the administration of potassium chloride.it would also likely result in a somewhat faster death than a protocol.on the other hand,the administration of potassium chloride without a preceding dose of pancuronium bromide would typically result in involuntary movement which might be misinterpreted as a seizure or an indication of consciousness.this protocol has also not been used by any other jurisdiction to carry out an execution.
protocol sodium thiopental 
finally,the department considered the merits of a protocol consisting of grams of sodium thiopental.
the primary advantage of the protocol is that it is much simpler to administer and provides an even lower risk of error in its administration.as compared to the two and protocols,it has the advantage of eliminating both of the chemicals which,if injected into a conscious person,would cause pain.it is similar to the process used in animal euthanasia.using one chemical that does not require refrigeration greatly simplifies the process of maintaining and accounting for the lethal injection chemicals.
the protocol has several disadvantages.first,the two and protocols would likely result in a more rapid death.second,the effect and required dosage of sodium thiopental would be less predictable and more variable when it is used as the sole mechanism for producing death than it would when used in combination with pancuronium bromide and potassium chloride.third,to date no other state has used a similar protocol,and thus in the context of lethal injection executions there is no experience upon which tennessee can draw.
lethal injection chemical procurement and storage 
the department previous protocol provided assurance that the lethal injection chemicals would be procured and stored in such a way as to further minimize the possibility of contamination,dilution,or adulteration or loss of the chemicals.an examination of best practices from other jurisdictions,however,suggests that accountability would be enhanced through improved documentation of these processes.accordingly,the protocol includes enhanced documentation requirements with regard to the procurement and storage of lethal injection chemicals.
iv team qualifications and training 
a review of best practices from other jurisdictions reveals that persons responsible for establishing iv access should have quality training in iv therapy,and preferably possess certification or licensure in a field that includes establishing iv access within its scope of practice.although tennessee has always used emergency medical technicians with iv certification or certified paramedics to establish iv access,the previous execution manual did not include such a requirement.the updated manual expressly requires that persons responsible for establishing iv access have such training and certification.
best practices in other jurisdictions require that,in addition to the continuing education required to maintain their certification and licensure,iv team members should also regularly practice establishing iv access during execution training exercises.this practice has always been in place in tennessee,but not in writing.the updated manual expressly requires it.
use of procedure 
the department also considered the use of a procedure and various alternative procedures with several experts.the department determined that procedures are not particularly difficult for physicians to perform,especially for those who have prior experience performing the procedure.accordingly,it has been retained as an option if needed to gain iv access.
executioner qualifications and training 
although not all jurisdictions require the executioner to have training in iv therapy,such training prepares the executioner to recognize when iv access is not adequately established,allowing him to take appropriate corrective action.the but unwritten practice in tennessee has always been to use an executioner trained in iv therapy.the department considers this to be an important requirement and has expressly incorporated it into the protocol.
chemical administration documentation 
an examination of best practices from other jurisdictions suggested that review of lethal injection executions is facilitated by contemporaneous documentation of the administration of the lethal injection chemicals.an express requirement for contemporaneous documentation by a member of the iv team has been incorporated into the updated manual.
selected areas of 
the following issues relating to electrocution were among those given particular attention in researching best practices 
history of tennessee electric chair 
in,tennessee electric chair was refurbished and a new electrocution system was installed by fred leuchter associates.later the system underwent substantial modifications at the recommendation of michael morse,phd,and jay weichert,a professional electrical engineer who has consulted with a number of states on electrocution protocols.through subsequent years weichert has consulted with the tennessee department of correction concerning the operation of its electrocution system and has tested and maintained the system in working order.
the committee met with weichert at riverbend maximum security institution on march.he explained in detail how the system operates,the recommended settings,and how to respond to various contingencies.his recommendations have been incorporated into the electrocution manual.
electrocution equipment control settings 
expert input received by the department indicates that the electrocution equipment should be set to render volts at amps,cycled on for seconds,off for seconds,and on for an additional seconds.these settings have been retained.
electrocution equipment maintenance and testing 
although not required by the state previous written protocol,the department has tested its electrocution system at least quarterly and has conducted regular maintenance as required.the department considers this schedule to be adequate and has expressly incorporated it into the updated manual.the updated manual also expressly requires documentation of testing,maintenance,and modifications in a permanent ledger.

transcript of april,public hearing 
for the first time in a case,to my knowledge,this court vacates a temporary restraining order that the court is incompetent to review because it is not in so doing clears the way for philip workman execution on may.
just as troubling,despite the extensive and detailed allegations workman raises tending to show that tennessee new protocol will subject him to pain and suffering in violation of the eighth amendment despite that workman supports his allegations with testimony from physicians familiar with protocols,medical studies,and evidence from recent botched executions despite the statements from federal courts across the united states expressing deep skepticism with similar protocols adopted by other states and despite the deference that an appellate court owes to the judgment of a district court,the majority concludes that workman concerns are insufficiently compelling to warrant a brief preservation of the status quo to determine whether his claims have merit.
in the end,i simply can not conclude that in the face of workman disturbing allegations,the state legitimate interest in finality and giving effect to its criminal judgments will be irretrievably impaired by the tro here.indeed,the state interest in executing workman will,at worst,simply be delayed but not denied if this court denies the state motion to vacate the tro.skillern procunier,d brennan,dissenting.and if workman is ultimately successful in proving the constitutional infirmity of tennessee new protocol,then the tro will have prevented a harm the legality of which will be open to serious question under federal law.id.accordingly,i respectfully dissent.
appealability 
the majority opinion rests on a profound jurisdictional defect there is no appealable order before this court.the district court issued a temporary restraining order,not a preliminary injunction.it is well established that a n order granting,denying,or dissolving a temporary restraining order is generally not appealable.moore federal practice ed.tro have the modest purpose of preserving the status quo to give the court time to determine whether a preliminary injunction should issue.first tech.safety,depinet,cir.the short duration of a more than days under rule b is one of its chief distinctions from a preliminary injunction.indeed,as this court recently acknowledged,t he rationale for this rule,the of tro is that tro are of short duration and usually terminate with a prompt ruling on a preliminary injunction,from which the losing party has an immediate right of appeal.ne.ohio coal.for the homeless blackwell,cir.
the district court tro can not be magically transformed into a preliminary injunction,which is an appealable order,even though the state and a majority of this court may wish it.this makes the majority heavy reliance on the unpublished decision in alley little.cir which involved a preliminary inapposite.true,in certain situations not applicable here,courts will treat tro as appealable preliminary injunctions.for instance,if a tro is extended beyond the limit provided for in rule b,then it may be treated as a preliminary injunction.see,nordin,cir treating tro as preliminary injunction because it had no expiration date and exceeded rule b limit chicago united,city of chicago,cir treating tro as preliminary injunction because days since its issuance had elapsed.this is not an issue here because the district court order sets a hearing date of may,and specifies that the tro will dissolve on that date.
in addition,courts sometimes say that even though an order is styled a tro,it is in substance a preliminary injunction.ne.ohio coal.for the homeless,at.the state contends that this is precisely the situation here because the tro will prevent the state from carrying out its may scheduled execution of workman,and therefore cause serious,perhaps irreparable harm to the state interest in giving effect to its criminal judgments.defs.motion to vacate temporary restraining order at quoting ne.ohio coal.for the homeless,at.but that conclusion is illogical.the state interest is in no way irreparably harmed,or even seriously undermined.the tro here does not interfere with the state conviction of workman it does not interfere with the state ultimate imposition of the death sentence and it does not indefinitely preclude the state from executing workman.the tro does no more than prohibit workman execution on may,so that the district court may mere five days a preliminary injunction should issue.i can not conclude that the state described as avoiding delay or achieving so compelling as to necessitate treating what is manifestly a tro as a preliminary injunction.indeed,such a conclusion can not be right for two reasons.
first,as a legal matter,the state contention provides grounds for converting every tro into a preliminary injunction,thereby eviscerating the distinctions between these two procedural devices.parties subjected to tro invariably have an interest in proceeding on schedule with whatever activity they intended to undertake prior to being restrained.the essence of a tro is to preserve the status quo by definition,then,its purpose is to prevent from happening an event that would otherwise happen.if an interest in avoiding any delay,no matter how brief,is a legitimate consideration in determining whether a tro is substantively a preliminary injunction,then tro could always be characterized as preliminary injunctions.this is exactly the majority mistake in its view,any tro that prevents an act from taking place as scheduled effectively operates as a preliminary injunction and can therefore be reviewed.
second,as a practical matter,the state interest in finality is simply not the type of interest that can be irreparably or even seriously harmed by the delay imposed by the district court tro.although the state interest in giving effect to workman death sentence is certainly recognized to be a strong one under applicable case law,it is not so strong as to amount to an inviolable interest in executing workman on may.as described above,the tro does no more than give the district court five additional days in which to decide whether a preliminary injunction should issue.and if the district court denies the preliminary injunction,the state can hardly complain that the minimal delay entailed in the issuance of the tro put it in a materially worse position.the state will be free to proceed with workman execution and,under tennessee law,it will not be required to take any action to do so,such as applying to the state supreme court for a new death warrant.the tennessee supreme court will automatically set a new execution date,which could be fixed as little as seven days from the date of the court new execution order.e.if the district court grants workman motion for a preliminary injunction,that order will be immediately appealable to this court,and nothing would stand in the way of the state requesting expedited review of its appeal.
because i believe that there is no doubt that the district court issued a tro and not a preliminary injunction,i would deny the state motion for lack of jurisdiction.
ii.standard of review abuse of discretion 
the district court decision to grant a temporary restraining order,when appealable,is reviewed by this court for abuse of discretion.ne.ohio coalition for the homeless,at.this court has stated many times that the standard is highly deferential to the judgment of the district court.see,united states owens,cir smith botsford,cir.indeed,w e will find an abuse of discretion only when we have a definite and firm conviction that the trial court committed a clear error of judgment.mitchell boelcke,cir.thus,so long as the district court acted within its sound discretion,we may not reverse its judgment even if we would have decided the matter differently.eeoc.state police dep t,cir.
whatever else may be said about the majority review of the district court order,it is not for an abuse of discretion.workman put before the district court an impressive record,particularly when considering that he was only at the tro stage,not the stage.as discussed in more detail below,workman filed an complaint detailing extensive allegations with respect to the constitutional infirmity of tennessee revised protocol.he further filed a memorandum in support of his motion for a tro,supported by exhibits,including,among other things,the revised protocol,affidavit testimony from two physicians familiar with protocols and their inherent risks,a recent medical study critical of lethal injection,and execution logs from two botched executions.besides the record,the district court had before it something that this court has not had the benefit of,namely,the parties themselves.even though it was operating under difficult time constraints,the district court heard oral argument from the parties and was able to test their respective positions.the transcript of the oral argument shows that the district judge was engaged with the difficult questions presented in workman motion and thoughtful in his assessment.tr.of dist.proceedings,motion for tro,may.
as discussed in more detail below,i simply can not say that the district court abused its discretion in issuing the tro.more importantly,the clear import of the majority holding is that virtually no defendant in workman an imminent execution under a protocol that may be make a sufficient showing to satisfy this court that a brief delay is warranted to determine whether a preliminary injunction should issue.the majority sets the bar extraordinarily high,and unnecessarily so given the limited nature of a tro.
iii.the four traditional tro factors 
each of the four traditional factors for equitable relief weighs in workman favor.the district judge was well within his discretion to so conclude.
success on the merits 
the eighth amendment bars executions that involve the unnecessary and wanton infliction of pain,gregg georgia,d,or that involve torture or a lingering death,in re kemmler.whether a particular execution procedure will inflict unnecessary pain is fundamentally an inquiry regarding whether the inmate is subject to an unnecessary risk of unconstitutional pain or suffering.cooper rimmer,cir emphasis added.workman has shown the likelihood of that risk here.
risk of unnecessary pain 
there is no dispute that the drugs used to execute tennessee inmates can inflict excruciating pain if not properly administered.yet tennessee revised protocol fails to provide for properly credentialed personnel to ensure that the drugs are properly administered.
but grave problems arise even before the drugs enter the inmate.for example,if the emt can not access the inmate particularly relevant here because of workman past intravenous drug revised protocol instructs that a doctor will conduct what is known as a procedure.workman mem.in support of motion for tro,ex,at.as columbia university anesthesiologist mark heath explains,this is an outdated method of achieving venous access for the administration of anesthetic drugs it has been virtually completely supplanted by the percutaneous technique,which is less invasive,less painful,less mutilating,faster,safer,and less expensive,ex,heath decl.at.using the method would defy contemporary medical standards and would be in violation of any modern standard of decency.id.tennessee adherence to this outdated method would represent the gratuitous infliction of pain and mutilation to the condemned prisoner.id.emphasis added.this explains why many states have abandoned this procedure for executions.id.
once a vein is through this unnecessary,mutilating first of the three drugs,sodium thiopental,is provided to anesthetize the inmate.properly providing this anesthetic is,of course,crucial to ensure lack of consciousness everyone recognizes that the next two drugs would otherwise inflict unbearable pain.
but there is a risk that workman will be conscious.sodium thiopental is an anesthetic that is extremely sensitive to errors in administration.id.thus,if the intended amount of sodium thiopental fails to reach the inmate brain,the duration of narcosis will be only brief and the inmate will reawaken during the execution process.id.yet the revised protocol does not require medically trained personnel to supervise or assist in the medical tasks necessary to prepare for the execution or during the execution.these critical tasks include mixing the solution setting up the iv line and associated equipment to ensure fluids do not leak and are not misdirected not an immaterial possibility considering that extensions extend into another that would not be permitted in a medical setting id.finding a usable vein and properly inserting the iv line in the proper direction in the vein and avoiding the risk that the inmate vein will rupture and the drugs will flow into the surrounding tissue.id.the president of the american society of anesthesiologists,writing about lethal injection,recently stated that the only way to assure a proper level of anesthesia would be to have an anesthesiologist prepare and administer the drugs,carefully observe the inmate and all pertinent monitors,and finally to integrate all this information.id.quoting orin guidry,message from the president.observations regarding lethal injection june.there is no evidence that anyone on the tennessee injection team has any training in administering anesthesia,or,if there is training,what that training might be.id.
most disturbingly,the revised protocol makes no mention of the need for effective monitoring of the inmate condition or whether he is anesthetized and unconscious after the iv lines are inserted.id.no medical personnel are permitted to be in the execution chamber during the administration of the drugs.id.in other words,there is no way to determine if something went wrong and the inmate is awake.monitoring consciousness is a regular part of the standard of care in many states for euthanizing dogs and cats.id.it should also be the standard for inmates.
in light of the possibility that the sodium thiopental will be improperly administered,and the inmate therefore will be improperly anesthetized,it is critical that execution personnel be able to ascertain if that occurs.but the second drug,pancuronium bromide,eliminates this possibility pancuronium is a neuromuscular blocking agent that paralyzes the inmate muscles.this paralytic effect is so complete that even an anesthesiologist in a clinical setting must vigilantly monitor diagnostic indicators to assess the anesthetic effect.id.because the drug does not affect the brain or nerves themselves,however,an unanesthetized patient remains completely conscious,and suffers slow suffocation and excruciating pain from the third drug potassium chloride,all while appearing to be in a peaceful sleep.see id.for this very reason,tennessee in declared the use of pancuronium bromide or any other neuromuscular blocking agent on animals inhumane and illegal.see ann.c j providing criminal sanctions for using any substance that acts as a neuromuscular blocking agent when euthanizing animals.thus,tennessee protects dogs and cats from the risk of excruciating pain in execution,but not inmates.
in this case,however,tennessee contends that pancuronium bromide serves useful purposes it speeds the death process,prevents involuntary muscular movement that may interfere with the functioning of the iv equipment,and contributes to the dignity of the death process.see workman mem.in support of motion for tro,ex.tennessee report on the administration of death
