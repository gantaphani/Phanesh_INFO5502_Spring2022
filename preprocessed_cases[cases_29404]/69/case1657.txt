sunglass hut international,lenscrafters,ray ban sun optics,luxottica group,and leonardo del vecchio collectively,sunglass hut appeal from the decision of the united states district court for the central district of california granting a preliminary injunction affecting certain of the defendants sunglass lenses that the court held to be likely to infringe oakley patent.oakley sunglass hut int l.because the court did not abuse its discretion in ordering the injunction,and because the injunction is not otherwise infirm,we affirm.
background 
oakley owns the patent,issued to william king and directed to a sunglass lens.the claimed lens comprises three layers a substrate,a middle semireflective layer,and an outer dielectric layer.patent,ll.the reflectance of the semireflective layer and the thickness of the dielectric layer must be such that a vivid colored appearance is produced by an interference differential effect of light reflected from the lens.id.at,to.claim of the patent,which defines the invention in terms of those limitations,reads as follows 
a lens for sunglasses to be worn by a wearer,comprising 
a light transmissive substrate constituting the lens body,and having a first side for facing the wearer and a second side of sic facing outwardly from the wearer,
a semireflective layer intimately bonded to the second side,and 
a dielectric layer over said semireflective layer,said dielectric layer being of substantially uniform thickness,
the reflectance of said semireflective layer and the thickness of said dielectric layer producing,at one or more wavelengths,a differential effect in intensity,of reflected light incident upon said lens from the direction faced by said second side,by interference between incident light reflected from said dielectric layer and light transmitted through said dielectric layer and reflected from said smireflecting sic layer,said differential effect altering the spectral distribution of light in an amount for producing a vivid colored appearance formed by said two layers when viewing toward the wearer from the direction faced by said second side.
id.at,emphases added.
the optics of the differential effect is illustrated in figure a of the patent,which follows 
as this drawing shows,light from the observer side of the lens is transmitted into a glass dielectric layer towards the wearer not shown.within the dielectric layer,the light reflects successively between the two interfaces of the dielectric layer,each time with diminishing amplitude.every internal reflection at the interface transmits light toward the observer,as depicted by rays,and.the phases of those light rays,after accounting for phase changes at interfaces,are dependent upon the thickness t of the dielectric layer,as that thickness determines the path lengths of the internal reflections.furthermore,the reflectance of the semireflective layer determines the strength of the internal reflections at the interface and hence the strength of the outwardly emanating rays,and.by choosing an appropriate thickness of the dielectric layer,t and reflectance of the semireflective layer,the inventors were able to construct the lens such that the rays,and constructively and destructively interfere with each other and with in varying strengths at given wavelengths.the invention of the patent is the basic lens structure depicted in figure a having a dielectric thickness and a semireflective reflectance value such that the cumulative effect of the interference among,is a differential effect producing a vivid colored appearance to the observer.
the specification sets forth a formula for calculating the differential effect,also called differential level,as follows 
differential level ir 
where ic is the enhanced intensity of reflected light at a given wavelength λc,and ir is a reference intensity,id.at,ll.the enhanced intensity ic is the algebraic sum of the reflected rays,ic for the lens shown in figure a,constructively interfering rays being added,and destructively interfering rays being subtracted.see id.at,ll.omitting the term because it is negligible.in the formula,different reference intensities are utilized throughout the specification.for example,the formula is first introduced with the random background intensity ib calculated as ib used as the reference.id.at,ll.later,the specification calculates ib as.id.at,ll.in other places,the reference is at an average noncoherent wavelength λa,calculated as.id.at,ll.in still other places,the specification utilizes as the reference the intensity of light at a different wavelength λd that is reflected from the lens in a net destructive fashion,id.at,ll.
the specification discloses a number of embodiments,and for each embodiment calculates a differential effect in multiple ways,under multiple circumstances.in the embodiment illustrated in figure a,reproduced above,in which the reflectance of the semireflective layer is,the specification calculates the differential effect to be above λd or above λa.id.at,ll.when that same embodiment is additionally subjected to light incident from the back surface of the lens,the specification calculates the differential effect above λ d to be in the worst case or in a realistic case.id.at,ll.in a similar embodiment,in which the reflectance of the semireflective layer is,the specification calculates the differential effect as above λd or above λa.id.at,to.in another embodiment having a different dielectric material,the maximum differential effect is purported to be.id.at.
in distinction to the claimed invention,which includes a semireflective middle layer,the patent disclaims the same basic lens structure having a middle layer that is highly reflective.such a lens is illustrated in the specification figure b,reproduced below 
as can be seen,the prior art depicted in figure b includes a reflectance middle layer where the figure a embodiment had a reflectance middle layer.the specification calculates the maximum differential effect for that prior art lens to be.id.at,ll.the specification explains that this is a poor result,stating interference colors on such highly reflecting metal surfaces therefore tend to be weak or washed out to the eye because of the small differential intensities involved.id.at,ll.
during prosecution of the application that led to the patent,the patent examiner rejected the claims as being unpatentable over patent,issued to joseph apfel,et.king overcame that rejection by amending the independent claim to include the phrase said differential effect altering the spectral distribution of light in an amount for producing a vivid colored appearance formed by said two layers when viewing toward the wearer from the direction faced by said second side.while acknowledging that apfel disclosed a lens structure resembling his claimed lens structure,king distinguished apfel lens from his invention on the basis of the reflectance of the middle layer and the resulting vividness.specifically,king represented to the examiner that apfel middle layer,being a material named inconel and having a thickness of angstroms,had a reflectance.thus,according to king,apfel did not disclose or suggest his invention vividly colored reflected light produced by interference.the patent and trademark office pto then issued the patent,and the patentability of claim was later confirmed in a reexamination proceeding 
oakley manufactures sunglasses having metallic green and blue colored lenses that oakley refers to as emerald and ice respectively.see oakley,at.according to oakley,those lenses have a vivid colored appearance and are covered by the patent.those sunglasses had been marketed exclusively by sunglass hut before luxottica group purchased sunglass hut.see id.after the purchase,sunglass hut began selling sunglasses manufactured by the other defendants,the lenses of which consist of a polycarbonate substrate with a polysiloxane hard coating,over which is applied a semireflective chromium layer,on which sits a silicon dioxide dielectric layer.id.at.
alleging that the sunglasses newly marketed by sunglass hut contained infringing lenses,oakley sued sunglass hut on november,for,inter alia,infringement of the patent,and sought a temporary restraining order tro and a preliminary injunction.id.at.the court entered the tro on november,and after briefing and argument,entered a preliminary injunction on december.id.the preliminary injunction order stated defendants are hereby enjoined from making,using,importing,selling,or offering to sell any products with emerald green or ice blue lenses that infringe the patent.id.at.
in granting the preliminary injunction,the court made findings favorable to oakley on the issues of irreparable harm,the balance of hardships,public interest,and likelihood of success on the merits.id.at.sunglass hut challenged oakley likelihood of success on the merits by arguing that the patent was invalid and not infringed.more specifically,sunglass hut made the following invalidity arguments the phrase vivid colored appearance is indefinite,in violation of,id.at apfel anticipates the patent claims and king misrepresented apfel to the pto,id.at certain foster grant sunglass lenses in existence more than one year before the filing of the application that led to the patent anticipate the patent claims,id.at and the claims would have been obvious,in violation of,in view of certain prior art references,id.at.the court did not agree with sunglass hut that any of its arguments raised a substantial question of invalidity.see id.at.on the issue of likelihood of infringement,the court did not accept sunglass hut argument that king prosecution comments regarding apfel disclaimed coverage of its products,whose color peaks are less than apfel.id.at.
sunglass hut appeals from the district court grant of the preliminary injunction.we have jurisdiction under c in view of a and a.
discussion 
a decision to grant or deny a preliminary injunction is within the sound discretion of the district court,based upon its assessment of four factors the likelihood of the patentee success on the merits irreparable harm if the injunction is not granted the balance of hardships between the parties and the public interest.we review the district court decision for an abuse of discretion,a lapse that occurs when the decision is premised on an error of law,a clearly erroneous finding of fact,or a clear error of judgment in weighing the factors.id.to the extent the court decision depends upon an issue of law,we review that issue de novo.tate access floors,interface architectural resources.

an assessment of the likelihood of validity of a patent claim over the prior art also involves a process.the first step is the same claim construction implicated in an infringement analysis.see smiths indus.med,vital signs.the second step involves a comparison of the asserted claims with the prior art.a determination that a claim is invalid as being anticipated or lacking novelty under requires a finding that each and every limitation is found either expressly or inherently in a single prior art reference.celeritas techs.rockwell int l.whether a claim would have been obvious within the meaning of is a question of law based on underlying findings of fact.smiths,at,at citing graham john deere,d.we review a district court underlying findings of fact for clear error,while we rule de novo on the ultimate issue of obviousness.id.at,at.because an issued patent is presumed to be valid,the evidentiary burden to show facts supporting a conclusion of invalidity is clear and convincing evidence,wms gaming int l game.

sunglass hut argues in this appeal that it raised below substantial questions concerning,inter alia,the indefiniteness,anticipation,and noninfringement of the patent claims.sunglass hut also contends that the court clearly erred in evaluating irreparable harm and the balance of hardships.finally,sunglass hut contends that the court injunctive order fails to comply with the specificity requirements of.d.
claim definiteness 
sunglass hut argues that the phrase vivid colored appearance appearing in claim is indefinite.even if vividness is based on the disclosed differential effect,according to sunglass hut,one skilled in the art can not tell which values of differential effect qualify as vivid and which do not.sunglass hut further contends that the district court did not and could not define the bounds of the phrase.
oakley responds that the phrase can be defined from the structure,formula,and examples disclosed in the patent.oakley cites the proposition that compliance with section,paragraph,does not require a particular number as a cutoff.according to oakley,the specification numerical examples,including some values of differential effect that do create a vivid colored appearance and one that does not,are sufficient.
we agree with oakley that sunglass hut has not raised a substantial question as to whether the phrase vivid colored appearance renders the claims indefinite in violation of.that paragraph provides the specification shall conclude with one or more claims particularly pointing out and distinctly claiming the subject matter which the applicant regards as his invention.the primary purpose of the definiteness requirement is to ensure that the claims are written in such a way that they give notice to the public of the extent of the legal protection afforded by the patent,so that interested members of the public,competitors of the patent owner,can determine whether or not they infringe.that determination requires a construction of the claims according to the familiar canons of claim construction.all dental prodx,llc advantage dental,citations omitted.
one of those canons is that claims are construed as one skilled in the art would understand them in light of the specification of which they are a part.orthokinetics,safety travel chairs.indeed,a patentee may be his or her own lexicographer by defining the claim terms.another one of those canons is that a patentee need not define his invention with mathematical precision in order to comply with the definiteness requirement.in re marosi,uspq.in marosi,we held that the phrase essentially free of alkali metal was not indefinite,where the specification defined it as containing only residual impurities,such as ppm parts per million.id.at,uspq at.marosi disclaimed a level of ppm disclosed in the prior art,and the pto took the position that one skilled in the art would not know where to draw the line between ppm and ppm.id.we sided with marosi,explaining that his invention does not reside in such a number and that a skilled artisan would draw that line between unavoidable impurities and essential ingredients.id.at,uspq at.
unlike the situation in marosi,the numerical value of the differential effect in this case is a distinguishing feature over the prior art.that is so because the language of the claim associates vividness with the differential effect,and the specification presents examples of numerical values of the differential effect that either qualify as vivid or do not.more precisely,the language of the claim itself confirms that the lens vivid colored appearance results directly from the differential effect.patent,ll.reciting said differential effect producing a vivid colored appearance in claim.moreover,the claim itself defines the lens structural attributes that produce the differential effect.id.at,ll.reciting the reflectance of said semireflective layer and the thickness of said dielectric layer producing a differential effect.
accordingly,the specification presents a formula for calculating the differential effect for a number of examples in which the differential effect is either great enough to produce a vivid colored appearance or not.those values that qualify as producing a vivid colored appearance range from to under various circumstances,whereas the only disclosed value of maximum differential effect that does not produce a vivid colored appearance is.id.at,ll.thus,while the specification does not indicate so explicitly,the dividing line must be somewhere between and.although the difference between those values is seemingly slight,and comparison of one differential effect value to another may present an problem due to the different reference intensities involved,the specification purports to indicate that the difference is significant,brushing aside any comparison difficulties.see patent,ll.purporting that differential effects of above λd and above λa are much larger than the found for the reflecting case emphasis added see also id.at,ll.purporting that is much greater than that obtained for a reflecting layer case emphasis added.faced with those examples and comments,we conclude that one skilled in the art would,in reasonable likelihood,understand that a lens exhibiting a maximum differential effect not substantially greater than does not have a vivid colored appearance.
indeed,we conclude that one skilled in the art would interpret the phrase vivid colored appearance in light of the specification to require that the maximum differential effect equal or exceed about,and we thus construe the phrase for purposes of the preliminary injunction.
that is not to say that sunglass hut can not ultimately succeed on the merits of its indefiniteness argument later in the litigation,after further development of the record.we simply hold that,recognizing the presumption of validity and the fact that the patent has already been subjected to reexamination,oakley has at this point in the case shown that it is reasonably likely to withstand such a validity challenge.
anticipation 
sunglass hut,once again attempting to take another bite at apfel,argues that apfel,particularly figures of the apfel patent,anticipates claim.according to sunglass hut,the pto allowed the patent claims over apfel only because king misrepresented to the pto that apfel middle layer of inconel is reflective,rather than semireflective,as called for in claim.to support its allegation of misrepresentation,sunglass hut points to other,allegedly inconsistent statements by king concerning apfel.
oakley responds that apfel middle layer is highly reflective and thus no different from the admitted prior art depicted in figure b of the patent.oakley also contends that the pto twice allowed the patent claims over apfel,and that king statements concerning the reflectivity of apfel inconel layer,when properly understood,are neither inconsistent nor misrepresentative of the facts of apfel disclosure.
sunglass hut apfel argument succeeds no better here than it has previously.we agree with oakley that apfel,like figure b,is different from what is claimed in the patent.apfel discloses a number of multilayer lenses,the relevant one of which is a lens depicted in figure.patent.the three layers are a substrate,a metal layer,and a dielectric layer,in that order.id.at,ll.the metal layer is further described as being inconel millimicrons thick.id.at,ll.apfel states that an object of his invention is to provide strong color.id.at,ll,ll.whether apfel strong color equates with vivid colored appearance as that phrase is used in the patent we need not decide for the patent claims cover only lenses having a vivid colored appearance,provided,inter alia,that the middle layer is semireflective.
sunglass hut only evidence that apfel metal layer is semireflective seems to be king deposition testimony that inconel reflectance is very low and king statements during prosecution of another patent application,in which sunglass hut contends that king stated that the same reflectance is.both of those statements,according to sunglass hut,contradict king statement before the pto during prosecution of the application that led to the patent that apfel metal layer is a thick metal layer angstroms of inconel which is essentially a mirror having reflectance.
the district court found sunglass hut evidence unconvincing,noting that the pto twice allowed the claims over apfel.oakley,at.we perceive no clear error in that finding.first,sunglass hut interpretation of king prosecution comments in the other patent application is a strained one.secondly,king apparently inconsistent deposition comment can be squared with his prosecution statements by the fact that the reflectance of a layer of inconel depends upon the thickness of the layer.
in sum,sunglass hut has not raised a substantial question whether apfel anticipates the patent claims.of course,as the litigation progresses sunglass hut may try to present even more evidence,physical measurements of the lenses apfel describes that apfel metal layer is semireflective and that apfel disclosed lenses otherwise satisfy all of the claim limitations.
foster grant 
sunglass hut next argues that certain sunglass lenses sold by foster grant more than one year before the filing of king application are prior art to the patent under b.to support this assertion,sunglass hut submitted a number of declarations describing the foster grant lenses.according to sunglass hut,those declarations corroborate each other and are corroborated by contemporaneous memoranda.sunglass hut contends that the court failed to recognize that corroboration and,moreover,misread the declarations when it found that the foster grant lenses were like those depicted in figure b in the patent and therefore lacked a vivid colored appearance.
oakley responds that the declarations do not establish that the reflectance of the middle layer and thickness of the dielectric layer in the foster grant lenses created a differential effect,as claim requires.oakley also contends that the supposed corroboration is similarly deficient,and that the declarations can not each other.
we agree with oakley that the district court finding that the foster grant declarations fail to raise a substantial question of anticipation is not clearly erroneous.while the foster grant declarations do state that the foster grant prior art lenses had a vivid colored appearance produced by a differential effect between light reflected from the dielectric and light transmitted through the dielectric and reflected from the semireflective chromium layer,declaration of theodore haddad at,oakley,no.sa cv ahs,such statements are conclusory.for example,no basis is provided to explain why the chromium layer is asserted to be semireflective.moreover,the declarations fail to address whether the thickness of the dielectric layer is causally related to the alleged differential effect.as another example,there is no quantitative assessment of the differential effect to support the conclusion that a vivid colored appearance is produced.
because the foster grant declarations are facially deficient,whether corroborated or not,we need not address the corroboration issue.we caution again that our decision on this issue at this stage in the case carries no implication that sunglass hut can not prevail on the merits after fuller development of the evidence.
we have considered sunglass hut other arguments concerning the validity of the patent,including its argument that it raised a substantial question of obviousness under.those arguments are not persuasive at this stage,and we now conclude that oakley is reasonably likely to succeed on the merits at trial against all of sunglass hut validity challenges.
infringement 
the preliminary injunction against sunglass hut can be upheld only if oakley has demonstrated a reasonable likelihood of prevailing on the infringement issue at trial.see,at,at.oakley can meet that burden,once the construction of the relevant claim limitations has been settled,with evidence that each claim limitation is likely present in the accused lenses.see id.
in this case,we,not the district court,have provided the construction of one of the relevant claim limitations vivid colored appearance.because the parties before the district court did not have the benefit of our construction in terms of quantitative differential effect,oakley did not present evidence of infringement tracking that construction nor did sunglass hut have an opportunity to respond to the infringement issue in terms of that construction.rather than construing the language and determining whether the accused lenses meet that aspect of the claims,the district court focused its infringement analysis on the structure of the accused lenses.in particular,the court made factual findings regarding the thickness of the accused dielectric layer,oakley,at paragraph,and the reflectivity of the accused semireflective layer,id.at paragraph.sunglass hut does not challenge those findings.accepting those findings,we are faced with the question whether it is reasonably likely that the patentee would establish at trial that the accused lenses satisfy the vivid colored appearance limitation as we have construed that language.if so,then remand would be an inefficient use of judicial resources.
we conclude that the court undisputed factual findings do establish that oakley has indeed shown a likelihood of infringement.in making the pertinent factual findings regarding the structure of the accused lenses,the district court relied heavily on the declaration of oakley optics expert,jack feinberg.as explained in the part of that declaration cited by the court,the thickness of the dielectric layer and the reflectivity of the semireflective layer in the sunglass hut lenses are within the same ranges as the embodiments disclosed in the patent specification.because those disclosed embodiments have a differential effect sufficient to produce a vivid colored appearance,the accused lenses should necessarily also exhibit a differential effect that produces a vivid colored appearance.it follows that oakley evidence of structural similarity is indirect evidence of a sufficiently high differential effect.thus,the district court factual findings support its conclusion that the accused lenses are likely to infringe.
sunglass hut argues that the prosecution history limits the meaning of the phrase vivid colored appearance to color peaks having a magnitude greater than those depicted in apfel figure.because the accused lenses have smaller color peaks,sunglass hut contends that they can not infringe.oakley responds that sunglass hut did not propose such a construction to the district court,and that we should therefore not consider it.oakley further responds that the prosecution history distinguished apfel on the basis of the lens structure,not the magnitude of color peaks.oakley further contends that sunglass hut proposed construction of the phrase vivid colored appearance would exclude the preferred embodiment,and that sunglass hut has not disputed that the accused lenses are similar to the patent preferred embodiment.
sunglass hut proposed construction of the phrase vivid colored appearance is based on an incorrect reading of the prosecution history.as discussed above,king distinguished his invention from apfel during prosecution on the basis of the lens structure,specifically the fact that apfel middle layer was not semireflective.although king also stated that apfel figure does not indicate a strong color peak,that one vague statement from the prosecution history does not have much bearing on the meaning of the claim phrase vivid colored appearance,which we derive from the specification clear teachings,as detailed above.sunglass hut has therefore not made convincing arguments that the district court erred in finding a reasonable likelihood that oakley would succeed on the merits of its infringement assertion.
in sum,because oakley presented evidence sufficient to establish a likelihood of infringement,we affirm the district court finding of a likelihood of infringement 
irreparable harm 
sunglass hut principally argues that because oakley failed to make a strong showing of likely success on the merits,irreparable harm can not be presumed.oakley responds that it is entitled to the presumption.furthermore,oakley contends that it established actual irreparable harm by evidence of exclusive market share and sunglass hut sizable impending marketing efforts.
we agree with oakley that it has made a sufficiently strong showing of likelihood of success on the merits to entitle it to a presumption of irreparable harm.see,at,at irreparable harm is presumed when a clear showing of patent validity and infringement has been made.while the merits issues discussed above are close,they favor oakley.thus,we agree with the district court that oakley has established a presumption of irreparable harm.in fact,because the district court found that sunglass hut was poised to release huge numbers of the enjoined sunglasses,oakley,at,the presumption is.that finding is not clearly erroneous.
balance of hardships 
sunglass hut argues that the court performed no true balancing when the court likened sunglass hut hardship to that of the typical infringer.according to sunglass hut,it is the party suffering irreparable harm by having to recall products on the shelf.oakley responds that the court did properly balance the hardships,and that sunglass hut claim of irreparable harm on its part is belied by its press release following the issuance of the tro admitting that sales to that point had been insignificant.
we conclude that the court factual finding regarding the balance of hardships is not clearly erroneous.the court expressly acknowledged that the injunction would cause sunglass hut some hardship,but the court determined that the harm to oakley without issuance of the injunction would be greater.that determination was supported by ample evidence and was not clearly erroneous.
adequacy of the injunctive order under rule d 
sunglass hut final argument is that the injunctive order does not satisfy the specificity requirement of.d because sunglass hut does not sell lenses or sunglasses denominated ice blue or emerald green,which are oakley trade names.sunglass hut further contends that the order is not limited to the accused lenses,nor does it specify which shades of green or blue are infringing.according to sunglass hut,its recall may have been too broad or too narrow,and the order vagueness prevents it from designing around the patent.
oakley responds that the order reference to colors is sufficiently specific,and that the order is clear in the context of the record in this case.moreover,according to oakley,sunglass hut understands the scope of the order,as evidenced by its response to the tro.
we agree with oakley that the order complies with rule d,which states 
every order granting an injunction and every restraining order shall set forth the reasons for its issuance,shall be specific in terms,shall describe in reasonable detail,and not by reference to the complaint or other documents,the act or acts sought to be restrained 
d.the purposes of that rule are to minimize confusion as to how the enjoined party can conform its conduct with the order,int l longshoremen ass n,local
