this indemnity case concerns litigation in the residential construction industry.specifically,we examine a synthetic stucco manufacturer duty to indemnify a contractor under chapter of the texas civil practice and remedies code.two threshold questions are paramount is synthetic stucco a product and is the contractor that installs it on a house a seller we answer yes to both,meaning chapter applies.we also conclude that the manufacturer statutory obligation to indemnify the contractor covers a settlement payment made by the contractor to the homebuilder where the contractor may have been independently obligated by contract to indemnify the homebuilder.we therefore affirm in part and reverse in part the court of appeals judgment,and render judgment for fresh coat,in accord with the trial court original judgment.
background 
manufactures synthetic stucco components that are collectively referred to as eif s,an acronym for exterior insulation and finishing system.fresh coat,contracted with a homebuilder,life forms,to install eifs on the exterior walls of several homes that life forms was building.fresh coat purchased eifs and installed it with the help of instructions and training.
over homeowners sued,life forms,and fresh coat,alleging the eifs allowed water penetration that in turn caused structural damage,termite problems,and mold.the plaintiffs alleged the eifs was defectively designed,manufactured,and marketed,and also asserted claims for negligence,deceptive trade practices,negligent misrepresentation,and breach of warranty.life forms filed against fresh coat and,seeking indemnity for losses from the homeowners claims.fresh coat sought indemnity from.
life forms,and fresh coat settled with the homeowners.fresh coat paid the homeowners just over million.fresh coat also settled with life forms,paying million to cover part of life forms payment to the homeowners.the case proceeded to trial on various claims the defendants brought against each other.this appeal concerns claims fresh coat asserted against.fresh coat sought indemnity from for its settlements with the homeowners and life forms,as well as in attorney fees.the claims were tried to a jury,and fresh coat received a judgment for all the damages requested.
the court of appeals affirmed the trial court judgment except with regard to the settlement payment fresh coat made to life forms the court rejected arguments that its eifs was not a product and that fresh coat was not a seller,and upheld the indemnity award as to the payment to the homeowners.however,with respect to fresh coat settlement with life forms,the court agreed with that it owed fresh coat no statutory indemnity duty because fresh coat would have been liable to life forms under the contract between the two regardless of whether either of them caused a defect in the eifs.
and fresh coat each filed petitions in this court.argues that the court of appeals erred in awarding fresh coat indemnification for the homeowners settlement because under chapter eifs is not a product,and fresh coat is not a seller fresh coat argues that the court of appeals erred in denying fresh coat indemnity from for fresh coat settlement with life forms.
ii.discussion 
chapter governs a manufacturer indemnity obligations arising from a products liability action.section a states 
a manufacturer shall indemnify and hold harmless a seller against loss arising out of a products liability action,except for any loss caused by the seller negligence,intentional misconduct,or other act or omission,such as negligently modifying or altering the product,for which the seller is independently liable.
is eifs a product under chapter 
section a applies to losses arising from a action,which section defines as 
any action against a manufacturer or seller for recovery of damages arising out of personal injury,death,or property damage allegedly caused by a defective product whether the action is based in strict tort liability,strict products liability,negligence,misrepresentation,breach of express or implied warranty,or any other theory or combination of theories.
argues that eifs was not a defective product for purposes of chapter.claims the product was the finished eifs wall of the home,if not the home,while fresh coat argues that life forms purchased eifs components plus the services required for its installation,and that the synthetic stucco system is the product.does not dispute that eifs is a product as it was sold by rather claims that,after the eifs components were purchased by fresh coat,they were not resold as products.
under definition of product,products that become part of homes can not be the subject of indemnity claims by homebuilders and their contractors if those homebuilders and contractors are sued by homeowners.instead,claims that products placed into the stream of commerce are not products once they become integrated into a house,which is real property,even if they were products for all purposes beforehand.we agree with the court of appeals that chapter contains no such limitation.
chapter itself does not define product,but it defines seller as a person who is engaged in the business of distributing or otherwise placing,for any commercial purpose,in the stream of commerce for use or consumption a product or any component part thereof 
from that definition,a product is something distributed or otherwise placed,for any commercial purpose,into the stream of commerce for use or consumption.
we hold that the eifs provided by fresh coat was a product as that word is used in the text of chapter.does not dispute that it is a manufacturer under chapter and that it placed its it admits is a the stream of commerce.as the court of appeals noted,the record establishes that the eifs is a synthetic stucco system made of component parts manufactured by.likewise,the eifs was used by life forms in the construction of homes,in addition to whatever use it was put to by homeowners.at least as to fresh coat transaction with life forms,the eifs was used.
other definitions of product also comport with how products are described in chapter.black law dictionary defines product as s omething that is distributed commercially for use or consumption and that is usu ally tangible personal property,the result of fabrication or processing,and an item that has passed through a chain of commercial distribution before ultimate use or consumption.the third restatement of torts uses a similar definition for product 
a product is tangible personal property distributed commercially for use or consumption.other items,such as real property and electricity,are products when the context of their distribution and use is sufficiently analogous to the distribution and use of tangible personal property 
each party argues that comment e to section of the restatement supports that party own definition of product.however,comment e merely addresses whether a person is a product seller,not whether something is a product.even so,it is unclear from comment e whether things such as that may become attachments to real property for other legal be considered products 
chapter definition of manufacturer is also instructive.section defines manufacturer as 
a person who is a designer,formulator,constructor,rebuilder,fabricator,producer,compounder,processor,or assembler of any product or any component part thereof and who places the product or any component part thereof in the stream of commerce.
under this definition,a manufacturer is anyone who builds,formulates,or assembles the product or any component part thereof.thus,even if were correct that an eifs wall is the relevant product,a manufacturer may be liable for defects in any component part thereof.this language suggests the word product should not be read narrowly to exclude eifs.
none of the sources discussed above,including chapter,except from the definition of product those things that may become an integral part of a home.moreover,the legislature could have easily excluded such products from the definition of product,or from products liability actions as that term is defined in chapter.the legislature could have added a few words to carve out com
