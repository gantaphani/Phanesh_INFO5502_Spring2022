veoh networks veoh operates a publicly accessible website that enables users to share videos with other users.universal music group umg is one of the world largest recorded music and music publishing companies,and includes record labels such as motown,def jam and geffen.in addition to producing and distributing recorded music,umg produces music videos.although veoh has implemented various procedures to prevent copyright infringement through its system,users of veoh service have in the past been able,without umg authorization,to download videos containing songs for which umg owns the copyright.umg responded by filing suit against veoh for direct and secondary copyright infringement.the district court granted summary judgment to veoh after determining that it was protected by the digital millennium copyright act dmca safe harbor limiting service providers liability for infringement of copyright by reason of the storage at the direction of a user of material that resides on a system or network controlled or operated by or for the service provider.c.we agree,and accordingly affirm.
veoh allows people to share video content over the internet.users can view videos uploaded by other users as well as authorized partner content made available by major copyright holders such as sonybmg,abc and espn.there are two ways to use veoh service through a standalone software client application launched in late,or through the website launched in early that users access via a standard web browser.both services are provided free of charge.veoh generates revenue from advertising displayed along with the videos.as of april,veoh had well over a million videos available for viewing,and users had uploaded more than four million videos to veoh.
before a user may share a video through veoh,he must register at by providing an email address,user name and password.he must then state that he has read and agreed to veoh publisher terms and conditions ptc.the ptc instructs users that they may not submit material that contains any infringing or illegal content and directs that they may only upload and publish material on the veoh service to which they have sufficient rights and licenses to permit the distribution of their material via the veoh services.the ptc agreement also gives veoh a license to publicly display,publicly perform,transmit,distribute,copy,store,reproduce provide the uploaded video through the veoh service,either in its original form,copy or in the form of an encoded work.
a user who wants to share a video must also agree to veoh terms of use,which give veoh a license to use,reproduce,modify,distribute,prepare derivative works of,display,publish,perform and transmit the video.the terms of use provide that you expressly represent and warrant that you own or have the necessary licenses,rights,consents,and permissions to use and authorize veoh to use all copyright or other proprietary rights in and to any and all material shared on veoh.users must agree not to a take any action or b upload,download,post,submit or otherwise distribute or facilitate distribution of any material through the veoh service,that infringes any copyright.once a user agrees to the ptc and terms of use,he may upload a video.each time a user begins to upload a video to veoh website,a message appears stating,do not upload videos that infringe copyright,are pornographic,obscene,violent,or any other videos that violate veoh terms of use.
when a video is uploaded,various automated processes take place.veoh software automatically breaks down the video file into smaller kilobyte chunks,which facilitate making the video accessible to others.veoh software also automatically converts,or transcodes,the video file into flash format.this is done because the vast majority of internet users have software that can play videos in this format.veoh presets the requisite settings for the flash conversion.if the user is a pro user,veoh software also converts the uploaded video into flash and mpeg formats,which are playable on some portable devices.accordingly,when a pro user uploads a video,veoh automatically creates and retains four copies the chunked file,the flash file,the flash file and the mpeg file.none of these automated conversions affects the content of the video.
veoh computers also automatically extract metadata from information users provide to help others locate the video for viewing.users can provide a title,as well as tags or keywords that describe the video,and can also select categories describing the video,such as music,faith or politics.the veoh system then automatically assigns every uploaded video a permalink,or web address,that uniquely identifies the video and makes it available to users.veoh employees do not review the video,title or tags before the video is made available 
veoh system allows users to access shared videos in two ways.first,the video may be streamed from a server,whereby the user web browser begins displaying the video almost immediately,before the entire file has been transmitted to the user computer.depending on whether the user stops his web browser from streaming the full video,a partial or full copy of the video is stored temporarily on the user computer.second,the user can download a copy of the video through veoh website or client software application.veoh transfers a chunked copy of the file to the user computer,and the software reassembles the chunks into a viewable copy.the downloaded file is stored on the user computer in a veoh directory,which gives veoh the ability to terminate access to the files.
veoh employs various technologies to automatically prevent copyright infringement on its system.in,veoh adopted hash filtering software.whenever veoh disables access to an infringing video,the hash filter also automatically disables access to any identical videos and blocks any subsequently submitted duplicates.veoh also began developing an additional filtering method of its own,but in opted instead to adopt a filtering solution produced by a company called audible magic.audible magic technology takes audio fingerprints from video files and compares them to a database of copyrighted content provided by copyright holders.if a user attempts to upload a video that matches a fingerprint from audible magic database of forbidden material,the video never becomes available for viewing.approximately nine months after beginning to apply the audible magic filter to all newly uploaded videos,veoh applied the filter to its backlog of previously uploaded videos.this resulted in the removal of more than videos,including some incorporating umg works.veoh has also implemented a policy for terminating users who repeatedly upload infringing material,and has terminated thousands of user accounts.
despite veoh efforts to prevent copyright infringement on its system,both veoh and umg agree that some of veoh users were able to download unauthorized videos containing songs for which umg owns the copyright.the parties also agree that before umg filed its complaint,the only notices veoh received regarding alleged infringements of umg works were sent by the recording industry association of america riaa.the riaa notices listed specific videos that were allegedly infringing,and included links to those videos.the notices did not assert rights to all works by the identified artists,and did not mention umg.umg does not dispute that veoh removed the material located at the links identified in the riaa notices.
in september,umg filed suit against veoh for direct,vicarious and contributory copyright infringement,and for inducement of infringement.umg contended that veoh efforts to prevent copyright infringement on its system were too little too late because veoh did not adopt filtering technology until after veoh harbored infringing material for its own benefit,and initially it ran the filters only on newly uploaded videos.umg also argued that veoh remove d copyrighted material only if identified specifically in a notice of infringement,and e ven then,veoh would only remove the video associated with the particular url and copies of that same video.
in umg first amended complaint fac,it added three of veoh investors as defendants on theories of secondary liability the investor defendants sought dismissal of umg fac for failure to state a claim against them under federal rule of civil procedure b.the district court granted the motion to dismiss without prejudice and umg filed a second amended complaint sac.the investor defendants again moved to dismiss,and the district court dismissed the claims against the investor defendants with prejudice,holding that umg allegations amounted to little more than what is legally and customarily required of corporate board members.final judgment on that ground was entered on june.
veoh asserted as an affirmative defense that it is protected by the dmca safe harbor provisions.umg moved for partial summary judgment that veoh is not entitled to protection under the c safe harbor because the alleged infringement did not qualify as by reason of the storage of material at the direction of a user.the district court disagreed and denied umg motion.see umg recordings,veoh networks umg i,d.veoh then moved for summary judgment on the basis that it satisfied the remaining requirements of c.judge matz granted the motion in a careful and comprehensive decision holding that veoh met all the c requirements and was thus entitled to dmca safe harbor protection.see umg recordings,veoh networks umg ii,d.the parties thereafter stipulated to final judgment,which was entered on november.
veoh moved for an award of costs and attorney fees under federal rule of civil procedure and the copyright act.although the district court found that veoh was the prevailing party on the core issue in the litigation,the court declined to exercise its discretion to award veoh fees under because veoh failed to demonstrate that umg legal challenge was improper,in bad faith,or contrary to the purposes of the copyright act.because the court concluded fees were not properly awardable under,it also denied veoh fees and costs under rule.veoh does not challenge the denial of fees under,but appeals the denial of rule costs and fees.umg appeals the entry of summary judgment in veoh favor and the dismissal of its complaint against the investor defendants.

difficult and controversial questions of copyright liability in the online world prompted congress to enact title ii of the dmca,the online copyright infringement liability limitation act ocilla.ellison robertson,cir.congress recognized that i n the ordinary course of their operations service providers must engage in all kinds of acts that expose them to potential copyright infringement liability,at.although congress was aware that the services provided by companies like veoh are capable of being misused to facilitate copyright infringement,it was loath to permit the specter of liability to chill innovation that could also serve substantial socially beneficial functions.congress decided that by limiting service providers liability,it would ensure that the efficiency of the internet will continue to improve and that the variety and quality of services on the internet will continue to expand.id.to that end,ocilla created four safe harbors that preclude imposing monetary liability on service providers for copyright infringement that occurs as a result of specified activities.the district court concluded that veoh qualified for one such safe harbor,under c.umg challenges that determination and the consequent entry of summary judgment in veoh favor.
there are a number of requirements that must be met for a service provider like veoh to receive c safe harbor protection section c provides in relevant part 
c information residing on systems or networks at direction of users.
in general.a service provider shall not be liable for monetary relief,or,except as provided in subsection j,for injunctive or other equitable relief,for infringement of copyright by reason of the storage at the direction of a user of material that resides on a system or network controlled or operated by or for the service provider,if the service provider 
a i does not have actual knowledge that the material or an activity using the material on the system or network is infringing 
ii in the absence of such actual knowledge,is not aware of facts or circumstances from which infringing activity is apparent or 
iii upon obtaining such knowledge or awareness,acts expeditiously to remove,or disable access to,the material 
b does not receive a financial benefit directly attributable to the infringing activity,in a case in which the service provider has the right and ability to control such activity and 
c upon notification of claimed infringement as described in paragraph,responds expeditiously to remove,or disable access to,the material that is claimed to be infringing or to be the subject of infringing activity.
on appeal,umg contends that three of these requirements were not met.first,umg argues that the alleged infringing activities do not fall within the plain meaning of infringement of copyright by reason of the storage of material at the direction of a user,a threshold requirement under c.second,umg argues that genuine issues of fact remain about whether veoh had actual knowledge of infringement,or was aware of facts or circumstances from which infringing activity wa s apparent under c a.finally,umg argues that it presented sufficient evidence that veoh receive d a financial benefit directly attributable to infringing activity that it had the right and ability to control under c b.we disagree on each count,and accordingly we affirm the district court 
we must first decide whether the functions automatically performed by veoh software when a user uploads a video fall within the meaning of by reason of the storage at the direction of a user.c.although umg concedes that s torage on computers involves making a copy of the underlying data,it argues that nothing in the ordinary definition of storage encompasses the automatic processes undertaken to facilitate public access to videos.facilitation of access,umg argues,goes beyond storage.therefore the creation of chunked and flash files and the streaming and downloading of videos fall outside c.umg also contends that these automatic processes are not undertaken at the direction of the user.
the district court concluded that umg reading of c was too narrow,wrongly requiring that the infringing conduct be storage,rather than be by reason of the storage,as its terms provide.umg i,d at quoting c emphasis in original.we agree that the phrase by reason of the storage at the direction of the user is broader causal language than umg contends,clearly meant to cover more than mere electronic storage lockers.id.at.we hold that the language and structure of the statute,as well as the legislative intent that motivated its enactment,clarify that c encompasses the processes that automatically occur when a user uploads a video to veoh.
umg argument that the district court too broadly construed the scope of c rests in part on umg contention that the dmca by reason of language should be interpreted in the same way as similar language in the racketeer influenced and corrupt organizations act rico.rico provides that a ny person injured in his business or property by reason of a violation of section of this chapter may sue therefor.c.in holmes securities investor protection corp,the supreme court held that rico by reason of language required proximate causation.umg contends that we should thus read c by reason of storage to mean that infringement must be proximately caused by the storage,rather than caused by the access that the storage facilitates.
ordinarily we presume that similar language in similar statutes should be interpreted similarly.united states sioux,cir see also northcross bd.of educ.of memphis city,noting that the similarity of language in two statutes is an indicator that the statutes should be interpreted pari passu,particularly when they share a common raison internal quotations omitted.in this case,however,there are important differences between the statutes and their purposes.the reasoning underlying holmes counsels against extending its reading to the dmca,and the language and structure of c compel us to conclude that it should not be interpreted in the same manner as rico.
the holmes court began its analysis by recognizing that by reason of can,of course,be read to mean that the defendant violation was a but for cause of plaintiff injury.at ultimately,however,holmes held that the unlikelihood that congress meant to allow all factually injured plaintiffs to recover persuades us that rico should not get such an expansive reading.id.at.holmes explained that t he key to the better interpretation lies in some statutory history,and traced the by reason of language back to of the clayton act,which courts had long held required proximate causation.id.at.because rico was specifically modeled on,holmes concluded that the clayton act interpretation was particularly persuasive.see id.at.
holmes also explained that such directness of relationship between the harm and the alleged wrong is a central element of clayton act causation for three primary reasons,and,significantly,concluded that all three apply with equal force to suits under rico.id.at.first,the less direct an injury is,the more difficult it becomes to ascertain the amount of a plaintiff damages attributable to the violation.id.at.second,recognizing claims of the indirectly injured would force courts to adopt complicated rules apportioning damages among plaintiffs removed at different levels of injury from the violative acts,to obviate the risk of multiple recoveries.id.and,finally,the need to grapple with these problems is simply unjustified by the general interest in deterring injurious conduct,since directly injured victims can generally be counted on to vindicate the law as private attorneys general,without any of the problems attendant upon suits by plaintiffs injured more remotely.id.at.
none of these concerns applies to the dmca,which,unlike the clayton act and rico,involves a narrow affirmative defense rather than the expansion of liability.further,unlike in holmes,there is no indication that congress modeled the dmca on the clayton act or rico.we are therefore doubtful that in this quite different context,holmes strict reading of by reason of is what congress intended 
our doubts are confirmed by the fact that umg reading of the by reason of language would create internal statutory conflicts.by its terms,c presupposes that service providers will provide access to users stored material,and we would thus contravene the statute if we held that such access disqualified veoh from the safe harbor.section c codifies a detailed notice and takedown procedure by which copyright holders inform service providers of infringing material accessible through their sites,and service providers then disable access to such materials.c a iii,c c c a iii emphasis added.this carefully considered protocol,and the statute attendant references to disabl ing access to infringing materials,see,would be superfluous if we accepted umg constrained reading of the statute.see greenwood compucredit,cir we must,if possible,interpret a statute such that all its language is given effect,and none of it is rendered superfluous.citing trw andrews.indeed,it is not clear how copyright holders could even discover infringing materials on service providers sites to notify them as the protocol dictates if c did not contemplate that there would be access to the materials 
we do not find persuasive umg effort to reconcile the internal contradictions its reading of the statute creates by positing that congress must have meant c to protect only web hosting services.web hosts host websites on their servers,thereby mak ing storage resources available to website operators.the thrust of umg argument seems to be that web hosts do not undertake the sorts of functions that veoh does,and thus the services they perform fit within the ordinary meaning of storage,and thereby harmoniz e with the notice and takedown procedures.umg theory fails to account for the reality that web hosts,like veoh,also store materials in order to make those materials accessible to other internet users.the reason one has a website is so that others may view it.as amici note,these access activities define web hosting if the web host only stored information for a single user,it would be more aptly described as an online service.see brief for electronic frontier found.et as amici curiae supporting appellees at,umg recordings,veoh networks,cir.
in addition,the technological processes involved in providing web hosting services require those service providers to make,transmit and download multiple copies of users stored materials.to create a website,the user uploads content to the web host computers,which make an initial copy.content may be any number of things family photos,poems,even sound clips and movies.preston gralla,how the internet works ed.then,when another internet user wants to access the website by clicking a link or entering the url,all the website relevant content is transmitted to the user computer,where another copy is automatically made by the user web browser software in order to assemble the materials for viewing and listening.see id.at.to carry out their function of making websites available to internet users,web hosting services thus routinely copy content and transmit it to internet users.see id.we can not see how these processes are meaningfully distinguishable from veoh for c purposes.
further,the language of the statute recognizes that one is unlikely to infringe a copyright by merely storing material that no one could access,and so includes activities that go beyond storage.section c a i so recognizes in stating the material or an activity using the material is infringing.emphasis added.section c a ii similarly addresses infringing activity.section c a iii also reinforces this reading by requiring the service provider to remove,or disable access to,the material,suggesting that if the material were still being stored by the service provider,but was inaccessible,it might well not be infringing.emphasis added.
finally,if congress wanted to confine c exclusively to web hosts rather than reach a wider range of service providers,we very much doubt it would have done so with the oblique by reason of storage language.we presume that congress instead would have taken the more straightforward course of clarifying in the definition of service provider that,as it applies to c,only web hosts qualify.indeed,congress already gives two definitions of service provider s one narrow definition specific to a,and one broader definition that applies to the rest of we therefore see no basis for adopting umg novel theory that congress intended c to protect only web hosting services 
ocilla two service provider definitions also undermine umg argument that the automatic processes that make videos accessible are not undertaken at the direction of the user.the narrower definition that applies exclusively to a,which governs functions,expressly excludes service providers that modif y the content of the material as sent or received.k a.under the broader definition applying to c,by contrast,there is no limitation on the service provider ability to modify material to facilitate storage and access,as veoh automatic processes do.see io,veoh networks,d.had congress intended to include such a limitation,it would have said so expressly and unambiguously,as it did in the narrower definition of service provider.see id.
veoh has simply established a system whereby software automatically processes content and recasts it in a format that is readily accessible to its users.id.at.veoh does not actively participate in or supervise file uploading,n or does it preview or select the files before the upload is completed.id.rather,this automated process for making files accessible is initiated entirely at the volition of veoh users.see also costar,loopnet,cir.we therefore hold that veoh has satisfied the threshold requirement that the infringement be by reason of the storage at the direction of a user of material residing on veoh system.c.
under c a,a service provider can receive safe harbor protection only if it i does not have actual knowledge that the material or an activity using the material on the system or network is infringing ii in the absence of such actual knowledge,is not aware of facts or circumstances from which infringing activity is apparent or iii upon obtaining such knowledge or awareness,acts expeditiously to remove,or disable access to,the material.umg has never disputed that when veoh became aware of allegedly infringing material as a result of the riaa dmca notices,it removed the files.rather,it argues that veoh had knowledge or awareness of other infringing videos that it did not remove.the district court found that umg failed to rebut veoh showing that when it did acquire knowledge of allegedly infringing material whether from dmca notices,informal notices,or other means it expeditiously removed such material.umg ii,d at.umg argues on appeal that the district court erred by improperly construing the knowledge requirement to unduly restrict the circumstances in which a service provider has actual knowledge under subsection i and setting too stringent a standard for what we have termed red flag awareness based on facts or circumstances from which infringing activity is apparent under subsection ii.we hold that the district court properly construed these requirements.
it is undisputed that,until the filing of this lawsuit,umg had not identified to veoh any specific infringing video available on veoh system.umg decision to forgo the dmca notice protocol stripped it of the most powerful evidence of a service provider knowledge actual notice of infringement from the copyright holder.corbis,d,citing nimmer nimmer,nimmer on copyright a,at hereinafter nimmer see also io,d at.nevertheless,umg contends that veoh hosted a category of copyrightable content music for which it had no license from any major music company.umg argues veoh thus must have known this content was unauthorized,given its general knowledge that its services could be used to post infringing material.umg urges us to hold that this sufficiently demonstrates knowledge of infringement.we can not,for several reasons.
as an initial matter,contrary to umg contentions,there are many music videos that could in fact legally appear on veoh.among the types of videos subject to copyright protection but lawfully available on veoh system were videos with music created by users and videos that veoh provided pursuant to arrangements it reached with major copyright holders,such as sonybmg.umg ii,d at.further,congress express intention that the dmca facilitate making available quickly and conveniently via the internet movies,music,software,and literary works precisely the service veoh provides makes us skeptical that umg narrow interpretation of c is plausible,at.finally,if merely hosting material that falls within a category of content capable of copyright protection,with the general knowledge that one services could be used to share unauthorized copies of copyrighted material,was sufficient to impute knowledge to service providers,the c safe harbor would be rendered a dead letter c applies only to claims of copyright infringement,yet the fact that a service provider website contained copyrightable material would remove the service provider from c eligibility.
cases analyzing knowledge in the secondary copyright infringement context also counsel against umg general knowledge approach.in sony of america universal city studios,the supreme court held that there was no precedent in the law of copyright for the imposition of liability based on the theory that the defendant had sold equipment with constructive knowledge of the fact that their customers may use that equipment to make unauthorized copies of copyrighted material.id.at.so long as the product was capable of substantial noninfringing uses,the court refused to impute knowledge of infringement.id.at.applying sony to the internet context,we held in a m records,napster,cir,that if a computer system operator learns of specific infringing material available on his system and fails to purge such material from the system,the operator knows of and contributes to direct infringement.id.at.but absent any specific information which identifies infringing activity,a computer system operator can not be liable for contributory infringement merely because the structure of the system allows for the exchange of copyrighted material.id.
requiring specific knowledge of particular infringing activity makes good sense in the context of the dmca,which congress enacted to foster cooperation among copyright holders and service providers in dealing with infringement on the internet.see,at noting ocilla was intended to provide strong incentives for service providers and copyright owners to cooperate to detect and deal with copyright infringements,pt,at same.copyright holders know precisely what materials they own,and are thus better able to efficiently identify infringing copies than service providers like veoh,who can not readily ascertain what material is copyrighted and what is not.see,at a service provider could not be expected,during the course of its brief cataloguing visit,to determine whether a photograph was still protected by copyright or was in the public domain if the photograph was still protected by copyright,whether the use was licensed and if the use was not licensed,whether it was permitted under the fair use doctrine,pt,at same.
these considerations are reflected in congress decision to enact a notice and takedown protocol encouraging copyright holders to identify specific infringing material to service providers.they are also evidenced in the exclusionary rule that prohibits consideration of substantially deficient c a notices for purposes of determining whether a service provider has actual knowledge or is aware of facts and circumstances from which infringing activity is apparent.c b i see also,pt,at explaining this provision nimmer b c t he copyright owner bears the burden of demonstrating knowledge independently of the failed notification.congress intention is further reflected in the dmca direct statement that n othing in this section shall be construed to condition the applicability of subsections a through d on a service provider monitoring its service or affirmatively seeking facts indicating infringing activity.m congress made a considered policy determination that the dmca notification procedures would place the burden of policing copyright infringement identifying the potentially infringing material and adequately documenting infringement squarely on the owners of the copyright.perfect,ccbill llc,cir.in parsing c,we have decline d to shift that substantial burden from the copyright owner to the provider.id.
umg asks us to change course with regard to c a by adopting a broad conception of the knowledge requirement.we see no principled basis for doing so.we therefore hold that merely hosting a category of copyrightable content,such as music videos,with the general knowledge that one services could be used to share infringing material,is insufficient to meet the actual knowledge requirement under c a i.
we reach the same conclusion with regard to the c a ii inquiry into whether a service provider is aware of facts or circumstances from which infringing activity is apparent.the district court conception of this red flag test properly followed our analysis in ccbill,which reiterated that the burden remains with the copyright holder rather than the service provider.see id.at.the plaintiffs in ccbill argued that there were a number of red flags that made it apparent infringing activity was afoot,noting that the defendant hosted sites with names such as and,as well as password hacking websites,which obviously infringe.see id.we disagreed that these were sufficient red flags because w e do not place the burden of determining whether materials are actually illegal on a service provider,and w e impose no such investigative duties on service providers.id.for the same reasons,we hold that veoh general knowledge that it hosted copyrightable material and that its services could be used for infringement is insufficient to constitute a red flag.
we are not persuaded that umg other purported evidence of veoh actual or apparent knowledge of infringement warrants trial.first,umg points to the tagging of videos on veoh service as music videos.relying on the theory rejected above,umg contends that this demonstrates veoh knowledge that it hosted a category of infringing content.relatedly,umg argues that veoh purchase of certain search terms through the google adwords program demonstrates knowledge of infringing activity because some of the terms purchased,such as cent,avril lavigne and britney spears,are the names of umg artists.however,artists are not always in exclusive relationships with recording companies,so just because umg owns the copyrights for some britney spears songs does not mean it owns the copyright for all britney spears songs.indeed,cent,avril lavigne and britney spears are also affiliated with sony bmg,which gave veoh permission to stream its videos by these artists.furthermore,even if veoh had not had such permission,we recognize that companies sometimes purchase search terms they believe will lead potential customers to their websites even if the terms do not describe goods or services the company actually provides.for example,a sunglass company might buy the search terms sunscreen or vacation because it believed that people interested in such searches would often also be interested in sunglasses.accordingly,veoh search term purchases do little to demonstrate that it knew it hosted infringing material.
umg also argues that veoh removal of unauthorized content identified in riaa notices demonstrates knowledge,even if veoh complied with c notice and takedown procedures.according to umg,veoh should have taken the initiative to use search and indexing tools to locate and remove from its website any other content by the artists identified in the notices.relatedly,umg argues that some of the videos on veoh that had been pulled from mtv or other broadcast television stations bore information about the artist,song title and record label.umg contends that veoh should have used this information to find and remove unauthorized videos.as we have explained,however,to so require would conflict with m,c c and ccbill refusal to impose investigative duties on service providers.at.it could also result in removal of noninfringing content.
umg also points to news articles discussing the availability of copyrighted materials on veoh.one article reported that several major media companies say that has been among the least aggressive video sharing sites in fighting copyrighted content,and has thus become a haven for pirated content.brad stone,veoh vexing visitor numbers,times bits blog july,am,ht tp.another article reported that,
veoh networks ceo dmitry shapiro acknowledges that only a week after the company official debut,is host to a wide range of unauthorized and copies of popular programs.but shapiro says it not his upstart company fault we have a policy that specifically states that when we see copyright material posted,we take it down,shapiro said.this problem is the democratization of publishing.anyone can now post a video to the internet.sometimes the material belongs to someone else.we take this very seriously.
greg sandoval,a new copyright battlefield veoh networks,cnet news,am.umg elicited deposition testimony from shapiro that he had heard of these articles,and was aware that,from time to time,material belonging to someone else end ed up on veoh.umg argues that this evidence of knowledge that,as a general matter,unauthorized materials had been previously posted on veoh is sufficient to meet the c a requirements.
at base,this argument relies on umg primary theory,which we rejected above.here,as well,more specific information than umg has adduced is required.the dmca detailed notice and takedown procedure assumes that,from time to time,material belonging to someone else ends up on service providers websites,and establishes a process for ensuring the prompt removal of such unauthorized material.if veoh ceo acknowledgment of this general problem and awareness of news reports discussing it was enough to remove a service provider from dmca safe harbor eligibility,the notice and takedown procedures would make little sense and the safe harbors would be effectively nullified.we can not conclude that congress intended such a result,and we therefore hold that this evidence is insufficient to warrant a trial.
umg comes closer to meeting the c a requirements with its evidence of emails sent to veoh executives and investors by copyright holders and users identifying infringing content.one email,sent by the ceo of disney,a major copyright holder,to michael eisner,a veoh investor,stated that the movie cinderella iii and various episodes from the television show lost were available on veoh without disney authorization.if this notification had come from a third party,such as a veoh user,rather than from a copyright holder,it might meet the red flag test because it specified particular infringing material as a copyright holder,however,disney is subject to the notification requirements in c,which this informal email failed to meet.accordingly,this deficient notice shall not be considered under paragraph a in determining whether a service provider has actual knowledge or is aware of facts or circumstances from which infringing activity is apparent.c b i.further,even if this email could have created actual knowledge or qualified as a red flag,eisner email in response assured disney that he would instruct veoh to take it down,and eisner copied veoh founder to ensure this happened right away.umg nowhere alleges that the offending material was not immediately removed,and accordingly veoh would be saved by c a iii,which preserves the safe harbor for service providers with such knowledge so long as they act expeditiously to remove,or disable access to,the material.
umg also points to an email from a veoh user whose video was rejected for containing infringing content.upset that veoh would not post his unauthorized material,he stated that he had seen plenty of other copyright infringement material on the site,and identified another user who he said posted infringing content.it is possible that this email would be sufficient to constitute a red flag under c a ii,even though it would not qualify as sufficient notice from a copyright holder under c.but even assuming that is so,umg has not specifically alleged that veoh failed to expeditiously remove the infringing content identified by the user email,or that the content at issue was owned by umg.accordingly,this too fails to create a genuine issue of material fact regarding veoh knowledge of infringement 
a service provider is eligible for the c safe harbor only if it does not receive a financial benefit directly attributable to the infringing activity,in a case in which the service provider has the right and ability to control such activity.c b.umg appeals the district court determination that veoh did not have the necessary right and ability to control infringing activity and thus remained eligible for safe harbor protection.we conclude the district court was correct,and therefore affirm 
statutory interpretation begins with the language of the statute.children hosp.health ctr.belshe,cir.when terms are not defined within a statute,they are accorded their plain and ordinary meaning,which can be deduced through reference sources such as general usage dictionaries.see bilski kappos.s tatutory language must always be read in its proper context,mccarthy bronson,and i n determining the meaning of the statute,we look not only to the particular statutory language,but to the design of the statute as a whole and to its object and policy,crandon united states.we must,if possible,interpret a statute such that all its language is given effect,and none of it is rendered superfluous.see trw andrews.
whether veoh had the requisite ability to control the infringing activity at issue depends on what the statute means by that phrase,which the statute does not define.looking first to the dictionary,ability is defined as the quality or state of being able physical,mental,or legal power to perform competence in doing and able is in turn defined as possessed of needed powers as intelligence or strength or of needed resources as means or influence to accomplish an objective constituted or situated so as to be susceptible or readily subjected to some action or treatment.webster third new international dictionary.control is defined as having the power or authority to guide or manage directing or restraining domination.id.at.where,as here,it is a practical impossibility for veoh to ensure that no infringing material is ever uploaded to its site,or to remove unauthorized material that has not yet been identified to veoh as infringing,we do not believe that veoh can properly be said to possess the needed powers or needed resources to be competen t in exercising the sort of restraining domination that c b requires for denying safe harbor eligibility.
as discussed,in the knowledge context it is not enough for a service provider to know as a general matter that users are capable of posting unauthorized content more specific knowledge is required.similarly,a service provider may,as a general matter,have the legal right and necessary technology to remove infringing content,but until it becomes aware of specific unauthorized material,it can not exercise its power or authority over the specific infringing item.in practical terms,it does not have the kind of ability to control infringing activity the statute contemplates.see viacom int l youtube,d,t he provider must know of the particular case before he can control it.emphasis added perfect,cir google supervisory power is limited because google software lacks the ability to analyze every image on the i nternet,compare each image to all the other copyrighted images that exist in the world and determine whether a certain image on the web infringes someone copyright.alterations in original internal quotation marks omitted.
our reading of c b is informed and reinforced by our concern that the statute would be internally inconsistent were we to interpret the right and ability to control language as umg urges.first,m cuts against holding that veoh general knowledge that infringing material could be uploaded to its site triggered an obligation to police its services to the fullest extent possible.as we have explained,m provides that c safe harbor protection may not be conditioned on a service provider monitoring its service or affirmatively seeking facts indicating infringing activity.umg reading of the right and ability to control language would similarly run afoul of ccbill,at,which likewise clarified that c impose s no such investigative duties on service providers,and place s the burden of policing copyright infringement squarely on the owners of the copyright.we are not persuaded by umg suggestion that congress meant this limitation on the duty to monitor to apply only to service providers who do not receive a direct financial benefit under subsection b.rather,we conclude that a service provider must be aware of specific infringing material to have the ability to control that infringing activity within the meaning of c b.only then would its failure to exercise its ability to control deny it a safe harbor.
second,c actually presumes that service providers have the sort of control that umg argues satisfies the c b right and ability to control requirement they must remove or disable access to infringing material when they become aware of it.c a iii c.quoting napster,at,umg argues that service providers have the right and ability to control infringing activity,c b,as long as they have the ability to locate infringing material and terminate users access.under that reading,service providers would have the right and ability to control infringing activity regardless of their becoming aware of the material.under that interpretation,the prerequisite to c protection under c a iii and c,would at the same time be a disqualifier under c b.we agree with judge matz that congress could not have intended for courts to hold that a service provider loses immunity under the safe harbor provision of the dmca because it engages in acts that are specifically required by the dmca.umg ii,d at quoting hendrickson ebay,d,internal quotation marks omitted see also io,veoh networks,d,same lee,supra,colum.arts at a service provider ability to remove materials posted by third parties does not satisfy the right and ability to control prong,because such power is necessary for a service provider to satisfy the basic requirement of takedown under the dmca.
accordingly,we hold that the right and ability to control under c requires control over specific infringing activity the provider knows about.a service provider general right and ability to remove materials from its services is,alone,insufficient.of course,a service provider can not willfully bury its head in the sand to avoid obtaining such specific knowledge.viewing the evidence in the light most favorable to umg,as we must here,we agree with the district court there is no evidence that veoh acted in such a manner.rather,the evidence demonstrates that veoh promptly removed infringing material when it became aware of specific instances of infringement.although the parties agree,in retrospect,that at times there was infringing material available on veoh services,the dmca recognizes that service providers who are not able to locate and remove infringing materials they do not specifically know of should not suffer the loss of safe harbor protection.
umg seeks to avoid our reading of the statute plain language and structure by arguing that we should instead interpret c as we read similar language in the common law vicarious liability context in napster,at.we are unpersuaded for several reasons,and conclude instead,as previously discussed,that whereas the vicarious liability standard applied in napster can be met by merely having the general ability to locate infringing material and terminate users access,see napster,at,c requires something more,cybernet ventures,d at internal quotation marks omitted.
first,c nowhere mentions the term vicarious liability.although it uses a set of words that has sometimes been used to describe common law vicarious liability,the language used in the common law standard is loose and has varied.for example,metro goldwyn mayer studios grokster,refers to supervis ing the direct infringer rather than control ing such infringing activity,c b,and supervise and control are different in potentially significant ways.control,which we have noted means having the power or authority to guide or manage directing or restraining domination,involves more command than supervise,which means to look over,inspect,oversee.webster third new international dictionary.
second,napster was decided after the dmca was enacted,so congress could not have intended to codify napster precise application upon which umg relies.third,although not definitive,the legislative history informs our conclusion that congress did not intend to exclude from c safe harbor all service providers who would be vicariously liable for their users infringing activity under the common law.the legislative history did,at one point,suggest an intention to codify the right and ability to control element of vicarious infringement,and c b was not modified following that report that report,however,referred to a version of the bill different from the one ultimately passed,and the discussion of vicarious liability is omitted from all later reports and,notably,from the statutory language.see,pt,at,at conf,at,reprinted in.
subsequent legislative statements help clarify congress intent.first,congress explicitly stated in three different reports that the dmca was intended to protect qualifying service providers from liability for all monetary relief for direct,vicarious and contributory infringement.conf,at,at emphasis added,at,pt,at.under umg interpretation,however,every service provider subject to vicarious liability would be automatically excluded from safe harbor protection.second,congress made clear that it intended to provide safe harbor protection not by altering the common law vicarious liability standards,but rather by carving out permanent safe harbors to that liability for internet service providers even while the common law standards continue to evolve.see,at there have been several cases relevant to service provider liability for copyright infringement.most have approached the issue from the standpoint of contributory and vicarious liability.rather than embarking upon a wholesale clarification of these doctrines,the committee decided to leave current law in its evolving state and,instead,to create a series of safe harbors,for certain common activities of service providers.a service provider which qualifies for a safe harbor,receives the benefit of limited liability.footnote omitted.
given congress explicit intention to protect qualifying service providers who would otherwise be subject to vicarious liability,it would be puzzling for congress to make c entirely coextensive with the vicarious liability requirements,which would effectively exclude all vicarious liability claims from the c safe harbor.see,lee,supra,colum.arts at acknowledging that interpreting the dmca to exclude service providers subject to vicarious liability would undo the benefits of the safe harbors altogether quoting mark lemley,rationalizing internet safe harbors,telecomm.high tech,internal quotation marks omitted.in addition,it is difficult to envision,from a policy perspective,why congress would have chosen to exclude vicarious infringement from the safe harbors,but retain protection for contributory infringement.it is not apparent why the former might be seen as somehow worse than the latter.see id.at.
furthermore,if congress had intended that the c b right and ability to control requirement be coextensive with vicarious liability law,the statute could have accomplished that result in a more direct manner.
it is conceivable that congress would have intended that service providers which receive a financial benefit directly attributable to the infringing activity would not,under any circumstances,be able to qualify for the subsection c safe harbor.but if that was indeed their intention,it would have been far simpler and much more straightforward to simply say as much.the court does not accept that congress would express its desire to do so by creating a confusing,catch situation that pits c b and c c directly at odds with one another,particularly when there is a much simpler explanation the dmca requires more than the mere ability to delete and block access to infringing material after that material has been posted in order for the service provider to be said to have the right and ability to control such activity.
ellison robertson,d,aff in part and rev in part on different grounds,cir.indeed,in the provision in title i of the dmca,which was enacted at the same time as the safe harbors,congress explicitly stated,nothing in this section shall enlarge or diminish vicarious or contributory liability for copyright infringement in connection with any technology,product,service,device,component,or part thereof.c.if congress had intended to exclude vicarious liability from the dmca title ii safe harbors,it would have done so expressly as it did in title i of the dmca.lee,supra,colum.arts at.
in light of the dmca language,structure,purpose and legislative history,we are compelled to reject umg argument that the district court should have employed napster vicarious liability standard to evaluate whether veoh had sufficient right and ability to control infringing activity under c.although in some cases service providers subject to vicarious liability will be excluded from the c safe harbor,in others they will not.because we conclude that veoh met all the c requirements,we affirm the entry of summary judgment in its favor.
umg also appeals the district court rule b dismissal of its complaint against the investor defendants for vicarious infringement,contributory infringement and inducement of infringement.it is that s econdary liability for copyright infringement does not exist in the absence of direct infringement napster,at.umg argues,however,that even if summary judgment was properly granted to veoh on the basis of the dmca safe harbor,as we have held it was,the investor defendants remain potentially liable for their related indirect infringement because the district court did not make a finding regarding veoh direct infringement,and the investor defendants do not qualify as service providers who can receive dmca safe harbor protection.the investor defendants argue that it would be illogical to impose greater liability on them than on veoh itself.although we agree that this would create an anomalous result,we assume without deciding that the suit against the investor defendants can properly proceed even though veoh is protected from monetary liability by the dmca reaching the merits of umg secondary liability arguments,we hold that the district court properly dismissed the complaint.
umg first alleges that the investor defendants are liable for contributory infringement.o ne who,with knowledge of the infringing activity,induces,causes or materially contributes to the infringing conduct of another,may be held liable as a contributory infringer.fonovisa,cherry auction,cir quoting gershwin publ g columbia artists,cir alteration in original internal quotation marks omitted see also grokster,at one infringes contributorily by intentionally inducing or encouraging direct infringement.in fonovisa,at,we established the site and facilities test providing the site and facilities for known infringing activity is sufficient to establish contributory liability where the defendant actively strives to provide the environment and the market for counterfeit sales to thrive.the district court concluded this test was not met,dismissing the complaint because umg did not allege sufficiently that the investor defendants gave material assistance in helping veoh or its users accomplish infringement.we agree.
umg acknowledges that funding alone can not satisfy the material assistance requirement.it thus argues that the investor defendants provided veoh necessary funding and directed its spending on basic operations including hardware,software,and employees elements umg argues form the site and facilities for veoh direct infringement.umg thus attempts to liken its case to umg recordings,bertelsmann ag et,where the district court denied an investor motion to dismiss claims of contributory infringement.in bertelsmann,however,the investor was napster only available source of funding,and thus held significant power and control over napster operations.id.at.here,by contrast,there were multiple investors,and none of the investor defendants could individually control veoh.accordingly,umg hinges its novel theory of secondary liability on the contention that the three investor defendants together took control of veoh operations by obtain ing three of the five seats on veoh board of directors,and effectively provided the site and facilities for direct infringement by wielding their majority power to direct spending.
even assuming that such joint control,not typically an element of contributory infringement,could satisfy fonovisa site and facilities requirement,umg argument fails on its own terms,because the complaint nowhere alleged that the investor defendants agreed to work in concert to this end.umg suggests that it did allege that the investor defendants agreed to operate veoh jointly umg alleged that the investor defendants operated veoh by eeking and obtain ing seats on veoh board of directors as a condition of their investments.but three investors individually acquiring one seat apiece is not the same as agreeing to operate as a unified entity to obtain and leverage majority control.unless the three independent investors were on some level working in concert,then none of them actually had sufficient control over the board to direct veoh in the way umg contends.this missing allegation is critical because finding secondary liability without it would allow plaintiffs to sue any collection of directors making up percent of the board on the theory that they constitute a majority,and therefore together they control the company.without this lynchpin allegation,umg claim that the investor defendants had sufficient control over veoh to direct its spending and operations in a manner that might theoretically satisfy the site and facilities test falls apart.we therefore affirm the dismissal of umg contributory infringement claim.
this missing allegation likewise requires us to affirm the district court dismissal of umg vicarious liability and inducement of infringement claims.inducement liability is proper where one distributes a device with the object of promoting its use to infringe copyright,as shown by clear expression or other affirmative steps taken to foster infringement.grokster,at.vicarious liability is warranted if the defendant profits directly from the infringement and has a right and ability to supervise the direct infringer.grokster,at see also visa,at.umg arguments that the investor defendants distribute d veoh services and had the right and ability to supervise the infringing users are premised on the unalleged contention that the investor defendants agreed to act in concert,and thus together they held a majority of seats on the board and maintained operational control over the company.we therefore affirm the dismissal of the complaint against the investor defendants 
veoh appeals the district court refusal to grant it costs and attorney fees under federal rule of civil procedure.under rule,if a plaintiff rejects a defendant offer of judgment,and the judgment finally obtained by plaintiff is not more favorable than the offer,the plaintiff must pay the costs incurred subsequent to the offer.united states trident seafoods,cir rule is designed to require plaintiffs to think very hard about whether continued litigation is worthwhile,and compensate defendants for costs they ought not have had to incur.champion produce,ruby robinson,cir quoting marek chesny.in october,veoh offered umg to settle this lawsuit,pursuant to the procedures set forth in rule.umg declined the offer and ultimately failed to win any monetary relief.after the district court ruled that veoh was entitled to c protection,the parties requested the entry of judgment and stipulated that veoh agree d to continue to disable access to the allegedly infringing video files and to continue to use hash filtering to prevent infringing video files from being accessed by users,and umg agree d that,even if it were to prevail on its remaining claims against veoh,it is entitled to no further relief.
veoh contends that it was entitled to receive rule costs incurred from the time of its october settlement offer.it argues these costs should include attorney fees because marek,at,held that,where the underlying statute defines costs to include attorney fees,such fees are to be included as costs for purposes of rule,and the copyright act,provides that a court may award a reasonable attorney fee to the prevailing party as part of the costs.relying on trident,the district court declined to grant attorney fees under rule because it had previously determined that fees were not properly awardable under veoh has not challenged the district court decision with regard to,but argues on appeal that under rule an award of costs,including fees,was mandatory.we agree with the district court that,because it found that attorney fees were not properly awardable under in this case,fees could not be awarded under rule.we remand to the district court to separately analyze whether rule costs,excluding attorney fees,are warranted.
in marek,the supreme court held that the term costs in rule was intended to refer to all costs properly awardable under the relevant substantive statute.at emphasis added.we have interpreted this to mean that attorney fees may be awarded as rule costs only if those fees would have been properly awarded under the relevant substantive statute in that particular case.in trident,at,for example,the issue was the interplay between the clean air act caa and rule.under the caa,fees may only be awarded if the action was unreasonable.see id trident held that t he only interpretation that gives meaning to every word in both rule and the caa is that costs in rule include attorneys fees only if the action was unreasonable.id.the fact that fees could have been awarded under the caa,had its requirements been met,was insufficient to make them properly awardable within the meaning of marek when the district court decided not to grant them in that case.see id.
we confronted the same issue with regard to a different substantive statute in champion.there,we considered whether rule costs included attorney fees where idaho code permitted the award of fees to a prevailing party,and the district court expressly held that the defendant had not prevailed within the meaning of that section.see champion,at.relying on trident,we held that rule is not intended to expand the bases for a party recovery of attorneys fees,id.at,and thus,
j ust as attorneys fees are not properly awardable to a defendant in a clean air act case unless the court finds that such action was unreasonable,trident,at,attorneys fees are not properly awardable to a defendant in a case where the relevant statute awards attorneys fees to a prevailing party unless the defendant is a prevailing party within the meaning of that statute.
id.at citing payne milwaukee,cir briefly put,costs can not encompass more than the rules or other relevant statutes authorize.
although we have not yet confronted this question in a copyright act case,trident and champion make clear that in this context as well,because the district court determined that attorney fees were not properly awardable to veoh under,they were not awardable under rule either 
even though veoh is not entitled to attorney fees under rule,it may be entitled to its other costs.see,champion,at holding that even though attorney fees were not properly awardable under rule,costs excluding fees were mandatory.the district court,however,did not analyze whether costs apart from fees were warranted.veoh has already been awarded some of its costs under federal rule of civil procedure d,but it argues on appeal that it is entitled to all of its offer costs under rule.this may be true,if certain conditions are met.first,costs are awardable under rule where the judgment that the offeree finally obtains is not more favorable than the unaccepted offer.d.veoh argues that b ecause veoh was already taking the measures set forth in the stipulated injunction,and umg was primarily seeking monetary damages,the value of that stipulation was less than veoh rule offer.although this may prove true,the value of the stipulated injunction is not clear on this record.
second,veoh can recover rule costs only if it is not a prevailing defendant.in delta air lines,august,u,the supreme court held that rule applies only to offers made by the defendant and only to judgments obtained by the plaintiff,and therefore is simply inapplicable where it was the defendant that obtained the judgment.see also goldberg pac.indem,cir rule does not allow a defendant to recover costs when judgment is entered in the defendant favor.the court observed that holding otherwise would create an odd system in which any settlement offer,no matter how small,would apparently trigger the op
