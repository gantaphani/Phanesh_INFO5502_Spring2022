because the district court did not abuse its discretion by extending the stay of the permanent injunction,by dissolving the permanent injunction,or by denying microsoft motion for relief from judgment,we affirm in part.because the district court failed to adequately explain the basis for its award of per infringing unit sold during the stay of the permanent injunction,however,and because recent supreme court action may affect damages,we vacate in part and remand.
background 
amado is the inventor and owner of patent the patent,which is directed to a point and shoot interface for linking database records to spreadsheets whereby data of a record is automatically reformatted and loaded upon issuance of a recalculation command.in general terms,the invention of the patent relates to a software program that combines the functionalities of spreadsheet and database software.claim,for example,recites a n apparatus for carrying out spreadsheet calculations using data imported from a database via a point and shoot user interface to select a database record for loading into a specified range of the spreadsheet 
amado filed suit against microsoft on march,alleging that several versions of microsoft office suite infringed the patent.in june,a jury found the patent valid and infringed and awarded amado damages for infringing sales equivalent to a reasonably royalty.the district court granted amado request for a permanent injunction,but then stayed the injunction until seven days after the resolution or abandonment of any appeal.as a condition of the stay,the district court required that microsoft make escrow deposits of per copy of the infringing software sold during the stay.
microsoft and amado appealed from the district court final judgment.we affirm ed in all respects and remanded for disposition of the funds deposited in the escrow account.see amado microsoft.amado i.as relevant to this appeal,on remand the district court extended the stay of the permanent injunction in order to consider various motions,including microsoft motion to dissolve the injunction in light of ebay,mercexchange,llc,d subsequently dissolved the injunction denied microsoft motion for relief from judgment based on alleged disclaimers made during reexamination and awarded amado per infringing unit from the escrow account for sales made during the period of the stay.
amado and microsoft timely appealed these rulings.both parties contend that the district court erred in assessing a royalty for the infringing units sold during the stay.amado contends the proper award is per unit,the amount escrowed,while microsoft contends the proper amount is,the amount found by the jury to be a reasonable royalty.amado also argues that the district court original injunction order,which granted but stayed the injunction,was incorporated into the mandate in amado i,thus depriving the district court of authority either to extend the stay or dissolve the injunction.microsoft contends that the district court erred in denying its motion for relief from judgment.it also asks us to adjust the damages award in light of the recently decided case of microsoft v.at t,d.

extensions of the stay of the permanent injunction 
the district court original order staying the permanent injunction stated that the injunction would go into effect s even days after the resolution or abandonment of any appeal.amado microsoft,slip op.at.following remand from this court in amado i,amado moved to enforce the injunction as having become effective on august,days after the mandate issued.the district court denied amado motion,interpreting its order staying the injunction through any pending appeal to include a petition for certiorari to the supreme court.amado microsoft,slip op.at.
the supreme court denied certiorari on november.on november,microsoft moved to extend the stay of the injunction.on december,the district court granted the request,and on december,clarified its ruling as follows 
a s to the stay,the court has reconsidered the august,order lifting the stay seven days after the resolution or abandonment of any appeal.the court believes that the more prudent course is to leave the stay in place,pending resolution of the motions that will be heard on february,regarding the escrow,the injunction,or any remaining issues.therefore,the stay of the permanent injunction will remain in place until days after the court rules on the february,motions.

amado contends that the district court abused its discretion by staying the injunction more than seven days following the mandate in amado i because the district court did not possess authority to deviate from the original order staying the injunction once it was incorporated into the amado i mandate.microsoft counters that the district court did not abuse its discretion because the propriety of the stay was not appealed and therefore was not within the scope of the mandate in amado 
amado first assignment of error relates to the district court interpretation of appeal in its order staying the injunction as including a petition for certiorari.a district court interpretation of its order is entitled to deference unless the interpretation is unreasonable or is otherwise an abuse of discretion.see cave singletary,cir the district court interpretation of its own order is properly accorded deference on appeal when its interpretation is reasonable.in re,rock island pac,cir we shall not reverse a district court interpretation of its own order unless the record clearly shows an abuse of discretion.the district court is in the best position to interpret its own orders.citations omitted.we have little difficulty concluding that the district court interpretation of appeal as including a petition for certiorari was reasonable,and thus worthy of deference.consequently,we move to amado central the district court was without authority to extend the stay following the supreme court denial of certiorari.
district courts manage hundreds of civil and criminal cases at any given time.for this reason,they are afforded broad discretion to control and manage their dockets,including the authority to decide the order in which they hear and decide issues pending before them,of.bd.of trustees vanvoorhies,this court defers to the judgment of the trial court on matters closely associated with the standard functions of the adjudicative process,as long as that judgment is not an abuse of the trial court discretion.beatrice foods new eng.printing lithographing,a trial court has broad discretionary authority in managing the litigation before it.
as reflected in the december,order,the district court extended the stay of the permanent injunction so that it could address the various pending motions related to the injunction and the escrow account.amado contends that the district court abused its discretion by so doing because once the order was incorporated into the amado i mandate,the district court was powerless to modify the terms of the injunction or the stay,no matter how extreme the circumstances.
we disagree.as we discuss in more detail below,infra section,district courts possess broad equitable authority to modify injunctions.this broad authority,coupled with the wide discretion to manage the order in which they address issues pending before them,necessarily vests district courts with the authority to extend the stay of an injunction,particularly under these circumstances where it is done to preserve the status quo while motions affecting that injunction are under advisement.gould control laser,b ecause district courts have broad discretionary powers to control their dockets,stays will not be vacated unless they are immoderate or of an indefinite duration.stay of proceedings pending patent reexamination.this principle holds true regardless of whether the order that originally set the terms of the stay is incorporated into an appellate mandate.barrow falck,cir an appellate mandate does not turn a district judge into a robot,mechanically carrying out orders that become inappropriate in light of subsequent factual discoveries or changes in the law.thus,we hold that the district court did not abuse its discretion by extending the stay of the injunction in order to address pending motions,including motions related to whether that very injunction should be dissolved.
dissolution of the permanent injunction 
following the supreme court denial of certiorari,microsoft moved for dissolution of the permanent injunction.it argued that the supreme court recent decision in ebay made the grant of the injunction inappropriate.the district court agreed and granted the motion.see generally order at.it observed that its initial decision to grant the injunction was influenced by the controlling federal circuit law at the time,which required a case to be exceptional to justify the denial of a permanent injunction.id.at citing mercexchange llc ebay,overruled by ebay,mercexchange llc,d.in light of ebay,the district court reapplied the traditional test for establishing entitlement to injunctive relief.see ebay.at a plaintiff must demonstrate that it has suffered an irreparable injury that remedies available at law,such as monetary damages,are inadequate to compensate for that injury that,considering the balance of hardships between the plaintiff and defendant,a remedy in equity is warranted and that the public interest would not be disserved by a permanent injunction.citation omitted.finding both an absence of irreparable harm and that the public interest would be disserved by granting an injunction,the district court prospectively dissolved the injunction.order at.
amado argues that because the ebay decision was handed down before our decision in amado i,albeit after the completion of briefing,and because the permanent injunction was included within our mandate in amado i,the mandate rule foreclosed microsoft from challenging the injunction or the district court from modifying it.microsoft argues that the propriety of the permanent injunction was not at issue in the first appeal,and thus was outside the scope of the mandate.alternatively,it argues that ebay is an intervening decision and is thus an exception to the mandate rule.
a decision is generally considered to be intervening when it comes between an appellate decision and the proceedings on remand.a decision is not intervening,however,if the parties have a reasonable opportunity to raise an issue with respect to that decision prior to issuance of the appellate mandate.pediatric specialty care.dep t of human,cir,vacated in part on other grounds,d determining that supreme court decision handed down prior to mandate was not intervening.thus,whether ebay constitutes an intervening decision,and forecloses application of the mandate rule,turns on whether microsoft had a reasonable opportunity to claim the decision benefit prior to our issuance of the amado i mandate.
the supreme court decision in ebay was handed down on may,the completion of briefing but prior to oral argument in amado following issuance of the decision,it was incumbent upon microsoft,if it desired to do so,either to alert this court that the case affected its position on appeal or to explicitly reserve the right to seek retrospective relief from the injunction on remand.engel,lockformer.this it did not do,even when questioned as to its position at oral argument.amado i,appeal,oral arg.at,available at because microsoft had a reasonable opportunity to raise an issue with respect to ebay prior to issuance of our mandate,and,indeed,expressly declined that opportunity,ebay is not an intervening decision and thus does not preclude application of the mandate rule.
the mandate rule provides that issues actually decided on appeal those within the scope of the judgment appealed from,minus those explicitly reserved or remanded by the foreclosed from further consideration.engel,at.thus,a n issue that falls within the scope of the judgment appealed from but is not raised by the appellant in its opening brief on appeal is necessarily waived.id.neither party raised the propriety of the permanent injunction in amado however,because the mandate rule precludes reconsideration of any issue within the scope of the judgment appealed merely those issues actually proper inquiry is whether the district court grant of the permanent injunction was within the scope of the judgment appealed from in amado 
microsoft and amado both appealed from the amended judgment entered on august,which expressly noted that a permanent injunction and stay had been entered.amado microsoft,slip op.at.thus,there can be no question that the grant of the permanent injunction was within the scope of the amado i mandate.because microsoft failed to challenge that grant,it became a part of our mandate.accordingly,the mandate rule operates as a bar to the district court reconsideration of the initial issuance of the injunction.
there is a fundamental difference,however,between the granting of retrospective relief and the granting of prospective relief.while the mandate rule would prevent the district court from dissolving the injunction ab initio,it does not preclude the district court from modifying,or dissolving,the injunction if it determines that it is no longer equitable.this principle is made explicit in rule b,which provides that o n motion and just terms,the court may relieve a party from a final judgment,order,or proceeding if applying it prospectively is no longer equitable.b emphasis added.due to the equitable nature of injunctive relief,district courts have wide discretion to determine under what circumstances the grant of injunctive relief is appropriate,ebay.at t he decision whether to grant or deny injunctive relief rests within the equitable discretion of the district courts,and under what circumstances the modification or dissolution of that injunction is warranted,see.fed wright,d.
we conclude that the district court was well within its discretion in this case to reconsider the prospective application of the permanent injunction on remand in light of the supreme court decision in ebay.we also conclude that the district court ultimate decision to dissolve the injunction was not an abuse of discretion,when,after applying the traditional test,it determined that an injunction was no longer equitable under the circumstances.
the district court escrow determination 
charged in our last remand with the disposition of the funds placed in escrow during the stay of the permanent injunction,the district court determined that amado was entitled to per infringing unit.the district court start ed with the jury reasonable royalty of four cents,and trebled the award to using the trebling for willful infringement as a guideline.order at.amado argues that the district court abused its discretion by failing to awar
