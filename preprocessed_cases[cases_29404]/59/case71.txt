order modifying opinion and denying petition for rehearing and request to change publication status 
no change in judgment 
it is ordered that the opinion filed on december,be modified as follows 
at the end of the first complete paragraph on page,the following footnote is added,which will require renumbering of all subsequent footnotes 
contrary to kemper assertion in a rehearing petition,we are not suggesting any new duty on an appellate counsel in a dependency action.given the strict deadlines in juvenile dependency actions and the state strong interest in expediting these proceedings,if an appellate counsel is aware of facts outside the record that would support an ineffective assistance of counsel claim,the counsel should advise the client of this fact and consider raising the issue by habeas corpus petition.if necessary,an appointed counsel may petition to expand his or her appointment.kemper citation to decisions in the criminal habeas context are unhelpful on this issue.
appellant petition for rehearing is denied.appellant request to change the publication status to nonpublished is denied.
there is no change in the judgment.

thomas montgomery,county counsel,ricky sanchez and stephanie karnavas,deputy county counsel,for defendants and respondents.
five years ago,this court affirmed a judgment terminating johnneisha kemper parental rights to her daughter,rejecting kemper contention that claimed ineffective assistance by her appointed juvenile dependency attorneys caused the termination of her parental rights kemper then brought a legal malpractice action against the same appointed juvenile dependency attorneys thomas kisiel and tracy de soto,their supervising attorney robert gulemi,and the county of san diego county she alleged defendants legal representation breached the applicable standard of care and caused the termination of her parental rights.defendants moved for summary judgment based on the collateral estoppel doctrine.the court granted the motion and entered judgment in defendants favor.
kemper appeals.we affirm.causation is an essential element of a legal malpractice claim,and kemper is barred by the collateral estoppel doctrine from relitigating the issue of whether her juvenile dependency attorneys caused the termination of her parental rights.we decline kemper request that we create a new exception to the collateral estoppel rule based on an analogy to the writ of habeas corpus procedure applicable in juvenile dependency cases.
factual and procedural summary 
summary of dependency proceedings 
in may,year old kemper gave birth to a daughter,nf.when the baby was less than two weeks old,san diego police officers removed the child from kemper care.four days later,the san diego county health and human services agency agency filed a juvenile dependency petition under welfare and institutions code section,subdivision g,alleging the infant was at substantial risk of harm because she had been abandoned by the mother the mother whereabouts were unknown and reasonable efforts to find the parents had been unsuccessful the next day,the trial court made a prima facie finding on the petition and detained the child in care.
about three weeks later,on june,the court held a jurisdiction and disposition hearing.at the outset,agency social worker mark hood informed the court that the mother kemper had called his office to say she was on her way to court from los angeles.the court then trailed the matter until in the afternoon.when kemper had not arrived by,the court resumed the hearing,sustained jurisdiction under section,subdivision g,declared nf a dependent child,and removed her from parental custody.the court did not appoint counsel for kemper because she had not yet appeared in the action.
shortly after the hearing,kemper and the baby alleged father arrived in the courtroom.the court clerk gave them hood phone number.the court scheduled a special hearing for the next month to appoint counsel for both parents.
on july,kemper appeared at the continued hearing and the court appointed counsel for her defendant de soto de soto said she had discussed kemper constitutional,trial and statutory rights with kemper,and kemper understood those rights.when the court asked about the appointment of a guardian ad litem,de soto said she had spoken with kemper and both she and kemper believed a guardian ad litem was not necessary.de soto requested that the court facilitate services in the los angeles area where kemper lived,and the agency counsel agreed it was appropriate to do so at least with respect to ordered therapy.the court spoke directly to kemper about the importance of complying with the ordered services in a timely fashion.
about eight months later,in february,the court held a contested review hearing.kemper was present and represented by defendant kisiel.at the hearing,the agency submitted two social worker reports,and requested termination of reunification services based on evidence showing kemper had only minimally participated in services and visitation.kisiel did not present any affirmative evidence or the social workers,but requested the court continue services for kemper,arguing kemper progress had been sufficient she had appeared for court hearings she had made progress in parenting classes she had engaged in therapy and she had made best efforts to comply with the plan despite living in los angeles county.
nf counsel requested that the court follow the agency recommendation,emphasizing kemper repeated failure to participate in reunification services.
at the end of the hearing,the juvenile court rejected kisiel arguments,terminated reunification services,and set a section selection and implementation hearing.the court found kemper had received adequate services,but had not made substantial progress with her case plan and there was no substantial probability of nf return to her parents physical custody in the next six months.
kemper signed a notice of intent to file a writ petition challenging this order see rules,but after kisiel supervisor,defendant gulemi,reviewed the record and spoke with kisiel,gulemi determined there were no viable issues for review.in march,gulemi communicated this conclusion to kemper by letter,and told her to call him collect if she had any questions or concerns.
this same month,kemper was arrested and became a dependent of the los angeles county juvenile court,which placed her into foster care.while in foster care,kemper gave birth to another child.
kemper san diego county case was then transferred to another attorney in the same office,sharon macgillis.after reviewing the file,macgillis requested that supervisor gulemi transfer the case to an independent attorney,believing there had been substantial problems with the legal representation in the case.gulemi declined to approve the transfer,and instructed macgillis to instead file a section motion challenging the factual and legal support for the prior orders and presenting evidence of kemper recent progress in accepting responsibility and taking care of herself.
in may and august,macgillis filed the section modification petitions,arguing the court prejudicially erred in failing to appoint a guardian ad litem at the july hearing and kemper improved circumstances supported an extension of reunification services or return of the child.on the second ground,macgillis admitted kemper had been unstable,but argued and presented evidence that her circumstances had changed because she was now in foster care in los angeles,enrolled in school,attending parenting classes,living with a supportive foster mother,and providing excellent care to her new second child.
the juvenile court found kemper made a prima facie case supporting both grounds for the motions,and then held a combined hearing on the two section petitions and the section reference.at this hearing,the court received into evidence all of the agency reports and the minute orders from the prior hearings,including the detention and jurisdiction hearings.several witnesses testified,including kemper,her foster mother,social worker hood,and a riverside county social worker in kemper dependency case.at the conclusion of the evidence and argument,the juvenile court found that although a guardian ad litem should have been appointed and this error was not harmless,the requested modification was not in the child best interests because kemper could not safely parent her child,supra.the court thus denied the section motions,and entered a final judgment terminating kemper rights.
kemper filed a notice of appeal and an appellate attorney was appointed to represent her.
ii.appellate decision 
on appeal in the case,kemper appellate counsel challenged the orders denying kemper section motions and the judgment terminating her parental rights.on the section issues,counsel argued the juvenile court abused its discretion in refusing to return the child to kemper based on the court earlier failure to appoint a guardian ad litem and based on her new and improved circumstances.in challenging the judgment terminating parental rights,kemper counsel argued the judgment was the result of kemper appointed counsel ineffective assistance in the proceedings below.kemper counsel identified three instances of alleged deficient representation the failure to challenge the jurisdictional findings under section,subdivision g waiving appointment of a guardian ad litem and failing to raise these issues in a writ petition filed after the hearing in which the court terminated reunification services,supra.
in june,this court filed,rejecting kemper appellate contentions and affirming the court section orders and judgment,supra.on the section issues,we held the juvenile court erred in not appointing a guardian ad litem and the appointment may have made a difference in the outcome of the jurisdiction and disposition hearings,but the juvenile court acted well within its discretion in denying the section motion because a custody change was not in the child best interests,supra.we also held the juvenile court did not abuse its discretion in concluding that kemper remained unable to safely parent nf and in finding that kemper was not a parental figure to nf.ibid.
we rejected the ineffective assistance claim on two grounds,supra.first,we stated the record does not affirmatively establish counsel had no rational tactical purpose for the alleged deficient performance,and therefore the claim was not cognizable on appeal.ibid.second,we stated that more importantly,we can not say the outcome termination of parental rights would have been different had counsel provided what mother believes was effective representation.ibid.we explained 
regardless of counsel alleged failings,the agency was justified in filing a dependency petition,and the court reasonably assumed jurisdiction of kemper child.kemper left her newborn without provision for support,and chose her relationship with father over her relationship with her child kemper ongoing irresponsible behavior and lack of motivation to participate in services or establish a relationship with her child prevented reunification.once her situation stabilized and she began to access services,kemper was never able to show she could properly parent her child.the remedy kemper seeks dismissing the petition or placing her child with her under a voluntary services contract is not a viable option.despite the fact that this case got off track initially when kemper had no representation,it was ultimately kemper inability or unwillingness to reunify with her child that caused her to lose her parental rights.kemper child is now two years old and has never lived with kemper.she is thriving in the home of maternal relatives who want to adopt her.the child deserves to have her custody status promptly resolved and her placement made permanent and secure.ibid.
iii.kemper current malpractice action 
shortly before was filed,kemper brought a legal malpractice action against her two former appointed attorneys de soto and kisiel and their supervising attorney gulemi.she alleged defendants acted below the standard of care by waiving her right to a guardian ad litem submitting and failing to object to jurisdiction,even though kemper whereabouts were known when the petition was filed and kemper did not abandon her child allowing a case plan to be put in place that was doomed to fail failing to pursue a writ or appeal challenging the court jurisdiction and reunification findings and failing and refusing to file pursue a writ of habeas corpus after the court terminated her parental rights.kemper also alleged defendants failed to communicate with her in relation to important aspects of her case,and made extremely important strategic and tactical decisions and mistakes,as well as critical omissions kemper alleged that as a direct and proximate result of these actions,she permanently lost custody of,and contact with,her infant daughter forever.kemper said that she does not seek to overturn the juvenile court orders terminating her parental rights.rather,she seeks money damages for the injury suffered as a result of the incompetence of her juvenile dependency counsel.
summary judgment motion 
defendants moved for summary judgment based on the collateral estoppel doctrine.defendants maintained that the court found the same claimed ineffective assistance did not cause the termination of kemper parental rights,and under collateral estoppel rules,kemper is bound by that finding in her legal malpractice action.in support,defendants submitted minute orders from the juvenile court proceedings the appellate briefs in the appeal the reporter transcripts of the july,hearing appointing de soto as counsel the reporter transcript of the february,review hearing and the opinion.the facts contained in these documents are summarized above.
opposition to summary judgment motion 
kemper opposed the summary judgment.she argued the collateral estoppel doctrine was inapplicable because the court rejected the ineffective assistance claim based solely on the appellate record,and did not consider additional relevant evidence that could or would have been submitted in a habeas corpus petition.to support this argument,kemper submitted various items of this additional evidence.
first,she submitted her own declaration,detailing the underlying circumstances from her viewpoint.in summary,kemper said that when she was years old she became pregnant with nf.at the time,she lived in compton in the los angeles area with her boyfriend and her boyfriend mother,who was her legal guardian.kemper said she had prenatal care and was prepared to care for and raise her child with the help of her boyfriend family and another woman who was living in the same residence.
although kemper said she did not live in san diego and had never lived in san diego,the baby was born in san diego when she was visiting her biological mother.within several days,the baby was taken by police officers when she and her mother had an argument,even though she was prepared to care for her baby.at the time,she gave the police officers her compton address and a phone number contact.because she had no place to stay in san diego,kemper went back to los angeles and then made numerous unsuccessful attempts to locate her baby.she did not attend the may detention hearing because she was never given notice of this hearing.but later that day,kemper had a telephone conversation with social worker hood during which she confirmed her compton address and that she was living with her legal guardian.kemper said she told hood she would do anything to get her daughter back and that she was ready,willing,and able to care for her daughter.based on these facts,kemper claimed that at the time of the jurisdiction hearing,hood knew of her whereabouts and knew she had not abandoned her baby,and should have disclosed this information to the court.
with respect to the july hearing at which the court appointed de soto to represent her,kemper said i told de soto that i did not understand the allegations being level ed against me,what was happening in the juvenile dependency proceedings,why i had to appear in the juvenile court,and why my baby was still being kept from me de soto never explained the function of a guardian ad litem to me,and never asked whether i needed a guardian ad litem appointed for me de soto waiver of a guardian ad litem was done without my knowledge,understanding,or consent de soto did not challenge or deny the allegations contained in the juvenile dependency petition or the fact that i was never provided notice of the detention hearing 
regarding attorney kisiel,kemper said that kisiel never explained the status of the case to her or assisted her with reunification efforts.kemper additionally said that at the hearing kisiel also represented her boyfriend the presumed father without obtaining an informed waiver of a potential conflict.she said that kisiel did not challenge the truthfulness of the social worker statements at this hearing even though she had informed kisiel of unspecified false information in the reports and unspecified material omissions from the reports.kemper attached the letter she received from supervisor gulemi in march indicating her attorneys would not be bringing a writ petition to challenge the termination of her reunification services.
kemper also submitted a july,memorandum from attorney macgillis to defendant gulemi,suggesting that kemper prior counsel had been incompetent in failing to challenge the bogus section,subdivision g jurisdictional finding,and in failing to file a writ petition after the court denied reunification services at the hearing.in the memorandum,macgillis recognized that kemper had failed miserabl y to comply with her reunification plan,but noted kemper was a minor herself who needed assistance.the memorandum concludes i think that there are huge problems what to do macgillis attached a fire sticker to the memorandum,reflecting her view that the prior legal representation had been problematic.
consistent with this evidence,macgillis testified at her deposition taken in the malpractice action that shortly after she was assigned to the case,she told supervisor gulemi that she thought there was a conflict with continuing the representation because of the manner in which prior counsel had handled the matter,and she wanted to transfer the case to independent counsel.gulemi denied this request and instructed her to remain on the case and to raise the issues in a section motion,which she did.
kemper also submitted the deposition testimony of several other individuals,including social worker hood and attorneys gulemi,de soto,and kisiel.at his deposition,hood acknowledged that no agency social worker ever visited kemper compton home and that he was aware of kemper compton home address before the court sustained the jurisdictional allegations of parental abandonment.at his deposition,kisiel acknowledged he did not investigate the validity of the jurisdictional finding he never interviewed social worker hood or informed kemper of her right to challenge the jurisdictional finding at the hearing,he did not the social worker or present affirmative evidence and he was aware kemper wanted custody of her daughter to be returned to her.at her deposition,de soto essentially testified consistent with the record of the july hearing,that she did not recall specific conversations with kemper.at his deposition,gulemi agreed that his office never specifically challenged the jurisdictional finding and acknowledged a court may dismiss a dependency petition if a jurisdictional allegation is untrue.he said he made the decision that there were no legal or factual grounds to challenge the court order terminating reunification services.
kemper also proffered the expert declaration of nicole williams,an attorney who specializes in juvenile dependency appellate practice.williams opined that kemper attorneys breached the standard of care in numerous ways,including de soto failed to timely challenge the factual basis for the jurisdictional finding de soto improperly waived kemper statutory guardian ad litem right kisiel failed to present affirmative evidence or the social worker at the review hearing gulemi improperly refused to approve a writ petition challenging the termination of reunification services and gulemi improperly failed to declare a conflict in and reassign the case to an independent attorney.williams also opined these errors caused kemper damages,including the termination of her parental rights.
defendants reply papers 
in reply,defendants argued that kemper submitted declarations,deposition transcripts,and memoranda were irrelevant to the collateral estoppel issue because the court had already rejected the argument that the claimed attorney negligence caused kemper claimed losses the termination of her parental rights,and therefore she was barred from presenting new evidence and relitigating the issue.defendants also submitted additional portions of kemper deposition in which she testified contrary to her later declaration.
defendants also raised separate objections to kemper evidence.regarding williams declaration,defendants asserted that williams opinions lacked foundation,were speculative,and constituted improper expert testimony.regarding kemper declaration,defendants argued her statements lacked foundation,were irrelevant,and improperly contradicted prior deposition testimony.
kemper filed separate objections to defendants evidence which consisted primarily of court documents.
trial court ruling 
after considering the parties submissions and conducting a hearing,the court granted defendants summary judgment motion,concluding kemper malpractice claim was barred by the collateral estoppel doctrine.the court reasoned that kemper was precluded from relitigating the determination made by the court that kemper parental rights were terminated as a result of her own actions,and not as a result of her attorneys conduct.the court also rejected kemper arguments that collateral estoppel does not apply because kemper did not previously bring an ineffective assistance claim through a habeas corpus petition,that kemper new legal theories preclude the collateral estoppel bar.the court summarily sustained each of defendants evidentiary objections,and overruled kemper evidentiary objections.

summary judgment review standards 
a summary judgment motion must be granted if the submitted papers show there is no triable issue on any material fact and the moving party is entitled to a judgment as a matter of law.aguilar atlantic richfield cal th,aguilar.a triable issue of material fact exists only if the evidence would allow a reasonable trier of fact to find the underlying fact in favor of the party opposing the motion in accordance with the applicable standard of proof.id.at.

ii.analysis 
traditional collateral estoppel doctrine bars this action 
collateral estoppel more accurately referred to as issue preclusion prevents relitigation of previously decided issues,even if the second suit raises different causes of action.dkn holdings llc faerber cal th,dkn holdings.under california law,issue preclusion applies after final adjudication of an identical issue actually litigated and necessarily decided in the first suit and asserted against one who was a party in the first suit or one in privity with that party.id.at.the issue preclusion bar can be raised by one who was not a party or privy in the first suit.id.at.
these elements were satisfied in this case.
first,there was a final judgment on the merits in the matter terminating kemper parental rights.the determination of an issue by final judgment in a juvenile dependency proceeding is conclusive upon the parties or their privies in a subsequent suit.in re joshua th.
second,kemper was a party in the dependency proceeding at the time of the appeal.although the focus of a juvenile dependency proceeding is on the child,a parent has the status of a party in the proceeding.in re th.t he court exercises personal jurisdiction over the parents once proper notice has been given and has the authority to enter binding orders adjudicating the parents rights to,and relationship with,the child.ibid.a parent status as a party permits the parent to assert and protect her own constitutional interest in the companionship,care,custody,and management of her child.in re josiah th.
third,the identical issue was actually litigated and decided in the case.for purposes of collateral estoppel,an issue was actually litigated in a prior proceeding if it was properly raised,submitted for determination,and determined in that proceeding.citation.citations.the identical issue requirement addresses whether identical factual allegations are at stake in the two proceedings,not whether the ultimate issues or dispositions are the same.citation.hernandez city of pomona cal th.to apply the collateral estoppel bar,the issue must have been raised and decided in the prior proceeding.dkn holdings,supra,cal th at.but collateral estoppel applies even if some factual matters or legal theories that could have been presented with respect to that issue were not presented.bridgeford pacific health th,italics added see murphy murphy th,clark lesher cal d.
kemper focuses her challenge on the element.we find this challenge to be without merit.the causation issue raised and decided in was whether the alleged deficiencies in counsel performance caused the challenged result the termination of parental rights,supra.this is the same issue that kemper seeks to litigate here whether the same alleged deficiencies in counsel performance caused the alleged loss the termination of parental rights.
to succeed on an ineffective assistance claim,a parent must show counsel representation fell below an objective standard of reasonableness and the deficiency resulted in demonstrable prejudice.in re nada th,in re th.to prove prejudice,the parent must show a reasonable probability that,but for counsel unprofessional errors,the result of the proceeding would have been different.in re jackson th,jackson.
these same elements are required for a legal malpractice claim.to prevail on a professional negligence claim against an attorney,the former client must prove the breach of the applicable duty of care and proximate causation between the conduct and the resulting injury.see paul patton th,younan caruso th.the proximate causation element must be proved under the but for test,meaning that the harm or loss would not have occurred without the attorney malpractice viner sweet cal th.in challenging claimed deficient performance in a prior litigation,the plaintiff must show causation under the methodology.mattco forge,arthur young th.the plaintiff must put on a trial within a trial to establish that,but for the lawyer negligence,the client would have prevailed in the underlying action.united community church garcin d,see piscitelli friedenberg th.
in the appeal,kemper argued her attorneys provided her with ineffective assistance because they failed to challenge the jurisdictional finding under section,subdivision g waived appointment of a guardian ad litem on her behalf and failed to raise these issues in a writ petition challenging the court denial of reunification services and setting of the section hearing see rule,supra.we specifically found that even assuming she could prove her counsel acted below the prevailing standards on these matters,kemper did not meet her burden to show prejudice causation more importantly,we can not say the outcome termination of parental rights would have been different had counsel provided what kemper believes was effective representation.ibid.we reasoned that kemper own conduct established that she was unwilling and unable to adequately care for her child and thus she and not her counsel was responsible for the court termination judgment.ibid.
this conclusion bars relitigation of the causation issue.see weiner mitchell,silberberg knupp d.in her malpractice complaint,kemper asserts the same negligence grounds that she asserted in her ineffective assistance claim.the complaint identifies two additional acts of negligence allowing a case plan to be put in place that was doomed to fail and after kemper parental rights were terminated,counsel fail ed and refus ed to file pursue a writ of habeas corpus that would have ameliorated the damages.with respect to the first claim,this is functionally the same as the failure to challenge the termination of reunification services through a rule writ petition both concern the adequacy of reunification services and compliance with those services.with respect to the failure to bring a habeas corpus petition after the termination of parental rights,kemper did not allege that any of the defendant attorneys represented kemper during posttermination proceedings and therefore they can not be held responsible for actions taken after the termination judgment.
in any event,the fact a party asserts new legal or factual theories or new evidence relevant to an issue previously decided does not affect the applicability of the collateral estoppel bar.see roos red th,frommhagen bd.of supervisors d,collateral estoppel applies even though some factual matters or legal arguments which could have been presented in the prior case were not presented carroll puritan leasing d,o nce an issue is litigated and determined,it is binding in a subsequent action notwithstanding that a party may have omitted to raise matters for or against it which if asserted might have produced a different outcome.
kemper contends these principles do not apply here because she was restricted in the type of evidence she could present to support her claim.she notes that in considering an appeal,a court is limited to considering the evidence that was presented in the court below.see in re carpenter cal th,a ppellate jurisdiction is limited to the four corners of the appellate record.she thus argues that she never had a full and fair opportunity to litigate the causation issue in the appeal.
this argument is factually unsupported.the undisputed evidence shows kemper did have a full and fair opportunity to litigate the causation prejudice issue.kemper was represented by independent counsel in the appeal,who argued that the prior counsel representation caused the termination judgment.if counsel had believed additional relevant evidence was available and necessary to prove the claim,counsel could have brought a habeas corpus petition.the courts have recognized that a habeas petition is the correct vehicle to raise an ineffective assistance of counsel claim in juvenile dependency cases where the record is unclear whether counsel had reasonable grounds for the challenged actions or nonactions.see in re darlice th,darlice in re carrie th,carrie in re kristin th,kristin see also in re paul th,in re paul,supra,at conc.opn.of bamattre manoukian.kemper does not contend that her appellate counsel acted below the standard of care in making the decision not to bring a habeas petition,or that defendants de soto,kisiel,or gulemi were in any way responsible for this decision.
moreover,on our review of the entire record,kemper has not presented any new facts on the causation element that were not,or could not have
