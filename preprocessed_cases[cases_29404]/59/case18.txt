kenneth lee sustained severe injuries to his head on december,when he fell out of the passenger door of his car onto a highway.he sought treatment at sacred heart hospital sacred heart in norristown,pennsylvania where he was initially examined by theodore harrison,the emergency room physician on staff.after it became apparent that harrison would not admit lee to sacred heart,nor transfer him to a hospital that could do a of his injuries,lee decided to return home with his wife,danielle lee.
two days later,on december,lee returned home from work to find lee collapsed on the floor.lee was then taken to mary hospital mary in langhorne,pennsylvania,arriving in the mid to late morning.lee condition deteriorated as he was required to await treatment throughout the afternoon.at,a neurologist arrived and ordered lee transported to mercer hospital in trenton,new jersey for a that ultimately revealed a subdural hematoma and brain contusion.the physicians at mercer hospital performed emergency surgery on lee.however,as a result of the delay in treatment,lee allegedly suffered severe and debilitating injuries.
in january of,and lee consulted with baratta,who was then with the law firm baratta takiff,about the possibility of filing a medical malpractice case against sacred heart,mary,and the doctors who had treated lee for the injuries he had suffered on december.baratta advised the lees that they should file a medical malpractice claim against sacred heart and harrison but not against mary.he explained that he was a personal friend of a cahill,who was a physician at mary hospital,and that if the lees did not sue mary hospital,cahill would be able to testify as to the negligence of sacred heart hospital and harrison.
on march,baratta filed a complaint in the montgomery county,pennsylvania,court of common pleas the court of common pleas on behalf of the lees alleging that sacred heart and harrison failed to treat and diagnose properly lee injuries.more than ten years later,on september,the court of common pleas dismissed the lees suit for lack of activity.in january of,baratta,who was by that time a partner in b f,met with the lees and informed them that their case had been dismissed for lack of activity but that he had taken action to get the case reinstated.on january,lee sent baratta a letter expressing his dissatisfaction with the handling of his case that stated in part 
you have,for whatever reason that you never explained,dragged this case on since.you have constantly brushed off inquiries for a case status report.you caused and continue to cause great anguish to me and my family by ignoring my case,my plight,my right to expect you to abide by your contract with me,to represent me and my best interest,in my case for the medical negligence i encountered at the hands of harrison at the sacred heart hospital in december of.
on february,the court of common pleas denied baratta petition to have the lees case reinstated,a decision that was affirmed by the pennsylvania superior court on november,and by the supreme court of pennsylvania on april.
on april,baratta and b f submitted an application for professional liability insurance to coregis,which extended coverage under policy no.pll the policy for the period may,to may.on november,the lees initiated a legal malpractice action against baratta and b f by filing a writ of summons in the court of common pleas.baratta and b f promptly reported this event to coregis.on december,coregis sent a letter to baratta and b f reminding them that exclusion b of the policy provides that the policy does not apply to any claim arising out of any act,error,omission or personal injury occurring prior to the effective date of this policy if any insured at the effective date knew or could have reasonably foreseen that such act,error,omission or personal injury might be expected to be the basis of a claim coregis followed up on this letter by denying coverage in january for the lees malpractice claims against baratta and b 
on october,the lees filed a complaint in the legal malpractice suit alleging,inter alia,a failure to fulfill contractual obligations,failure to exercise skill and knowledge possessed by other attorneys in the community,and failure to prosecute the lees case against sacred heart and harrison.in addition,the complaint alleged legal malpractice for failing to sue mary.
on november,baratta and b f renewed their request for coverage,which coregis denied on february.in addition,on february,coregis initiated in the district court a declaratory judgment action against baratta and b f to obtain a declaration of its rights and obligations under the policy.in granting coregis motion for summary judgment on august,the district court concluded that a reasonable attorney in the position of baratta would foresee that his lack of action in the lees medical malpractice case might be expected to be the basis of not only a tort claim,but also a contract claim and that exclusion b in the policy precludes coverage for the lees legal malpractice action against baratta as a matter of law.coregis ins.baratta fennerty,d.on august,baratta and b f appealed to this court.
notwithstanding their appeal,on december,baratta and b f filed in the district court a motion for relief from judgment pursuant to federal rule of civil procedure b.the rule b motion presented the district court with newly discovered evidence contained in reports from frederick mceliece and joseph levinsky that were submitted in connection with the lees legal malpractice action against baratta and b f in february and september of,respectively.the mceliece report provides that despite some confusion and at least poor communication at sacred heart,there was no deviation from the standard of care at the time,but with regard to mary,if indeed kenneth lee arrived at in the morning and was evaluated at that time,the delay until until obtaining a neurosurgical consultation is not acceptable.the levinsky report states that e valuation of the care rendered at sacred heart shows no evidence of a deviation from the accepted standard of emergency medical care in.however,e valuation of the care at mary hospital reveals significant deviations from the accepted standard of medical care.
by order entered on march,the district court denied baratta and b f rule b motion.on march,baratta and b f filed another appeal.by order of this court on april,the two appeals were consolidated.we have appellate jurisdiction under.
