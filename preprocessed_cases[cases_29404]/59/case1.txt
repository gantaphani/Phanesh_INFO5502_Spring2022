a legal malpractice insurer sought a declaratory judgment in federal district court that,pursuant to a business enterprise exclusion in a lawyer professional liability insurance policy,it has neither a duty to defend nor a duty to indemnify the insured lawyer,timothy keiter,in an underlying state court suit alleging legal malpractice and breach of fiduciary duty.the district court denied the insurer summary judgment motion.it found a duty to defend under maine law and held that consideration of the duty to indemnify was premature.the insurer appealed on the duty to defend issue.
we affirm the finding of a duty to defend.
american guarantee liability insurance company american guarantee issued to timothy keiter,a professional liability insurance policy the policy that was in effect at all material times.
in june,keiter was retained as a lawyer by kaile warren,to represent him in connection with the development of his handyman business franchise concept.keiter incorporated melbren construction,melbren for warren in and,in exchange,was issued fifty shares representing percent of its common stock.warren was the president of melbren,which did business under the assumed name of.in,keiter incorporated,rah for warren for the purpose of promoting and selling franchises.warren was also the president of rah.percent of rah shares were issued to margaret keiter,timothy keiter wife at that time.keiter himself did not then receive any rah stock.in,warren sought and was offered a contract to author a book,and keiter represented warren in negotiating the contract.on keiter advice,the book contract was structured in such a way that all book royalties would go to rah and none would be paid directly to warren.
in june,keiter filed for bankruptcy on june,he obtained a bankruptcy discharge.on july,a divorce judgment ended the keiters marriage.the shares of melbren and rah were deemed marital property and were divided,as a consequence of the divorce decree,equally between timothy and margaret such that each came to hold a interest in melbren and a interest in rah as of july.in the fall of,melbren merged into rah,and immediately thereafter,rah was renamed enterprises,kwe.
on june,kwe and warren,who are appellees in this appeal,sued keiter in maine superior court.the suit the underlying action involves five counts of legal malpractice against keiter based on his alleged negligence in representing melbren and rah.more specifically,the complaint alleges that keiter was professionally negligent in preparing certain franchise documents,prosecuting the rah trademark application,negotiating the sale of a franchise,drafting the closing documents for the sale of a franchise,and drafting the documents for the purchase of a trademark.
the suit also includes a sixth claim by warren against keiter for breach of fiduciary duty in connection with keiter representation of warren in negotiating the book contract.the relevant paragraphs of count vi state 
at the time keiter negotiated the book contract on behalf of warren,keiter represented both warren and rah and was directly and closely related to a substantial stockholder in rah,keiter.
by advising warren to negotiate a contract in which the proceeds of the book were made payable entirely to rah,keiter placed himself in a position to unfairly and improperly gain in the transaction through his wife,keiter interest in rah.through this transaction,keiter took affirmative steps to obtain financial gain at the expense of his client.
in the amended complaint,the last line of what was was altered to read related to the purported owner of a substantial number of rah shares,keiter and the end of the first sentence of what was was altered to read through keiter purported interest in rah.in short,counts concerned melbren,in which keiter had an express ownership interest,as well as rah.but count vi concerned only rah,in which keiter wife had an express ownership interest but keiter did not.
when sued,keiter tendered the complaint to american guarantee and filed a claim for coverage.american guarantee initially disclaimed any duty to defend or indemnify on the ground that the allegations of the complaint were within the scope of the policy business enterprise exclusion.
keiter had gone into bankruptcy and had received a bankruptcy discharge.it appears kwe and warren believed that the policy was the only source of recovery because they amended the complaint in an effort to avoid triggering the policy business enterprise exclusion.the amended complaint included two new paragraphs alleging that the melbren and rah stock issued to the keiters provided them with no pecuniary or beneficial interest in either corporation because maine law.ann.tit,b,kwe and warren say,prohibits the issuance of shares in exchange for an agreement to perform future services and deems any such shares void.
in response to the amended complaint,american guarantee agreed to provide keiter with a defense subject to a reservation of rights and initiated an action seeking declaratory judgment that it has neither a duty to defend nor a duty to indemnify keiter in the underlying action.american guarantee argued that the claims in the underlying action fall within the scope of section c i h of the policy,which provides that coverage does not apply to 
any claim based upon or arising out of the work performed by the insured,with or without compensation,with respect to any corporation,fund,trust,association,partnership,limited partnership,business enterprise or other venture,be it charitable or otherwise,of any kind or nature in which any insured has any pecuniary or beneficial interest,irrespective of whether or not an relationship exists,unless such entity is named in the declarations.for purposes of this policy,ownership or shares in a corporation shall not be considered a pecuniary or beneficial interest unless one named insured or members of the immediate family of the named insured own s of the issued and outstanding shares of such corporation.
the argument was that keiter ownership interest in melbren brought counts within the exclusion his interest in his wife ownership of rah brought count vi within the exclusion.to avoid a duty to defend,all counts had to be within the exclusion.
the magistrate judge recommended that american guarantee motion for summary judgment be denied.as to count vi,the magistrate judge held that the allegations could reasonably be read as raising claims beyond those based upon or arising out of work performed by keiter with respect to rah,because the allegations suggested that keiter may have undertaken the negotiation of the book contract for warren as an individual rather than for the corporations.as to counts,the magistrate judge held that the allegations of the complaint alone,considered without extrinsic facts,made it possible that the policy exclusion did not apply to the claims and that the coverage issue thus could not be decided at the summary judgment stage.the district court affirmed without opinion.
we review the denial of summary judgment de novo.airy ins.greenbaum,cir.
it is helpful to understand the rationale behind the business enterprise exclusion,a standard exclusion in lawyers professional liability insurance policies.professional liability insurers generally do not wish to provide coverage for the business activities of insured lawyers.mallen smith,legal malpractice ed.the actuarial rates on which lawyers professional liability insurance rates are based contemplate that when insured lawyers exercise their professional judgment they will be acting in their capacity as lawyers and their judgment will not be clouded by personal interests.accordingly,several types of business activities raise concerns for insurers and lead them to include policy provisions that exclude those activities from coverage.first,there are the business aspects of the practice of as renting office space in which to practice or dissolving a partnership formed for the purpose of the losses associated with those aspects of practice.see id.second,there are activities undertaken by lawyers that blur the line between the practice of law and the practice of bu
