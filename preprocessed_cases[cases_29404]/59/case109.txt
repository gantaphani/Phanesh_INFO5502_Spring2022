in lynch filed a complaint against warwick containing causes of action for legal malpractice,breach of contract and breach of fiduciary duty.as amended,the causes of action were based on warwick alleged failure to perform the professional services for which he was retained.lynch alleged that warwick failed to interview key witnesses,unnecessarily sought continuances,failed to prevent the loss or destruction of evidence,failed to develop a working relationship of trust and confidence with him,and failed to adequately communicate with him about the case.
as damages,lynch sought in his negligence cause of action to recover the amount of money he had paid to the second retained attorney in his breach of contract action,sought to recover the he had paid to warwick and in his breach of fiduciary duty cause of action,sought general and punitive damages.
warwick moved for summary judgment on the ground that lynch had failed to establish negligence by failing to designate an expert witness and on the ground lynch failed to establish his actual innocence of the criminal charges.the court granted summary judgment on lynch failure to establish actual innocence and denied lynch subsequent motions for reconsideration and to vacate the judgment.
discussion 
lynch argues the actual innocence requirement for a legal malpractice suit against a former criminal defense attorney does not apply here because he is seeking expenses unrelated to guilt or innocence 
generally,the elements of a legal malpractice action are the duty of the attorney to use such skill,prudence,and diligence as members of his or her profession commonly possess and exercise a breach of that duty a proximate causal connection between the breach and the resulting injury and actual loss or damage resulting from the attorney negligence.coscia mckenna cuneo cal th,d.in a legal malpractice case arising out of a criminal proceeding,california,like most jurisdictions,also requires,as a necessary element,proof of actual innocence.id.at,d,wiley county of san diego cal th,d,wiley.the actual innocence requirement applies to legal malpractice claims asserted against both private attorneys and public defenders.barner leeds cal th,d.
in wiley,the supreme court explained the actual innocence requirement was justified by policies against allowing an individual to profit by his own fraud,or to take advantage of his own wrong,or to found a claim upon his iniquity,or to acquire property by his own crime.wiley,supra,cal th,d.the wiley court observed that allowing civil recovery for convicts impermissibly shifts responsibility for the crime away from the convict.ibid.wiley made it clear that o nly an innocent person wrongly convicted due to inadequate representation has suffered a compensable injury because in that situation the nexus between the malpractice and palpable harm is sufficient to warrant a civil action,however inadequate,to redress the loss.id.at,d.the wiley court further explained 
the guilty criminal may be able to obtain an acquittal if he is skillfully represented,but he has no right to that result just as he has no right to have the jury nullify the law,though juries sometimes do that,and the law provides no relief if the right is denied him.citation.moreover,t he underpinnings of common law tort liability,compensation and deterrence,do not support a rule that allows recovery to one who is guilty of the underlying criminal charge.a person who is guilty need not be compensated for what happened to him as a result of his former attorney negligence.there is no reason to compensate such a person,rewarding him indirectly for his crime,at,d.
the wiley court actual innocence requirement also rested on key differences between civil and criminal actions.the court observed that,unlike a criminal case where the defendant has recourse to postconviction relief,a civil matter lost through an attorney negligence is lost forever and the civil litigant,unlike the criminal defendant,has no recourse other than a malpractice claim.wiley,supra,cal th,d.the wiley court further noted 
reinforcing this conclusion that a criminal malpractice action requires a showing of actual innocence are the pragmatic difficulties that would arise from simply overlaying criminal malpractice actions with the civil malpractice template.in civil actions,carrying the burden on causation is relatively straightforward and comprehensible for the jury,even if it necessitates a trial within a trial.the factual issues in the underlying action are resolved according to the same burden of proof,and the same evidentiary rules apply.thus,it is reasonably possible for the malpractice jury to assess whether and to what extent counsel professional lapse compromised a meritorious claim or defense.citation.
by contrast,the prospect of retrying a criminal prosecution is something one would not contemplate with equanimity citations.the procedure outlined in shaw state,of admin.alaska,suggests this estimation is not exaggerated t he standard of proof will be a complex one,in essence,a standard within a standard.plaintiff must prove by a preponderance of the evidence that,but for the negligence of his attorney,the jury could not have found him guilty beyond a reasonable doubt.citations.moreover,while the plaintiff would be limited to evidence admissible in the criminal trial,the defendant attorney could introduce additional evidence,including any and all confidential communications,as well as otherwise suppressible evidence of factual guilt.citations.the mental gymnastics required to reach an intelligent verdict would be difficult to comprehend much less execute.citations.avoiding such a procedure is also consistent with a strong judicial policy against the creation of two conflicting resolutions arising out of the same or identical transaction.citation.wiley,at,d.
finally,the wiley court observed 
tort damages are in most cases fungible in the sense that the plaintiff seeks in a malpractice action exactly what was lost through counsel negligence money.damages in criminal malpractice are difficult to quantify under any circumstances.calculating them when,for example,counsel incompetence causes a longer sentence would be all the more perplexing.wiley,supra,cal th,d.
lynch claims that wiley is distinguishable because guilt or innocence is not relevant to the instant matter,he is not suing for being wrongfully convicted or receiving a longer sentence as was at issue in wiley and the cases upon which wiley relied,and warwick was not his attorney when he pleaded guilty.we are unpersuaded.
lynch guilt or innocence is relevant in this case.lynch claims rests on the assertion that he had meritorious defenses,that had warwick exercised proper care,skill and diligence,lynch would have received a proper or reasonable defense with respect to the underlying criminal charges,and lynch would not have been forced to fire warwick and retain other legal counsel at the eleventh hour.to the extent lynch claim is based on a loss of meritorious defenses,clearly guilt and innocence are at issue an innocent person is one who has a meritorious defense to the charges while a guilty person is one who lacks a meritorious defense.to establish warwick conduct resulted in the loss of a meritorious defense,lynch guilt or innocence would be litigated.to rebut lynch claims as to lack of a meritorious defense and negligence,warwick would be entitled to put on evidence establishing lynch guilt,the reasonableness of his investigation and conduct in light of lynch guilt.warwick would be entitled to put on evidence that he advised lynch to plead guilty not because warwick had failed to conduct a sufficient investigation or was unprepared for trial but because lynch was,in fact,guilty and had no meritorious defense to the charges.as to lynch claimed damages for having to retain a second attorney who advised him to plead guilty,guilt or innocence would be at issue since if lynch were guilty,lacked any meritorious defenses,or was reasonably advised by warwick to plead guilty,it could not be said that warwick was the cause of lynch incurring the expense of a second attorney.rather,the cause of the additional expense would have been lynch failure to earlier plead guilty as advised by warwick.
further,in violation of one of the policies identified in wiley,lynch is seeking to shift blame he is seeking to blame warwick for his lack of a meritorious defense,for his second retained counsel advice to plead guilty and his guilty plea rather than accepting his responsibility for having committed the crimes.without a showing of actual innocence,the fact that warwick could have conducted a more thorough investigation or have communicated more with lynch fails to establish that warwick negligence resulted in any harm,including the need to retain a second attorney.
furthermore,lynch claim that he lost meritorious defenses as a result of warwick incompetence is contradicted by the fact lynch pleaded guilty and thereby admitted he had no meritorious defenses and was,in fact,guilty of the charges.
the dissent suggests that lynch claim for attorney fees he paid to warwick is a breach of contract case not covered by wiley.contract law exists to enforce the intentions of the parties to an agreement while tort law is designed to vindicate social policy.foley interactive data cal d.a wrongful act may constitute both a breach of contract and an invasion of an interest protected by the law of torts.witkin,cal.procedure ed.actions.north american chemical superior court th,d.a cause of action in tort may sometimes arise out of the negligent manner in which the contractual duty is performed perry robertson d.
here,although he seeks a contractual type damage expenses for attorney fees and labels his cause of action as a breach of contract,lynch is actually seeking recovery on a tort theory for warwick negligence,lynch is seeking recovery for legal malpractice.our supreme court has made it clear that a legal malpractice action against a former criminal attorney requires a showing of actual innocence.see also mahoney shaheen,cappiello,stein gordon,holding the actual innocence requirement applies when damages are sought for contempt fines and attorney fees related to a criminal proceeding.
further,the fact that lynch is seeking expenses,attorney fees,does not readily distinguish lynch case from other criminal malpractice actions.seeking attorney fees incurred in a legal malpractice action due to the prior attorney negligence is a typical item of damages.see california state auto.bureau parichan,renberg,crossman harvey th,d saunders cariss d.moe transamerica title ins.d.undoubtedly,criminal malpractice actions involving retained counsel would involve a claim for attorney fees and yet the supreme court did not create any exception for attorney fee damages.
additionally,like cases involving an avoidable conviction or longer sentence,lynch claim of attorney malpractice,while couched in terms of breach of contract,is integrally involved with guilt or innocence and his case would give rise to the proof problems noted by the supreme court in wiley.lynch trial would require the jury to engage in the mental gymnastics the wiley court sought to avoid.here,while lynch may be seeking quantifiable,losses,his criminal malpractice trial will involve the same difficulties in proving causation as exist in cases where the complaint is related to a wrongful conviction or longer sentence.indeed,proof may be even more difficult and convoluted in this case.for example,in his claim to recover fees paid to the second retained attorney,lynch will have to prove that not only was warwick negligent,but also that his second attorney was not negligent and that there was no unnecessary duplication of effort.warwick would be permitted to introduce evidence showing lynch was guilty,had no viable defense,and should not have hired a second attorney but rather should have pleaded guilty at an earlier date.as to seeking reimbursement for fees paid to warwick,the proof would be less convoluted but even so,issues of guilt and innocence would arise in the context of determining whether warwick was negligent.as noted in wiley,the jury would be faced with applying a preponderance of the evidence standard to issues involving a reasonable doubt standard.
the dissent expresses concern that if proof of actual innocence were required under these circumstances,a criminal defense attorney could collect a large retainer fee from a client and neglect the client case with impunity if the client could not prove actual innocence.dis,post,at.the dissent concern was addressed to some extent in wiley.in wiley,the court observed there would be situations where the criminal defense attorney was clearly negligent,such as when the attorney failed to raise a technical defense that would have resulted in a complete dismissal of the case,and yet the supreme court held the actual innocence requirement applied in these circumstances.wiley,supra,cal th,d.
moreover,there are remedies other than a legal malpractice action to preclude criminal defense attorneys from collecting large retainer fees and then neglecting a client case.such an attorney could be reported to the state bar and be subject to discipline.see bus,moral turpitude,dishonesty or corruption irrespective of criminal conviction.additionally,to the extent the criminal defendant or other individual who paid the retainer fee has a dispute with the attorney about fees because the attorney has abandoned the client versus making disputed tactical decisions about how to try the case,the attorney fee issue could be arbitrated by the state bar see,et 
we conclude the actual innocence requirement for a criminal legal malpractice case applies regardless of whether the former criminal defendant is seeking damages for a wrongful conviction,a longer sentence,or for attorney fees.
because we have concluded that summary judgment was properly granted on the ground that lynch failed to raise a triable issue of fact as to the required actual innocence element of a legal malpractice action against a former criminal defense attorney,we need not discuss whether summary judgment was also justified on the basis of lynch failure to designate an expert.
disposition 
the judgment and order are affirmed.
thomas lynch,filed a fourth amended complaint against his former attorney thomas warwick,containing causes of action for negligence,breach of contract and breach of fiduciary duty.all three causes of action are based on warwick alleged failure to perform the professional services for which lynch retained him in connection with criminal charges filed against lynch.the complaint alleges,either directly or through incorporation by reference,that lynch suffered monetary damages when he was forced to replace warwick with new counsel.although lynch alleges warwick conduct caused him to incur additional attorney fees paid to replacement counsel and refers to the additional fees as damages he suffered,he stated in his opening brief and confirmed at oral argument that he does not seek to recover those fees but rather limits his claim to the he paid to warwick less the reasonable value of services warwick rendered.
warwick moved for summary judgment or,in the alternative,for summary adjudication on two grounds expert evidence is required to prove warwick violated the standard of care and lynch did not designate an expert witness and lynch can not satisfy the
