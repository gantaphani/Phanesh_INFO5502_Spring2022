code of civil procedure section,subdivision a hereafter section a provides an action against an attorney for a wrongful act or omission,other than for actual fraud,arising in the performance of professional services shall be commenced within one year after the plaintiff discovers,or through the use of reasonable diligence should have discovered,the facts constituting the wrongful act or omission we granted review to decide whether an attorney refusal to return a former client money after the client terminated the representation was a wrongful act or omission arising in the performance of professional services under section a.we hold that section a applies to a claim when the merits of the claim will necessarily depend on proof that an attorney violated a professional obligation that is,an obligation the attorney has by virtue of being an attorney in the course of providing professional services.such claims brought more than one year after the plaintiff discovers or through reasonable diligence should have discovered the facts underlying the claim are by section a unless the plaintiff alleges actual fraud.
according to plaintiff nancy lee second amended complaint,she advanced defendant attorney william hanley funds to cover attorney fees in litigation,but hanley refused to return unearned attorney fees after lee terminated the representation.hanley demurred on the ground that the lawsuit was barred by section a.after concluding that section a applied to lee claims and that she filed her complaint more than one year after hanley informed her that he would not return her money,the trial court sustained the demurrer with leave to amend.lee declined to file a further amended complaint,and the trial court dismissed the case.
we conclude the trial court erred in sustaining the demurrer.in this procedural posture,the trial court was required to construe all factual allegations in the complaint in lee favor.lee allegations,if true,would show that hanley has violated certain professional obligations in the course of providing professional services,and any claim based on his violation of these obligations is.but the complaint can also be construed to allege a claim for conversion whose ultimate proof at trial may not depend on the assertion that hanley violated a professional obligation.thus,on at least one reasonable construction of the complaint,at least one of lee claims is not.we therefore affirm the court of appeal judgment reversing the trial court order sustaining defendant demurrer.
on review of the judgment of the court of appeal reversing the superior court order sustaining defendant demurrer,we examine the complaint de novo to determine whether it alleges facts sufficient to state a cause of action under any legal theory,such facts being assumed true for this purpose.mccall pacificare of,cal th,d.accordingly,we assume the truth of the allegations in lee second amended complaint.
lee retained hanley to represent her in a civil litigation matter and over several months advanced hanley to be used for attorney fees and costs as well as to be used for expert witness fees.the matter settled on january.on february,hanley sent lee a letter and an invoice for legal services,both of which indicated that lee had a credit balance of.in april,lee telephoned hanley to request a final billing statement and a refund of her final credit balance.hanley responded that lee did not have a credit balance and would not receive a refund.
on december,lee and her new lawyer,walter wilson,each sent hanley a letter,terminating hanley services and demanding a refund of in unearned attorney fees and approximately in unused expert witness fees.on december,hanley returned in unused expert witness fees.he has not returned any unearned attorney fees.
on december,over a year after sending her demand letter to hanley,lee filed suit.hanley demurred on the ground that lee lawsuit was under section a.before the trial court ruled on the demurrer,lee filed her first amended complaint,so the trial court ruled that the demurrer was moot.hanley demurred to the first amended complaint on the same basis as his original demurrer.concluding that section barred all of lee claims,the trial court sustained the demurrer with leave to amend.
lee filed a second amended complaint.the second amended complaint alleged that hanley provided appropriate legal services and lee did not suffer any injury from said services the second amended complaint further alleged on or about february,defendants sent to plaintiff the last billing for through the dismissal,offsetting their earned against the war chest,informing plaintiff the remainder was a credit balance after all professional services were completed of.within a reasonable time after transmission of the last billing,but no later than march,defendants should have paid plaintiff credit balance to plaintiff,but did not.as a direct and proximate result of defendants and each of their sic failure to return to plaintiff the unearned,defendants were unjustly enriched,and plaintiff lost,said.plaintiff herein seeks the return of said unearned funds.plaintiff also seeks interest on said funds,at the legal rate of from march,through judgment.
hanley again demurred on section a grounds.the trial court issued a tentative ruling sustaining the demurrer without leave to amend,stating that the funds were advanced in connection with the performance of professional services and the attorney was required to return the funds upon his discharge.at oral argument,lee suggested that she could cure the defects in her complaint and requested leave to amend.the trial court sustained the demurrer but allowed lee leave to amend by adding a count for fraud.when lee did not file a further amended complaint,the trial court dismissed the action with prejudice.
lee appealed,arguing that section a does not apply to her claims.in the alternative,she argued that the limitations period was tolled from december,to december,because hanley continued to represent her until the day he returned her unused expert witness fees.she also argued that the limitations period did not begin to run until she discovered hanley belief that his retention of her credit balance arose in the performance of professional services.
the court of appeal opinion began by observing that section a does not apply to every conceivable case in which a client alleges that an attorney took actions that wronged him or her.for example,section a would not bar a claim that an attorney stole money from a client unattended purse,even if the client was in the attorney office to discuss a lawsuit.a theft claim against an attorney alleges wrongful conduct,but that conduct does not arise in the performance of professional services even if the client and the attorney were discussing legal matters at the time the theft took place.
after reviewing the allegations in lee second amended complaint,the court of appeal determined that the complaint could be construed to advance a claim for conversion,and a claim for conversion is not relevantly different from a claim for theft.thus,the court concluded,section a might not bar lee lawsuit.the court explained we do not know whether,on remand,the facts as ultimately developed will show a theft of funds,an accounting error,or something else.while a cause of action based on the theft or conversion of client funds,for example,would not be subject to the section statute of limitations,a cause of action predicated on an accounting error could be.finding that the trial court erred in sustaining the demurrer,the court of appeal reversed.
finally,the court of appeal addressed lee tolling and date of discovery arguments in case she continued to assert claims to which section a would apply on remand.the court held that the statute of limitations began to run no later than december,when lee and her attorney sent hanley a letter terminating the representation.the court further held that,for purposes of section a,the date of discovery is the date lee discovered or should have discovered hanley wrongful conduct,not the date she discovered hanley belief that section a may apply to her lawsuit.we granted review.

we review de novo questions of statutory construction.imperial merchant services,hunt cal th,d.in doing so,our fundamental task is to ascertain the intent of the lawmakers so as to effectuate the purpose of the statute.we begin by examining the statutory language because it generally is the most reliable indicator of legislative intent.we give the language its usual and ordinary meaning,and i f there is no ambiguity,then we presume the lawmakers meant what they said,and the plain meaning of the language governs.if,however,the statutory language is ambiguous,we may resort to extrinsic sources,including the ostensible objects to be achieved and the legislative history.ultimately we choose the construction that comports most closely with the apparent intent of the lawmakers,with a view to promoting rather than defeating the general purpose of the statute.mays city of los angeles cal th,d,citations omitted.
as noted,the claims in lee complaint can not survive the demurrer if they are for a wrongful act or omission,other than for actual fraud,arising in the performance of professional services within the meaning of section a.the statutory text does not by itself make clear whether the phrase arising in the performance of professional services limits the scope of section a to legal malpractice claims or covers a broader range of wrongful acts or omissions that might arise during the relationship.because the text is ambiguous see roger cleveland golf,krane smith,apc th,d roger cleveland finding section a ambiguous,we proceed to examine the statute purpose and legislative history.
the legislature enacted section a in amid rising legal malpractice insurance premiums.see mallen,panacea or pandora box a statute of limitations for lawyers cal.state bar hereafter mallen during the last year,insurance premiums of california attorneys have increased from per cent to almost per cent.hill,the bar at bay malpractice woes hit attorneys as lawsuits against them increase,wall street journal,beal bank,ssb arter hadden,llp cal th,d,beal bank.the increase in premiums was due in part to two features of the law that had produced uncertainty surrounding the limitations period for claims of legal malpractice.
first,our decisions in neel magana,olney,levy,cathcart gelfand cal d,and budd nixen cal d,held that a cause of action for legal malpractice does not accrue until the client discovers,or should have discovered,the facts establishing the elements of the cause of action.neel,at,budd,at.these decisions made it difficult for attorneys and insurers to determine when the limitations period for potential malpractice lawsuits began to run.
second,before,the limitations periods for malpractice lawsuits depended on the forms of action contained in a plaintiff complaint.lawsuits for malpractice were subject to different limitations periods depending on whether the plaintiff pleaded breach of a written contract code civ,four years,fraud,three years,or breach of an oral contract or a tort affecting intangible property,subd.two years.see com.on judiciary,analysis of assem.bill reg.sess.as amended may.under the old scheme,attorneys could not be certain of the applicable limitations period for potential claims of malpractice.
the legislature responded by enacting assembly bill reg.sess,which added section to the code of civil procedure.hereafter assembly bill.the legislature sought to reduce the cost of legal malpractice insurance and limit the of the various limitations periods for claims against attorneys.democratic caucus,on assem.bill reg.sess.as amended,see stoll superior court th,d stoll the limitation of one year was designed to counteract the potential of lengthy periods of potential liability wrought by the adoption of the discovery rule,and thereby reduce the costs of malpractice insurance.
the bill evolution in the legislature helps to further illuminate the statute purpose.as originally introduced on january,the proposed bill provided in relevant part in any action for damages against an attorney based upon the attorney alleged professional negligence,the time for the commencement of action shall be three years after the date of the negligent act or one year after the plaintiff discovers,or through the use of reasonable diligence should have discovered,the damage,whichever first occurs.assem.bill.reg.sess.as introduced.on may,the bill was amended in the assembly to read in relevant part an action against an attorney for a wrongful act or omission,other than for actual fraud,arising in the performance of professional services shall be commenced within one year after the plaintiff discovers,or through the use of reasonable diligence should have discovered,the facts constituting the wrongful act or omission,or four years from the date of the wrongful act or omission,whichever occurs first.assem.bill.reg.sess.as amended may.thus,the assembly replaced the bill original phrase professional negligence with the ultimately enacted phrase wrongful act or omission,other than for actual fraud,arising in the performance of professional services.
although the legislative history does not explain the substitution,the amended language can be traced to a proposal in a state bar journal article submitted to the assembly committee on judiciary around the time of the amendment.assem.com.on judiciary,dig.of assem.bill reg.sess.as amended on,citing mallen,supra,state bar.that article proposed a single statute of limitations applicable to legal malpractice claims.the author suggested using the phrase a n action against an attorney for a wrongful act or omission rather than malpractice because malpractice is not in itself a word of precise definition.legal malpractice is best stated in terms of the actual wrong a wrongful act or omission occurring in the rendition of professional services.mallen,at.we have previously observed that assembly bill dr ew heavily from this article and was rewritten with mallen proposal as a template,borrowing verbatim some of the language appearing in mallen article.beal bank,supra,cal th at,d.thus,in enacting the final version of the bill,the legislature intended to establish a limitations period that would apply broadly to any claim concerning an attorney violation of his or her professional obligations in the course of providing professional services regardless of how those claims were styled in the plaintiff complaint.
at the same time,the legislative history following the change continued to indicate that the legislature primary focus was establishing a new limitations period for legal malpractice.all legislative history subsequent to the may,amendment continued to speak of the bill as creating a statute of limitations for legal malpractice claims.see,assem.com.on judiciary,dig.of assem.bill reg.sess.as amended may,off.of legal affairs,enrolled bill on assem.bill reg.sess,see also roger cleveland,supra,th at,d all the subsequent legislative material that we have reviewed referred to what became section as a statute of limitations for legal malpractice southland mechanical constructors nixen d.southland from the time the statute was introduced in the assembly to its ultimate signing by the governor,every legislative analysis on section began with a review of existing statutes of limitation applicable to legal malpractice actions,including section,subdivision for actions based on a written contract,disapproved on other grounds,laird blacker cal th,d.assembly bill passed the senate on august,and the assembly on september.
in a letter urging governor brown to sign the bill,the bill sponsor wrote this bill creates a new statute of limitations for legal malpractice actions in an effort to close off the present time frame allowed for such actions.assemblyman willie brown,letter to governor edmund brown.governor brown approved assembly bill on september.
from the legislative history described above,we draw two conclusions about the legislature purpose in enacting section a.first,the legislature sought to eliminate the former limitations scheme dependence on the way a plaintiff styled his or her complaint.analyses produced in committee identified this dependence as one of the sources of uncertainty in the pre limitations scheme.com.on judiciary,analysis of assem.bill reg.sess.as amended may.similarly,the state bar journal article that outlined the amendment to the statutory text suggested that the statute be stated in terms of the actual wrong rather than in terms of a single cause of action,professional negligence.mallen,supra,cal.state bar at.thus,assembly bill consolidated the prior limitations periods applicable to malpractice claims against attorneys.the legislature enacted the statute so that the applicable limitations period for such claims would turn on the conduct alleged and ultimately proven,not on the way the complaint was styled.see prakashpalan engstrom,lipscomb and lack th,d prakashpalan section a applies to a breach of fiduciary duty claim yee cheung th,d same for malicious prosecution vafi mccloskey th,d same for malicious prosecution stoll,supra,th at,d same for breach of fiduciary duty southland,supra,d at.same for breach of contract.
second,the version of the bill that the legislature ultimately adopted was designed to give assembly bill a broader sweep than its original language would have provided.as a result of the may,amendment,the statute applies not only to actions for professional negligence but to any action alleging wrongful conduct,other than actual fraud,arising in the performance of professional services.at the same time,the legislature continued to make clear that its primary purpose was to address the growing cost of malpractice lawsuits.that is why committee reports and analyses throughout the legislative process focused on rising legal malpractice insurance premiums.thus,while section a applies to claims other than strictly professional negligence claims,it does not apply to claims that do not depend on proof that the attorney violated a professional obligation.
in light of these observations,we conclude that section a time bar applies to claims whose merits necessarily depend on proof that an attorney violated a professional obligation in the course of providing professional services.in this context,a professional obligation is an obligation that an attorney has by virtue of being an attorney,such as fiduciary obligations,the obligation to perform competently,the obligation to perform the services contemplated in a legal services contract into which an attorney has entered,and the obligations embodied in the rules of professional conduct.by contrast,as the court of appeal observed,section a does not bar a claim for wrongdoing for example,theft that does not require proof that the attorney has violated a professional obligation,even if the theft occurs while the attorney and the victim are discussing the victim legal affairs.section a also does not bar a claim arising from an attorney performance of services that are not professional services,meaning services performed by an attorney which can be judged against the skill,prudence and diligence commonly possessed by other attorneys.quintilliani mannerino th,d quintilliani.
both parties disagree,at least in part,with this holding.lee observes that the legislature in enacting section a was primarily concerned with legal malpractice.in her view,section a applies only when an attorney is acting as an attorney that is,only when an attorney performs services that require a license to practice law.lee thus urges us to distinguish between legal and nonlegal services,and to hold that section a does not apply to claims based on an attorney provision of nonlegal services that are merely incidental to the practice of law.because safely keeping and timely returning client funds is merely incidental to a lawyer provision of legal services,lee argues,section a does not apply to her lawsuit.
this view falters on the statutory text,which speaks of wrongful conduct arising in the performance of professional services,not merely legal services.a,italics added.to be sure,section a does not apply to claims involving an attorney provision of services unrelated to the practice of law,such as concert promotion.see quintilliani,supra,th at,d.but the relationship often requires attorneys to provide nonlegal professional services such as accounting,bookkeeping,and holding property in trust.see prakashpalan,supra,th at,fn,d.indeed,the training and regulation that make the practice of law a profession,as well as the grounds on which an attorney may be disciplined as an attorney,include professional obligations that go beyond duties of competence associated with dispensing legal advice or advocating for clients in dispute resolution.see,cal.rules of conduct,rule governing an attorney handling of a client property.in light of the legislature intent that section a cover more than claims for legal malpractice,the term professional services is best understood to include nonlegal services governed by an attorney professional obligations.
hanley urges us to construe section a to apply to all forms of attorney misconduct,except actual fraud,that occur during the relationship or entail the violation of a professional obligation.although the legislature intended section a to apply to most lawsuits between clients and their attorneys,so as to reduce the uncertainty driving the cost of malpractice insurance premiums ante,at,d,hanley proposed construction sweeps too broadly.
misconduct does not aris e in the performance of professional services for purposes of section a merely because it occurs during the period of legal representation or because the representation brought the parties together and thus provided the attorney the opportunity to engage in the misconduct.to hold otherwise would imply that section a bars claims unrelated to the legislature purposes in enacting section a for example,claims that an attorney stole from or sexually battered his client while the attorney was providing legal advice.nor does section a necessarily apply whenever a plaintiff allegations,if true,would entail a violation of an attorney professional obligations.the obligations that an attorney has by virtue of being an attorney are varied and often overlap with obligations that all persons subject to california laws have.for example,everyone has an obligation not to sexually batter others see,subd.a,but attorneys also have a professional obligation not to do so in the particular context of the relationship see cal.rules of conduct,rule.for purposes of section a,the question is not simply whether a claim alleges misconduct that entails the violation of a professional obligation.rather,the question is whether the claim,in order to succeed,necessarily depends on proof that an attorney violated a professional obligation as opposed to some generally applicable nonprofessional obligation.
hanley maintains that when an attorney professional obligations overlap with generally applicable obligations,today holding can be exploited by artful pleading.he argues,for example,that a claim most naturally understood as an ordinary fee dispute,based on alleged deficiencies in the attorney performance,can be styled as a claim for conversion.but plaintiffs involved in ordinary fee disputes can not evade the statute as hanley suggests.proper pleading requires a complaint to contain a statement of the facts constituting the cause of action,in ordinary and concise language.code civ,subd.a.further,the attorney or party filing the complaint must
