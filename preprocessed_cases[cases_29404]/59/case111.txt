statement of the case and facts 
in may,paul winters established a trust,naming as himself and regina fellman,whom he had recently married.winters was nearly years old and fellman was.the trust provided that if fellman predeceased winters,upon winters death all the trust assets would be distributed to fellman adult daughter from a prior marriage,diane mirviss.winters reserved the right to terminate or amend the trust.
in late may,winters was hospitalized and diagnosed with dehydration,renal failure and dementia.soon thereafter,fellman petitioned for a conservatorship of winters person and estate,requesting orders to have mirviss replace winters as and to restrict winters power to revoke or amend the trust without prior court approval.the court granted these orders and subsequently replaced fellman as conservator with professional conservator barbara devries.the court entered an order which provided during the pendency of these proceedings,the conservatee shall not have the power either to amend or to revoke the paul winters trust,dated june,without the prior approval of this court.
on august,fellman died of colon cancer.accordingly,mirviss became the sole trustee and beneficiary of the trust.winters had been telling devries that he wanted to change his trust and she sought a lawyer for him.respondent accepted the appointment.
respondent met with winters on september and.winters was adamant that he did not want mirviss to act as successor and trustee of the trust or benefit from his estate and remained adamant on this point until his death.winters was in a convalescent hospital respondent was aware he had been released from the hospital two days before and had a heart condition that respondent understood to be life threatening.respondent told winters there was some sense of urgency about making decisions on his estate plan.respondent was aware of the order restricting winters power to amend the trust from his review of the case file and had not previously seen an order like it.he understood from the order that the court would prefer application be made to the court for authority to amend before a trust amendment was executed,although he felt the order was ambiguous as to whether court approval would be required before an amendment was signed and he did not think the court would refuse to inquire into the circumstances of his signing the trust amendment prior to obtaining court approval.appellants expert,john hartog,had also never seen an order like this and characterized it as unique and ambiguous.respondent expert,barbara jagiello,had not seen an order like it either and found it confusing,but did not see anything in the order to indicate the court would not consider the validity of a testamentary trust after the trustor death.respondent other expert,bruce friedman,found the order astonishing.
respondent met with winters again on september and then on october.during this time,winters was uncertain how he wanted to dispose of his estate.on october,winters asked respondent to ask his friends,john hult and pat lombardo,to call him about his estate plan.respondent made these calls on november.hult reported to respondent almost immediately that winters wanted to leave his estate to appellants.when respondent next met with winters on november,winters showed him a piece of paper with five names,four matching the ones hult had provided but the fifth being a morabito and not lombardo.winters then indicated he wanted to give lombardo and have him be trustee,and was not sure he wanted to give anything to morabito.respondent suggested making devries the trustee but winters disagreed.
on november,respondent told the court investigator,john cusher,and devries that he thought winters was coming to a decision on his estate plan.on november,devries told respondent that winters had had a heart incident and respondent felt it was more urgent to accomplish the trust amendment.on november,respondent prepared the trust amendment,providing for distribution of the trust assets in equal shares to john hult,pat lombardo,mary dorcy,albert butch winters and maria winters,and took it to winters,but winters was angry and refused to talk to him.respondent returned to see winters on december,on which date winters signed the amendment and respondent notarized it.respondent wanted to meet with winters once more before seeking court approval of the amendment,both to be sure winters remained consistent regarding his choice of beneficiaries and to resolve whom winters wanted as trustee,and planned to meet with him in.winters died on december.
about a month after winters death,respondent filed a petition for approval of the trust amendment.mirviss filed a petition to invalidate the amendment.by order of april,the probate court denied the petition for approval and granted mirviss petition,finding the amendment had been executed without the prior court approval required by prior court orders and was therefore invalid and void.
appellants appealed the probate court decision in re conservatorship of winters,but while the appeal was pending settled with mirviss for percent of the trust assets.the appeal was dismissed on september.according to appellants,after deducting attorney fees,they received about from winters estate.
meanwhile,on september,appellants lombardo,hult and dorcy filed the present complaint for damages for professional negligence against respondent.appellants claimed that respondent failed to take the steps necessary to cause the trust amendment to become effective upon winters death by failing to apply for court approval immediately upon receiving winters instructions,failing to immediately prepare the amendment,failing to immediately present the amendment to winters for execution once it was prepared,failing to immediately apply for court approval after winters executed the amendment and failing to apply for an order shortening time to have the court consider a petition for approval on an emergency basis.a first amended complaint filed on december,added appellants albert winters and maria winters as plaintiffs.
the matter came on for trial on february.a jury was empaneled on february.after considering the parties motions in limine,however,the court came to the conclusion on february that the probate court had erred in ruling that the trust amendment was invalid because it was signed without prior court approval.according to the superior court,because a court is required to interpret an order to maintain its validity and constitutionality if it is possible,a reasonable court would have interpreted the order in such a way that it did not limit the testamentary capacity of winters and would have held a hearing to at least explore the circumstances surrounding the proposed amendment either before or after winters death.given this conclusion,the court questioned whether any negligence by respondent could be viewed as having resulted in any damages,suggesting that it would not have mattered if respondent had handled matters differently because the court should have held a hearing in any event.the court rejected as calling for speculation appellants counsel argument that actionable negligence could be proved because the probate court erroneous ruling was foreseeable.respondent attorney responded with a motion for nonsuit,which the trial court granted.the court order,filed on april,includes the following findings and determinations as a matter of law 
to maintain the validity and constitutionality of the order if possible,a reasonable court should have interpreted the order as not restricting the conservatee testamentary ability to amend his trust 
had defendant filed a petition for approval of the amendment after its execution but before paul winters death,on friday december,or between monday,december,and friday december,a reasonable court should not have held a hearing on the petition before the death because such a court should have required proper notice to the trustee,and there was insufficient time to do that.however,a reasonable court should have granted a hearing to be conducted after paul winters death to explore the circumstances surrounding the proposed amendment,whether the petition for approval of the amendment was filed before or after winters death 
although in the conservatorship proceeding the court denied defendant petition for approval of the amendment without considering the amendment on its merits,a reasonable court should have granted a hearing to at least explore the circumstances surrounding the amendment.
since a reasonable judge should have considered the circumstances surrounding the amendment after defendant petitioned for its approval,it is inconsequential that paul winters died before the amendment was brought to the court attention in the conservatorship proceeding and there is no causal connection between the conduct of the defendant and the plaintiffs alleged damages.
judgment was entered on june,and notice of entry of judgment was served on june and filed on june.appellants filed a timely notice of appeal on august.
discussion 
a defendant is entitled to a nonsuit if the trial court determines that,as a matter of law,the evidence presented by plaintiff is insufficient to permit a jury to find in his favor.campbell general motors cal d,in determining whether plaintiff evidence is sufficient,the court may not weigh the evidence or consider the credibility of witnesses.instead,the evidence most favorable to plaintiff must be accepted as true and conflicting evidence must be disregarded.the court must give to the plaintiff evidence all the value to which it is legally entitled,indulging every legitimate inference which may be drawn from the evidence in plaintiff favor.id.at.in reviewing a grant of nonsuit,we are guided by the same rule requiring evaluation of the evidence in the light most favorable to the plaintiff.carson facilities development cal d,we will not sustain the judgment unless interpreting the evidence most favorably to plaintiff case and most strongly against the defendant and resolving all presumptions,inferences and doubts in favor of the plaintiff a judgment for the defendant is required as a matter of law,quoting mason peaslee d,nally grace community church cal d.additionally,we will not consider any ground for the nonsuit not advanced in the trial court,except one which identifies an incurable defect.lawless calaway cal d,loral moyes d.
where a nonsuit is granted after opening argument,the reviewing court accepts as true the facts asserted in the opening statement and indulges every legitimate inference those facts support.hoff vacaville unified school dist.cal th,d.similarly,here,we accept as true the facts stated in appellants trial court briefs and argument.see aspen enterprises,bodge th,d parties stipulated that plaintiff oral argument and supplemental brief in opposition to the motion for nonsuit would serve as its opening statement.
appellants contend that the trial court erred in holding as a matter of law that the probate court ruling superseded respondent alleged negligence in causing appellants damages.they maintain that the probate court ruling could constitute a superseding cause only if it was not reasonably foreseeable and that foreseeability was a question of fact for the jury.they additionally argue that the probate court ruling could not supersede respondent alleged negligence in failing to deliver the trust amendment to the trustee during winters lifetime.
respondent characterizes the case differently,viewing the critical issue not as foreseeability of the probate court ruling but as whether causation depended on a legal ruling which presented a question of law for the court to decide.according to respondent,the threshold issue in the malpractice case was how a reasonable court should have ruled on the petition to amend the trust the trial court correctly decided this issue as a question of law and concluded the probate court should have held a hearing on the validity of the amendment and since a reasonable court should have considered the merits of the petition to amend the trust,no conduct of respondent caused appellants damages.stated differently,in respondent view,if the trust amendment was within the requirements of the conservatorship order as properly interpreted,respondent conduct could not be viewed as having caused appellants any damage only if the amendment failed to comply with the order should the question of respondent conduct have been submitted to the jury.
it should be stated at the outset that we do not find it necessary to determine whether the trial court was correct to find that the probate court ruling on the trust amendment was erroneous,or whether appellants are presently in a position to maintain that the probate court order was actually correct as will be explained,whether the probate court was correct or incorrect,factual questions existed as to liability in the present case and nonsuit was improperly granted.

one aspect of causation is cause in fact or actual cause was the defendant conduct a substantial factor in bringing about the injury.mitchell gonzales cal d,d.the other is legal or proximate cause.

causation is generally a question of fact for the jury,unless reasonable minds could not dispute the absence of causation.constance state of california d.here,the trial court concluded that respondent conduct did not cause any injury to appellants because if the probate court had properly construed its conservatorship order,the petition for approval of the trust amendment would have been considered on its merits at the time it was presented by respondent.appellants,however,offered must be accepted as true for purposes of reviewing the nonsuit see hoff vacaville unified school,supra,cal th at,d,that a reasonable attorney confronted with the conservatorship order involved here would have taken steps before execution of the trust amendment to avoid the result reached in the probate court.specifically,appellants expert testified in his deposition that respondent violated the standard of care by not filing a petition for instructions to determine the proper interpretation of the conservatorship order not requesting the court to allow winters to sign the trust amendment subject to court approval after execution not seeking approval of the amendment more quickly after it was signed and generally not acting with greater dispatch in handling the amendment.appellants argue that the proper inquiry for the trial court was whether they would have prevailed in the probate court if respondent had taken any of these steps.for example,if respondent had requested clarification,would a reasonable court have construed the conservatorship order to permit the amendment winters executed if respondent had requested permission from the court for winters to sign the amendment,subject to subsequent approval,would a reasonable court have granted the request if a reasonable court would have responded to such requests by allowing the amendment,respondent failure to take these steps would be a substantial factor in causing appellants injury.
if the probate court it should have entertained a hearing on the merits of the amendment despite respondent failure to take earlier action to obtain court fact would alter the analysis only if the probate court action could be viewed as a superseding cause of the injury.in skinner stone,raskin israel cir,for example,the plaintiff sued attorneys who had represented him in a divorce action in which a default judgment was entered in favor of his former wife.the attorneys formally entered the case to move to vacate the default judgment on grounds that it was entered without proper notice the trial court denied this motion but was reversed on appeal.in the malpractice action,the second circuit held that although the plaintiff,as a result of the appeal,was again in a position to contest the divorce case on the merits,he could recover expenses attributable to the defective default judgment,expenses in opposing enforcement of that judgment if the default judgment resulted from the attorneys negligence.the court pointed out that there was evidence from which a jury could conclude the attorneys could have taken steps to head off the entry of the default,as they had been provided with a copy of the proposed judgment a month before it was entered.according to skinner,the attorneys could be held liable if their conduct was a proximate contributing cause of the injury unless the trial court mistake was a superseding cause.id.at.
as appellants point out,even if the probate court ruling was erroneous,it can not be viewed as unforeseeable as a matter of law.as an abstract principle,it is always foreseeable that a trial court will err,as evidenced by the existence of appellate courts.in the case before us,there is clearly evidence that the probate court ruling was foreseeable.the literal language of the conservatorship order required prior approval for a trust amendment.respondent acknowledged in his deposition that he believed the conservatorship order indicated the probate court would prefer approval of a trust amendment before execution.the deposition testimony of the parties expert witnesses demonstrates that they,too,viewed the conservatorship order as appearing to require prior approval of the trust amendment.indeed,the appellants and respondent viewed the order as unique,ambiguous,astonishing and confusing,because the order appeared to require prior approval of the court for a testamentary disposition that normally would not be subjected to such a requirement.even if the probate court was in fact wrong to insist on prior approval of the amendment,there was abundant evidence that respondent could have foreseen from the language of the conservatorship order that it might do so,and might have been able to protect against this result by seeking the prior approval the order appeared to require,or attempting to clarify the interpretation of the order.faced with a highly unusual order that appeared to impose a requirement for the amendment of the trust of an elderly client,in rapidly failing health,who unequivocally wanted to change the beneficiary of the trust,respondent had an obligation to take all reasonable steps to avoid having the conservatorship order interfere with the effectuation of his client wishes.acting in violation of the apparent requirement of the if respondent believed that requirement to be appellants to unnecessary risk.an attorney owes a duty to his client to employ that degree of knowledge,skill,and judgment ordinarily possessed by members of the legal profession in carrying out the services for his client.citation.one of these obligations is anticipating reasonably foreseeable risks.citation.temple hoyne buell foundation holland hart,attorney could be liable for negligence in drafting option contract that did not in fact violate rule against perpetuities for failure to protect against likelihood of litigation concerning applicability of the rule,italics omitted.
when an attorney is charged with negligence,the question is what result would have been reached by a reasonable court if the attorney had not engaged in the conduct alleged to be negligent.the standard is objective it does not ask what the same court would have done under different circumstances but what the result should have been if the attorney had acted differently.the method does not recreate what a particular judge or fact finder would have done.rather,the jury task is to determine what a reasonable judge or fact finder would have done brust newton.even though should and would are used interchangeably by the courts,the standard remains an objective one.the trier of facts determines what should have been,not what the result would have been,or could have been,or might have been,had the matter been before a particular judge or jury.phillips clancy harline barker utah,justice carter cir,mallen smith,legal malpractice,supra.mattco forge,arthur young th,d.
the trial court analysis of this case did not consider what a reasonable court would have done if respondent had acted in the manner appellants expert testified a competent attorney would have.rather,the court asked what a reasonable court faced with respondent actual conduct should have done and,because it believed the probate court did not so act,the court concluded that there was no causal link between respondent conduct and appellants injury.in effect,the court was passing judgment on the nature of respondent conduct by determining that a proper interpretation of the conservatorship order would have allowed for a hearing on the merits of the trust amendment either before or after winters death,the trial court determined that respondent engaged in no erroneous conduct.indeed,respondent so characterizes the matter on appeal,arguing that a s there was no erroneous conduct on huysentruyt part,the trial court was correct to conclude that the element of causation could not be shown.
this reasoning confuses the issues of causation and breach of the standard of care if respondent engaged in no erroneous conduct,appellants case would be defeated because there was no negligent conduct,not because that conduct did not cause appellants injury.this was not the basis of the nonsuit.the trial court granted nonsuit on grounds of absence of causation.because appellants offered evidence that respondent conduct breached the standard of care,the trial court should have considered what a reasonable court should would have done if respondent had acted in conformance with the standard of care.the trial court view of the case serves to exonerate respondent because of what it considered to be the probate court error when,according to the evidence offered by appellants,respondent could have headed off any such error by recognizing the ambiguity in the conservatorship order and acting to protect against the possibility that the probate court would enforce its most.such exoneration would be appropriate only if the probate court mistake could be viewed as a superseding cause.skinner stone,raskin israel,supra,at.here,it could not,because there was evidence the probate court order was foreseeable.
on the other hand,if the probate court order was in fact correct,the existence of factual issues as to respondent liability is even more apparent.if the conservatorship order,properly construed,required prior approval before the trust amendment was executed,respondent would be liable if his failure to obtain such prior approval constituted sustained conduct and was the proximate cause of appellant injury.the evidence discussed above as creating factual issues regarding respondent conduct in failing to seek clarification of the order or approval from the court for the amendment clearly demonstrates the existence of factual issues under this scenario as well.
appellants additionally maintain that the nonsuit should not have been granted of any error by the probate was negligent in failing to deliver the trust amendment to the trustee during winters lifetime,an omission that would have been fatal to the amendment if the probate court had considered it on the merits.appellants assert that winters trust set forth no method for modification and respondent does not dispute this point.when a revocable trust does not expressly provide an exclusive method for modification or amendment,it may be modified by a writing other than a will signed by the settlor and delivered to the trustee during the lifetime of the settlor,subd.a see also,conservatorship of irvine th,d.if a settlor modifies the trust but fails to inform the trustee,the modification or amendment will not be effective if the trust instrument requires delivery of the modification or amendment to the trustee or the trustee consent,because the modification or amendment will not have been made according to the terms of the governing instrument.cal.trust administration,italics added.conservatorship of irvine,supra,th,d.in irvine,a trust amendment that was delivered to the wrong individuals was held ineffective.id.at,d.
appellants contend that even if the probate court had considered the trust amendment on its merits,it would have had to invalidate the amendment because it was not delivered to the trustee during winters lifetime,and that respondent was negligent in not delivering the trust amendment to the trustee in the nine days between the time winters signed it and the time he died.respondent,however,maintains that the trust must be read in conjunction with the conservatorship order requiring prior court approval for amendments and that because there was no prior approval here,there was no effective modification to deliver to the trustee.respondent notes the statement in conservatorship of irvine,supra,that i nstruments may require consent of a third party or a specific waiting period before the modification is effective.th at,d,quoting cal.trust administration,supra.as irvine noted,p rovisions like these are designed to protect settlors from possible undue influence of people who would like to benefit from the trust assets.ibid.
respondent can not have it both ways.in arguing on this appeal that the trial court properly found an absence of causation,respondent takes the position that,properly interpreted,the conservatorship order did not require prior court approval of the particular amendment at issue in this case.if that is so,respondent can not rely on the requirement of prior approval to excuse a failure to deliver the amendment to the trustee.
the trial court made no findings concerning appellants claim of malpractice based on respondent failure to deliver the trust amendment to the trustee before winters death its determination that appellants damages were not caused by respondent conduct but by the probate court erroneous ruling ignores this separate claim.nonsuit on this basis was therefore inappropriate.it bears noting,however,that in order to prevail on a claim of malpractice based on respondent failure to deliver the trust amendment to the trustee,appellants will ultimately have to demonstrate both that respondent was negligent in not so delivering the amendment and that the amendment would have been effective if he had done so.this latter showing could be made only if appellants could also demonstrate that the amendment would have been found valid in the context of the prior court approval issue.if a reasonable court would not have approved the amendment if respondent had taken what appellants assert were the proper steps to comply with or obtain relief from the conservatorship order requirement of prior approval,any negligence with respect to delivery of the amendment would be irrelevant.
appellants seek sanctions against respondent for his failure to timely file his brief on appeal.appellant opening brief was filed on november.on december and,respectively,the parties signed a stipulation to extend the time for filing respondent brief to january,provided that n o rule b notice shall be issued extending respondent time to file his brief beyond january.apparently,this stipulation was not received by this court.on december,this court notified respondent that the matter would be submitted for decision based on the record and appellants opening brief if respondent brief was not filed within days,unless respondent showed good cause for an extension of time.cal.rules of court,rule b.on january,the stipulation extending time to january was filed.
on january,respondent filed an application for an extension of time to february.respondent attorney declared that he had determined he needed to file an application to augment the record with documents including the briefs in the appeal from the probate court order and that he was preparing for an oral argument that had been rescheduled from january to february in an appeal of a million verdict with a record of more than volumes as well as briefing two additional appeals besides the present one.the extension of time was granted on january.respondent brief was not filed and,on february,this court notified respondent pursuant to rule b that the time for filing his brief had expired.
on march,respondent filed an application for permission to file his brief.according to respondent counsel,after obtaining the extension to february,he planned to file the brief within that time frame and,in any case,within the time frame of a proper rule b notice providing days in which to file the brief,rather than seek another extension,as the brief was substantially completed.respondent counsel believed that the december,rule b notice was erroneous because of the parties stipulation extending the time for filing the brief until january,and,therefore,that he would receive a rule b notice with respect to the february,deadline.instead,respondent counsel received the february notice that time had expired.
on march,appellants counsel filed a declaration in opposition to respondent application,arguing that granting the application would prejudice appellants and that respondent counsel had no basis to believe he could file his brief later than february.according to appellants counsel,david baer,when respondent initially asked for the stipulation to extend time in december,baer explained that a continuance was not in his clients interests because prejudgment interest was accruing on their claims,which might exceed the policy limits on respondent professional liability policy,but agreed to the extension provided that respondent counsel waived his right to a rule b extension allowing him to file the respondent brief after that date.baer declared that he told bacerdo to call him if he needed a further extension.on january,baer received bacerdo application for an extension of time to february.on february,baer learned that the associate who had prepared the opening brief in this case would be leaving the firm on march.she confirmed that she would be able to prepare the reply brief and contacted bacerdo,who told her he would be filing respondent brief at the last minute and might wait for the rule b notice.baer believed the parties december stipulation precluded any rule b extensions.accordingly,he felt it was proper when he did not hear from bacerdo after receiving the court february notice that time to file respondent brief had expired or the court march notice that the case was fully briefed.
in response to the application to late file respondent brief,baer stated that the parties december stipulation precluded any rule b extension he a
