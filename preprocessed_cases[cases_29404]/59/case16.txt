opinion of the court 
state national appeals from the dismissal of its claims against donna whiteside for legal malpractice.the district court dismissed state national claims because state national could not demonstrate that whiteside actions proximately caused state national to suffer any damages.in this case,we must first determine whether this court has jurisdiction over state national appeal.only then may we determine whether the district court erred in dismissing the claims against whiteside.
for the reasons that follow,we hold that this court lacks jurisdiction over state national appeal because it was untimely.accordingly,we do not reach the merits of state national claim that whiteside was improperly dismissed from its case.
factual history 
this dispute centers on donna whiteside representation of the county of camden,new jersey county in a lawsuit brought by nicholas anderson,which resulted in a jury award paid,in part,by the county excess insurer,state national insurance company state national.
on december,nicholas anderson was seriously injured after crashing his car into a guardrail on a road owned and maintained by the county.anderson filed suit against the county for negligence in maintaining the road and guardrail and sought million in damages.
the county maintained an insurance policy with state national whereby the county was responsible for the first of losses and state national obligations were triggered only if a potential loss exceeded this amount.in order to invoke state national coverage obligations,the policy required the county to provide an adequate defense and investigation of any action for or notice of any actual,potential or alleged damages.in the event that the county failed to meet this requirement,the policy provided that state national shall not be liable for any damages or costs or expenses resulting from any such occurrence.the policy limit was million.
pursuant to the policy,the county utilized its own attorney,donna whiteside,assistant county counsel,to defend the county against the anderson lawsuit.according to state national,the county did not notify state national of the anderson lawsuit until several months after it was filed and after the county first became aware of the claims against it.whiteside initially informed state national that the case was meritless and valued it at.in the midst of trial,whiteside changed her valuation and requested the full million policy limit to settle the claims with anderson.after receiving this valuation,state national conducted an independent review and denied the county request for million.after the parties failed to settle,the anderson case continued to trial.on october,the jury reached a verdict in favor of anderson and awarded him million,which was later remitted to million.
procedural history 
four days after the verdict in the anderson case,state national filed suit,seeking a declaratory judgment that it was not obligated to provide coverage under the policy because the county had breached the policy contract.it alleged that the county failed to timely notify state national of the case and failed to mount an adequate investigation and defense of the lawsuit,as required by the policy.state national also asserted claims directly against whiteside for professional negligence,legal malpractice,breach of fiduciary duty,and breach of contract.
in its first amended complaint,state national alleged that whiteside defense of the case fell well below adequate because she did not present evidence or assert defenses that would have either totally cut off the county liability or would have substantially lowered anderson recovery.specifically,state national alleges that she did not present expert reports or testimony,raise available statutory defenses,or anderson expert witnesses.because whiteside advised state national on the case status,progress,and likely outcome,state national claims that an relationship existed between it and whiteside.
whiteside moved to dismiss under federal rule of civil procedure b for failure to state a claim.on march,the district court granted her motion,holding that the county and whiteside were not two distinct entities based on respondeat superior and the contract between state national and the county,and thus any liability of whiteside must be borne by the county.moreover,the district court found no proximate cause because if whiteside did not provide an adequate defense,then state national was not obligated to pay.but if whiteside did provide an adequate defense,then state national was subject only to its existing contractual duty to pay.
following the dismissal,on march,state national filed a motion under rule e,asking the district court to reconsider its dismissal of whiteside.the district court denied state national motion on june.the district court also denied state national motion for certification under rule b,which if granted,would have allowed state national to immediately appeal whiteside dismissal.
although whiteside was dismissed from the litigation,state national case against the other defendants went on.over the next four years,all of state national claims against the other defendants were resolved,and only the claims against the county remained.eventually,the district court denied state national motion for summary judgment on its remaining claims against the county.state national alleges that in the district court march,order denying summary judgment,the district court undermined its prior ruling that served as the basis for dismissing whiteside.accordingly,state national sought leave to renew its claims against whiteside under rule b,which permits the district court to grant relief from a final judgment,order,or proceeding.
before the district court ruled on state national rule b motion,state national and the county reached a settlement.the parties filed a joint stipulation of dismissal with prejudice pursuant to rule a a ii on october.the stipulation of dismissal acknowledged that state national wanted to renew its claims against whiteside,but state national made no motion or request before the district court apart from the clause in the stipulation of dismissal.
on december,the district court denied state national rule b motion to renew the claims against whiteside.it rested on the same reasoning as its earlier ruling and rejected state national arguments that its march,order called any of its prior rulings into question.in that opinion,the district court ordered the clerk of court to terminate the litigation and close the case.
the case was closed on december.state national filed its notice of appeal on december.in the notice of appeal,state national sought an appeal from the district court december,order denying its motion under rule b to reinstate its claims against whiteside.the notice did not reference the underlying rule b dismissal,and it was filed days after the stipulation of dismissal had been entered.
the district court had jurisdiction pursuant to.before reaching the merits of this appeal,we must consider whether we have appellate jurisdiction we exercise plenary review in answering this question 
the timeliness of an appeal is a mandatory jurisdictional prerequisite.under federal rule of appellate procedure a,the appellant must file a notice of appeal with the district clerk within days after entry of the judgment or order appealed from.because the time limit embodied in rule a derives from a statute,it is a jurisdictional requirement.
in addition to the requirement that it must be timely filed,the notice of appeal must also specify the judgment,order,or part thereof being appealed.if an appeal is taken only from a specified judgment,this court does not exercise jurisdiction to review other judgments that were not specified or fairly inferred by the notice 
in our case,state national faces two hurdles with respect to this court appellate jurisdiction.first,the parties voluntarily dismissed this case on october,days before state national filed its notice of appeal.because of the mandatory jurisdictional prerequisite embodied in federal rule of appellate procedure a a,we permitted the parties to submit supplemental briefing on the issue of whether the parties voluntary termination of the case constituted a final judgment from which the time limit in rule began to run.
second,even if the stipulation of dismissal did not trigger the time limit,state national notice of appeal specified only the district court december,order denying state national rule b motion.it made no mention of the underlying dismissal of whiteside on rule b grounds.yet,in its brief before this court,state national argued only that the rule b dismissal was error it made no arguments that the district court erred in denying its motion under rule b.
the first issue we must address is whether state national notice of appeal was timely.federal rule of appellate procedure a a required state national to file its notice of appeal within thirty days of the judgment it was appealing.here,state national filed its notice on december,well within thirty days of the order denying its rule b motion on december.
although at first glance,the timeline of state national appeal seems to comport with the requirements of rule,the nature of state national rule b motion and the stipulation of dismissal complicate the issue.
state national rule b motion 
the district court dismissed state national claims against whiteside on rule b grounds on march,nearly four and a half years before this appeal was taken.after whiteside dismissal,the case was not immediately appealable because other parties and claims remained in the litigation more than four years later,on march,the district court denied summary judgment on state national claims against the county.state national,believing this opinion called into question whiteside dismissal,sought to get another bite at the apple before an appeal to this court.
in order to get review of the district court earlier dismissal of whiteside,state national filed a rule b motion on april,asking the district court to reconsider its prior dismissal.although rule e would have been the most obvious route to get reconsideration of the prior dismissal,state national had already done so four years earlier.without the ability to file a timely motion under rule e state national attempted to reinstate its claims against whiteside using rule b,which provides that the court may relieve a party from a final judgment,order,or proceeding for any other reason that justifies relief.
but rule b grants the district court the power to relieve a party from a final judgment,order,or proceeding.the march,order dismissing whiteside and not all of the defendants was not a final order.rather,it was an interlocutory order that was not immediately appealable unless the district court certified it under rule b,which it refused to do thus,because the underlying dismissal of whiteside was not a final judgment,order,or proceeding,state national rule b motion was not a proper avenue by which to challenge her dismissal 
apart from rule b,the district court has the inherent power to reconsider prior interlocutory orders.under its inherent powers,the district court could have reinstated whiteside at any point during which the litigation continued.the power to reconsider prior interlocutory orders depends on the district court retaining jurisdiction over the case 
the stipulation of dismissal 
the parties,however,filed a stipulation of dismissal under rule a a ii,and pursuant to that stipulation,the parties agreed to voluntarily dismiss the case.rule a a ii provides that the plaintiff may dismiss an action without a court order by filing a stipulation of dismissal signed by all parties who have appeared.
the language of the rule makes clear that a dismissal under rule a a ii does not require a court order,nor does it require the approval of the court because a dismissal under rule a a ii does not require a court order or approval,we have held that t he entry of such a stipulation of dismissal is effective automatically.
state national argument that rule requires a separate entry of judgment is unavailing.every court to have considered the nature of a voluntary stipulation of dismissal under rule a a ii has come to the conclusion that it is immediately no separate entry or order is required to effectuate the dismissal.
once the voluntary stipulation is filed,the action on the merits is at an end a ny action by the district court after the filing of the stipulation of dismissal can have no force or effect because the matter has already been dismissed.a voluntary dismissal deprives the district court of jurisdiction over the action.
the dissent criticizes our discussion of anago franchising,smallbizpros,and smith as a line of cases arising out of the supreme court decision in kokkonen guardian life insurance company of america but kokkonen is not relevant here.kokkonen speaks to the district court ancillary jurisdiction to enforce the settlement agreement that served as a basis for the parties stipulated dismissal.in this case,the parties are not concerned with enforcing their settlement agreement.rather,we are concerned with the district court jurisdiction over the original matter.
the dissent misinterprets the basis of our holding kokkonen does not compel the conclusion that the stipulation of dismissal divested the district court of jurisdiction the federal rules of civil procedure do.long before the supreme court decided kokkonen,we held that a stipulated dismissal under rule was automatic we have also held that a timely notice of voluntary dismissal invites no response from the district court and permits no interference by it.the dissent attempts to distinguish the cases cited here as merely invoking the kokkonen principle,but both versata software,callidus software,and meinecke block of houston focus on the broader concerns relevant here.
in versata software,the federal circuit vacated its own opinion because it was issued after the parties voluntarily dismissed their case before the case had been decided recognizing that the joint stipulation of dismissal between the parties automatically dismissed the case with no further action of the district court required,the federal circuit held that there was no longer a controversy pertinent to the parties appeal 
similarly,in meinecke block of houston,the fifth circuit held that the district court grant of summary judgment in favor of the defendants was of no consequence because the parties had three days earlier filed a stipulation of dismissal pursuant to rule a a ii even though the district court order approving of the stipulated dismissal was handed down on the same day as the order granting summary judgment,the fifth circuit recognized that the dismissal was effective when filed,and any further actions by the court were superfluous.
the final judgment 
after the stipulated dismissal,there was nothing left for the district court to do.the stipulation of dismissal resolv ed the matter.a final judgment is one which ends the litigation on the merits and leaves nothing for the court to do but execute the judgment.a final order accomplishes two ends it disposes of all of the claims presented to the district court,and it leaves nothing further for the district court to do.
following the stipulation of dismissal,all of the claims against all of the parties remaining in the litigation had been resolved.because whiteside was no longer a party to the litigation,and the district court had not exercised its inherent power to review its previous interlocutory order dismissing her,the only claims remaining were the claims asserted by state national against the county.because the stipulation of dismissal resolved these claims,the stipulation of dismissal was a final judgment.
state national rule b motion did not prevent the stipulation of dismissal from serving as the final judgment.state national claims against whiteside had already been resolved,and every available method of reinstating its claims against her had been exhausted state national can not rely on an improper procedural motion to argue that its own dismissal of the case was not a final judgment.because the district court could not have reinstated the claims against whiteside after the stipulated dismissal,there was nothing further for the district court to do.
nor does the single statement in the stipulation of dismissal that nothing in the settlement shall be construed in any way to release or otherwise limit the claims state national has asserted or may assert against donna whiteside prevent finality.the parties did not make their dismissal contingent on the district court ruling on state national rule b motion.and the parties did not make a motion before the district court for it to decide on whether the claims against whiteside should be reinstated before dismissing the case.moreover,state national and the county can not speak for whiteside in their stipulated dismissal whiteside had already been dismissed from the litigation years earlier.
the dissent argues that,because the district court a fter the stipulation of dismissal both accepted briefing from the parties and issued an order permitting additional briefing,the district court intended to retain jurisdiction until it ruled on state national motion and to exercise its inherent power to reconsider its prior decision.the district court actions,however,can not override the application of jurisdictional rules,as both this court and the supreme court have held.the dissent position is just dead wrong.
in lizardo united states,we held that an untimely rule e motion does not toll the time to appeal under rule a a even if the party opposing the motion did not object to the motion untimeliness and the district court considered the motion on the merits.we expressed concern about basing the timeliness of motions on what occurred in the district court because such a system would inject uncertainty into the appeal timeline and would be based on the happenstance of a particular litigation.instead,the federal rules of appellate procedure require uniformity.thus,we held that the appellant appeal was untimely even though the district court in that case had ruled on the merits of his rule e motion.
similarly,the supreme court,in bowles russell,in rejecting the unique circumstances doctrine,held that a district court assurances about timeliness,and a party good faith reliance on them,are not enough to cure a jurisdictional defect there,the district court had told the appellant bowles that he had seventeen days to file his notice of appeal.in reality,he had only fourteen.bowles filed his notice of appeal on the sixteenth day one day before the district court deadline and two days after the actual deadline the deadline was jurisdictional,and as a result,it could not be tolled or waived.thus,the court held,his notice of appeal was untimely,and it dismissed his appeal 
these cases demonstrate that no matter how the district court actions may be,they can not confer jurisdiction where it is lacking.and the district court erroneous consideration of an improper or untimely motion can not alter the timeliness requirements of federal rule of appellate procedure a.in this case,the district court consideration of state national rule b motion can not confer jurisdiction where the case had already been dismissed.because of the dismissal,no claims remained against any party still involved in the litigation the stipulated dismissal was the final decision.
appealability and tolling 
once an order becomes final,the time for appeal begins to run following the final judgment,federal rule of appellate procedure a provides that the party wishing to appeal has thirty days to do so.state national did not file within thirty days of its joint stipulation of dismissal the final judgment.therefore,state national appeal days after the final judgment was untimely.the time requirement in federal rule of appellate procedure a is jurisdictional and mandatory,and the failure to comport with this mandatory deadline deprives this court of appellate jurisdiction.
contrary to state national contention,none of the tolling provisions of federal rule of appellate procedure a a is applicable here.state national argues that its rule b motion tolled the time to file its appeal.under federal rule of appellate procedure a a vi,a rule b motion filed no later than days after the judgment is entered,tolls the time to file an appeal the time to appeal runs from the entry of the order disposing of the rule b motion.but as previously explained,state national motion to renew its claims was not a proper rule b motion.t he function of the motion,and not the caption,dictates which rule is applicable.because state national motion was not actually a rule b motion,its motion to renew its claims against whiteside can not extend the time to file an appeal under federal rule of appellate procedure a a vi.
state national motion was also not a timely rule e motion that could operate to extend the time to file a timely appeal.under federal rule of appellate procedure a a iv,if a party timely files a motion to alter or amend the judgment under rule,the time to file an appeal runs from the entry of the order disposing of such motion.a rule motion is timely when it is filed within days of the order or judgment for which reconsideration is sought state national had previously filed a timely rule motion on march,immediately after whiteside was first dismissed from the litigation its motion to renew its claims against whiteside,which state national contends tolls the time to appeal,was not filed within days of whiteside dismissal and thus can not extend the time for state national to appeal.
the dissent questions why we can not consider state national rule b motion as a premature motion that ripened after the stipulation of dismissal was filed.even if we assume that state national rule b motion was the proper means of getting review of whiteside dismissal,it would still not toll the time to appeal.this is because federal rule of appellate procedure a a iv permits tolling of the time to appeal if a rule motion is filed no later than days after the judgment is entered.in state national view,the judgment entered is whiteside dismissal.however,that judgment was entered years before state national filed its rule b motion.thus,under either view of the nature of state national rule b motion,tolling is inapplicable 
the dissent also argues that motions invoking rule b should be treated flexibly and functionally.in making this argument,the dissent relies on torres charter,in which this court allowed appeal of the denial of a rule b motion,even though the motion sought review of a supposedly interlocutory order in that case,however,the interlocutory order subject to the rule b motion was a district court order to remand a claimant social security disability claim to the commissioner of the social security administration.this court explained that if we did not entertain the appeal,on remand the claimant may receive an award of benefits,in which event he will not appeal,and it is very doubtful the commissioner could appeal.under those circumstances,we held that such an order was final and could be the basis for a rule b motion because it was likely that appellant would be unable to secure appellate review of that decision.that situation is not applicable here.after the stipulated dismissal,state national could have appealed the underlying dismissal of whiteside on rule b grounds.thus,state national was not unable to secure appellate review of whiteside dismissal,and torres exception to the requirement of finality for rule b motions is inapposite.
it is strict to require state national to file an appeal while the district court was apparently still considering state national rule b motion,even if it was an improper one.but jurisdiction is a strict master.the stipulation of dismissal was effective immediately,and because all of the remaining claims were resolved by that stipulation,the stipulated dismissal was a final judgment from which the time to appeal began to run.state national failure to appeal within thirty days of the final judgment deprives this court of jurisdiction to hear its appeal.the district court consideration of a motion that it lacked the power to grant or deny can not excuse this failure.
because we hold that we lack jurisdiction on the basis of state national untimely notice of appeal,we do not reach the alternative jurisdictional argument advanced by whiteside that a notice of appeal that references only an order denying a rule b motion does not draw into question an underlying dismissal under rule b 
for the foregoing reasons,we will dismiss this case for lack of jurisdiction.
the majority acknowledges that its interpretation of the operative rules of procedure is strict.majority op.at.but the interpretation goes beyond strict with all respect,it is wrong.i therefore dissent from the dismissal of the appeal.
here are the key procedural steps and the dates on which they occurred.the district court dismissed state national insurance company claims against donna whiteside in an order dated march.over four years later,on april,state national filed a motion for leave to renew its malpractice claims against whiteside styled as a motion pursuant to fed.civ.b.the district court initiated active litigation by soliciting briefing and ordering settlement negotiations.the litigation proceeded between whiteside and state national with neither party questioning the district court jurisdiction.during the battle over the motion to reinstate the claims against whiteside,state national separately entered a stipulation of dismissal with the county of camden on october.nothing in the stipulation limited state national efforts to renew its claims against whiteside.on the contrary,the stipulation provided that it should not be construed in any way to release or otherwise limit those claims.app.the district court then entered an order,on december,denying state national motion for leave to proceed with its claims against whiteside,and,in the same order,directed that the matter be marked as closed.state national filed its notice of appeal on december.
as my colleagues in the majority see it,even though state national was trying to obey court orders to actively litigate its motion to reinstate its claims against whiteside,it was actually allowing the clock to run on its time to appeal.all that litigation wound up being a nullity.it turns out that,unbeknownst to the district court or the parties,state national was foolishly forfeiting claims worth perhaps millions of dollars.as the majority would have it,state national could only maintain its appeal rights by choosing between two bad alternatives it could abandon its settlement of its separate claim against the county,or it could appeal the dismissal of the claims against whiteside even as the district court was actively reconsidering that dismissal.the federal rules of civil procedure and of appellate procedure are meant to permit the just,speedy,and inexpensive determination of every action and proceeding,fed.civ,and to allow district courts to fully resolve all issues in the first instance so that appellate review is not piecemeal,eisen carlisle jacquelin.it would therefore be strange if the rules really did put state national in that bind.but,properly understood,they do not.
the majority has the rules wrong,but it is correct that the october,stipulation of dismissal terminated the litigation between state national and the county.it is also correct that the district court had the power to reinstate the claims against whiteside either through its inherent powers to reverse an interlocutory decision or through ruling on a rule motion.the majority incorrectly concludes,however,that the district court failed to reinstate state national claims through either of those means.i disagree.though the stipulation of dismissal did terminate state national suit against the county,it did nothing to divest the court of jurisdiction over the entirely separate claims against whiteside.therefore,whether characterized as a motion invoking the district court inherent power or a rule b motion,state national motion did keep the matter against whiteside open until it was resolved by the district court.therefore,the time to appeal did not begin to run until the court issued its december,order denying the motion,and state national appeal is timely.
discussion 
my colleagues acknowledge that,before the county and state national filed their stipulation of dismissal,the district court had inherent authority to reinstate the claims against whiteside.they also seemingly recognize that,had the order dismissing whiteside been final before the stipulation of dismissal,the district court could have given state national relief under rule b.but they nevertheless hold that state national can get the benefit of neither of those avenues for relief.the majority says instead that the court inherent authority was lost when the stipulation of dismissal was entered,and that rule b relief was unavailable before the stipulation of dismissal was entered because the order dismissing whiteside was not final.i reject both of those conclusions and would hold that state national could have received relief from the district court by either route.
a.the district court jurisdiction under its inherent authority 
the clearest way to resolve the question of timeliness would be to rule that the dismissal of state national claims against whiteside was not final until december,when the district court denied state national motion to renew its claims.it is true that the claims against whiteside had earlier been dismissed by what all agree was an interlocutory order,but the district court chose to exercise its inherent power to reconsider that decision.state national filed its motion for leave to renew its claims against whiteside on april,and three days later,the district court set deadlines for considering the motion.both sides then actively litigated the matter until it was finally decided on december.that was thus the true date of final judgment on the claims against whiteside,at which point the time to appeal began to run.
the majority reaches a contrary conclusion by saying that the district court was divested of any jurisdiction over the claims against whiteside when state national and the county filed a stipulation of dismissal on october.my colleagues seem to agree that,just a day earlier,the dismissal of the claims against whiteside was interlocutory and unappealable,and that the district court was free to reinstate the claims against whiteside.yet,even as the district court was actively considering doing just that,it lost jurisdiction,according to the majority,because the plaintiff claim against a separate defendant was settled.
to reach that conclusion,my colleagues rely upon a series of cases that stand only for the unremarkable proposition that when a plaintiff and a defendant resolve their dispute through a rule stipulation of dismissal,that dispute ends and the district court loses jurisdiction.none of the cases they cite,however,suggests that the stipulation has any effect on ongoing litigation with a third party who is expressly excluded from the stipulation of dismissal.
the two cases that the majority considers in detail are illustrative.in versata software,callidus software,the federal circuit concluded that a pending interlocutory appeal was mooted when the two parties terminated their litigation through a rule stipulation of dismissal,fed.cir.i agree that any pending appeal between state national and the county would have been mooted by their stipulation of dismissal,but that says nothing about the separate claims against whiteside.
in meinecke h r block of houston,the fifth circuit voided a district court grant of summary judgment on claims that had already been resolved by a rule stipulation of dismissal,cir.of note,not only did that decision fail to affect to the stipulation of dismissal it did not even affect all the claims among the parties to the stipulation.immediately after declaring contract claims against a defendant resolved by the stipulation,the court went on to consider summary judgment on discrimination claims against the very same defendant that had not been resolved by the stipulation.id.at.just as the meinecke court could distinguish between claims resolved by a stipulation of dismissal and those unaffected by it,we should similarly distinguish between those claims terminated in state national stipulation of dismissal with the county and those claims,against an entirely separate party,that were expressly excluded from the stipulation 
in short,i do not dispute that we have long held that a stipulated dismissal under rule is automatic.majority op.at citing first nat.bank of toms river,marine city,cir.what i do dispute is that a stipulation that resolves certain claims somehow nullifies ongoing litigation of separate claims against a separate party.
my colleagues implicit assumption is that the case against whiteside was dormant,awaiting only the completion of the suit against the county to become final and appealable.but,in reality,the district court was actively overseeing litigation between whiteside and state national on whether to allow renewal of the claims against whiteside,so that the matter was far from resolved.on september,over a month before the stipulation of dismissal the court ordered state national and whiteside to participate in settlement discussions before a magistrate judge.those discussions took place on september.when they failed to produce a settlement,the court granted whiteside request to file a supplemental brief on september,and then,on october,ordered whiteside to file the brief within days.that brief was filed on october,one day after the stipulation of dismissal.on october now two days after the stipulation the court issued an order granting state national request to file a response to whiteside brief,and that response was filed on october.all this culminated in the district court december,order denying the motion for leave to renew the claims against whiteside.
the ongoing litigation over the whiteside claims demonstrates that the case was open and active.in resolving the motion to reinstate the claims against whiteside,the district court was simply exercising its jurisdiction over the original matter,majority op.at,congruent with the settlement terms that state national intends to maintain its claims against donna whiteside.app.after the stipulation of dismissal between state national and the county,the court both accepted briefing from state national and whiteside and issued an order permitting additional briefing.it quite obviously intended to retain jurisdiction until it ruled on state national motion,and the parties understood the case against whiteside to be active and unaffected by the stipulation 
the majority emphasizes that the district court actions can not override the application of jurisdictional rules.majority op.at.i do not disagree,and i concur with my colleagues readings of bowles russell,and lizardo united states,cir,that a district court mistaken consideration of untimely motions does not excuse the untimeliness.that,however,merely demonstrates that my colleagues are asking the wrong question.if the case against whiteside had definitively ended in,it would be true that the district court subsequent actions in were irrelevant.but the order dismissing whiteside was not final it was an interlocutory order that was not immediately appealable.majority op.at.therefore,until the entire case was made final,the district court had ongoing inherent authority to revise its interlocutory order and revive the suit against whiteside.the question before us is whether it did so revive the suit.its actions and intentions in ordering active litigation on the claims against whiteside,and the parties understanding of those actions,certainly are relevant to that determination and prove that the litigation between state national and whiteside was revived and active.in fact,everybody associated with the litigation,except for the two members of the majority,understood it that way.infra.
rule b motion seeking relief from a final order 
the majority rejects the above reasoning by concluding that the moment the stipulation of dismissal was filed,the dismissal of the claims against whiteside became final,and all issues among all parties were resolved.it thus concludes that the time to appeal began to run on that date.even if the stipulation of dismissal ended the case as to all claims against all parties which it did not,we should still not dismiss this appeal but should instead treat state national pending motion as a rule b motion for relief that,in turn,would mean that the time to appeal was tolled until the motion was resolved.see fed.app.a a vi.
state national motion was,in fact,framed in terms of rule b,so it is puzzling that the majority is at such pains to avoid treating it that way.since my colleagues are adamant that the stipulation of dismissal made all interlocutory orders final,they should be glad to treat the further litigation as having proceeded under the terms of rule b.instead,they insist that the pending motion was invalid,so that the ongoing litigation before the district court was meaningless.
there are,however,two ways that the district court could have properly considered state national motion as a rule b request for relief from final judgment.first,it could have treated the b motion as legitimate even though,when it was filed,there was no final order in the case.that approach is,admittedly,in tension with my conclusion that the motion is better considered under the district court inherent power to review interlocutory orders.but our court has previously considered appeals from denials of rule b motions that concerned interlocutory orders,and we could do so here if we opted not to analyze the motion as invoking the district court inherent power.in the alternative,accepting that the motion was premature when filed,the district court could properly have treated it as ripening into a rule b motion once the stipulation of dismissal made the underlying interlocutory order final.
state national motion as an ongoing rule b motion 
the first avenue that by which the district court was free to consider state national motion under rule b from the time the motion was filed is supported by the generally flexible treatment our court has given rule b motions.it is true,as we said in torres chater,that by its own terms,rule b applies only to final judgments,orders,and proceedings,so that purely interlocutory orders are not within the scope of rule b,cir.but that principle simply governs whether the strictures of rule b apply,not whether a district court can consider more generally a motion to alter an interlocutory decision.as the advisory committee notes to rule explain in describing the finality requirement,interlocutory judgments are not brought within the restrictions of the rule,but rather they are left subject to the complete power of the court rendering them to afford such relief from them as justice requires.fed.civ.b advisory committee note to amendment emphasis added see also united states jerry,cir.s o long as the district court has jurisdiction over the case,it possesses inherent power over interlocutory orders,and can reconsider them when it is consonant with justice to do so.because a motion for relief from an interlocutory order is treated more liberally than a b motion,there is no reason to consider state national original motion as a nullity simply because it was presented under rule b.
our case law makes clear that motions invoking rule b should be treated flexibly and functionally.in torres,while we said that rule b applied only to final orders,we did so in reaching the conclusion that a rule b motion was not appealable under unless it related to a final order.torres,at.the point was to prevent untimely appeals and to direct district courts to resolve all issues before a party was put to the choice of filing an appeal.the goal of our opinion in torres was precisely contrary to the purposes for which the majority now cites it.
in fact,rather than insisting that rule b motions are null and void unless in reference to a clearly final order,torres suggested just the opposite.we allowed appeal of the denial of a motion brought under rule b,even though the motion was in reference to a seemingly interlocutory order.we took a functional approach to assessing finality and determined that,when an otherwise interlocutory order would likely escape appellate review,the district court properly considered that order as final for purposes of rule b,making its denial of the motion final and appealable id.at.we thus declined to adopt the rigidly formalistic interpretation of rule that today majority relies upon.
we extended torres flexible analysis in a later case,penn west associates,cohen,to hold that,even where an underlying order is purely interlocutory,we may nonetheless review a district court denial of a rule b motion if the denial has the effect of wrap ping up all matters pending on the docket,thus making the decision final,cir.quoting torres,at.that language from penn west plainly authorizes a district court to entertain a premature rule b motion to review an order that is itself interlocutory exactly what the district court was doing with the order dismissing the whiteside claims accord kapco c o enterprises,cir.the denial of a motion under rule b is a final and appealable order,and this could be so in rare cases even when the underlying order is interlocutory.emphasis added.penn west also teaches that whether a district court decision on a rule b motion is itself final or interlocutory depends on a functional analysis of whether it wrap s up all matters pending.at.
if one takes the position that state national motion to reconsider should be addressed as a rule b motion,i would say that penn west controls and compels us to rule that state national rule b motion was proper,thereby tolling the time to appeal.in penn west,we considered whether rule b applied to a motion to reopen a case that had been administratively closed.id.at.we ruled that an administrative closing was not a final order,so that it was inappropriate for the district court to consider reopening the case under the restrictions of rule b.rather than treat the premature rule b motion as null and void,though,we remanded to the district court to consider the motion under an equitable analysis without rule b restrictions.id.at applying those principles to this case,the district court could have properly considered the rule b motion and given it more liberal treatment because it was initiated before the interlocutory order dismissing the claims against whiteside was made final.
state national motion as a ripened rule b motion when the underlying interlocutory order became final 
the majority provides no reason why the district court could not have treated state national premature rule b motion as having ripened into a true rule b motion after the stipulation of dismissal was filed and the order dismissing whiteside became unambiguously final.as explained above,torres and penn west undermine the majority determination that a premature rule b motion is thereafter a nullity,since in both those cases we considered appeals of rule b rulings when the underlying order finality was uncertain.indeed,no one in this case understood the procedural events in the way that the majority now does.state national and whiteside litigated before the district court under the assumption that the motion at issue was valid under rule b,and they did so with the active approval and encouragement of the district court.it is thus not just contrary to the rules and our own precedent for us to declare,on appeal,that such litigation amounts only to sound and fury,signifying nothing,william shakespeare,macbeth act,sc.it is contrary to the understanding of all the participants in the process.
practical considerations also support an interpretation of rule b that would allow the district court to reconsider the dismissal of the claims against whiteside.under the majority reading of the rule,the district court was free to reconsider the whiteside dismissal under its inherent powers before state national and the county signed the stipulation of dismissal,but it was immediately stripped of all jurisdiction the moment the stipulation was entered.such a conclusion effectively abrogates rule b in cases in which there is a rule stipulation of dismissal.in the present case,it provides no point at which state national could have sought rule b review of whiteside dismissal as my colleagues would have it,state national motion to renew its claims against whiteside was either a nullity when filed or was voided with the entry of the stipulation.either way,their position suggests that the district court lacked jurisdiction to consider a rule b motion concerning whiteside dismissal once the stipulation with the county was filed.if that were correct,then the rules arbitrarily require a plaintiff in such circumstances to abandon settlement with one defendant in order to give the district court time to mull over independent claims against another defendant.
that is a particularly strange result because rule dismissals may themselves be reviewed by a district court under rule b.we have held that any time a district court enters a judgment,even one dismissing a case by stipulation of the parties,it retains,by virtue of rule b,jurisdiction to entertain a later motion to vacate the judgment on the grounds specified in the rule.sawka healtheast,cir.internal quotation omitted even if a district court did not retain jurisdiction over settlement enforcement,we suggested in sawka that it could set aside the settlement under extraordinary circumstances under rule b.id.at see also bryan,at t he same ancillary jurisdiction that supports enforcement proceedings supports proceedings to seek relief from the judgment.if state national could seek rule b review of the actual stipulation of dismissal that supposedly stripped the district court of all jurisdiction,it only makes sense that it could seek the same review of the order dismissing whiteside,which became final and thus appealable only when the stipulation of dismissal was entered.
a district court ability to grant relief in a case like this is especially valuable.the basis of state national motion to renew its claims against whiteside was that the district court legal reasoning had shifted over the course of the litigation in a way that now would allow state national to assert malpractice claims against whiteside.if changes in the district court legal reasoning really did undermine the final judgment,that is precisely the kind of error that rule b is meant to address,by allowing district courts to correct and clarify their logic in the first instance rather than forcing an unnecessary appeal of a muddled final judgment 
federal rule of appellate procedure and the purpose of the appellate rules 
under the legal theories i have discussed,the clock for a timely appeal began to run with the district court december,order denying the motion for leave to renew the claims against whiteside.under the inherent authority theory,there simply was no final judgment with regard to whiteside until december,since the district court had reopened the matter by entertaining the motion to reverse its interlocutory order.if,instead,the motion were to be treated as a rule b motion,it tolled the time to appeal pending its resolution because it was filed no later than days after the judgment.fed.app.a a.in either case,the december,appeal was within days after entry of the judgment or order appealed from and was therefore timely.fed.app.a a vi.
both interpretations comport with the purpose of the rules to have district courts fully resolve a case before it is appealed.as the advisory committee elaborated when it clarified rule a in,it would be undesirable to proceed with the appeal while the district court has before it a motion the granting of which would vacate or alter the judgment appealed from.fed.app.a advisory committee note to amendment see also griggs provident consumer disc,observing one reason for the reform of rule a was to clarify both the litigants timetable and the courts respective jurisdictions,in service of the principle that a federal district court and a federal court of appeals should not attempt to assert jurisdiction over a case simultaneously.
in contrast,the majority holding frustrates the purpose of the rules to limit appeals to truly final decisions.as we explained in penn west,a final decision for purposes of appeal is generally one which ends the litigation o
