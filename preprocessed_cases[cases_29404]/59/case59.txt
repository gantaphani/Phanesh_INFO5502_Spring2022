in wiley county of san diego cal th,d,this court held that when a former criminal defendant sues his or her attorney for legal malpractice,the former client actual innocence of the underlying criminal charges is a necessary element of the malpractice cause of action.we granted review in this matter to address a distinct,but related,a former criminal defendant must obtain exoneration by postconviction relief as a prerequisite to obtaining relief for legal malpractice.as we shall explain,we conclude that postconviction exoneration is a prerequisite to prevailing on a legal malpractice claim in this context.
in october,plaintiff nicholas coscia,an attorney,was indicted by the federal government for securities fraud and related offenses.he retained defendants mckenna cuneo,and juanita brooks hereafter sometimes mckenna cuneo to represent him.
in december,coscia pleaded guilty in the united states district court for the district of nevada to one felony count of conspiracy to violate federal securities laws.he admitted his guilt under oath and confirmed that his plea and his waiver of certain constitutional rights were made freely and voluntarily.he answered affirmatively in response to the court question whether he in fact knowingly participate d in the conspiracy charged.at the court request,he summarized his role with regard to the conspiracy by admitting that,with the intent of obtaining financial profit,he purchased securities of the subject corporation knowing that there would be a corporate reorganization of that entity.he also signed a statement of offense acknowledging his criminal conduct.
in march,coscia was sentenced to two years probation and a fine.
in march,coscia commenced the present malpractice action against mckenna cuneo,alleging that he was injured by the firm negligent legal advice.mckenna cuneo demurred on the grounds that the action was barred by the statute of limitations and by collateral estoppel.the superior court sustained the demurrer without leave to amend,concluding that coscia criminal conviction precluded relief in the present action under principles of collateral estoppel.the court entered judgment in favor of mckenna cuneo.
coscia appealed from the judgment.he contended that the trial court should have permitted him to amend the complaint to allege that he had entered into a plea agreement despite his innocence of the criminal charges.coscia asserted that he would allege the following facts.during the plea negotiations,he approached attorney brooks and informed her that he possessed information regarding another ongoing securities fraud,and that he would like to trade this information to the government in exchange for the prosecutor agreement to a misdemeanor plea.brooks advised coscia not to do so,stating that in her opinion it would not be worth her time to present such facts to the federal prosecutor.relying upon that advice,coscia accepted the felony plea offer.as a consequence of the plea,he suffered economic and emotional damage,including suspension of his license to practice law in california.coscia subsequently was informed,in meetings with a united states attorney and an fbi agent,that it was a mistake for his attorney not to have presented the offer of information in the plea negotiations,and that favorable deals are struck all the time on that basis.
the court of appeal reversed the judgment of the superior court.it noted that a majority of courts addressing the point have held that,in addition to proof of innocence,a further requirement in a criminal malpractice action is that the conviction have been set aside through appeal or other postconviction proceeding.the court of appeal determined,however,that it was precluded from adopting the majority rule,regardless of its substantive merits,because in california the application of such a rule would render most criminal malpractice actions untimely under code of civil procedure section.because of the effect of the statute of limitations,the court of appeal suggested that the propriety of a postconviction relief requirement in criminal malpractice actions may be determined only by this court or the legislature.citing teitelbaum furs,dominion ins.cal d,the court concluded that a plaintiff in a criminal malpractice action who pleaded guilty to the underlying offense is not collaterally estopped from proving actual innocence.because there was a reasonable possibility that coscia could have cured the defects in his complaint,the court of appeal concluded that the superior court should have granted him leave to amend.accordingly,it reversed the judgment of the superior court and remanded the matter for further proceedings consistent with its opinion.
we granted review.as will appear,we determine,contrary to the court of appeal,that exoneration by postconviction relief is a prerequisite to recovery for legal malpractice arising out of a criminal proceeding,but we nonetheless conclude that the matter should be remanded to the trial court for further proceedings consistent with this opinion.
the failure to provide competent representation in a civil or criminal case may be the basis for civil liability under a theory of professional negligence.in a legal malpractice action arising from a civil proceeding,the elements are the duty of the attorney to use such skill,prudence,and diligence as members of his or her profession commonly possess and exercise a breach of that duty a proximate causal connection between the breach and the resulting injury and actual loss or damage resulting from the attorney negligence.budd nixen cal d,schultz harney th,d.in a legal malpractice case arising out of a criminal proceeding,california,like most jurisdictions,also requires proof of actual innocence.wiley county of san diego,supra,cal th at,d.
our decision in wiley explained that the addition of an actual innocence requirement was required by several public policy considerations.wiley county of san diego,supra,cal th,d.first,p ermitting a convicted criminal to pursue a legal malpractice claim without requiring proof of innocence would allow the criminal to profit by his own fraud,or to take advantage of his own wrong,or to found a claim upon his iniquity,or to acquire property by his own crime.id.at,d.
second,allowing civil recovery for convicts impermissibly shifts responsibility for the crime away from the convict.wiley county of san diego,supra,cal th at,d.a plaintiff convicted of an offense should bear sole responsibility for the consequences of his or her criminal acts a ny subsequent negligent conduct by a plaintiff attorney is superseded by the greater culpability of the plaintiff criminal conduct.citation.citation.id.at,d.the fact that nonnegligent counsel could have done better may warrant postconviction relief,but it does not translate into civil damages,which are intended to make the plaintiff whole.id.at,d.only an innocent person wrongly convicted due to inadequate representation has suffered a compensable injury because in that situation the nexus between the malpractice and palpable harm is sufficient to warrant a civil action,however inadequate,to redress the loss.citation.ibid.
third,guilty defendants have an adequate remedy in the form of postconviction relief for ineffective assistance of counsel.wiley county of san diego,supra,cal th at,d.not only does the united states constitution guarantee this right under the sixth amendment,any lapse can be rectified through an array of postconviction remedies,including appeal and habeas corpus.id.at,d.moreover,avoiding a procedure that would involve retrying criminal prosecutions in tort actions for malpractice is consistent with a strong judicial policy against the creation of two conflicting resolutions arising out of the same or identical transaction.citation.citation.id.at,d.
wiley noted that many jurisdictions that require proof of actual innocence as an element of criminal malpractice also require that the person conviction has been reversed,on appeal or through relief,or the person has otherwise been exonerated.citations.wiley county of san diego,supra,cal th at,fn,d.indeed,the court of appeal in weiner mitchell,silberberg knupp d,implicitly imposed such a requirement,holding that the doctrine of collateral estoppel precludes relitigation of guilt in a malpractice action when the plaintiff remains convicted on charges of federal securities law violations.wiley county of san diego,supra,cal th at,fn,d,see also id.at,d,dis.opn.of mosk,s ince weiner mitchell,silberberg knupp,supra,d,it has been the rule in the state that a criminal defendant must obtain postconviction relief before pursuing a malpractice action.
because we had no occasion in wiley to do so,however,we did not address the question whether exoneration by postconviction relief is required before a plaintiff in a criminal malpractice action can prove actual innocence.
that issue now is presented,and for the reasons cited in wiley and the additional reasons set forth below,we hold that an individual convicted of a criminal offense must obtain reversal of his or her conviction,or other exoneration by postconviction relief,in order to establish actual innocence in a criminal malpractice action.as discussed,public policy considerations require that only an innocent person wrongly convicted be deemed to have suffered a legally compensable harm.unless a person convicted of a criminal offense is successful in obtaining postconviction relief,the policies reviewed in wiley preclude recovery in a legal malpractice action.
in so concluding,we align ourselves with the numerous jurisdictions that have,on similar grounds,required appellate or other postconviction relief as a predicate to recovery in a criminal malpractice action.thus,the texas supreme court held in peeler hughes luce,that a client who had pleaded guilty to a federal crime could not sue her criminal defense counsel for malpractice until she obtained postconviction relief since the plaintiff has not been exonerated,her illegal acts remain the sole proximate and producing causes of her indictment and conviction as a matter of law.similarly,the virginia supreme court in adkins dixon,required postconviction relief as a predicate to a malpractice action against criminal counsel on the basis that courts will not assist the participant in an illegal act who seeks to profit from the act commission.
significantly,most of the foregoing cases,like the present matter,involved convictions based upon guilty pleas or no contest pleas.see gomez peters,supra,at hockett breunig,supra,at labovitz feinberg,supra,at schlumm,supra,at state ex rel.adolf,supra,at morgano smith,supra,at carmel lunney,supra,at stevens bispham,supra,at peeler hughes luce,supra,at harris bowe,supra,at.as the oregon supreme court explained in stevens bispham,supra,at page however a person comes to be by a plea to the charge,through a plea agreement,or after a trial to judge or the purposes of a case like this one claiming professional negligence by former criminal defense counsel,the person convicted is deemed equally guilty although a plaintiff may wish that he or she had gotten a better deal,we do not consider it appropriate,outside of circumstances where relief is available under the relief law,to treat a convicted offender as having been caused harm in a legally cognizable way by any disposition of that person case that was legally permissible.the convicted criminal own conduct is deemed to be the sole cause of his or her indictment and after trial or based on a guilty plea.
as many of these courts have stressed,the requirement of exoneration by postconviction relief is firmly grounded in the unique constitutional and statutory guarantees provided to criminal defendants.the pennsylvania supreme court explained in bailey tucker,supra,at page unlike in the civil litigation area,a client does not come before the criminal justice system under the care of his counsel alone he comes with a full panoply of rights,powers,and privileges.these rights and privileges not only protect the client from abuses of the system but are designed to protect the client from a deficient representative.thus,whereas in a civil matter a case once lost is lost forever,in a criminal matter a defendant is entitled to a second chance perhaps even a third or fourth chance to insure that an injustice has not been committed.
addressing some of those rights and privileges,the court in labovitz feinberg,supra,at page,referred to the duty imposed upon judges under both federal practice and the cognate state practice to assure not only that guilty pleas are knowingly,intelligently,and voluntarily offered and that there is a factual basis for each crime to which a plea is tendered,but also that the defendant sixth amendment right to effective assistance of counsel has been honored.see also stevens bispham,supra,at describing the wide range of procedural protections afforded persons accused of criminal offenses in oregon.
wiley similarly observed that the criminal justice system itself provides redress for the errors and omissions of counsel all criminal defendants have a sixth amendment right to effective assistance of counsel that is,counsel acting reasonably within the range of competence demanded of attorneys in criminal cases.citation.citation.not only does the constitution guarantee this right,any lapse can be rectified through an array of postconviction remedies,including appeal and habeas corpus.such relief is afforded even to those clearly guilty as long as they demonstrate incompetence and resulting prejudice,negligence and damages,under the same standard of professional care applicable in civil malpractice actions.citation.wiley county of san diego,supra,cal th at,d.these and other constitutional and statutory protections are to safeguard against conviction of the wrongly accused and to vindicate fundamental values.id.at,d.they also support the principle that an individual who was convicted and has not obtained postconviction relief should not be permitted to shift responsibility for his or her predicament to former criminal defense counsel.id.at,d.
in addition,the requirement of exoneration by postconviction relief protects against inconsistent as a legal malpractice judgment in favor of a plaintiff whose criminal conviction remains would contravene a strong judicial policy against the creation of two conflicting resolutions arising out of the same or identical transaction.citation.heck humphrey,d.this requirement also promotes judicial economy.many issues litigated in the effort to obtain postconviction relief,including ineffective assistance of counsel,would be duplicated in a legal malpractice action if the defendant is denied postconviction relief on the basis of ineffective assistance of counsel,collateral estoppel principles may operate to eliminate frivolous malpractice claims.thus,younan caruso th,d,held that the plaintiff in a legal malpractice action against his former criminal counsel was barred by collateral estoppel from relitigating his claim of professional negligence after he was denied habeas corpus relief on the same ground of ineffective representation.a further policy reason for requiring postconviction relief is to encourage the representation of criminal defendants by reducing the risk of baseless malpractice actions.see glenn aiken.
like the majority of cases on point,we hold that an intact conviction precludes recovery in a legal malpractice action even when ordinary collateral estoppel principles otherwise are not controlling,for example because a conviction was based upon a plea of guilty that would not be conclusive in a subsequent civil action involving the same issues.teitelbaum furs,dominion ins,supra,cal d at.we thus conclude that the court of appeal erred in applying the rule in teitelbaum furs in the context of a criminal malpractice action 
we did not have occasion in teitelbaum furs or subsequent decisions to address the unique practical and policy considerations against permitting a criminal defendant with an intact conviction to recover on a malpractice claim against his or her former criminal defense counsel.in light of those considerations,which we deem compelling,we conclude that such a conviction,regardless whether it follows a plea of guilty or nolo contendere or a trial,bars proof of actual innocence in a legal malpractice action.
by so holding,we also avoid a potential adverse consequence of distinguishing between convictions based upon guilty pleas and convictions after trial for the purpose of determining the preclusive effect of the convictions in legal malpractice actions.if only the client who pleaded guilty could recover for malpractice without first obtaining postconviction relief,attorneys might be tempted to practice defensive law when faced with the choice of advising a client to enter into a plea agreement or proceed to trial,in order to insulate themselves from malpractice actions.as we observed in wiley,i n our already overburdened system it behooves no one to encourage the additional expenditure of resources merely to build a record against a potential malpractice claim.citation.wiley county of san diego,supra,cal th at,d.
for all these reasons,we conclude that a plaintiff must obtain postconviction relief in the form of a final disposition of the underlying criminal example,by acquittal after retrial,reversal on appeal with directions to dismiss the charges,reversal followed by the people refusal to continue the prosecution,or a grant of habeas corpus a prerequisite to proving actual innocence in a malpractice action against former criminal defense counsel 
we next consider the effect of the foregoing requirement of exoneration by postconviction relief upon the application of the relevant statute of limitations for legal malpractice actions arising from criminal proceedings.
code of civil procedure section,subdivision a,provides that a n action against an attorney for a wrongful act or omission,other than for actual fraud,arising in the performance of professional services shall be commenced within one year after the plaintiff discovers,or through the use of reasonable diligence should have discovered,the facts constituting the wrongful act or omission,or four years from the date of the wrongful act or omission,whichever occurs first.in no event shall the time for commencement of legal action exceed four years except that the period shall be tolled during the time that any of the following exist the plaintiff has not sustained actual injury the attorney continues to represent the plaintiff regarding the specific subject matter in which the alleged wrongful act or omission occurred the attorney willfully conceals the facts constituting the wrongful act or omission when such facts are known to the attorney,except that this subdivision shall toll only the limitation and the plaintiff is under a legal or physical disability which restricts the plaintiff ability to commence legal action.
in jordache enterprises,brobeck,phleger harrison cal th,d,we explained that the actual injury provision in code of civil procedure section,subdivision a,effectively continues the accrual rule established in budd nixen,supra,cal d at pages,which held that the statute of limitations began to run when the plaintiff sustained loss or damage from the attorney negligence.under budd,the cause of action could not accrue until the plaintiff suffered actual loss or damage resulting from the allegedly negligent conduct.citation.after sustaining damages compensable in a negligence action,the plaintiff could establish a cause of action for professional negligence,and the limitations period commenced.citation.under code of civil procedure section,the limitations period commences when the plaintiff actually or constructively discovers the facts of the wrongful act or omission,but the period is tolled until the plaintiff sustains actual injury.that is to say,the statute of limitations will not run during the time the plaintiff can not bring a cause of action for damages from professional negligence.jordache enterprises,brobeck,phleger harrison,supra,cal th at,d.the test for actual injury is whether the plaintiff has sustained any damages compensable in an action,other than one for actual fraud,against an attorney for a wrongful act or omission arising in the performance of professional services.ibid.
the court of appeal declined to impose a requirement of exoneration by postconviction relief in the present matter on the ground that t he interest of plaintiffs in pursuing meritorious claims,and considerations of fairness citation,preclude us from adopting a rule that under existing law would result in the forfeiture of most criminal malpractice actions on technical grounds.it asserted that such a requirement would create an inherent statute of limitations problem in criminal malpractice cases because of the time required to complete postconviction proceedings,the statute of limitations in most cases will have run long before the convicted individual has had an opportunity to remove the bar to establishing his or her actual innocence.citing wiley county of san diego,supra,cal th,d,conc.opn.of werdegar.
the example of the practice in other jurisdictions,however,reveals that the requirement of postconviction relief,as a prerequisite to proving legal malpractice arising out of a criminal proceeding,need not result in a technical forfeiture of legitimate malpractice claims.as will appear,most courts have adopted one of two approaches to avoid possible unfair results.
some courts have held that the limitations period does not commence until the plaintiff has obtained postconviction relief,because the cause of action does not accrue for statute of limitations purposes until that time.thus,in adkins dixon,supra,at page,the virginia supreme court expressly rejected the contention that the statute of limitations might bar the plaintiff malpractice action before he obtained relief in postconviction proceedings since successful termination of such a proceeding is a part of the plaintiff cause of action,he has no right of action until that time,and,thus,the statute of limitations does not begin to run until termination of the proceeding.citations.in crafting a similar rule,the alaska supreme court in shaw state,of,supra,at page,relied upon the law of malicious prosecution,which requires that a plaintiff must prove that an unsuccessful prosecution occurred this element is not established,and indeed,remains uncertain,until the cessation of the underlying action.the same is necessarily true of relief.the merits of the application for relief can not be established until the court has ruled on the matter.the decision explained by adopting the date that relief is obtained as the trigger to the statute of limitations,we establish a bright line test which should significantly assist courts in the resolution of statute of limitation issues.id.at.similarly,the oregon supreme court in stevens bispham,supra,at page,held that the statute of limitations for malpractice did not start to run until the plaintiff obtained postconviction relief plaintiff could not have brought this action until he had suffered legally cognizable harm.citation.see also,morgano smith,supra,at britt legal aid socy.
other jurisdictions have adopted a approach.in gebhardt,the michigan supreme court rejected as a mere legal fiction the rule that a wrongly convicted criminal defendant suffers no cognizable harm,and the criminal malpractice claim does not accrue,until he or she has obtained appellate relief.the court thus held that exoneration by postconviction relief was not an element of a criminal malpractice claim or a prerequisite to proving actual innocence.at.the statute of limitations began to run on the day the plaintiff knew that she had a possible claim against her criminal defense counsel.id.at.the decision in gebhardt observed that a criminal defendant who has initiated postconviction relief proceedings should have knowledge sufficient to have discovered his claim against his initial defense attorney for statute of limitations purposes.id.at.with his claim preserved,he can and should seek a stay in the civil suit until the criminal case is resolved.see also silvers brodeur,fn.adopting rule consistent with that in gebhardt seevers potter,same duncan campbell,same.
the supreme court of pennsylvania,in bailey tucker,supra,at page,agreed with the decision in
