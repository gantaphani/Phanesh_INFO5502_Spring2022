held section a does not deprive the state courts of subject matter jurisdiction over minton malpractice claim.
a congress has authorized the federal district courts to exercise original jurisdiction over any civil action arising under any act of congress relating to patents,and further decreed that n o state court shall have jurisdiction over any such claim.a.because federal law did not create the cause of action asserted by minton legal malpractice claim,the claim can aris e under federal patent law only if it necessarily raise s a stated federal issue,actually disputed and substantial,which a federal forum may entertain without disturbing any congressionally approved balance of federal and state judicial responsibilities.grable,at.
b applying grable inquiry here,it is clear that minton legal malpractice claim does not arise under federal patent law.
resolution of a federal patent question is necessary to minton case.to prevail on his claim,minton must show that an argument would have prevailed if only petitioners had timely made it in the earlier patent litigation.that hypothetical patent case within the malpractice case must be resolved to decide minton malpractice claim.
the federal issue is also actually disputed.minton argues that the exception applied,which would have saved his patent from the bar petitioners argue that it did not.
minton argument founders,however,on grable substantiality requirement.the substantiality inquiry looks to the importance of the issue to the federal system as a whole.here,the federal issue does not carry the necessary significance.no matter how the state courts resolve the hypothetical case within a case,the result of the prior federal patent litigation will not change.nor will allowing state courts to resolve these cases undermine the development of a uniform body of patent law.bonito boats,thunder craft boats.the federal courts have exclusive jurisdiction over actual patent cases,and in resolving the nonhypothetical patent questions those cases present they are of course not bound by state precedents.minton suggests that state courts answers to hypothetical patent questions can sometimes have effect on other patents through issue preclusion,but even assuming that is true,such and effects are not sufficient to establish arising under jurisdiction,empire healthchoice assurance,mcveigh.finally,the federal courts greater familiarity with patent law is not enough,by itself,to trigger the federal courts exclusive patent jurisdiction.
it follows from the foregoing that minton does not meet grable fourth requirement,which is concerned with the appropriate balance.there is no reason to suppose that congress meant to bar from state courts state legal malpractice claims simply because they require resolution of a hypothetical patent issue.

on writ of certiorari to the supreme court of texas 
chief justice roberts delivered the opinion of the court.
federal courts have exclusive jurisdiction over cases arising under any act of congress relating to patents.a.the question presented is whether a state law claim alleging legal malpractice in the handling of a patent case must be brought in federal court.
in the early,respondent vernon minton developed a computer program and telecommunications network designed to facilitate securities trading.in march,he leased the system known as the texas computer exchange network,or texcen to stark,a securities brokerage.a little over a year later,he applied for a patent for an interactive securities trading system that was based substantially on texcen.the patent and trademark office issued the patent in january.
patent in hand,minton filed a patent infringement suit in federal district court against the national association of securities dealers,nasd and the nasdaq stock market.he was represented by jerry gunn and the other petitioners.nasd and nasdaq moved for summary judgment on the ground that minton patent was invalid under the on sale bar,b.that provision specifies that an inventor is not entitled to a patent if the invention was on sale in the united states,more than one year prior to the date of the application,and minton had leased texcen to stark more than one year prior to filing his patent application.rejecting minton argument that there were differences between texcen and the patented system that precluded application of the bar,the district court granted the summary judgment motion and declared minton patent invalid.minton national of securities dealers,supp,ed.
minton then filed a motion for reconsideration in the district court,arguing for the first time that the lease agreement with stark was part of ongoing testing of texcen and therefore fell within the experimental use exception to the bar.see generally pfaff wells electronics,describing the exception.the district court denied the motion.minton national of securities dealers,ed,july.
minton appealed to the court of appeals for the federal circuit.that court affirmed,concluding that the district court had appropriately held minton argument waived.see minton national of securities dealers,ca fed.
minton,convinced that his attorneys failure to raise the argument earlier had cost him the lawsuit and led to invalidation of his patent,brought this malpractice action in texas state court.his former lawyers defended on the ground that the lease to stark was not,in fact,for an experimental use,and that therefore minton patent infringement claims would have failed even if the argument had been timely raised.the trial court agreed,holding that minton had put forward less than a scintilla of proof that the lease had been for an experimental purpose.app.it accordingly granted summary judgment to gunn and the other lawyer defendants.
on appeal,minton raised a new argument because his legal malpractice claim was based on an alleged error in a patent case,it aris es under federal patent law for purposes of a.and because,under a,n o state court shall have jurisdiction over any claim for relief arising under any act of congress relating to patents,the texas court where minton had originally brought his malpractice claim lacked subject matter jurisdiction to decide the case.accordingly,minton argued,the trial court order should be vacated and the case dismissed,leaving minton free to start over in the federal district court.
a divided panel of the court of appeals of texas rejected minton argument.applying the test we articulated in grable sons metal products,darue engineering,it held that the federal interests implicated by minton state law claim were not sufficiently substantial to trigger arising under jurisdiction.it also held that finding exclusive federal jurisdiction over state legal malpractice actions would,contrary to grable commands,disturb the balance of federal and state judicial responsibilities.proceeding to the merits of minton malpractice claim,the court of appeals affirmed the trial court determination that minton had failed to establish experimental use and that arguments on that ground therefore would not have saved his infringement suit.
the supreme court of texas reversed,relying heavily on a pair of cases from the court of appeals for the federal circuit,discussing air measurement technologies,akin gump strauss hauer feld,immunocept,llc fulbright jaworski,llp.the court concluded that minton claim involved a substantial federal issue within the meaning of grable because the success of minton malpractice claim is reliant upon the viability of the experimental use exception as a defense to the bar.at.adjudication of minton claim in federal court was consistent with the appropriate balance between federal and state judicial responsibilities,it held,because the federal government and patent litigants have an interest in the uniform application of patent law by courts in that subject matter.at citing immunocept,supra,at air measurement technologies,supra,at.
justice guzman,joined by justices medina and willett,dissented.the dissenting justices would have held that the federal issue was neither substantial nor disputed,and that maintaining the proper balance of responsibility between state and federal courts precluded relegating state legal malpractice claims to federal court.
we granted certiorari.
federal courts are courts of limited jurisdiction,possessing only that power authorized by constitution and statute.kokkonen guardian life ins.of america.there is no dispute that the constitution permits congress to extend federal court jurisdiction to a case such as this one,see osborn bank of united states,wheat,the question is whether congress has done so,see powell mccormack.
as relevant here,congress has authorized the federal district courts to exercise original jurisdiction in all civil actions arising under the constitution,laws,or treaties of the united states,and,more particularly,over any civil action arising under any act of congress relating to patents,a.adhering to the demands of l inguistic consistency,we have interpreted the phrase arising under in both sections identically,applying our and a precedents interchangeably.see christianson colt industries operating.for cases falling within the arising under jurisdiction of a,however,congress has not only provided for federal jurisdiction but also eliminated state jurisdiction,decreeing that n o state court shall have jurisdiction over any claim for relief arising under any act of congress relating to patents.a,supp.v.to determine whether jurisdiction was proper in the texas courts,therefore,we must determine whether it would have been proper in a federal district court whether,that is,the case aris es under any act of congress relating to patents.
for statutory purposes,a case can aris e under federal law in two ways.most directly,a case arises under federal law when federal law creates the cause of action asserted.see american well works layne bowler,a suit arises under the law that creates the cause of action as a rule of inclusion,this creation test admits of only extremely rare exceptions,see,shoshone mining rutter,and accounts for the vast bulk of suits that arise under federal law,see franchise tax bd.of cal.construction laborers vacation trust for southern.minton original patent infringement suit against nasd and nasdaq,for example,arose under federal law in this manner because it was authorized by.
but even where a claim finds its origins in state rather than federal law as minton legal malpractice claim indisputably does we have identified a special and small category of cases in which arising under jurisdiction still lies.empire healthchoice assurance,mcveigh.in outlining the contours of this slim category,we do not paint on a blank canvas.unfortunately,the canvas looks like one that jackson pollock got to first.see wright,miller,cooper,freer,federal practice and procedure,ed.reviewing general confusion on question.
in an effort to bring some order to this unruly doctrine several terms ago,we condensed our prior cases into the following inquiry does the claim necessarily raise a stated federal issue,actually disputed and substantial,which a federal forum may entertain without disturbing any congressionally approved balance of federal and state judicial responsibilities grable,at.that is,federal jurisdiction over a state law claim will lie if a federal issue is necessarily raised,actually disputed,substantial,and capable of resolution in federal court without disrupting the balance approved by congress.where all four of these requirements are met,we held,jurisdiction is proper because there is a serious federal interest in claiming the advantages thought to be inherent in a federal forum,which can be vindicated without disrupting congress intended division of labor between state and federal courts,at.
applying grable inquiry here,it is clear that minton legal malpractice claim does not arise under federal patent law.indeed,for the reasons we discuss,we are comfortable concluding that state legal malpractice claims based on underlying patent matters will rarely,if ever,arise under federal patent law for purposes of a.although such cases may necessarily raise disputed questions of patent law,those cases are by their nature unlikely to have the sort of significance for the federal system necessary to establish jurisdiction.
to begin,we acknowledge that resolution of a federal patent question is necessary to minton case.under texas law,a plaintiff alleging legal malpractice must establish four elements that the defendant attorney owed the plaintiff a duty that the attorney breached that duty that the breach was the proximate cause of the plaintiff injury and that damages occurred.see alexander turtur associates.in cases like this one,in which the attorney alleged error came in failing to make a particular argument,the causation element requires a case within a case analysis of whether,had the argument been made,the outcome of the earlier litigation would have been different,at see mallen smith,legal malpractice.to prevail on his legal malpractice claim,therefore,minton must show that he would have prevailed in his federal patent infringement case if only petitioners had timely made an argument on his behalf,at.that will necessarily require application of patent law to the facts of minton case.
the federal issue is also actually disputed here indeed,on the merits,it is the central point of dispute.minton argues that the exception properly applied to his lease to stark,saving his patent from the bar petitioners argue that it did not.this is just the sort of dispute respecting the effect of federal law that grable envisioned,at quoting shulthis mcdougal.
minton argument founders on grable next requirement,however,for the federal issue in this case is not substantial in the relevant sense.in reaching the opposite conclusion,the supreme court of texas focused on the importance of the issue to the plaintiff case and to the parties before it,at because the success of minton malpractice claim is reliant upon the viability of the experimental use exception as a defense to the bar
