plaintiff and appellant joel drum appeals from the judgment entered against him and in favor of defendants and respondents bleau,fox associates,thomas bleau,nikki fong and martin fox collectively referred to as bleau fox on drum complaint for abuse of process.drum contends the trial court erred in granting bleau fox special motion to strike the complaint pursuant to code of civil procedure section hereafter section or the statute for the first time on appeal,bleau fox contends the action is barred by the litigation privilege of civil code section,subdivision b hereafter section b.after review,we conclude drum established a prima facie case for abuse of process,and that the action is not barred by the litigation privilege.accordingly,we reverse.
factual and procedural background 
bleau fox represented a plaintiff in a legal malpractice action against drum and his law firm the underlying action.on october and,a jury trial in the underlying action resulted in a judgment in favor of bleau fox client in the amount of.after the jury was excused,the following colloquy occurred counsel for drum may i make one request the court yes.counsel for drum pursuant to code of civil procedure section this court has the power to stay this judgment pending the filing of a notice of appeal,or at least the time running to file the notice of appeal.i ask the court to stay this judgment,and we do intend to bring a motion for new trial,and i would like that opportunity to do that before we have to be fighting a judgment debtor examination,or whatever.the court we will stay the judgment pending filing of the notice of appeal and motion for new trial,et cetera.all right.counsel for drum thank you.fong thank you,your honor for your time.
on november,judgment was entered in the underlying action.that same day,notice of entry of judgment was served by the clerk of the superior court.on december,while the stay was still in effect,bleau fox obtained a writ of execution from the superior court clerk.
on january,drum motion for new trial was denied.although drum time to file a notice of appeal had yet to expire and the stay was therefore still in effect,fong caused the writ of execution to be submitted to the los angeles county sheriff and,on january,the sheriff levied on the writ.
drum learned of the levy on january,when he was notified by his bank that all funds in the multiple accounts drum maintained were frozen because of the levy.as a result,checks drum had drawn on those accounts were dishonored.that day,drum informed bleau in a telephone call that drum intended to move ex parte for an order quashing the levy the following day.in a subsequent telephone call,drum counsel reminded bleau the trial court had granted his request for a stay pending filing of a notice of appeal,which counsel anticipated would be filed on february.maintaining the stay had expired when the new trial motion was denied,bleau fox refused to withdraw the levy.
on january,drum made ex parte application to the trial court to withdraw the writ of execution and for an order to show cause re contempt.bleau fox opposed the motion,arguing the stay that was in effect lapsed upon the hearing of the motion for new trial.in support,fong filed a declaration averring she recalled drum counsel requesting a stay only until a motion for new trial was heard.bleau filed a declaration averring that drum counsel stated,in his telephone call to bleau,that he could not recall whether he asked for a stay pending filing of notice of appeal.drum counsel filed a declaration categorically denying any such statement.
the trial court granted drum application to recall the writ of execution and set aside the levy.the court denied drum application for an order to show cause re contempt.
on january,drum filed a timely notice of appeal from the november,judgment and the january,order denying his motion for new trial,among other things pursuant to code of civil procedure section,drum served an undertaking on bleau fox that same day.
on april,drum filed the instant action for abuse of process against bleau fox.drum alleged in his unverified complaint that bleau fox violation of the stay order was done for the sole purpose of causing harm to drum and with the intention of depriving him of his property and legal rights.
on july,bleau fox filed a special motion to strike the original complaint pursuant to section on the grounds that drum could not demonstrate a reasonable probability of success on the merits of his action because he could not establish the ulterior motive element of a cause of action for abuse of process.in support of that motion,fong submitted a declaration in which she averred she was the only bleau fox attorney present on october,and she only heard the trial court stay enforcement of the judgment until a motion for new trial was filed heard.
the motion to strike was taken off calendar after drum filed an amended unverified complaint on august.in his amended complaint,drum alleged bleau fox violated the stay for the purpose of causing financial harm to drum so that he would be dissuaded from filing an appeal of the underlying action would not have the funds available for the purpose of prosecuting such appeal.
on september,bleau fox refiled its slapp motion.in opposition,drum submitted the reporter transcript from the october,proceedings,the relevant portion of which we have quoted above,which shows fong was present in court when the trial court clearly stated enforcement was stayed pending filing of the notice of appeal and motion for new trial,et cetera.
at the october,hearing on the slapp motion,the trial court indicated its intention to grant the motion to strike because drum had failed to establish a reasonable probability of success on his claim for abuse of process based on insufficient evidence of ulterior motive.acknowledging the sufficiency of the evidence of a willful improper use of process,the trial court rejected the proposition that ulterior motive could be inferred from that evidence alone.finding drum had thus failed to establish a prima facie case of abuse of process,the trial court granted the motion.in a written minute order,the trial court noted that bleau fox presented evidence that they misunderstood the length of the stay.it found drum failed to establish a prima facie case of abuse of process in that he failed to show by direct or circumstantial evidence that bleau fox acted with an ulterior motive.
drum filed a timely notice of appeal 
discussion 
drum contends he established a prima facie case of abuse of process sufficient to withstand a special motion to strike pursuant to section.he argues the ulterior motive element of his cause of action for abuse of process can be inferred from the evidence that bleau fox willfully obtained a writ of execution and levied on that writ when it knew a stay of enforcement of judgment was in effect.as the parties do not argue the matter,we assume without deciding that actions taken to obtain and enforce a writ of execution are taken in furtherance of the right to petition and so are subject to the statute.we conclude,however,drum established a reasonable probability of success on the merits of his action for abuse of process sufficient to defeat a slapp motion,and that the action is not barred by litigation privilege b.accordingly,the trial court erred in granting bleau fox motion and dismissing the complaint.
standard of review 
upon review of an order granting or denying a motion pursuant to section,the appellate court independently reviews whether a complaint arises out of the defendant exercise of a valid right to free speech and petition,and,if so,whether the plaintiff established a reasonable probability of prevailing on the complaint.governor gray davis com.american taxpayers alliance th,d davis computerxpress,jackson th,d.
the statute 
in pertinent part,section provides b a cause of action against a person arising from any act of that person in furtherance of the person right of petition or free speech under the united states or california constitution in connection with a public issue shall be subject to a special motion to strike,unless the court determines that the plaintiff has established that there is a probability that the plaintiff will prevail on the claim.in making its determination,the court shall consider the pleadings,and supporting and opposing affidavits stating the facts upon which the liability or defense is based.e as used in this section,act in furtherance of a person right of petition or free speech under the united states or california constitution in connection with a public issue includes any written or oral statement or writing made before a legislative,executive,or judicial proceeding authorized by law any written or oral statement or writing made in connection with an issue under consideration or review by a legislative,executive,or judicial body,or any other official proceeding authorized by law italics added.
section,subdivision b requires the court to engage in a process.first,the court decides whether the defendant has made a threshold showing that the challenged cause of action is one arising from protected activity,subd.b.if the court finds that such a showing has been made,it then determines whether the plaintiff has demonstrated a probability of prevailing on the claim.under section,subdivision b,the trial court in making these determinations considers the pleadings,and supporting and opposing affidavits stating the facts upon which the liability or defense is based.equilon,supra,cal th at,d,navellier sletten cal th,d,navellier i.
in the trial court,drum argued that the levy did not fall within the scope of the statute because it involved purely ministerial matters and was not part of an official proceeding.drum does not,however,make this argument on appeal and,as noted,we assume,without deciding the question,that the challenged cause of action for abuse of process arises from a protected activity,and is subject to the statute.
drum established a reasonable probability of prevailing on the merits of his claim for abuse of process 
to establish the requisite probability of prevailing,a plaintiff need not prove the validity of the challenged claims against the defendant.he or she need only demonstrate that the complaint is both legally sufficient and supported by a sufficient prima facie showing of facts to sustain a favorable judgment if the evidence submitted by the plaintiff is credited.only a cause of action that satisfies both prongs of the,that arises from protected speech or petitioning and lacks even minimal a slapp,subject to being stricken under the statute.navellier i,supra,cal th at,d,citations and internal quotation marks omitted.
thus,special motions to strike pursuant to section operate like a demurrer or motion for summary judgment in reverse.briggs,supra,cal th at,d,citing college hospital,superior court cal th,d,plaintiff opposing code civ,subd.a motion,must demonstrate existence of legally sufficient claim that is supported by competent,admissible evidence.like other statutes which provide a procedure for exposing and dismissing certain causes of action lacking merit,section requires the court at a preliminary stage of the litigation,to determine by examining affidavits the substantial probability of plaintiff prevailing on a claim,whether evidence substantiates a standard of proof the plaintiff must meet,or whether plaintiff has established a reasonable probability of recovery.citation.equilon,supra,cal th at,d.evidence that the defendant conduct,although a protected activity,was not valid,goes toward discharging the plaintiff burden to provide a prima facie showing of the merits of the plaintiff case.navellier i,supra,cal th at,d.we now turn to the merits of drum cause of action.
the tort of abuse of process constitutes the use of a legal process against another to accomplish a purpose for which it is not designed.brown kennard th,d brown kompa th,d ion equipment nelson d.ion,quoting rest.torts.its elements are an ulterior motive and a willful act in the use of process not proper in the regular conduct of the proceedings.brown,supra,th at,d merlet rizzo th,d merlet.t he essence of the tort abuse of process lies in the misuse of the power of the court it is an act done in the name of the court and under its authority for the purpose of perpetrating an injustice meadows bakersfield d.see also stolz wong communications limited partnership th,d.in brown,the court recognized an action for abuse of process may inhere where a wrongful levy is executed upon exempt property.brown,supra,th at,d.
here,the act of levying on a writ of execution at a time when enforcement of the judgment had been stayed,the stay had been announced in open court in defendant presence,and a minute order had memorialized the stay,established a prima facie case of the willful act in the improper use of process element of the tort.
establishing a prima facie case of ulterior motive is more difficult.for purposes of abuse of process,the ulterior motive to prove is that the party employing the process did so for an end not germane thereto.citation.and,an improper purpose may consist in achievement of a benefit totally extraneous to or of a result not within its legitimate scope.citations.ion,supra,d at.in charles vacanti,state comp.ins.fund cal th,d,our supreme court held that the ulterior motive or malice element of an abuse of process claim may be inferred from the willful abuse of the process.see also tranchina arcinas d,it is well settled that the intention with which a party did an act may be inferred from evidence of his subsequent conduct.
here,the first amended complaint alleges bleau fox motive in levying on the writ of execution in violation of the stay was to cause such financial harm to drum that he would be dissuaded from filing an appeal of the underlying action would not have the funds available for the purpose of prosecuting such appeal.in opposition to the special motion to strike,drum presented evidence that fong was present in court when the trial court granted drum request for a stay of enforcement of the judgment until notice of appeal was filed.disregarding the court ordered stay,bleau fox caused a writ of execution to be issued and levied against drum bank accounts.when reminded of the stay by drum counsel,bleau fox continued to deny its existence and refused to cancel the writ of execution.as a result,drum was required to apply to the trial court for appropriate relief.from this evidence of willful abuse of process,the timing of the unlawful levy and its financial consequences,a reasonable trier of fact could infer the requisite ulterior motive suggested by drum in his pleadings bleau fox intended to deplete drum resources to hinder his ability to pursue an appeal of the judgment 
we are not persuaded to the contrary by bleau fox argument that vacanti is inapposite because it was decided in the procedural context of a demurrer.ulterior motive is a state of mind,which,like other states of mind,can seldom be proved by direct evidence.it must be inferred from objective or external circumstantial evidence.in vacanti,the issue was whether the plaintiff pled sufficient facts from which ulterior motive could be inferred.in the context of a section motion,the issue is whether the plaintiff proffers sufficient evidence for such an inference.under vacanti,an allegation of an egregious willful abuse of process is sufficient.the same rule applies to drum proffered evidence.
once again,this does not end our inquiry.bleau fox asserts for the first time on appeal that section b bars drum suit for abuse of process.we disagree.
the litigation privilege does not preclude drum abuse of process claim 
known in pertinent part as the litigation privilege,section b provides that a privileged publication or broadcast is one made in any legislative proceeding,judicial proceeding,in any other official proceeding authorized by law,or in the initiation or course of any other proceeding authorized by law and reviewable by writ of mandate.the statute applies to any communication made in judicial or proceedings by litigants or other participants authorized by law to achieve the objects of the litigation and which have some connection or logical relation to the action.silberg anderson cal d,silberg brown,supra,th at,d,supra,th at,d merlet,supra,th at,d.
bleau fox maintained in the trial court that the statute was intended to supplant the litigation privilege.it further argued that suits for abuse of process were not subject to the litigation privilege and were instead subject to the statute thus,the trial court did not have occasion to pass on the applicability of the litigation privilege in this case 
on november,one month after the hearing on the motion,the third district court of appeal decided in brown,supra,th,d,that the litigation privilege barred suit for abuse of process arising out of allegations the defendant caused a wrongful writ of execution to be levied upon the plaintiff categorically exempt funds,social security and personal retirement benefits.accordingly,on appeal bleau fox relies on brown to argue that its conduct in obtaining a writ of execution and levying on drum property was absolutely privileged under section b.although bleau fox correctly characterizes brown,we respectfully disagree with our colleagues from the third district as to the application of the privilege to a levy on property.
a brief review of the purpose and history of the litigation privilege is helpful to an understanding of why we conclude that to apply the defense in the present case would be an unwarranted extension of the privilege,supported by neither the statutory language nor sound public policy.
section b derives from common law principles establishing a defense to the tort of defamation.oren royal oaks venture greenberg,bernhard,weiss karma,cal d,oren.on its face,the statute applies to only a publication or broadcast.b.its purpose is to afford litigants free access to the courts without the threat of,and harassment by,derivative litigation.silberg,supra,cal d at,brown,supra,th at,d.because it applies without regard to malice or evil motives,the privilege is characterized as absolute.silberg,supra,cal d at.
although the genesis of the privilege resides in defamatory publications,its application has been far more widespread.it is now beyond debate that the privilege applies to any communication,whether or not it amounts to a publication see,rosenthal irell manella d.block sacramento clinical labs,d,and to all torts except malicious prosecution.silberg,supra,cal d at.the court of appeal first applied the litigation privilege to abuse of process in thornton rhoden d.there,justice kaus warned that the courts would be looking with an unseeing eye to the policies behind the litigation privilege,if the defense were limited to defamation claims.the salutary purpose of the privilege should not be frustrated by putting a new label on the complaint.if it is desirable to create an absolute privilege in defamation,not because we desire to protect the shady practitioner,but because we do not want the honest one to have to be concerned with libel or slander actions while acting for his client,we should not remove one concern defamation and saddle him with another abuse of process for doing precisely the same thing.id.at.following thornton,a considerable number of cases have followed that decision and have found abuse of process actions untenable on the basis of the statutory privilege.oren,supra,cal d at,citing younger solomon d.umansky urquhart d.drasin jacoby meyers d.asia investment borowski d.
much as the litigation privilege has escaped from the initial confines of defamation and publication,so,too,has the privilege been affixed to matters beyond the courtroom.thus,the filing of a lis pendens with the county recorder is privileged albertson raboff,supra,cal d at,as are demand letters sent prior to litigation lerette dean witter organization,supra,d at,threats associated with settlement negotiations asia investment borowski,supra,d at,and an attorney tortious solicitation of potential plaintiffs rubin green cal th,d,rubin.there are apparently no fixed temporal or geographical limitations as long as there is some relation to a judicial proceeding contemplated or extant.id.at,d.
it is with this backdrop that bleau fox argues that even if levying on property of a judgment debtor pursuant to a writ of execution obtained in violation of a stay constitutes an abuse of process,it is privileged.in so doing,bleau fox has overlooked the one limitation on the privilege that still survives the event claimed to be protected must be communication not conduct.even though our supreme court has on at least four occasions emphasized the difference between communication and conduct in applying section b,that distinction has been lost on some appellate courts with which we part company.
in kimmel goland cal d,kimmel,had secretly taped a conversation involving in violation of penal code section unlawful to record telephone conversation without consent.the sought damages under various tort theories.the trial court granted judgment on the pleadings,concluding that the taping was in anticipation of litigation and hence privileged under section b.the supreme court reversed.its analysis started with the case of ribas,supra,cal d.ribas was a divorce action.at an arbitration hearing,the wife attorney testified that while she was secretly listening to a telephone conversation between husband and wife she heard husband tell wife that he had prevented her from retaining an attorney during earlier dissolution proceedings.the husband then sued the wife attorney for invasion of privacy.the supreme court distinguished a claim based on the act of eavesdropping,which was not subject to the litigation privilege,and one founded on the attorney giving testimony at the arbitration hearing,which was a communication that fell within the privilege.id.at.
implicit in the ribas decision was the distinction between injury allegedly arising from communicative acts,the attorney testimony,and injury resulting from noncommunicative conduct,the invasion of privacy resulting from the attorney eavesdropping.this distinction has traditionally served as a threshold issue in determining the applicability of section b.kimmel,supra,cal d at.in kimmel the court described the claimed injuries as not arising from the broadcast and publication the statutory language of private conversations but from the act of recording them.id.at.we note that plaintiffs have not cited a single case in which section b has been held to bar suit for personal injuries arising from noncommunicative conduct that occurred during a judicial proceeding.on the contrary,a review of the myriad cases that have applied section b to shield defendants from liability demonstrates that,without exception,the privilege has applied only to torts arising from statements or publications.id.at.see also westlake community hospital superior court cal d,westlake community hospital act of terminating physician staff privileges not subject to section b because statute applied only to statements and publications not actions.
following kimmel,ribas,and westlake community hospital,the supreme court again had occasion to visit the threshold in rubin,supra,cal th,d.in rubin,plaintiff cause of action was founded on the common law offense of barratry,the act of frequently exciting and stirring up suits and quarrels.blackstone,commentaries see.the plaintiff alleged that the defendant had used improper methods in soliciting tenants in a trailer park residence as potential plaintiffs in a lawsuit against the park owners for housing violations.rubin,supra,cal th at,d.the defendant raised the litigation privilege by way of demurrer,which was sustained without leave to amend.the supreme court first reiterated that the fact the solicitations occurred before litigation did not defeat the privilege.it then wrestled with whether defendant alleged wrongs consisted of acts or communications,observing that the fact that defendants communications with trailer park residents necessarily involved related acts does not destroy the privilege.id.at,d.the court considered its earlier decision in kimmel,pointing out that the claimed abuse there was the unprivileged act of taping,not from any publication,citing kimmel,supra,cal d at.the court found ribas equally instructive on the dichotomy,noting there that damages for the act of eavesdropping were recoverable,those resulting from the testimonial use of the contents of the overheard conversation were not.rubin,supra,cal th at,d,quoting ribas,supra,cal d at.applying these principles to the facts in rubin,the court concluded that the litigation privilege would not apply to the injury resulting from plaintiffs and their attorney conduct.to the extent the complaint rests on the attorney alleged communicative acts of counseling and advising his clients,the privilege is clearly operative.judging from the allegations of the amended complaint,plaintiffs claims,however styled,are founded essentially upon the alleged misrepresentations made by the law firm and green to the trailer park residents.rubin,supra,cal th at,d.accordingly,the privilege defeated the plaintiff claims.
in agreeing with the trial court,the supreme court in rubin recognized that conduct is often stirred with communication and vice versa.it directed that the inquiry be into whether the activities were communicative in their essential nature id.at,d.if so,the privilege applies.we,too,recognize that lines in this area are likely to be drawn with brushes and not cut with knives.here,the actual levying on property falls squarely on the side of conduct.this becomes clearer when one considers the process by which judgments are enforced.initially the judgment is prepared,then the judgment creditor may make application for a writ of execution,the writ is issued,and instructions are given to the levying officer.the essential nature of this part of the process is communicative,at least from the perspective of the judgment creditor and its lawyer.the various documents filed or delivered reflect statements that there is a judgment,that it is subject to execution,and that there exists certain property subject to levy.
the line is crossed when the levying officer,on behalf of the judgment creditor,actually levies on the property.that is a taking the act of removing property from one source here a financial institution and depositing it in a place controlled by the levying officer.whatever statements may be inherent in that part of the process are tangential,or in the words of the court in rubin,not essential.
indeed,the supreme court in kimmel recognized the danger in the rote assumption that once a statement is implicated all other activities that follow are also communicative.finally,we note that the result urged by the plaintiffs,an extension of section b to unlawful conduct undertaken to obtain evidence in anticipation of litigation,would lead to unacceptable consequences.suppose a prospective defendant kept important documents at home.if a prospective plaintiff,in anticipation of litigation,burglarized defendant premises in order to obtain evidence,plaintiff here would apparently apply the privilege to protect the criminal conduct.such an extension of section b is untenable.kimmel,supra,cal d at.
bleau fox cites a single case,brown,supra,th,d,in support of its position that the wrongful levy is privileged.in brown,the court was faced with an abuse of process claim arising out of the execution on exempt social security and retirement funds.a demurrer was sustained without leave to amend.the court of appeal correctly chronicled the development of the privilege from defamation to other torts and to statements outside the courtroom.it also observed that the threshold issue in determining whether the privilege applies is whether the injury results from communicative acts or noncommunicative conduct.id.at,d.however,the appellate court then changed its focus from the inquiry to whether the activity occurred completely outside the judicial proceedings and therefore outside the litigation privilege.id.at,d.in so doing,it appears to us the court of appeal lost sight of the fact that the essential nature of actually levying on exempt funds was not communication but was action.id.at,d.the opinion states the act of applying for a writ is privileged.the privilege extends to torts arising from the privileged statement or publication.as such,not only does the privilege protect the application for the writ of execution,it also extends to the act of carrying out the directive of the writ.to hold otherwise would effectively strip the litigation privilege of its purpose.id.at,d,fns.omitted.
we respectfully disagree.the privilege is limited by its statutory language to publications and broadcasts.the supreme court has regularly reminded that the privilege does not apply to conduct.thus,it does not follow that,merely because the application for the the statement by the judgment creditor to the clerk that the creditor has a judgment and requests the issuance of a a privileged communication,subsequent acts in levying on property are likewise privileged.we agree with the decisions of other appellate courts that certain steps taken preliminary to actual levy are communicative in nature.for example,in merlet,supra,th,d,the court correctly concluded that filing with the court an application for a writ of sale and seeking reconsideration of an order denying the application are essentially communicative in nature and therefore privileged.nor does the rule we adopt today run counter to supreme court and court of appeal decisions that uphold the privilege in the context of the filing of lis pendens albertson raboff,supra,cal d,mechanics liens frank pisano associates taggart d,or homeowners assessment liens wilton mountain wood homeowners th,d.each of these cases implicitly recognizes that a lien is at its core not conduct but a notice,a statement,to the world,of a potential interest in property.it thus comes within the purview of communication 
finally,we note that the failure to distinguish between conduct and communication runs the risk of essentially eliminating the tort of abuse of process,something we do not believe the legislature intended when it amended the litigation privilege in the session to include publications made in judicial proceedings.historical note,west ann.ed.foll.given the expansion of the privilege to matters not only inside but outside the courtroom,and not only during trial but before and after trial,to sweep conduct within the privilege ambit would in all likelihood nullify the tort.if that is the inevitable next step,it should be undertaken by the legislature,not by the judiciary expansive reading of a statute that itself was limited in its origins.oren,supra,cal d at.
we therefore conclude that wrongfully levying on property pursuant to a writ of execution is not subject to the litigation privilege.

code of civil procedure section provides a subject to subdivision b,the trial court may stay the enforcement of any judgment or order.b if the enforcement of the judgment or order would be stayed on appeal only by the giving of an undertaking,a trial court shall not have power,without the consent of the adverse party,to stay the enforcement thereof pursuant to this section for a period which extends for more than days beyond the last date on which a notice of appeal could be filed.c this section applies whether or not an appeal will be taken from the judgment or order and whether or not a notice of appeal has been filed.thus,a trial court may stay enforcement of any judgment,without a bond,for a period not longer than days beyond the last date a notice of appeal could be filed.as applicable here,under california rules of court,rule,a notice of appeal must be filed on or before days after the superior court clerk mails a notice of entry of judgment to the party filing the notice of appeal.according to rule,however,the filing of a valid notice of intention to move for new trial extends the time to appeal from a judgment to
