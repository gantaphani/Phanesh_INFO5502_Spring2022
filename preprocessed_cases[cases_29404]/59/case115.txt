plaintiff debra frazee appeals from a summary judgment in favor of defendants hall seely,katia diehl,the law firm of seely russell s r,michelle elizabeth hales,robert etienne,and the law firm of hales,hales etienne h,h e.frazee contends the court erred by granting summary judgment in her malpractice action for the following reasons the court granted summary judgment without allowing oral argument it incorrectly denied her request for a continuance to conduct further discovery to oppose the summary judgment motion it incorrectly granted a motion by hales,etienne,and h,h e to join in the motion for summary filed by seely,diehl,and s r it applied the wrong standards of proof and persuasion to the summary judgment motion and there are genuine questions of material fact.we agree with the second and third contentions and reverse.
frazee retained hales and etienne of h,h e to represent her in a dissolution action filed by her husband in santa clara county.this representation was for the purpose of protecting her property rights,obtaining orders of support for herself and her son,attempting to get the dissolution proceeding in santa clara county dismissed to allow her to institute a similar proceeding in orange county,where she resides.frazee retained separate counsel in southern california and filed a petition for dissolution with the orange county superior court.the santa clara action was later dismissed.
although frazee sought to retain further local counsel in the orange county action,hales and etienne agreed to continue representing her.they acted on frazee behalf at the outset of the dissolution action including advising her to store an automobile she owned jointly with her husband as leverage.however,hales subsequently informed frazee that she and her firm would no longer be able to represent frazee,and referred her to the law firm of s frazee then retained seely.
frazee alleges that at family court appearances seely was either absent or,if present,allowed diehl,an associate,to proceed with no supervision,and that both seely and diehl failed to take any depositions in the dissolution action.allegedly seely informed frazee he wished to leave depositions until closer to the trial date,and later told her the time to conduct discovery had passed.the court ordered frazee husband to pay her temporary support.when he stopped paying this support,seely told frazee to sell her possessions to support herself and her son.
in frazee absence,the court granted her husband a final decree of dissolution.frazee demanded to speak with seely,but was told he could not represent her because he had to represent paying clients she then contacted hales and asked for advice.hales refused to help her and advised frazee to continue working with diehl,obtain a judgment,and worry about it later.
in the present action,frazee seeks damages for malpractice against all defendants and damages for constructive fraud and negligent misrepresentation against seely,diehl,and s r.she alleges diehl made crucial errors and failed to admit important evidence or to properly examine witnesses.these errors resulted in the family residence being awarded to her husband and other orders in his favor.she also alleges seely breached his fiduciary duty by entrusting her representation to diehl.
in may,seely,diehl,and s r moved for summary judgment,or in the alternative,for summary adjudication,requesting a hearing date of june.they argued that frazee would be unable to prove damages in the first cause of action because she could not have obtained a more favorable result in the dissolution action.the separate statement and supporting documents tended to show,among other things,that a retrial granted in favor of frazee husband did not end in a better result than the original judgment obtained by diehl.
as for the purported cause of action for constructive fraud,seely,diehl,and s r argued that frazee could not prevail because she had not shown a breach of fiduciary duty.lastly,they contended the purported cause of action for negligent misrepresentation must fail because the alleged misrepresentation was immaterial.on june,hales,etienne,and h,h e moved to join in the motion for summary,i nasmuch as the issues of causation of damages are identical 
in a declaration filed with frazee opposition,her attorney requested that the court deny the motion or grant a continuance to allow completion of pending discovery he stated that the transcripts of depositions recently taken have not yet been received,depositions of defendant declarants in support of their motion for summary judgment are currently calendared but have not yet been taken,frazee own deposition had yet to be completed,and responses to interrogatories were expected to arrive in days.frazee attorney also claimed that frazee had been most diligent in attempting to conduct and complete her discovery,but scheduling problems had arisen,and it ha d not been an easy task to fly to northern california to take these various depositions.completion of discovery was necessary,he argued,because the transcript of seely deposition would include some admissions and acknowledgments that will go far in establishing the alleged professional negligence and breaches of fiduciary duty and further depositions of defendants expert witnesses would be necessary to impeach their declarations filed in support of the motion for summary judgment.
frazee also opposed hales,etienne,and h,h e joinder motion.her opposition to the motion for summary dealt exclusively with the issues relating to seely,diehl,and s r and was filed before the motion of joinder was served on her.she argued the attempted joinder was untimely and should be denied.
seely,diehl,and s r opposed frazee request for a continuance.in response to the assertion that frazee needed to depose their expert witnesses,they argued the request was insufficient because frazee remedy was not to depose the experts for purposes of the opposition to the summary judgment,but rather to submit a declaration of her own expert or to attack the foundational basis for the opinion.they also contended it is not enough to justify a continuance where discovery is outstanding,and that the action was pending for well over three years.
after a hearing held on june,the court granted the motion of joinder filed by hales,etienne,and h,h e and granted summary judgment for all defendants.it found that frazee would be unable to prove any damages from defendants alleged malpractice and that she could not establish a breach of fiduciary duty by seely,diehl,and s r as to the cause of action for constructive fraud or that seely alleged representations were sufficiently material to establish negligent misrepresentation.the record does not indicate whether the court expressly ruled on frazee request for a continuance.
discussion 
the court provided frazee a hearing 
frazee contends the court denied her due process of law by granting the motion for summary judgment without providing her an opportunity to argue in open court.she points to the fact that the reporter transcript shows the motion was granted during a morning session at which she and her attorney were not present.we disagree.
the phantom morning session is nothing but a product of typographical error.we granted frazee motion to augment the record with the reporter transcript of the hearing and also granted a request by seely,diehl,and s r to correct it.a declaration from the court reporter stated,i have concluded that the transcript is in error.the hearing wherein the court granted the summary judgment did not take place during the morning session.rather,the hearing took place after oral argument which was set forth at as corrected,the transcript reads the following proceedings were had in open court after oral argument on summary judgment motion.moreover,the court explicitly stated in its order that the motion was granted a fter consideration of all papers filed in support of the motion for summary judgment and upon oral argument italics added.
the court abused its discretion by denying a continuance 
frazee also argues the court should have either denied the motion for summary or,i
