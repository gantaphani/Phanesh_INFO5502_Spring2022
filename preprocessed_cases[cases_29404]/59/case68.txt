representing himself,clay joseph jones sued his former attorney,alan whisenand,for legal malpractice and civil rights violations allegedly committed in the course of civil commitment proceedings under the sexually violent predator act svpa.welf.inst.code,et the trial court sustained whisenand demurrer to the first amended complaint without leave to amend on the grounds that jones failed to allege actual innocence of all charges in the underlying criminal case or exoneration,and jones failed to show that whisenand was a state actor acting under color of state law.
we conclude that the actual innocence requirement does not apply to svpa proceedings.because svpa proceedings take place at the end of an offender prison sentence,requiring an offender to plead and prove actual innocence would make recovery impossible in all but the most unusual cases.see,in re smith cal th,considering the constitutional claims of an offender who obtained postconviction relief after an svp petition was filed.although the svpa imposes significant limitations on the rights of sexually violent predators svps and alleged svps,nothing in the statutory scheme suggests the legislature intended to deprive all or even most such persons of the right to recover for legal malpractice.we therefore conclude that the actual innocence requirement does not apply.
however,public policy considerations underlying the actual innocence requirement namely,judicial economy and the desire to avoid conflicting resolutions compel the conclusion that alleged svps should not be able to pursue causes of action for legal malpractice in the course of their svpa proceedings unless and until such proceedings have been terminated in their favor.as we shall explain,our conclusion does not leave alleged svps without a remedy while proceedings are ongoing,as they may still seek relief for ineffective assistance of counsel in the svpa proceedings themselves.
jones does not,and can not,allege that the pending svpa proceedings have been terminated in his favor.we therefore conclude the trial court properly sustained whisenand demurrer to jones cause of action for legal malpractice.the svpa proceedings against jones are,however,still pending,raising the possibility that he may be able to comply with the favorable termination requirement in the future.accordingly,we conclude the demurrer should have been sustained with leave to amend.by analogy to coscia mckenna cuneo cal th,coscia,we further conclude that the malpractice cause of action should be stayed during the period in which jones timely and diligently pursues a favorable termination of the svpa proceedings.
turning to jones cause of action for violations of his civil rights under title united states code section section,we conclude that the trial court properly sustained the demurrer without leave to amend.
we therefore affirm in part,reverse in part,and remand for further proceedings.
background 
in,jones was convicted of one count of lewd and lascivious conduct with force upon a child under age pen.code,subd.b,eight counts of lewd and lascivious conduct upon a child under the age of pen.code,subd.a,and four counts of sodomy pen.code,subd.c.people jones,nonpub.opn.jones admitted he had a prior felony conviction pen.code,subd.b and was sentenced to years in prison.people jones,supra,at.on appeal,another panel of this court modified the judgment to stay execution of a two year term with respect to one count of lewd and lascivious conduct upon a child under the age of,thereby reducing jones aggregate sentence to years.id.at.
jones was released from prison in and transferred to the sacramento county jail pending svpa commitment proceedings.jones was subsequently released from the county jail,then arrested on a body attachment and detained at coalinga state hospital csh pending svpa commitment proceedings.see people clay joseph jones,sacramento superior court case people clay joseph jones,sacramento superior court case.
in september,jones,through his former counsel,robert saria,filed a petition for habeas corpus in this court.in re clay joseph jones on habeas corpus.the petition was denied.jones alleges that saria botched the petition,resulting in unspecified litigation against saria.
whisenand was appointed to represent jones in connection with the svpa proceedings in july.according to the complaint,whisenand failed to communicate with jones,failed to investigate,failed to secure expert witnesses,failed to prepare for trial,and generally failed to render effective assistance of counsel,resulting in the denial of due process and equal protection of the laws as well as wrongful prolonged incarceration.the complaint further alleges that,defendant s named herein are being sued for malpractice,resulting in the plaintiff erroneous loss of liberty state and federal civil rights violations,loss of liberty,mental and emotional trauma stigma from being erroneously confined in a mental institution,false imprisonment,and mental and emotional suffering.
the complaint suggests that jones would have prevailed in the svpa proceedings,but for whisenand negligence.according to jones,had counsel investigated independently,and also obtained the services of an expert to assist the defense,counsel would have had a high probability of overcoming or preventing the current finding by the court.the complaint does not specify which adverse finding may have been overcome or prevented.we take judicial notice of the fact that the svpa trial has not taken place,and appears to have been pending since against this background,we understand jones to complain that whisenand neglected his case over a period of years,necessitating multiple continuances of the svpa trial date,when,according to jones,there was a high probability that he would have been deemed not to be an svp and released,had whisenand been diligent in defending him.
jones commenced the instant action on december.at the time,jones svpa trial was scheduled to commence in.jones initial complaint asserts causes of action for legal malpractice and civil rights violations based on the allegations described above.the initial complaint seeks a declaration of jones right to counsel,an injunction barring whisenand and the entire public defender office from representing jones in the pending svpa proceeding,appointing new counsel,and staying the svpa proceedings pending resolution of the instant action,and damages for deliberate ineffective assistance of counsel,with gross negligence harm to his said svp case and defence sic and violations of his state and federal constitutional rights,including but not limited to,denial of due process,loss of liberty,false imprisonment,and mental emotional suffering.
whisenand demurred to the initial complaint on the grounds that jones failed to plead actual innocence of all charges in the underlying criminal case or exoneration,failed to show that his detention in csh is unlawful,and failed to show that whisenand was a state actor acting under color of state law.the trial court sustained the demurrer with leave to amend.
jones filed the first amended complaint on december.the first amended complaint omits the prayer for declaratory relief,injunctive relief and damages.whisenand demurred a second time,on the same grounds as before.jones did not oppose the demurrer,which was sustained without leave to amend following an uncontested hearing on march,instead,jones filed a motion for leave to file second amended complaint,on march,the trial court entered a judgment of dismissal in whisenand favor on april.the trial court denied jones motion for leave to amend by order dated may.
jones filed a timely notice of appeal.

legal malpractice 
the failure to provide competent representation in a civil or criminal case may be the basis for civil liability under a theory of professional negligence.in a legal malpractice action arising from a civil proceeding,the elements are the duty of the attorney to use such skill,prudence,and diligence as members of his or her profession commonly possess and exercise a breach of that duty a proximate causal connection between the breach and the resulting injury and actual loss or damage resulting from the attorney negligence.citations.in a legal malpractice case arising out of a criminal proceeding,california,like most jurisdictions,also requires proof of actual innocence.citations.wilkinson zelen th.
when a former criminal defendant sues his or her attorney for legal malpractice resulting in conviction,the former defendant actual innocence of the underlying criminal charges is a necessary element of the cause of action.citation.moreover,the plaintiff must obtain postconviction relief in the form of a final disposition of the underlying criminal case for example,by acquittal after retrial,reversal on appeal with directions to dismiss the charges,reversal followed by the people refusal to continue the prosecution,or a grant of habeas corpus relief as a prerequisite to proving actual innocence in a malpractice action against former criminal defense counsel.citation.khodayari mashburn th.for convenience,we shall refer to both of these elements actual innocence of the convictions and postconviction relief from the convictions as the actual innocence requirement.ibid.
this case requires us to determine whether the actual innocence requirement applies to svpa proceedings.no published decision appears to have addressed this issue.because our analysis requires an understanding of the svpa,we begin with an overview of the relevant statutory scheme.
overview of the svpa 
the svpa provides for involuntary civil commitment of an offender immediately upon release from prison if the offender is found to be an svp.people yartz cal th.the svpa was enacted to identify incarcerated individuals who suffer from mental disorders that predispose them to commit violent criminal sexual acts,and to confine and treat such individuals until it is determined they no longer present a threat to society.people allen cal th.a n svpa commitment proceeding is a special proceeding of a civil nature,because it is neither an action at law nor a suit in equity,but instead is a civil commitment proceeding commenced by petition independently of a pending action.people yartz,supra,at.
an svp is defined as a person who has been convicted of a sexually violent offense against one or more victims and who has a diagnosed mental disorder that makes the person a danger to the health and safety of others in that it is likely that he or she will engage in sexually violent criminal behavior,subd.a.a diagnosed mental disorder is defined to include a congenital or acquired condition affecting the emotional or volitional capacity that predisposes the person to the commission of criminal sexual acts in a degree constituting the person a menace to the health and safety of others,subd.c.
the procedure for determining whether a convicted sex offender is an svp typically begins when an offender is scheduled to be released from custody.turner superior court th.under section,whenever the director of corrections determines that a defendant serving a prison term may be a sexually violent predator,the department of corrections and the board of prison terms undertake an initial screening based on whether the person has committed a sexually violent predatory offense and on a review of the person social,criminal,and institutional history,subd.b.people hurtado cal th.
the screening is conducted in accordance with an assessment protocol developed by the department of state hospitals dsh,formerly known as the department of mental health.people hurtado,supra,cal th at.if that screening leads to a determination that the defendant is likely to be a sexually violent predator,the defendant is referred to the dsh for an evaluation by two psychiatrists or psychologists,subds.b c.if both find that the defendant has a diagnosed mental disorder so that he or she is likely to engage in acts of sexual violence without appropriate treatment and custody,subd.d,the department forwards a petition for commitment to the county of the defendant last conviction ibid.if the county designated counsel concurs with the recommendation,he or she files a petition for commitment in the superior court,subd.i.ibid.
upon filing of the svpa commitment petition,the trial court must review the petition and determine whether the petition states or contains sufficient facts that,if true,would constitute probable cause to believe that the alleged svp is likely to engage in sexually violent predatory criminal behavior upon his or her release.if the trial court determines the petition,on its face,supports a finding of probable cause,then the court orders that the offender be kept in a secure facility until a probable cause hearing under section is conducted.
the probable cause hearing must be conducted within calendar days of the issuance of the order finding the petition would support a finding of probable cause.the purpose of the probable cause hearing is to determine whether there is probable cause to believe that the individual named in the petition is likely to engage in sexually violent predatory criminal behavior upon his or her release,subd.a.the probable cause hearing is an adversarial hearing where the offender has the right to counsel.ibid.
if the trial court finds probable cause,it orders a trial to determine whether the offender is an svp under section,subd.a.the offender must remain in a secure facility between the time probable cause is found and the time trial is completed.ibid.the offender is entitled to a trial by jury,and the jury verdict must be unanimous,subds.a f.the offender is also entitled to assistance of counsel and to retain experts or professional persons to perform an examination on his or her behalf,subd.a.at trial,the trier of fact determines whether,beyond a reasonable a doubt,the offender is an svp.if the trier of fact determines the offender is an svp,the offender is committed for an indefinite term to the custody of the dsh for appropriate treatment and confinement in a secure facility.ibid.as noted,jones has been confined at csh pending trial since.
the actual innocence requirement 
jones argues that the actual innocence requirement does not apply to the present malpractice cause of action.he emphasizes that the actual innocence requirement applies to criminal malpractice,and the present cause of action alleges legal malpractice in svpa proceedings,which are civil in nature.people allen,supra,cal th at proceedings to commit an individual as a sexually violent predator in order to protect the public are civil in nature moore superior court cal th,svp trials are special proceedings of a civil nature,wholly unrelated to any criminal case.
whisenand counters that svpa proceedings share many features in common with criminal proceedings.see reilly superior court cal th,reilly though civil in nature,an svp trial contains a number of procedural safeguards commonly associated with criminal trials,including the alleged svp right to a jury trial,subd.a,to assistance of counsel ibid,and to a unanimous jury finding that he or she is an svp beyond a reasonable doubt before he or she may be committed.whisenand also argues that public policy considerations justify the application of the actual innocence requirement to svpa proceedings.see wiley county of san diego cal th,wiley explaining that public policy considerations support the imposition of the actual innocence requirement in the context of a cause of action for criminal malpractice.jones has the better argument.
as noted,svpa proceedings take place after an offender has served his or her prison term.see reilly,supra,cal th at under the svpa,the state can civilly commit individuals found to be svps after they conclude their prison terms people superior court troyer th,under the svpa,a convicted sex offender may be declared to be an svp and civilly committed after completing the criminal sentence.although there may be unusual circumstances in which an offender obtains postconviction relief after an svp petition is filed see,in re smith,supra,cal th at,for the most part,such offenders have not obtained postconviction relief,and can not satisfy the actual innocence requirement.see coscia,supra,cal th at a n individual convicted of a criminal offense must obtain reversal of his or her conviction,or other exoneration by postconviction relief in order to establish actual innocence in a criminal malpractice action.requiring such offenders to comply with the actual innocence requirement would effectively foreclose the possibility that they could ever recover for legal malpractice in the course of their svpa proceedings.nothing in the svpa suggests that the legislature intended to preclude svps and alleged svps from recovering for legal malpractice.
whisenand argues that public policy considerations justify application of the actual innocence requirement to svpa proceedings.our supreme court has described the public policy considerations underlying the actual innocence requirement as follows first,p ermitting a convicted criminal to pursue a legal malpractice claim without requiring proof of innocence would allow the criminal to profit by his own fraud,or to take advantage of his own wrong,or to found a claim upon his iniquity,or to acquire property by his own crime.citation.second,allowing civil recovery for convicts impermissibly shifts responsibility for the crime away from the convict.citation.a plaintiff convicted of an offense should bear sole responsibility for the consequences of his or her criminal acts a ny subsequent negligent conduct by a plaintiff attorney is superseded by the greater culpability of the plaintiff criminal conduct.citation.citation.citation.the fact that nonnegligent counsel could have done better may warrant postconviction relief,but it does not translate into civil damages,which are intended to make the plaintiff whole.citation.only an innocent person wrongly convicted due to inadequate representation has a compensable injury because in that situation the nexus between the malpractice and palpable harm is sufficient to warrant a civil action,however inadequate,to redress the loss.citation.citation.third,guilty defendants have an adequate remedy in the form of postconviction relief for ineffective assistance of counsel.citation.not only does the united states constitution guarantee this right under the sixth amendment,any lapse can be rectified through an array of postconviction remedies,including appeal and habeas corpus.citation.moreover,avoiding a procedure that would involve retrying criminal prosecutions in tort actions for malpractice is consistent with a strong judicial policy against the creation of two conflicting resolutions arising out of the same or identical transaction.coscia,supra,cal th at see wiley,supra,cal th at.
many of these public policy considerations are inapplicable here.because svps and alleged svps have already paid their debt to society for their underlying crimes,they can not be seen as profiting from their crimes or shifting responsibility for their criminal acts when they sue for legal malpractice occurring during the course of svpa proceedings.people rasmuson th,c ommitment under the svpa is a civil commitment procedure,which commits a defendant indefinitely,after he has already paid his debt to society by serving out his prison term fn.omitted.these public policy considerations can not be used to justify the application of the actual innocence requirement in the circumstances presented here.however,jones malpractice cause of action implicates the strong judicial policy against the creation of two conflicting resolutions arising out of the same or identical transaction.coscia,supra,cal th at.as we shall discuss,jones malpractice cause of action necessarily implies the invalidity of his confinement,which justifies the application of a related pleading rule the favorable termination requirement.
the favorable termination requirement 
in heck humphrey heck,the united states supreme court considered whether a state prisoner may challenge the constitutionality of his conviction in a suit for damages under section.id.at.the court concluded that a state prisoner section claims are not cognizable when the resolution of such a claim would call into question the validity of an outstanding criminal conviction or sentence.heck,supra,at.thus,in order to recover damages for allegedly unconstitutional conviction or imprisonment,or for other harm caused by actions whose unlawfulness would render a conviction or sentence invalid,a section plaintiff must prove that the conviction or sentence has been reversed on direct appeal,expunged by executive order,declared invalid by a state tribunal authorized to make such determination or called into question by a federal court issuance of a writ of habeas corpus,section of title of the united states code,fn.omitted.
in reaching this conclusion,the court began with the principle that section creates a species of tort liability.heck,supra,at.the court analogized heck section claim to a malicious prosecution claim,which requires termination of the prior criminal proceeding in favor of the accused.heck,supra,at.the court explained this requirement avoids parallel litigation over the issues of probable cause and guilt and it precludes the possibility of the claimant sic succeeding in the tort action after having been convicted in the underlying criminal prosecution,in contravention of a strong judicial policy against the creation of two conflicting resolutions arising out of the same or identical transaction.citation.ibid.
furthermore,the court continued,to permit a convicted criminal defendant to proceed with a malicious prosecution claim would permit a collateral attack on the conviction through the vehicle of a civil suit.citation.this court has long expressed similar concerns for finality and consistency and has generally declined to expand opportunities for collateral attack,citations.we think the hoary principle that civil actions are not appropriate vehicles for challenging the validity of outstanding criminal judgments applies to section damages actions that necessarily require the plaintiff to prove the unlawfulness of his conviction or confinement,just as it has always applied to actions for malicious prosecution.heck,supra,at,fns.omitted.
thus,the court concluded,when a state prisoner seeks damages in a section suit,the district court must consider whether a judgment in favor of the plaintiff would necessarily imply the invalidity of his conviction or sentence if it would,the complaint must be dismissed unless the plaintiff can demonstrate that the conviction or sentence has already been invalidated.but if the district court determines that the plaintiff action,even if successful,will not demonstrate the invalidity of any outstanding criminal judgment against the plaintiff,the action should be allowed to proceed,in the absence of some other bar to the suit.heck,supra,at,fns.omitted.
in huftile cir,huftile,the ninth circuit held that heck applies to detainees under the svpa.there,the ninth circuit considered an svp section suit challenging the procedures used to evaluate him under the svpa.huftile,supra,at.the ninth circuit concluded that a judgment in favor of huftile in his section action would necessarily imply the invalidity of his civil commitment.id.at.accordingly,the court concluded that heck barred the alleged svp claim.
