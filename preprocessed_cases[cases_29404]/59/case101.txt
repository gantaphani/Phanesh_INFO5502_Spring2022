plaintiff and appellant russell seheult appeals from a judgment in a legal malpractice action entered in favor of defendants and respondents jeffer,mangels,butler marmaro,llp,jeffrey steiner and david waite collectively,the lawyers after the trial court granted the lawyers motion for summary judgment.we hold that creation of an enforceable obligation is actual injury whether or not attorney fees or other quantifiable costs have yet been incurred in efforts to defeat or limit the liability.accordingly,we affirm the judgment based on the lawyers statute of limitations defense.
factual and procedural background 
the proposed partnership and the taubman notes 
seheult describes himself as a dental surgeon and business investor.in seheult and development company agreed to form a limited partnership to develop an enclosed shopping mall in redlands,california,to be known as the redlands fashion center or rfc.the lawyers were retained to create a limited partnership between seheult and,to be called shannon brooke limited partnership shannon brooke,and to provide other legal services in connection with the rfc project.
during the time the lawyers were working on the partnership agreement,seheult and entered into a preliminary letter agreement with taubman realty group limited partnership taubman,whereby taubman would provide services relating to developing the rfc project including entitlements processing.the parties contemplated forming a joint venture between shannon brooke and taubman to develop the project.pursuant to the letter agreement with taubman,seheult and executed certain promissory notes in favor of taubman for development costs the taubman notes.taubman advanced for legal expenses,entitlements,purchase options and other costs,which was secured by the notes.seheult understood that once shannon brooke was actually formed,he would have no further liability under the taubman notes.
the lawyers worked on the rfc project until april when they ceased providing services due to nonpayment.in late may,taubman abandoned the rfc project because seheult and failed to satisfy certain conditions set forth in the letter agreement.taubman made written demand on seheult for payment of the taubman notes by letter dated august.taubman filed suit against seheult and on october.that lawsuit was settled on august.
seheult complaint 
the complaint in this action was filed on october.seheult alleged that he retained the lawyers to form shannon brooke and to represent him in connection with the development of rfc.he alleged the lawyers were negligent in a failing to form shannon brooke to limit his personal liability for the debts of rfc b failing to obtain a final development agreement between taubman and the development group or shannon brooke c failing to disclose they were also representing taubman during the relevant times d failing to enter into a retainer agreement with seheult in violation of the rules and regulations of the state bar e allowing taubman to delay the signing of the final development agreement f subjecting seheult to personal liability for debts that were incurred by shannon brooke g failing to disclose conflicts and obtain proper consent to dual representation and h failing to notify seheult regarding a call of securities even though the lawyers had notice of the call.based on these allegations,the complaint alleged causes of action for malpractice,breach of fiduciary duty and breach of oral contract.
the lawyers summary judgment motions 
the lawyers filed a motion for summary judgment on february,the first motion in which they argued a they did not represent seheult individually and had no contract with him b they owed no duty to him c they committed no wrongful acts and d seheult was not damaged by any of their acts or omissions.the hearing on the first motion was continued several times at seheult request.on may,the lawyers filed a second motion for summary judgment the second motion based upon the expiration of the statute of limitations.
the two motions were heard on july.the trial court granted both motions,ruling in favor of the lawyers on all counts.judgment was entered on august.seheult filed a timely notice of appeal.
contentions 
seheult contends that his malpractice action is timely because he suffered no actual injury as a result of the lawyers alleged negligence in failing to form the limited partnership until he began incurring attorney fees to defend the taubman note litigation.the lawyers contend that the limitations period began to run,at the latest,when taubman demanded payment on the note from seheult personally.seheult also contends that the trial court committed reversible error in denying his motion for leave to amend the complaint.
discussion 
standard of review 
the standard of review for an order granting summary judgment was recently reiterated by our supreme court as follows a trial court properly grants summary judgment where no triable issue of material fact exists and the moving party is entitled to judgment as a matter of law.citation.we review the trial court decision de novo,considering all of the evidence the parties offered in connection with the motion except that which the court properly excluded and the uncontradicted inferences the evidence reasonably supports.citation.in the trial court,once a moving defendant has shown that one or more elements of the cause of action,even if not separately pleaded,can not be established,the burden shifts to the plaintiff to show the existence of a triable issue to meet that burden,the plaintiff may not rely upon the mere allegations or denials of its pleadings but,instead,shall set forth the specific facts showing that a triable issue of material fact exists as to that cause of action citations.merrill navegar,cal th,d,see also aguilar atlantic richfield cal th,d,katz chevron th,d.
the statute of limitations began to run when seheult sustained the first actual injury stemming from the lawyers malpractice,even though other injuries may have occurred later 
code of civil procedure section provides a an action against an attorney for a wrongful act or omission,other than for actual fraud,arising in the performance of professional services shall be commenced within one year after the plaintiff discovers,or through the use of reasonable diligence should have discovered,the facts constituting the wrongful act or omission,or four years from the date of the wrongful act or omission,whichever occurs first.this limitations period is tolled during the time t he plaintiff has not sustained actual injury.code civ,subd.a.
seheult contends that once was actually formed,taubman would permit shannon brooke to assume liability on the taubman notes,thereby relieving the partners of individual liability.the lawyers contend seheult suffered actual injury,at the latest,when taubman demanded that seheult personally and make good on the taubman notes we agree with the lawyers.
although seheult brief refers to other items of damages such as the diffenbach action and the churchill threatened lawsuit and his complaint refers to yet other items of damage,the complaint contains only a single claim for malpractice,a single claim for breach of fiduciary duty and a single claim for breach of contract,all of which were based on the same conduct by the lawyers because he alleged only a single claim,the statute of limitations began to run when seheult suffered the first actual injury from any of the alleged wrongful acts.bennett shahhal th,d as a general rule,where an injury,although slight,is sustained in consequence of the wrongful act of another,the statute of limitations attaches at once.it is not material that all the damages resulting from the act shall have been sustained at that time,and the running of the statute is not postponed by the fact that the actual or substantial damages do not occur until a later date.moreover,a claim for legal malpractice arises before the client sustains all,or even the greater part,of the damages occasioned by his or her attorney negligence.citations.any appreciable and actual harm flowing from the attorney negligent conduct establishes a cause of action upon which the client may sue.budd nixen cal d,italics added.therefore,our statute of limitations analysis concerns only the alleged injury that occurred first in lawyers failure to complete the partnership and seheult resulting personal liability for the taubman notes.
the creation of an enforceable personal obligation that would have been avoided by formation of constituted actual injury 
in his complaint seheult alleges the lawyers failure to complete formation of the limited partnership agreement caused him to become personally liable for the taubman notes,a liability that should have been borne by the partnership.assuming this to be the case,seheult suffered actual injury,at the latest,when the notes matured and taubman made demand for payment of those debts.
the undisputed facts establish that seheult always knew that no limited partnership agreement had been executed.he did not contact the lawyers regarding the status of the partnership agreement after may,and was aware that the project was no longer viable and it went away and the lawyers were not representing him in connection with the partnership after that date it is also undisputed that the lawyers stopped working on the rfc project in april due to nonpayment.it is further undisputed that taubman made written demand on the taubman notes in a letter dated august.seheult filed his complaint on october,more than one year later.
in holding seheult suffered actual injury when the lawyers stopped work without completing the partnership,the taubman notes matured and demand was made on seheult personally,we are guided by the decision in foxborough van atta th,d foxborough.foxborough involved alleged attorney negligence that caused the client to lose an unrestricted right to annex the subsequent development of a property to an existing apartment complex foxborough owned two adjoining parcels of land in san jose.on one parcel was a unit apartment complex the apartments the smaller parcel was undeveloped.from november through january,foxborough retained van atta to perform legal services concerning the two parcels.van atta was to assist in converting the apartments into condominiums,transferring the apartments to daon corporation daon in a property exchange,and securing the right to develop the smaller parcel with condominiums that foxborough could automatically annex to the apartments without the approval of daon or the owners of condominiums in the apartments.the automatic annexation right,without time constraints,was of particular importance to foxborough.id.at,d.van atta failed to obtain the automatic annexation right.ibid.foxborough learned of this failure no later than february.id.at,d.foxborough subsequently sued daon for failing to inform it of the limitation on its annexation right,but the daon litigation was unsuccessful.on march,foxborough lost its case and was ordered to pay daon attorney fees and costs.ibid.
foxborough brought suit against van attta on june.foxborough,supra,th at,d.the trial court granted summary judgment based on the statute of limitations.id.at,d.on appeal,foxborough contended its action was not because it did not suffer actual injury until it lost the daon litigation.id.at,d.the court of appeal rejected that argument,explaining t hough van atta alleged negligence may have contributed to the daon litigation judgment,that judgment was but the last in time of the alleged injuries.id.at,d.
w hen malpractice results in the loss of a right,remedy,or interest,or in the imposition of a liability,there has been actual injury regardless of whether future events may affect the permanency of the injury or the amount of monetary damages eventually incurred.citations.applying these principles to the undisputed facts in this case,we conclude that foxborough sustained actual injury well outside the statutory period.one of foxborough key objectives was to secure an unrestricted right to annex subsequent development of the retained parcel to the apartments.during the period that foxborough could have effected an automatic annexation under the pertinent regulation citation,van atta alleged negligence created only the potential for harm,because foxborough could have proceeded with the development and annexation.but when the period for automatic annexation expired on may,foxborough lost the right it had retained van atta to secure.foxborough then had to resort to the more onerous,expensive,and unpredictable task of obtaining annexation approval from the apartments owners,the very situation it hired van atta to avoid.citation.therefore,foxborough sustained actual injury before its february discovery of the facts constituting the alleged wrongful act or omission.foxborough,supra,th at,d.
in jordache enterprises,brobeck,phleger harrison cal th,d,jordache,the california supreme court held t he loss or diminution of a right or remedy constitutes injury or damage.citation.neither uncertainty of amount nor difficulty of proof renders that injury speculative or inchoate.id.at,d.citing foxborough,it also held a n existing injury is not contingent or speculative simply because future events may affect its permanency or the amount of monetary damages eventually incurred.citations.thus,we must distinguish between an actual,existing injury that might be remedied or reduced in the future,and a speculative or contingent injury that might or might not arise in the future.id.at,d.accordingly,while a lawyer error might give rise to related litigation between the client and a third party,the conclusion of such related litigation is not always synonymous with actual injury as used in code of civil procedure section.id.at,d,see also laird blacker cal th,d,we disagree with plaintiff that actual injury should be defined in terms of monetary amount and that a successful appeal negates the client ability to file a malpractice action.to the contrary,although appellate review may correct judicial error,and thus reduce the client damages,an appeal does not necessarily exonerate the attorney,nor does it extinguish the client action again him for negligence in the conduct of trial.citation.
seheult concedes the loss or diminution of a right or remedy constitutes injury or damage.see adams paul cal th,d.he also concedes damages can include the loss of an interest or the imposition of liability.foxborough,supra,th at,d when malpractice results in the loss of a right,remedy,or interest,or in the imposition of a liability,there has been actual injury regardless of whether future events may affect the permanency of the injury or the amount of monetary damages eventually incurred jordache,supra,cal th at,d,same radovich th,d same.yet he contends,without any citation to authority,that he did not suffer any actual and appreciable harm until the time of the settlement of the taubman case in and the settlement of the diffenbaugh claim,also in,or at the earliest when he started incurring legal fees in those actions in november.we can not agree.
like the lawyer in foxborough,the lawyers in this case were retained to effect a transaction that would give the client certain rights and avoid certain liabilities.in foxborough the right at issue was a right to annexation with no time limit.in the present case the right was to be a limited partner rather than a personal guarantor of notes executed with respect to the rfc project,and thus to avoid personal liability on the taubman notes.seheult admits that no later than august,the lawyers had ceased working on the partnership agreement,the rfc deal had gone away,and taubman was demanding payment on the taubman notes.thus,at that point seheult had certainly lost the right he had retained the lawyers to secure the protection he anticipated receiving from shannon brooke.see foxborough,supra,th at,d actual injury was sustained when foxborough lost the right it had retained van atta to secure.the fact he did not incur legal fees in connection with the loss of that right until later does not change the fact of the injury.adams paul,supra,cal th at,d,fn.although expenditure of attorney fees or other costs in many instances clearly would be sufficient to constitute the requisite injury,nothing in the history of section a or its decisional predicates suggests it is necessary.in some circumstances,the loss or substantial impairment of a right or remedy itself may constitute actual injury and may well precede quantifiable financial costs.
our holding that creation of an enforceable obligation is actual injury prior to efforts by the obligee to enforce it is consistent with the analysis in cases of alleged malpractice by tax lawyers.for example,in yandell baker d,overruled on other grounds in neel magana,olney,levy,cathcart gelfand cal d,footnote,involving a lawyer sued by former clients for negligent advice that resulted in an unnecessary tax liability,the court of appeal held once the clients corporation was dissolved and its assets were distributed,the liability for payment of ordinary income rates,rather than capital gains rates,arose and the damage was though the amount of damage or liability could not be determined until the internal revenue service acted later.yandell baker,supra,at.and in united states gutterman cir,a case cited with approval in both justice arabian lead opinion in adams paul,supra,cal th at page,d,and justice kennard concurring opinion id.at,d,the ninth circuit held under california law the client had suffered actual injury at the latest when the irs assessed the tax penalty.liability for a tax assessment caused by a lawyer malpractice is actual damage,since an enforceable obligation has come into existence.united states gutterman,supra,at.
seheult relies heavily on sindell gibson,dunn crutcher th,d sindell to support his contention that he suffered actual injury only upon the filing of the taubman lawsuit.in sindell,the attorney was engaged to draft an estate plan for a client and negligently failed to obtain acknowledgement from the client wife as to the nature of certain assets.id.at,d.after the wife lost her mental capacity due to age and illness,her children from a prior marriage brought suit against the husband and his children,asserting a community property claim to the husband property.id.at,d.the client sued the lawyer for malpractice based on his failure to obtain the wife consent.the trial court sustained the lawyer demurrer on the ground the cause of action had not yet accrued because the client would only suffer actual injury in the event of an adverse judgment in the community property litigation.id.at,d.division three of this court reversed the judgment of the trial court,holding that the malpractice action was not premature because the client sustained actual injury when the community property action was filed.id.at,d.
seheult erroneously argues that sindell,supra,th,d,imposes a rule that actual injury in a transactional malpractice case occurs only upon the filing of litigation related to the underlying transaction.the important fact in sindell was not that the client had been injured by having to incur legal fees to defend the lawsuit,but rather that the litigation was the precise event the lawyer had been hired to avoid where,as here,the purpose of a lawyer retention is to place the client and his or her intended beneficiaries in a posture of quiet ownership of assets,and the lawyer negligently fails to obtain a simple written consent which would all but preclude costly litigation,the mere fact of such litigation is the unwanted consequence.the litigation represents the loss of the benefit the litigation itself is the event which constitutes damage.id.at,d.
in the present case,the purpose of the lawyers retention was to form the shannon brooke partnership and thus to shield seheult from personal liability on the taubman notes.when the notes came due and taubman made a demand for payment,seheult was under a real and current personal obligation to pay,and had thus suffered the unwanted consequence he hired the lawyers to avoid.under sindell,supra,th,d,this constitutes actual injury for purposes of the statute of limitations.
the dissenting opinion description of sehuelt personal obligation to taubman as only a contingent injury until some portion of the debt is paid or a lawyer hired to contest it disregards the economic significance of an enforceable personal obligation that would have been avoided entirely according to sehuelt if the lawyers had formed shannon brooke the existence of this debt and taubman demand to be paid would need to be reflected as a liability on seheult personal balance sheet and reduced his net worth to the same extent as would the loss of an asset.see,kenly ukegawa th,d punitive damage award improper if it focuses solely on the assets side of the balance sheet without examining the liabilities side of the balance sheet.to be sure,until the debt is paid or a lawyer retained sehuelt may not be able to quantify his damages.but actual injury may well precede quantifiable financial costs.adams paul,supra,cal th at,fn,d.
the trial court denial of seheult motion to amend his complaint did not constitute prejudicial error 
seheult also contends the trial court erred in denying his motion for leave to amend his complaint to add additional facts supporting the existing causes of action and to add a cause of action for fraud.error in and of itself does not necessarily require the reversal of a judgment.prejudice resulting from the error must be shown and that such prejudicial error under the circumstances justifies a reversal.hoyt los angeles metropolitan transit authority d.in this case,the denial of the motion for leave to amend caused no prejudice.the existing causes of action were,as we have held.the proposed fraud claim is now the subject of a new action filed by seheult in the superior court.therefore,seheult has not lost the opportunity to litigate any viable claim.
disposition 
the judgment of the trial court is affirmed.respondents are to recover their costs on appeal.
i respectfully dissent.
there are two reasons first,to urge the supreme court to consider the issue raised in this case,even though it may be reluctant to revisit,yet again,the general problem of the legal malpractice limitations period it has felt compelled to address several times in the past decade.second,to explain my concerns about the position adopted in the majority opinion,which appears to create a bright line rule in a class of cases not addressed in prior supreme court decisions discussing when an actual injury occurs.as explained more fully below,the beginning point the majority opinion potential claimant first contact with the client requesting have the effect of commencing the statute of limitations period before the client legal malpractice action has accrued.
the majority opinion seizes on general pronouncements from our high court in the course of deciding what constitutes actual injury and applies those pronouncements to the facts of this case.in particular,my colleagues twice phrase when malpractice results in the loss of a right,remedy,or interest,or in the imposition of liability,there has been actual injury.italics added.according to the majority reasoning,a purported debtor letter demanding payment equates with an imposition of liability and thus the appellant here suffered an actual injury at the moment he received such a letter.as a result,the tolling period expired and,since the client already had discovered the law firm malpractice,the statute of limitations began running.
i question whether such a bright line rule exists.at a minimum,in holding the mere existence of a purported cause of action against the client constitutes an actual injury the majority opinion takes a long stride beyond the issues the supreme court actually decided in its decisions thus far.consequently,i briefly rehearse the facts of those cases and what the supreme court decided.
i.the supreme court has disavowed bright line rules and requires an injury to be palpable and definite and sufficient to provide the damage element of a malpractice cause of action before it is considered an actual injury for purposes of.
the supreme court has struggled mightily with the problem of defining actual injury ever since it decided laird and embarked on an effort to find a substitute for the earlier requirement found in some cases that an injury be irremedial to be actual.in a series of decisions since then the supreme court majority has shifted between the search for a bright line rule or rules,and a requirement clients and the reviewing courts engage in an ad hoc examination of the particular facts of each case in light of the wrongful act or omission the plaintiff alleges against the attorney.
chief justice george,former chief justice lucas,and justice mosk advocated the court establish bright line rules and persuaded enough other justices to form a majority in itt small business finance niles decided in.but only a year later,in adams paul,a new majority coalesced and rejected bright lines,opting instead for individualized inquiries.the myriad of circumstances under which statute of limitations issues may arise in missed statute cases sharply illustrates the practicality of applying the prevailing rule to the determination of when actual injury occurs.the number of potential variables,which do not necessarily follow a set pattern,precludes defining the point of harm as a fixed point or event because reasonable application becomes too problematic.the issue may be resolved as a matter of law only if the facts are undisputed.citation omitted.
the supreme court solidified this rejection of bright line rules in its most recent decision describing when an actual injury occurs,jordache enterprises,brobeck,phleger harrison,decided in.t he determination of when attorney error has caused actual injury under section,subdivision a,can not depend on facile,bright line rules.
the other question at stake in laird blacker and the line of cases which followed it was whether a client only experienced actual injury at the moment the trial court entered judgment in the underlying case,or whether it could occur earlier.laird blacker itself held actual injury need not await an appeal of the trial court judgment and under the facts of that case fixed the time of actual injury as the date when the trial court entered judgment when the adams plurality ruled actual injury could occur before the trial court rendered its judgment,justices george,lucas,and mosk dissented.they argued adams represented a retreat from this rule they deemed the court had announced in laird blacker,as did george and mosk once again in jordache in those two cases,the supreme court majority not only rejected the notion of bright line rules in general,but this bright line rule in particular.
in adams,a probate law firm failed to advise the decedent widow the statute of limitations would expire on her wrongful death action one year after the issuance of letters of administration.relying on advice the lawyer did provide regarding when she could file an action as to claims against the estate itself,she waited too long to file her wrongful death action.the estate filed a summary judgment motion based on the statute of limitations in the wrongful death action.another attorney represented the widow and opposed summary judgment,claiming the estate was estopped from raising this defense.the trial court denied summary judgment on other grounds and over a year later the parties settled the wrongful death suit.
less than a year after the settlement of the wrongful death action,the filed a legal malpractice action against the probate lawyer.this was almost six years after she belatedly filed the wrongful death action,almost seven years after the statute of limitations expired on the wrongful death action,and over two years after the probate lawyer filed a document in the summary judgment motion conceding his malpractice.the trial court sustained the probate attorney demurrer,holding the client had suffered actual injury when the statute of limitations expired on her wrongful death lawsuit,nearly seven years before she filed her legal malpractice action the appellate court affirmed,but picked a different time of actual injury the date when the client engaged counsel to oppose the summary judgment motion.
the supreme court accepted the case,in part to resolve a conflict in appellate sanbrook having decided actual injury occurred at the time the statute expired in the underlying action and pleasant celli finding the injury was not actual until the trial court dismissed the underlying action on grounds the statute had expired the appellate court in adams having selected yet a third date,the high court stepped in.
the supreme court began by reiterating basic principles from budd nixen and laird blacker i repeat them,because they have special relevance to the case before this court.t he fact of damage rather than the amount is the relevant consideration in addition,the character or quality of the injury must be manifest and palpable.citations omitted.the mere breach of a professional duty,causing only nominal damages,speculative harm,or the threat of future yet not suffice 
in applying these principles,the supreme court first discussed the classic missed statute situation,which it defined as one in which the attorney negligently fails to file the underlying lawsuit within the applicable statutory period and does nothing further.that is,neither the malpracticing attorney nor the client seeks to file the lawsuit or challenge the demise of the claim.in that instance,the client has suffered actual injury at the moment the statute expired because he or she has lost the benefit he or she could have gained through the lawsuit.as the supreme court explains it,the right remedy of recovery on the action has been substantially impaired.in other words,the client has a complete legal malpractice cause of action at that moment,including the damages element of that claim,the lost opportunity to recover damages in the law suit the lawyer malpractice now bars the client from pursuing.
the supreme court then turned to the many variations and permutations on the theme of the classic missed statute scenario and explained why oftentimes those more complex fact situations could result in actual not just threatened future harm first occurring after the statute expired but before a final judgment or settlement occurs in the underlying action accordingly,it rejected the bright line rule announced in pleasant requiring a final resolution of the underlying action where the client attempts to rectify the lawyer malpractice and pursue that underlying action anyway.ultimately,the high court remanded the case before it to the trial court with the admonition neither finlayson nor the court of appeal decision in adams comported with the rule we reaffirm that actual injury is generally a question of fact.among other possible points of actual injury the supreme court instructed the appellate court to consider whether such injury occurred when the underlying statutory period expired,or when the client first opposed the limitations defense,or not until the date of the settlement.t he court may determine the point at which the fact of damage became palpable and definite even if the amount remained uncertain,taking into consideration all relevant circumstances.
in jordache,the court begins by summarizing the holdings of adams.determining actual injury is predominantly a factual inquiry actual injury may occur without any prior adjudication,judgment,or settlement nominal damages,speculative harm,and the mere threat of future harm are not actual injury and the relevant consideration is the fact of damage,not the amount.
it applied those principles to a factual scenario somewhat more complicated than adams.in jordache,the law firm allegedly failed to advise its clients they had insurance coverage for defense of a major,long running lawsuit.accordingly,the clients paid the law firm to mount a dollar defense.when the clients replaced the original law firm for other reasons,the new law firm advised there indeed was insurance coverage.the clients then employed a third law firm to seek that coverage from the liability insurers.
three years later,this led to a lawsuit against the insurers seeking some million in reimbursements for attorneys fees and costs the clients had laid out.because of the original law firm failure to advise insurance covered the defense of this action,the insurers were able to assert a late notice defense.the trial court agreed the notice was untimely as a matter of law,but also found the issue of prejudice remained a triable issue.the clients and the insurers then settled the insurance coverage claim for million.
still out of pocket for million in defense costs they felt would have been covered by insurance except for the original law firm negligence,the clients sued that law firm for malpractice.the law firm raised the statutory bar,claiming the clients sustained actual injury either when they diverted investment funds to pay defense costs and thus lost profits they would have earned from those investments or the insurance benefits they lost before tendering the defense to the insurers.the clients countered they did not suffer actual injury until forced to settle for less than their full defense costs.the trial court granted summary judgment on grounds the clients suffered lost profits before it even tendered the claim to the insurer.but the appellate court reversed,holding whether the law firm omissions impaired the clients interests in the benefits of its insurance policies was contingent on the outcome of the insurance coverage action.
the supreme court reversed the appellate court and held actual injury occurred before the insurance coverage litigation ended with a settlement.the high court expanded on adams discussion of budd nixen,and also concluded essentially codifies that opinion definition of actual injury.the jordache opinion repeatedly underscores a point which is critical to the outcome of the case before this court.to be an actual injury the client harm must be of such character and significance as to support an immediate legal malpractice cause of action.it is not sufficient there is a probability the client at some time in the future will have suffered an injury that will support a cause of action then.the injury must be such as would supply that element of a cause of action if it were filed now.as the jordache opinion explains 
budd recognized that actual loss or damage resulting from the professional negligence was an essential element of a cause of action in tort for professional negligence.citation omitted.thus,budd held that the statute of limitations began to run when the plaintiff sustained loss or damage from the attorney negligence that allowed the plaintiff to assert a malpractice cause of action.citation omitted.in section terms,the limitations period that commences when the plaintiff actually or constructively discovers the attorney wrongful act or omission is no longer tolled after the plaintiff sustains actual injury,when the plaintiff can plead a legal malpractice cause of action.
if the allegedly negligent conduct does not cause damage,it generates no cause of action in tort hence,until the client suffers appreciable harm as a consequence of the attorney negligence,the client can not establish a cause of action for malpractice.
later on,the opinion returns to this theme.the actual injury provision in section,subdivision a,effectively continues the accrual rule budd established.under budd,the cause of action could not accrue until the plaintiff suffered actual loss or damage resulting from the allegedly negligent conduct.citation omitted.that is to say,the statute of limitations will not run during the time the plaintiff can not bring a cause of action for damages from professional negligence.
in jordache,the supreme court held the clients in that case suffered injury,in the form of unpaid insurance benefits and lost profits from investment funds diverted to cover defense costs,more than sufficient in character and amount to provide the damages element of a legal malpractice cause of action.those lost profits and benefits were palpable and definite and thus compensable at the time they occurred.a malpractice claim based on those lost profits and benefits could have been filed long before the settlement in the insurance coverage action.accordingly,at that earlier point the clients had sustained actual injury within the meaning of and the statute of limitations was no longer tolled.
ii.is the mere existence of a potential cause of action or a potential plaintiff request for payment of damages sufficiently palpable and definite to represent actual injury within the meaning of 
in one important respect,the case before this court is different from adams and jordache and nearly every other previous decision on the issue of when a client experiences actual injury and loses the tolling protection provided in.the clients in these other cases lost the opportunity to seek or receive money or other affirmative benefits from someone else,because of their lawyers malpractice.here,on the other hand,what the client lost was a defense to another person claim to receive money from the client.
the basic scenario arises when a plaintiff has a possible cause of action against the client and the client lawyer has done failed to do deprives the of some potential defense against that cause of action.the possible cause of action might be based on an automobile the plaintiff,totaling his car and injuring his back.or,it could be a cause of action based on a breach of client defendant ordered a shipment of widgets in a contract promising payment within days,and has failed to pay as yet.or,as here,a breach of a contract to repay money the plaintiff in effect loaned the in a rather complex business arrangement.
the nature of the cause of action appears irrelevant to determining whether and when actual injury occurs.to say someone owes another person a debt merely means the lender has a cause of action against the borrower for breaching the contract to repay the debt.it is an enforceable obligation only in the sense the lender can go to court and sue on that cause of action.if successful in that lawsuit the lender then has a judgment he can execute against the debtor assets.thus,the driver who rear ends another car has as much of an enforceable obligation to pay the damages the other driver sustained as a debtor does to repay a lender.that other driver can take him to court and,if successful,end up with a judgment he can execute against the defendant.
in neither instance is there an imposition of liability the moment the cause of action comes into existence nor the moment the potential plaintiff calls or writes and says i want my money for breach of the duty you owed me.liability will be accepted if and when the defendant,whether borrower or driver,voluntarily pays the damages the plaintiff has asked for.liability will be imposed in either instance,only if and when the plaintiff wins the lawsuit and obtains a judgment against the defendant.
this raises the issue whether one necessarily suffers actual injury for purposes of a legal malpractice action at the instant a potential cause of action comes into existence or at the instant the potential plaintiff asks the client to pay damages he allegedly owes.or does the only begin to suffer actual injury when he makes some payment to the potential plaintiff,or starts expending money to dispute the claim,or experiences some lost benefit,such as the denial of a loan,as the result of the existence of the potential cause of action against him 
there appears to be a salient difference between malpractice which causes the client to lose a right to obtain money from another and malpractice which causes the client to lose a defense to someone else claim to obtain money from the client.in the former the actual injury occurs at the instant the client loses the right.the money you could have gained from the other person if you still possessed that right constitutes the damage element for an immediate malpractice cause of action against the lawyer.but when the lawyer malpractice only deprives the client of a defense against a claim another party may pursue against that client and may succeed in enforcing against him sometime in the future,the actual injury does not occur until the client pays the other party all or part of the claim or pays someone to fight back or suffers the loss of some other benefit because of the existence of the claim.until then the injury is really only the threat of future yet realized and hence does not suffice.
if the client attempted to file a legal malpractice action at the moment the purported cause of action came into existence,when he lost his defense to the other person claim,or when that other person requested payment,what could the client claim as damages in his malpractice cause of action he could only allege another person had a possible cause of action against him,which he might file in the future and which eventually might require the client to pay damages to that person sometime still further in the future is that prospect a palpable and definite injury 
no doubt the damages the client might have to pay on the claim represent a probable future harm and more probable once the potential plaintiff asks the client to pay him the damages he is claiming.but jordache and the cases it cites appear to reject the notion the threat of future harm,no matter how probable,can supply the damage element of a malpractice cause of action and,until the client is in a position to file a viable malpractice action he has not suffered an actual injury within the meaning of.consequently,we must wait until that future harm materializes in one form or another.the client either makes at least some payment to the potential plaintiff,or employs some lawyer to defend against the claim,or loses some other affirmative benefit,such as a loan,because of the existence of the cause of action.until then,the tolling period of continues.
for this reason,appellant did not suffer actual injury in this case when respondent malpractice deprived him of a defense to taubman realty group limited partnership taubman claim,nor when taubman sent a demand,nor when taubman filed a lawsuit.instead he began suffering actual injury when he decided to resist the claim and employed a law firm to defend the also would have experienced actual injury had he decided not to resist and started making payments on the debt to taubman.
the distinction between malpractice that costs a client a right and malpractice that loses him a defense may appear subtle,but is nonetheless real and with real life consequences for the timing of legal malpractice lawsuits.if a law firm malpractice costs a client a right to obtain money or some other benefit from another,the loss is immediate.except in the rather rare case where the client has an alternative potential legal ground for seeking that same money or benefit,he has lost the right to demand or file suit to gain that money or benefit.so,in the normal situation,there will be no further event,no claim or lawsuit from the other side,merely the immediate and permanent loss of whatever money or other benefit to which the client would have been entitled in the absence of the law firm malpractice.that,clearly,is an actual injury.and indeed to say it was not an actual injury sufficient to end the unlimited tolling period of would place the client in complete control of the timing of his legal malpractice lawsuit.he could commence that suit at his own convenience anytime in the future,because no other actual injury would have occurred nor would occur in the natural course of events.
contrast the implications of a loss of right to obtain a benefit from another with those accompanying the loss of a defense to the other person seeking a benefit from you.in the language of the supreme court jordache decision,the loss of a right to obtain a benefit from another is,as explained above an actual,existing injury while the loss of a defense is a contingent injury that might or might not arise in the future.whether this contingent injury will ever materialize as an actual injury depends upon the conduct of the other party and the persistence and success of its efforts to pursue its cause of also whether the client has other defenses to the claim.when it materializes as an actual injury depends on the conduct of both the other party and the client.the other party must first demand payment of the damages it claims to have suffered and,if that fails to yield results,then file a lawsuit.the client either pays turns the contingent injury into an actual injury at that ignores the demand and hopes it goes away.if the client adopts this latter course and the other party files a lawsuit,the client either pays at that time or hires a lawyer to defend the lawsuit to the bitter end or perhaps to negotiate a lesser payment.but either way the client turns the contingent injury into an actual injury.the actual injury comes either in the form of a payment to the other party or a legal fee to the client possibly the loss of some other affirmative benefit,such as a loan,because of the mere existence of the cause of action.
in this lost defense scenario,delaying until the contingent injury materializes as an actual injury does not result in an statute of limitations for the legal malpractice suit.unlike the lost right situation discussed above,the client will experience an actual out of pocket loss,or not,within a determinable time period.if the other party does not obtain payment or file a lawsuit within the statute of limitations period on its claim,the client will never have an actual injury,hence will have no damages to claim in a legal malpractice lawsuit.on the other hand,anytime the client pays the other party all or any part of the other party or without a lawsuit having been filed against suffers actual injury and the tolling of the legal malpractice lawsuit comes to an end.similarly,if he decides to resist the demand or the lawsuit by hiring a lawyer,once again the client contingent injury has turned into an actual injury and the tolling period ends.or even if the client seeks a loan and is denied or forced to accept less favorable terms because of the mere existence of this potential cause of action,the injury will no longer be contingent but actual.consequently,no matter what happens the tolling period is not,but closes either when the contingency upon which the injury depends expires or when it materializes as an actual injury because of the other party action and the client reaction.
on this issue,foxborough van appears to be weak dictum,at best.the facts of that case involved a lost right not a lost defense.and even the dictum which arguably embraces a lost defense appears ambiguous on that question.that language is when malpractice results in the loss of a right,remedy,or interest,or in the imposition of a liability,there has been actual injury regardless of whether future events may affect the permanency of the injury or the amount of monetary damages eventually incurred.for reasons expressed more fully above,it seems a stretch to construe malpractice resulting in the loss of a defense to a potential cause of action as malpractice causing an imposition of liability.furthermore,in such a case future events will not just affect the permanency of the actual injury but whether the injury will remain merely contingent or become actual whether it remains but a threat of future harm or an immediate,palpable and definite injury sufficient to furnish the damage element of a legal malpractice cause of action.
the majority opinion cites yandell for the proposition the mere existence of a debt constitutes actual injury,based on the language o nce the liability for payment of higher income tax rates arose the damage was done but,placed in context,this statement in yandell supplies no support for this proposition.the yandell court was not focused on the issue of what constitutes an actual injury a palpable and definite the terms of or budd nixen.for,yandell was applying an earlier and very different test of when the legal malpractice limitations period commenced and expired.under that test,as quoted in yandell,the statute begins to run at the time when the negligence or breach of duty occurs,not at the time when it is discovered or actual damage results.budd nixen and the formula enacted in effectively turned that old test on its head.now,what counts is not when the breach occurred but when that breach is discovered and when actual damage results.
indeed the language in the
