although the underlying litigation was apparently quite thorny,the issue presented by this appeal in a legal malpractice case is less complicated.former counsel moved to withdraw from representing a client,alleging another attorney had agreed to handle and was already handling postjudgment motions,and that the other attorney would also handle the appeal of an adverse judgment.the client sued former counsel for malpractice more than one year after the motion to withdraw was made,but less than one year after the motion was granted.the question before us is whether the trial court properly granted summary judgment to former counsel based on the statute of limitation provided by code of civil procedure section on the ground that the client could not have had an objectively reasonable expectation that former counsel was continuing to represent him after the motion to withdraw had been served.we conclude the answer is yes.
once the former counsel told the client,via the motion to withdraw,that the case had already been handed off to another attorney,the client was on notice that former counsel was no longer working for him.as we will explain,because this lawsuit was filed more than one year after that time,no triable issue of fact remains as to the statute of limitation defense,and we shall affirm the judgment.
background 
stanley flake and other underlying plaintiffs including attorney richard carroll sinclair sued various underlying defendants in the stanislaus county superior court over the fox hollow real estate development.they lost at trial in.at that trial,the plaintiffs were represented by the defendants in this malpractice suit,specifically,daniel truax and lisa blanco jimenez,attorneys with defendant firm neumiller beardslee collectively,neumiller except as noted 
neumiller filed a motion to be relieved as counsel on november,in part alleging that sinclair had agreed to handle the appeal and three postjudgment motions,and has been handling these motions.italics added.neumiller alleged the clients have stated they are not opposed to the withdrawal.the motion was not opposed,and was granted on january.
in a letter dated january,truax informed the underlying plaintiffs 
as you know,by order of the court served upon you last week,our firm is no longer your attorney sic of record in this matter.i think an explanation might be helpful.as you know,over a month ago,richard sinclair circulated for signature consents to substitutions of attorneys.the consents were signed by you and our office and returned to richard office for signature by richard and filing.richard never filed those consents,thus,our motion to be relieved as attorneys was necessary and was granted on january.
flake sued neumiller for legal malpractice on january,he alleged that he and the other underlying plaintiffs had divergent interests,creating a nonwaivable conflict for neumiller to represent them all,and neumiller mistakenly characterized flake as a plaintiff in his personal capacity,instead of as a trustee of the capstone trust,resulting in flake exposure to personal liability in the form of an attorney fee and cost award to the other side allegedly,plus the cost of hiring counsel to represent him on appeal from the adverse judgment.
the summary judgment motion urged that upon receipt of the motion to withdraw and associated papers,served on flake both individually and as trustee of the capstone trust,and flake failure to timely oppose the motion by december,flake objectively had no expectation that neumiller would provide further legal services.because this suit was filed more than one year after any objectively reasonable expectation ceased,it was barred by section.
flake opposition hinged on the proposition that an attorney representation does not end until the agreed tasks or events have occurred,the client consents to termination or a court grants an application by counsel for withdrawal.app.because he filed this malpractice suit less than one year after the motion to withdraw in the underlying case was granted,flake contended his malpractice suit was timely.
in opposition to the summary judgment,both flake and sinclair provided declarations.flake declared he had not consented to neumiller withdrawal,contrary to the statement in truax january,letter.although flake did not recall receiving the motion to withdraw,he did not deny receiving it.he declared that he thought truax was still representing him,but also declared that because he flake had been sued in a representative capacity,he was not concerned about any personal liability,based on advice he had received from truax.
specifically,flake declared as follows i do not have a specific recollection of receiving the notice of motion,motion to withdraw,and supporting declaration by truax,however,i do not deny that i received them.my state of mind from november,through january,was that truax was continuing to and was going to continue to represent me.truax had told me,after the trial,and before november,that he did not believe that attorney fees would be awarded against any of his clients,and that if attorney fees were awarded that i would not be subject to the attorney fee award,because i was not involved in the matters upon which the court could base an award of attorney fees.until january,i was not concerned about the litigation,because my state of mind was that the case had been tried,we had lost,and i was basically done with the litigation.i was not responsible for nor had i paid any costs or attorney fees to my attorneys.my state of mind was that the matter had been lost and i was not going to be responsible or liable for any costs or attorney fees,or payments to any party to the litigation.
sinclair declared that at various times in the underlying case he had represented all of the plaintiffs,including flake.after the adverse judgment,he did not speak with flake about flake substituting neumiller out of the case,or any potential or actual changes in counsel regarding any post trial motions or any tasks that needed to be performed before an appeal was to be filed by appellate counsel.sinclair denied statements in the letter truax sent plaintiffs on january,to the effect that sinclair had circulated consent to substitution forms but failed to file them.
the trial court granted summary judgment,finding that flake had no objectively reasonable expectation that neumiller would continue to perform legal services after it served flake with the motion to withdraw,thus,this suit was untimely.
after a judgment was entered in conformity with the order granting summary judgment,flake timely filed this appeal.
discussion 
in reviewing an order granting summary judgment we ascertain the pleaded issues which outline the perimeter of materiality,view the movant evidence strictly,and view the opponent evidence liberally to determine if triable issues of material fact remain.see fpi development,nakashima d.w e determine with respect to each cause of action whether the defendant seeking summary judgment has conclusively negated a necessary element of the plaintiff case,or has demonstrated that under no hypothesis is there a material issue of fact that requires the process of a trial.guz bechtel national,cal th.however,we may bypass the strict paradigm for summary judgments where,as here,there are no disputes about the record or the legal issues implicated.crow state of california d,see jimenez roseville city school dist.th.
as relevant to this case,section provides as follows 
a an action against an attorney shall be commenced within one year after the plaintiff discovers,or through the use of reasonable diligence should have discovered,the facts constituting the wrongful act or omission,or four years from the date of the wrongful act or omission,whichever occurs first.i n no event shall the time exceed four years except that the period shall be tolled during the time that any of the following exist 
flake does not dispute that he was on at least inquiry notice of alleged malpractice as of the time of the adverse underlying judgment,well over one year before this suit was filed instead,as in the trial court,he contends the toll
