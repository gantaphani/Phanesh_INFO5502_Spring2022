plaintiffs jeff croucier and david moody sued defendants anthony chavos and chavos rau,apc for alleged legal malpractice committed in a prior lawsuit.the trial court sustained chavos demurrer to the first amended complaint and dismissed the action against chavos based on the applicable statute of limitations.see code civ,section.we agree with the court ruling and affirm the judgment of dismissal.
as is often the case in legal malpractice actions,the facts necessary to decide this appeal are convoluted.there are three pertinent lawsuits the underlying business litigation,in which chavos successfully obtained a default judgment in favor of plaintiffs but failed to successfully enforce the judgment a fraudulent conveyance action,brought by current counsel for plaintiffs against certain parties that allegedly engaged in tortious conduct to stymie the enforcement of the default judgment obtained in the underlying business litigation and the instant action,in which plaintiffs allege chavos committed legal malpractice and other torts in the underlying litigation,specifically with regard to the enforcement of the judgment obtained therein.
in conducting our de novo review of the court order sustaining chavos demurrer,we must give the complaint a reasonable interpretation,and treat the demurrer as admitting all material facts properly pleaded.people ex,gallegos pacific lumber th.where,as here,a demurrer is to an amended complaint,we may consider the factual allegations of prior complaints,which a plaintiff may not discard or avoid berg berg enterprises,llc boyle th.in addition to the pleadings in the instant action,the trial court also properly took judicial notice of pleadings from the other actions at issue in this case.see,subd.d code civ,subd.a when any ground for objection to a complaint appears on the face thereof,or from any matter of which the court is required to or may take judicial notice,the objection on that ground may be taken by a demurrer to the pleading.thus,for purposes of setting forth the facts in this case,we rely on the initial complaint and first amended complaint as sources of facts that must be assumed true for purposes of this appeal,as well as judicially noticed documents from other actions to establish the existence of these documents and the statements therein,not the truth of any factual statements made in these documents.
underlying business litigation 
on october,plaintiffs represented by chavos filed a complaint for breach of contract and fraud against sun limousine manufacturers,robert paul curtis,steve curtis,and mark kane collectively,sun limousine.this action alleged sun limousine was in the business of selling custom limousines plaintiffs croucier and moody each negotiated separate contracts with sun limousine to purchase custom limousines croucier and moody each separately paid money consideration to sun limousine sun limousine did not deliver the limousines owed to croucier and moody and throughout the relevant time period,sun limousine made various false representations to croucier and moody.
on or about april,plaintiffs obtained a joint default judgment on the causes of action set forth in the complaint,in the sum of,which included an award of punitive damages for the fraud alleged in the complaint.on or about july,the court signed an affidavit of identity and order naming xtreme coach international corporation as a judgment debtor in the case.on or about august,plaintiffs,through counsel chavos,obtained a writ of possession,levied and seized at least one vehicle,registered in the name of peter goring,though goring was not a judgment debtor in the case litigated by chavos.xtreme coach did not own the vehicle levied,though the vehicle was on its premises.this levy cost the plaintiffs approximately.the court denied plaintiffs motion to quash a third party claim made by goring with reference to the ownership of the vehicle.
chavos left the buckner firm in december and established a new firm,chavos rau.chavos took the file of plaintiffs,however,according to court records,no substitution of attorney was ever filed until june,when substitution of attorney forms were filed indicating plaintiffs had hired their current counsel,michelle strickland.
fraudulent conveyance action 
on june,plaintiffs croucier and moody through attorney strickland filed a complaint against the individual defendants from the underlying business litigation,as well as peter goring,cheryl goring,and coach international corporation xtreme coach.among other causes of action,plaintiffs asserted a fraudulent conveyance occurred with regard to sun limousine and its assets.plaintiffs put forth the following factual allegations to support this cause of action the gorings operated xtreme coach at the same site sun limousine had occupied the individual defendants from the underlying business litigation transferred sun limousine to peter and cheryl goring for little to no value the gorings continue to operate xtreme coach for a profit,with the assets and capital acquired from the acquisition of sun limousine and xtreme coach utilized the same employees,equipment,and vendors as sun limousine.
plaintiffs suffered damages as a result of the fraudulent conveyance,including attorney fees,loss of credit,interest on borrowed money,the value of plaintiffs time in prosecuting this action,travel,and other incidental expenses 
simultaneously with the complaint,plaintiffs filed ex parte applications for a writ of attachment and injunctive relief with regard to the assets of xtreme coach and the gorings.croucier stated under oath that plaintiffs became aware sun limousine had been sold to peter goring in september.
malpractice action 
on august,plaintiffs croucier and moody represented by strickland filed the instant action against chavos,chavos rau,and the buckner firm.both the initial complaint and the first amended complaint include multiple causes of action,professional negligence,breach of fiduciary duty,and fraud,but the factual allegations all pertain to the representation of plaintiffs in the underlying business litigation.
plaintiffs alleged in their initial complaint that neither chavos nor the buckner firm conducted adequate postjudgment discovery to determine the status of xtreme coach,its relations to peter goring,how and why it was conducting business in the very location of sun manufacturers,the defendant in the underlying case,and the fact that xtreme coach was conducting the exact same business using the same employee manpower,the same tools and using the owners of sun limousines as their business management plaintiffs obtained new counsel in june,and she immediately began the collection process in the underlying business litigation,which led to the judgment debtor examinations which uncovered much of the information upon which this complaint is based.debtor examinations conducted from august through december developed an evidentiary record supporting the allegations in the fraudulent conveyance action,as well as possible alter ego allegations against the gorings.
the court granted a motion for judgment on the pleadings in september,with leave to amend,based on a statute of limitations defense.
plaintiffs first amended complaint omitted much of the specific factual detail included in the initial complaint.instead,plaintiffs more generally alleged that defendants were negligent in their representation of plaintiffs,by failing to diligently,timely and properly identify any and all persons and entities who competent lawyers similarly situated would have joined in underlying case as indispensable parties and seek and obtain equitable and legal remedies for declaratory relief,specific performance of existing contracts,constructive trusts and resulting trusts and sought and obtained timely marshaling and tracing of all potential underlying assets and sought and obtained rescission reformation of relevant purchase and sale arrangements concerning their assets and secured title to all of their purloined assets and timely and properly avoided transfers thereof to any alleged bona fide purchasers for value,setting aside any and all transfers to straws and agents and timely prosecuted any and all tort claims,and performed necessary adversary proceedings in bankruptcy courts to set aside any attempts by underlying defendants or their agents to declare plaintiffs as discharged creditors and secured any and all economic damages and penalties as lawyers of ordinary skill similarly situated would have accomplished in their stead,which,as of june,were no longer available to plaintiffs.
the court sustained a demurrer to the first amended complaint without leave to amend.the court then entered a judgment of dismissal as to chavos.
discussion 
we are presented with a single issue did the trial court properly apply section in sustaining chavos demurrer to the first amended complaint although the application of section often turns on the resolution of factual disputes,courts should sustain demurrers based on section in appropriate circumstances.see,rose hudson th,affirming dismissal gordon law offices of aguirre meyer th,affirming dismissal.
an action against an attorney for a wrongful act or omission,other than for actual fraud,arising in the performance of professional services shall be commenced within one year after the plaintiff discovers,or through the use of reasonable diligence should have discovered,the facts constituting the wrongful act or omission,or four years from the date of the wrongful act or omission,whichever occurs first i n no event shall the time for commencement of legal action exceed four years except that the period shall be tolled during the time that any of the following exist the plaintiff has not sustained actual injury.the attorney continues to represent the plaintiff regarding the specific subject matter in which the alleged wrongful act or omission occurred.code civ,subd.a,italics added.
thus,the limitations period is one year from actual or imputed discovery,or four years whichever is sooner,unless tolling applies.beal bank,ssb arter hadden,llp cal th.although the language of the statute is ambiguous on the point,t he tolling provisions of section apply to both the and the provisions.bennett mccall th,see gurkewitz haberman d.
plaintiffs filed their malpractice complaint in the instant case on august,clearly within any possible limitations period as the underlying business litigation began october.
with regard to whether the limitations period precludes plaintiffs action,there are three issues that must be addressed did plaintiffs discover chavos wrongful act s or omission s more than one year prior to august,if discovery occurred,was the statute of limitations tolled because the attorney s at issue continued to represent plaintiffs and if discovery occurred,was the statute of limitations tolled because plaintiffs had not sustained actual injury at the time they discovered chavos wrongful act 
tolling by continued representation 
the second question is easiest to answer,so we address it first.given the procedural posture of this case,the earliest the statute of limitations could be deemed to start running with regard to claims against chavos is june.this is the date on which plaintiffs current counsel,strickland,substituted into the underlying business litigation,replacing chavos as counsel of record.under section,subdivision a,the statute of limitations was tolled until chavos ceased to represent plaintiffs in the underlying business litigation.see beal bank,ssb arter hadden,llp,supra,cal th at the statute of limitations for attorney malpractice claims arising from a given matter is tolled for the duration of the attorney representation of the client in that matter lockton th.we may not look beyond the pleadings or judicially noticed documents to determine whether chavos representation of plaintiffs in the underlying business litigation ended earlier than june.
discovery of wrongful acts or omissions 
we turn to the first question when did plaintiffs discover chavos alleged wrongful acts and omissions it is well settled that the limitations period of section is triggered by the client discovery of the facts constituting the wrongful act or omission,not by his discovery that such facts constitute professional negligence,by discovery that a particular legal theory is applicable based on the known facts.it is irrelevant that the plaintiff is ignorant of his legal remedy or the legal theories underlying his cause of action.peregrine funding,sheppard mullin richter hampton llp th.
as of june,chavos had not succeeded in enforcing the judgment in the underlying business litigation.his only effort to do so backfired when peter goring succeeded in making a third party claim with regard to assets levied upon by chavos.plaintiffs hired strickland in june.she immediately filed an action against numerous parties for fraudulent conveyances and other torts with regard to assets that allegedly could have collected upon and began conducting postjudgment discovery in the underlying business litigation.these facts illustrate that plaintiffs were aware of alleged omissions by chavos in failing to take these same steps.plaintiffs discovered chavos wrongful acts and omissions by june,when strickland took over representation in the underlying business litigation and filed the fraudulent conveyance action.
tolling by lack of actual injury 
the final question is whether the statute of limitations was tolled from june through august because plaintiffs had not yet suffered as of june any actual injury under section,subdivision a.this statutory tolling provision is rooted in the required element of actual loss or damage in a professional negligence action.oasis west realty,llc goldman cal th.if the allegedly negligent conduct does not cause damage,it generates no cause of action in tort.citation.the mere breach of a professional duty,causing only nominal damages,speculative harm,or the threat of future harm not yet realized does not suffice to create a cause of action for negligence.ibid.d etermining when actual injury occurred is predominantly a factual inquiry.citations.when the material facts are undisputed,the trial court can resolve the matter as a question of law jordache enterprises,brobeck,phleger harrison cal th,jordache.
the test for actual injury under section is whether the plaintiff has sustained any damages compensable in an action against an attorney for a wrongful act or omission arising in the performance of professional services jordache,supra,cal th at.ordinarily,the client already has suffered damage when it discovers the attorney error.id.at.o nce the plaintiff suffers actual harm,neither difficulty in proving damages nor uncertainty as to their amount tolls the limitations period.id.at.there is no requirement that an adjudication or settlement must first confirm a causal nexus between the attorney error and the asserted injury.the determination of actual injury requires only a factual analysis of the claimed error and its consequences.the inquiry necessarily is more qualitative than quantitative because the fact of damage,rather than the amount,is the critical factor.ibid.
s ection,subdivision a,will not toll the limitations period once the client can plead damages that could establish a cause of action for legal malpractice.jordache,supra,cal th at.t he limitations period is not tolled after the plaintiff sustains actual injury even if the injury is,in some sense,remediable.citation.furthermore,the statutory scheme does not depend on the plaintiff recognizing actual injury.actual injury must be noticeable,but the language of the tolling provision does not require that it be noticed.foxborough van atta th.on the other hand,the statute of limitations will not run during the time the plaintiff can not bring a cause of action for damages from professional negligence because the plaintiff can not allege actual injury resulted from an attorney malpractice.jordache,at.
plaintiffs in this case claim the statute of limitations should have continued tolling until plaintiffs had evidence that the judgment was collectible at the time chavos committed malpractice,but not collectible after june.in other words,chavos acts and omissions may have been harmless if it turned out there wa
