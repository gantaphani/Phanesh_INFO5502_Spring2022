george lindstadt lindstadt has moved for a writ of habeas corpus pursuant to,challenging his conviction in new york supreme court,suffolk county,for the sexual abuse of his daughter.lindstadt challenges the conviction on the grounds a that his criminal trial counsel was constitutionally ineffective and b that the use of television to take the testimony of his old daughter violated his rights under the confrontation clause and that counsel failure to object to this arrangement was another instance of ineffectiveness.the united states district court for the eastern district of new york sifton,denied lindstadt motion,lindstadt keane,no.cps,and denied his pro se motion for reconsideration,lindstadt keane,no.cps may.
we agree with judge sifton that the televising of the child testimony did not under the circumstances violate lindstadt rights under the confrontation clause but we reverse nevertheless,and grant the writ,because lindstadt has established i that trial counsel errors,considered cumulatively,amounted to constitutional ineffectiveness,and ii that lindstadt was prejudiced by those errors.
lindstadt has served about eleven years of his to year sentence.he was convicted on the basis of testimony from his daughter and estranged wife,and on testimony from two experts.lindstadt testified in his own defense that he committed no abuse,and asserted that the allegations were fabricated by his embittered wife.
lindstadt claims that his lawyer at trial committed numerous errors serious enough to render the defense services constitutionally ineffective.we base our decision on the cumulative effect of four errors 
i defense counsel along with the judge and the prosecution failed to notice a error in the date of the alleged abuse.lindstadt wife and daughter testified that the first incident of abuse lindstadt was convicted on the basis of two incidents took place in december.it is now conceded that the first incident must have happened,if at all,in december.since the daughter account of the event reflects that lindstadt was at the time of the incident a member of the household doing cooking,bathing the child,present at night,and since lindstadt lived with his wife and daughter in december but not in december and can prove it,a lawyer who conducted an adequate investigation could have elicited testimony by lindstadt that he did not live with his daughter at the time of the alleged abuse,and in that way and others shaken the credibility of both key prosecution witnesses.
ii defense counsel made no effective challenge to the only physical evidence of sexual abuse.milton gordon testified that his observations of the child private parts confirmed that she was abused.this testimony was based on unnamed studies that were a not requested by defense counsel,b not produced by the prosecution,c never produced or usefully identified since,d essentially unchallenged at trial,and e controverted by other easily available,published studies.
iii defense counsel announced in his opening that,after the close of the state case,lindstadt and counsel would decide whether the prosecutors have proven their case,and only if they have made their case would lindstadt testify.lindstadt testimony in his own defense therefore became an implicit concession that the prosecutor had made its case.
iv defense counsel proffered testimony from two law enforcement witnesses that,before the daughter made allegations of abuse,lindstadt had attempted several times to put her husband in jail for a variety of alleged crimes.this testimony was essential to bolster lindstadt only defense that his wife had fabricated the allegations of abuse and coached the child to remember them.the testimony was excluded,however,after counsel failed to make the obvious relevance argument to the court.
because we find that these errors,in combination,fall outside the wide range of professionally competent assistance and that they prejudiced the defense,we conclude that lindstadt petition should be granted.strickland washington,d.
the government moved for an order allowing lindstadt daughter to testify via television.lindstadt counsel did not object,and the motion was granted.lindstadt contends that the trial court thereby violated his sixth amendment right to confront the witnesses against him,and that his counsel failure to object further demonstrates counsel ineffectiveness.we disagree.the trial court grant of the unopposed motion did not violate lindstadt rights,and the decision to acquiesce is not ineffective because the decision was supportable for tactical reasons.
background 
on june,suffolk county grand jury indicted lindstadt on one count of first degree rape,three counts of first degree sodomy,and one count of first degree sexual abuse.all counts involved lindstadt alleged abuse of his daughter.
motion for testimony 
before trial,the prosecution moved to have the child declared a vulnerable witness,pursuant to new york criminal procedure law,so that she could testify via television.in support of its motion,the prosecution cited five factors the alleged crimes were heinous sexual abuse of a girl the witness was nine years old the defendant was the witness father,and had lived previously with her in the same home the alleged abuse was part of a course of conduct over two years and according to a psychologist,the child would be vulnerable to psychological harm if called to testify in open court.the defense filed no opposition.justice not the trial judge granted the motion.
suffolk county trial 
the trial commenced on march,before justice weissman.the prosecution called four witnesses lindstadt wife his daughter don lewittes an expert child psychologist and milton gordon the doctor who examined the child.
lindstadt wife testified briefly that there was acrimony in her marriage that in april her daughter told her about sexual acts involving her father and that she immediately ordered lindstadt out of the house and took her daughter to child protective services.mistakenly,she testified that in december,the first alleged instance of abuse counts of the indictment,lindstadt lived with her and their daughter at fairfax drive in coram.as discussed later in some detail,the family did not live in coram in.
defense counsel mounted no useful,focusing instead on a curious series of questions,including a line of questioning concerning her name.lindstadt wife had several previous husbands and was apparently thought by counsel to have had an inordinate choice of last names.
the child testified as to the nature of the abuse.she too mistakenly testified that the first incident took place in december.on that occasion,lindstadt is alleged to have performed various sexual acts with his daughter,including intercourse.she testified that,on instructions from her father,she reported this to no one.the child testified to a second incident in march count of the indictment in which her father performed a sexual act on her until she stopped him.
lindstadt lawyer conducted a lengthy,limited by numerous objections sustained by the court.he did get out that the child rode horses and was active in gymnastics,activities he cited in his closing as alternative causes of the physical phenomena later described by the prosecution medical expert.
the prosecution then called a child psychologist,don lewittes,to explain why a child might conceal sexual abuse for years.lewittes described the effect of child abuse on the victim,specifically addressing sexual abuse syndrome,a form of post traumatic stress disorder.lewittes had never examined the child.defense counsel asked a single question on cross is lindstadt daughter your client it is not contended that more was required.
the next prosecution witness was milton gordon,the pediatrician who examined the child after her mother brought her to child protective services.the doctor gave her general medical history,followed by a discussion of the genital examination.gordon found no obvious signs of trauma bruising,swelling,her hymen was intact.the doctor did find bumps and clefts on the hymen at the two and three and extending down to the five positions,a phenomenon that he testified was consistent with sexual abuse.on cross examination,the doctor indicated that he arrived at this critical conclusion based on what he referenced as a boston study.
the doctor also discussed toluidine blue dye testing,which he claimed can disclose otherwise scarring of the genitalia.when gordon applied the dye,it indicated some scarring of the child posterior fourchette.the doctor testified that this is consistent with intrusion into or rubbing of the vaginal area due to sexual abuse.that conclusion was based on a review conducted by a mccaully from johns hopkins university.defense counsel tried to elicit an admission that the damage might have been caused by horseback riding,gymnastics,masturbation,or infection the doctor rejection of each of these alternative causes was based largely on the boston study and the mccaully review he had referenced earlier.with that,the prosecution rested.
the defense put two witnesses on the stand,george lindstadt and george lindstadt mother,and unsuccessfully proffered the testimony of two probation officers who had supervised lindstadt following his conviction for drunk driving.
lindstadt testified that he never engaged in sexual conduct with his daughter.he detailed the turmoil of his marriage,which he summarized as hell.as to the family finances,he testified that he and his wife had trouble paying the rent,were sometimes evicted,and moved often from dwelling to dwelling.lindstadt described a good relationship with his daughter,involving games,hiking,horseback riding,and the like.he testified that he regularly helped her with her bath,and that on one occasion helped to clean the girl private parts after he noticed her scratching at a mild infection.lindstadt also suggested that the sexual abuse allegations had been fabricated by his wife out of rancor,though the prosecution successfully objected to much of his testimony along these lines.
lindstadt mother testified that lindstadt relationship with his daughter was happy and appropriate.she also testified that lindstadt wife had attempted to cajole her into repeating any admissions lindstadt may have made to his mother.
defense counsel then attempted to call lindstadt two probation officers to testify as to their visits to the lindstadt household.the prosecutor objected on the ground of relevance.the trial judge decided to hear the testimony outside the presence of the jury before ruling on the motion.the two officers testified that as part of their supervision of lindstadt they observed the lindstadt household from february through the summer of.they testified to acrimony in the household,lindstadt animosity and vindictiveness toward her husband,and her refusal to help him with the basic tasks of supporting the household such as driving him to work when the terms of his probation prohibited him from doing so.significantly,they testified that,prior to the reporting of the sexual abuse,lindstadt wife repeatedly tried to convince the officers that lindstadt had violated his probation and should be put in jail.
defense counsel made several arguments in support of admissibility,but failed to make the obvious,pivotal argument the testimony would have corroborated lindstadt defense that his wife fabricated the sexual abuse.the trial judge precluded the testimony.
after the court delivered the jury charge,defense counsel asked for the first time that the jury be charged on lesser included offenses.the court rejected counsel requests,which were apparently read from a digest,and characterized counsel as thoroughly unprepared 
i would think in representing your client and as appropriate to the court as well,you should have a down charge request in writing before the charge i admonish you,sir,of that fact right now.this is the first time in years when this has occurred where down charges have been presented to me in the form wanted by their defense attorney.
the jury found george lindstadt guilty on counts,and one count of first degree rape and two counts of first degree sodomy concerning december,and on count first degree sodomy concerning april.the jury found lindstadt not guilty on count first degree sexual abuse.
state appeal 
with new counsel,lindstadt appealed to the appellate division challenging the trial court rulings that allowed the daughter testimony via television expert testimony on sexual abuse syndrome and gordon testimony.
the appellate division affirmed the judgment.as to the televising of the child testimony,the appellate court initially noted that the issue was unpreserved because no objection had been made,but ruled on the merits that no hearing was required because the prosecution submission was sufficient.lindstadt other claims were summarily rejected.
lindstadt subsequently moved in suffolk county court to vacate his conviction pursuant to new york criminal procedure law on the ground that trial counsel was ineffective.lindstadt cited the confusion over the date of the first incident,and explained that the error drew into question the testimony of his daughter and wife on the circumstances surrounding the offense.lindstadt also argued that the child testimony did not match her mother concerning the date and location of the fifth count.the motion further cited trial counsel failures to challenge the testimony,to challenge the admission of lewittes testimony,and to effectively gordon.the suffolk county court denied the motion on the ground that lindstadt received good and meaningful representation and blamed lindstadt for any chronological confusion in the evidence,as it was his obligation to advise his counsel.the court treated lindstadt motion as one seeking to raise newly discovered information,and denied it because lindstadt knew where he had lived over the years together with his family and the victim.
habeas petition 
lindstadt moved pro se for a writ of habeas corpus pursuant to on the grounds that he was denied his sixth amendment rights to confront witnesses and to enjoy effective assistance of counsel.the district court denied the writ.see lindstadt keane,no.cps,sifton,lindstadt keane,no.cps may,denying pro se motion for reconsideration.
the district court concluded that lindstadt confrontation clause claim was procedurally defaulted in state court,but went on to address and reject the claim on the merits.the court held that trial counsel errors with regard to the expert testimony did not amount to deprivation of a fundamentally fair trial.the court found that most of the trial decisions attributed by lindstadt to ineffectiveness could be attributed instead to litigation tactics and strategy.as to counsel failure to notice the error,and the ensuing confusions in the testimony of the prosecution witnesses,the district court considered that counsel performance may have fallen outside the wide range of professionally competent behavior,but that lindstadt failed to make the necessary showing of prejudice.lindstadt moved pro se for reconsideration,adding several affidavits in aid of his claims.this,too,was denied.
discussion 
ineffectiveness of.standard of habeas review 
lindstadt ineffectiveness of counsel claim was heard on the merits by way of his motion in the state appellate court.the supreme court has ruled that under the antiterrorism and effective death penalty act,codified at,
a writ may issue only if one of the following two conditions is adjudication resulted in a decision that was contrary to clearly established federal law,as determined by the supreme court of the united states,or involved an unreasonable application of clearly established federal law,as determined by the supreme court of the united states.under the contrary to clause,a federal habeas court may grant the writ if the state court arrives at a conclusion opposite to that reached by this court on a question of law or if the state court decides a case differently than this court has on a set of materially indistinguishable facts.under the unreasonable application clause,a federal habeas court may grant the writ if the state court identifies the correct governing legal principle from this court decisions but unreasonably applies that principle to the facts of the prisoner case.

the threshold question is whether the petitioner seeks to apply a rule of law that was clearly established at the time his conviction became final.id.at.in a petition for habeas relief alleging ineffective counsel,the question as to whether the matter is governed by existing supreme court precedent is easily answered because the merits of such claim s are squarely governed by the supreme court holding in strickland washington.id.citation omitted.
the state court decision denying lindstadt appeal on the basis of ineffective counsel does not reference strickland instead,it relies on a standard articulated in people baldi,t rial tactics which terminate unsuccessfully do not automatically indicate ineffectiveness.so long as the evidence,the law,and the circumstances of a particular case,viewed in totality and as of the time of the representation,reveal that the attorney provided meaningful representation,the constitutional requirement will have been met.citations omitted 
the standard applied by the state court is not diametrically different,opposite in character or nature,or mutually opposed to the standard articulated in strickland.williams.at internal quotation marks omitted.nor is lindstadt case governed by any case in which the court encountered a materially indistinguishable set of facts.see id.relief is appropriate therefore only if the state unreasonably applie d the governing legal principle to the facts of the prisoner case.id.at.
defense counsel errors 
the guarantee of counsel in criminal trials protects the fundamental right to a fair trial afforded by the sixth amendment.see strickland,at.to give substance to this right,counsel must be reasonably effective.see,mcmann richardson,d it has long been recognized that the right to counsel is the right to the effective assistance of counsel.citations omitted.
to demonstrate constitutional ineffectiveness,f irst,the defendant must show that counsel performance was deficient.strickland,at.to determine whether a counsel conduct is deficient,t he court must determine whether,in light of all of the circumstances,the identified acts or omissions were outside the wide range of professionally competent assistance.id.at.in gauging the deficiency,the court must be highly deferential,must consider all the circumstances,must make every effort to eliminate the distorting effects of hindsight,and must operate with a strong presumption that counsel conduct falls within the wide range of reasonable professional assistance id.at.
the strickland standard is rigorous,and the great majority of habeas petitions that allege constitutionally ineffective counsel founder on that standard.nonetheless,we count four errors made by lindstadt defense counsel that can be said to fall outside the wide range of professionally competent assistance.
we need not decide whether one or another or less than all of these four errors would suffice,because strickland directs us to look at the totality of the evidence before the judge or jury,keeping in mind that s ome errors have a pervasive effect on the inferences to be drawn from the evidence,altering the entire evidentiary picture id.at.we therefore consider these errors in the aggregate.see moore johnson,cir holding that court should examine cumulative effect of errors committed by counsel across both the trial and sentencing stouffer reynolds,cir taken alone,no one instance establishes deficient representation.however,cumulatively,each failure underscores a fundamental lack of formulation and direction in presenting a coherent defense.rodriguez hoke,cir dismissing case for failure to exhaust claims,but noting,s ince rodriguez claim of ineffective assistance of counsel can turn on the cumulative effect of all of counsel actions,all his allegations of ineffective assistance should be reviewed together.
the four errors are as follows 
i in her statement to the police,lindstadt daughter said that the first incident of abuse occurred when she was in the first grade,about december.the indictment repeats december as the date.she testified to this date at trial.so did lindstadt wife.in short,everything presented by the state indicated that the first four counts of abuse occurred in december.
the prosecution now concedes that this was an the abuse could not have occurred at the time specified in all the evidence introduced at trial.lindstadt daughter stated in her police report that the first abuse occurred at the family home located at fairfax drive,the town of coram.so too say the indictment,the child testimony,and the wife testimony.however,the lindstadts did not live at fairfax during december or anywhere else in coram.the government concedes that the alleged abuse must have occurred in december at fairfax drive.
the apparent explanation for this error is that though the child year academic year ended in,the december of her first grade year fell of course in.
the principal evidence against lindstadt was the testimony of his daughter and wife.both made the same error in dating the incident alleged in the first four counts.and though the prosecution now dates the incident in december,the child testimony fits the circumstantial details to the erroneous december date.an effective lawyer who worked out the chronology of the events could have argued convincingly that the child errors evidenced manipulative coaching by an adult.
lindstadt daughter testified that the residence in which she was abused had a second floor.but the residence at mother and child lived in no second floor.more important,the child testimony described the household at the time of the abuse as a conventional domestic household,with father,mother,and daughter living together.so,too,does her statement to the police.lindstadt wife testified similarly.in december,however,the defendant was living apart from his wife and daughter,lodging with his mother and sister,as they have both attested.the prosecution has not tried to explain these incongruities.
c ounsel has a duty to make reasonable investigations or to make a reasonable decision that makes particular investigations unnecessary.strickland,at.in williams washington,cir,a case of alleged sexual abuse of a child by her foster parent,counsel failure to investigate was held to constitute ineffective counsel where an investigation would have disclosed information bolstering his client credibility and information indicat ing that,given the layout of the home the alleged assault could not have taken place as claimed.see also williams.at holding that a failure to investigate and present mitigating evidence during sentencing hearing constituted ineffective assistance,even when doing so would have admitted some unfavorable evidence hart gomez,cir holding that failure to introduce evidence supporting defendant contention that sexual abuse could not have occurred under the circumstances alleged rendered counsel ineffective united states ex rel.williams brown,cir holding that counsel inadequate preparation for trial,including counsel failure to sufficiently consult with defendant,constituted ineffective counsel united states tucker,cir same.
if defense counsel had investigated the case and ascertained that the child was in the first grade in december rather than,lindstadt would have been able to demonstrate that the corroborative details in the child testimony concerning the first sexual father presence in her home cooking meals,bathing her and running the household her memory of him ascending the stairs of the home on the date of the the household in december when,as everyone now concedes,the assault did not take place and is incompatible with the family arrangements in december the month in which the assault is now alleged to have taken place,at which time mother and daughter lived in a house,and the defendant was residing apart from the pair,with his own parents.
counsel could have exploited these holes in the prosecution case to shake the testimony of the only percipient witnesses to argue that the mother was inventing impossible details and circumstances to suggest that the child has absorbed those misimpressions by coaching from her mother to elicit testimony from the defendant that he was not living with his wife and daughter when the daughter testified she was abused by her father and to gather the easily available corroborative testimony of the defendant mother and sister,with whom he was living at the critical time.
the information needed to accomplish these defense objectives was available from a variety of sources,including lindstadt himself and the police report.in fact,during defense counsel examination of lindstadt on unrelated points,lindstadt testified that,in early the family lived in ridge and then moved to middle island later in the year.
counsel errors prevented lindstadt from offering something akin to an alibi lindstadt was not living with his daughter in december.brown myers,cir taking it as given that a failure to adequately investigate alibi claim or witnesses constitutes ineffective counsel bryant scott,cir holding that a failure to adequately investigate alibi witnesses constitutes ineffective counsel nealy cabana,cir same noble kelly,d,holding that,in the absence of a strategic explanation,the failure to properly call an alibi witness constituted constitutionally ineffective counsel.for obvious reasons,there is no record evidence that lindstadt had access to the house or the child in december,when the offense is now said to have happened and if the prosecution had had an opportunity to augment its evidence to show parental access,no one can say what the particulars of that showing would be.
the prosecution emphasizes that defense counsel was not alone in failing to notice these errors,a point also made by the state appellate court and the district court.we do not think that the failure of others to notice establishes that the point is so subtle that an effective counsel would miss it.a trial judge has a full plate without undertaking an independent study of the facts on which the parties seem to agree.the prosecutor may though should not have other priorities.and it is understandable that the was being tried for child rape on the word of his own wife and distracted enough to leave the basics of his defense to his counsel.defense counsel investigating a case of child molestation should be expected to ascertain the child age at the time of the event,to consider the how many years elapsed before the trial testimony,to read the child prior statements closely,and to check school performance for signs of psychological trauma.these elementary steps would have uncovered the prosecution error.
ii defense counsel made no challenge to the only physical evidence that the prosecution introduced.the only physical evidence of abuse was the testimony of gordon,consisting of two observations i bumps and clefts on the child hymen and ii scarring of her posterior fourchette that became detectable when a special dye was applied.
the only link between the bumps and clefts identified by gordon and the sexual abuse charged against lindstadt was a boston study referenced during the doctor testimony.defense counsel never requested a copy of this study.it was not introduced into evidence.it was never referred to with any greater specificity than the boston study.lindstadt appellate counsel could not locate the study.the prosecutor admitted at oral argument before this court that the study is not in his file and that he has no knowledge of it.defense counsel therefore could not gordon about where or whether the study was published,who prepared it,whether it was peer reviewed,or even what it found.
we can not say that such would have been fruitful.but counsel failure to seek the study was an amazing dereliction.moreover,there is no evidence that defense counsel contacted an expert,either to testify or at least to educate counsel on the vagaries of abuse indicia.see generally beth townsend,defending the indefensible a primer to defending allegations of child abuse,it is difficult to imagine a child abuse case where the defense would not be aided by the assistance of an expert.such an expert could have brought to light a contemporaneous study,accepted for publication at the time of lindstadt trial,that found similar irregularities on the hymens of girls who were not abused.see john mccann et,genital findings in prepubertal girls selected for nonabuse a descriptive study,pediatrics,at see also townsend.at discussing studies that indicate the presence of clefts on the hymen of girls gardner,descriptive study of genital variation in healthy,nonabused premenarchal girls,pediatrics.
gordon linked the scarring to sexual abuse,relying on a review conducted by a doctor from johns hopkins,identified in the transcript apparently phonetically as mccaully.again,defense counsel did not request this material,nor was it introduced into evidence,nor was it referred to in detail.counsel had no way to test or evaluate the scientific basis of gordon assertions.gordon admitted that the study was based on someone else work,though it is unclear what that means.and again,lindstadt appellate counsel was able to locate contemporaneous studies that cast doubt on any link between i the scarring of the posterior fourchette disclosed by the toliudine dye test and ii sexual abuse.see david muram,child sexual abuse relationship between sexual act and genital findings,in child abuse and neglect teixeira,hymenal colposcopic examination in sexual offenses,am.forensic med.pathology see also dowd et,the interpretation of urogenital findings in children with straddle injuries,pediatric surgery,at.
in sum,defense counsel failure to consult an expert,failure to conduct any relevant research,and failure even to request copies of the underlying studies relied on by gordon contributed significantly to his ineffectiveness.see holsomback white,cir holding that failure to conduct adequate investigation into medical evidence of sexual abuse was ineffective knott mabry,cir noting that counsel may be found to be ineffective for failing to consult an expert where there is substantial contradiction in a given area of expertise,or where counsel is not sufficiently versed in a technical subject matter to conduct effective.tucker,at holding that,in complex fraud case,it should have been obvious to a competent lawyer that the assistance of an accountant was necessary.
the prosecution and the district court opinion point to the of gordon that defense counsel did conduct as evidence that his performance was satisfactory.this effort was hamstrung,however,by counsel lack of familiarity with the studies upon which gordon was presumably relying the effect was ruinous because gordon testified that the unidentified studies ruled out every theory of innocent injury such as horseback riding posited by the defense.
the two remaining errors of counsel,which bear upon the case presented by the defense,are less compelling and would not alone suffice.but when they are added to the first two,the cumulative weight of error convinces this court that the ineffectiveness of counsel reached the constitutional threshold.
iii lindstadt counsel announced in his opening that lindstadt was under no obligation to testify that,after hearing the state evidence,lindstadt and counsel would decide whether the prosecutors have proven their case and that,only if they have made their case,lindstadt would testify.emphasis added this gratuitous comment compelled lindstadt to pay a heavy price for the exercise of his constitutional right to give testimony in his defense by mounting the witness stand,he was conceding the prosecution had proven their case.and the only way a prosecutor can prove a case is beyond a reasonable doubt.see united states swanson,cir holding that o nce counsel told the jury that there was no reasonable doubt regarding his client identity as the perpetrator of the crime charged against him,he ceased to function as defense counsel.
in the circumstances of this case lindstadt was not defending on the basis of entrapment or insanity,for instance,the only tactical justification for such a statement would be a prior irrevocable decision by the defendant to avoid the stand.but
