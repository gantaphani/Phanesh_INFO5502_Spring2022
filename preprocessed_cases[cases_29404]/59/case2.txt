plaintiffs rosen construction ventures,and acropolis ventures,owned by clifford rosen,collectively,rosen filed a legal malpractice action against mintz,levin,cohn,ferris,glovsky and popeo,and two members of that firm,stephen leonard and stephen langer collectively,mintz levin.rosen alleges that mintz levin was negligent in drafting a contract between rosen and sand gravel,owned by mary collectively,or odsg,and in failing to properly advise rosen about certain easements it required on the property.
mintz levin moved for summary judgment in august,arguing that rosen claims were barred by the statute of limitations for legal malpractice actions.ch.in march,the district court denied that motion,holding that there was a disputed issue of fact about the duration of mintz levin representation of rosen.one year later,while discovery was ongoing,the massachusetts supreme judicial court decided lyons nutt,a case that clarified the continuing representation doctrine applicable to legal malpractice actions.
in february,mintz levin again moved for summary judgment,citing the lyons decision and evidence procured during discovery.in response,the district court held that t he issue is not when rosen thought that it might have a malpractice claim against mintz levin,but rather when it knew it was harmed as a result of mintz levin conduct.the district court then granted mintz levin second summary judgment motion,holding that rosen actually knew that its harm was the result of mintz levin conduct more than three years before it filed its malpractice action against mintz levin.
in evaluating rosen appeal from this summary judgment ruling,we must determine whether there is a genuine issue of fact regarding when rosen malpractice claim is,when rosen knew,or should have known,that mintz levin alleged malpractice was the source of rosen injuries.after reviewing the summary judgment record,we affirm in part and vacate in part the district court decision.
we set forth the background facts here,reserving some of the details until the discussion of the issues on appeal.in august of,rosen associates,a to this case and a separate entity controlled by clifford rosen,the owner of rosen construction ventures,agreed to purchase a parcel of land in everett,massachusetts from monsanto chemical company and another related entity.rosen intended to build a shopping center on this site,referenced by the parties as the development site.the development site was contaminated,and the remediation plan called for a deep layer of clean fill to be spread over the property.because rosen contracted for this remediation responsibility,it needed to obtain and store clean fill until it could be used on the development site.
who had access to significant quantities of clean fill,owned land close to the development site.it had purchased this property from boston edison the edison site for in cash and a million note the edison note.in early,rosen and negotiated an agreement relating to both the fill and certain aspects of the edison site.rosen retained mintz levin to draft a contract that memorialized the arrangement between rosen and.that written contract,which came to be known as the fill agreement,was dated april.
among other things,the fill agreement provided that would grant rosen a three year interest in the edison site as tenants in common,rosen could convert that temporary interest into a maximum permanent partial interest,depending on the extent to which rosen negotiated a reduction in the principal of the edison note,and would grant to rosen,upon rosen request,a perpetual easement on the edison site to allow rosen to construct road access to the development site.the portion of the fill agreement relevant to rosen rights to secure a permanent interest in the edison b reads as follows 
i f rosen,in its sole discretion,is able to negotiate with edison a forgiveness of,or a reduction in,the principal amount due in order to obtain a discharge of the edison mortgage,below,then rosen may retain,and shall not be required to reconvey to,that undivided percentage interest not to exceed in the edison site which is equal to x the amount of such principal forgiveness or reduction,divided by y two million dollars.for example,if rosen were to negotiate a principal reduction of,then rosen would be able to retain a undivided interest,and if rosen were to negotiate a principal reduction of,then rosen would be entitled to retain a undivided interest.
after signing the fill agreement in april,rosen began negotiating with boston edison for a reduction in the principal amount of the edison note.at that time,the principal payment schedule for the edison note called for monthly payments from may to september,payments in december and march and june,and a final payment in march.rosen attempted to secure at least partial forgiveness of the edison note in exchange for agreeing to purchase the electricity for the planned shopping center on the development site from boston edison.at one point,boston edison offered a reduction in the edison note,which rosen did not accept.in the end,rosen and boston edison never finalized a reduction in the outstanding edison note balance.
on april,almost one year after the fill agreement was signed,paid off the outstanding balance of the edison note and obtained a discharge of the mortgage on the edison site.the next day,verbally informed rosen of its actions.during the following week,advised rosen that,in its view,the full payment of the note terminated rosen right to acquire a permanent interest in the edison site under the fill agreement.
rosen disagreed with interpretation of the fill agreement,claiming that its right to obtain a permanent interest in the edison site had not been terminated and that prepayment of the note and its position on the issue were calculated to interfere with a right rosen had bargained for in good faith.responded that rosen position was preposterous and that decision to satisfy its obligations on the edison note at that time was permitted by the fill agreement.also wrote that n owhere is it stated that is prohibited from early satisfaction of our financial obligations.during april and june of,rosen and exchanged increasingly heated letters setting forth their respective positions,and eventually they reached an impasse.
in june,rosen asked mintz levin to draft a complaint for use in an impending civil action against,and mintz levin complied.when mintz levin would not agree to handle the case on a contingency fee basis,rosen consulted with boston attorney albert farrah,who agreed to take the case on contingency.rosen filed suit in massachusetts state court in november,alleging that of the edison note breached the fill agreement.in april,the state court granted motion for summary judgment.two months later,the massachusetts appeals court affirmed the summary judgment ruling.
following this adverse decision in its suit against,rosen claimed that mintz levin had been negligent in failing to draft the fill agreement to protect rosen right to secure a permanent interest in the edison site and in failing to timely secure an easement for rosen and perform sufficient due diligence regarding the status of an existing easement on the property.on october,rosen and mintz levin entered into a tolling and standstill agreement that tolled the statute of limitations for any claim of rosen against mintz levin that accrued after september.if rosen claims accrued prior to that date,they would be barred by the applicable massachusetts statute of limitations.
on january,rosen filed this legal malpractice action against mintz levin.in granting mintz levin summary judgment motion,the district court found that letters to rosen in april and june of were sufficient to apprise rosen,an experienced real estate developer,that conduct of mintz levin had caused rosen harm.further,the district court found that 
quite apart from mary april and june letters,and at least by september,rosen was aware that the interests could pay the balance of the edison note at any time the letters were merely a reminder to rosen of what it actually knew on september,rosen did not have an exclusive option to acquire a interest in the edison site,because the fill agreement did not grant rosen the exclusive right to pay the balance of the edison note.
finally,the district court also held that even though neither party devoted much argument to the easement question,t o the extent that there was appreciable harm as a result of the easement problems,the record demonstrates that rosen had actual knowledge of that harm prior to september.
rosen now appeals the district court grant of summary judgment for mintz levin.in rosen view,the summary judgment record does not compel a finding that it knew or should have known that mintz levin drafting of the fill agreement was the cause of its harm until at least the massachusetts state court rejected its lawsuit against.
we review the grant of summary judgment de novo.leblanc great am.ins,cir.summary judgment is proper when the record shows that the pleadings,depositions,answers to interrogatories and admissions on file together with the affidavits,if any,show that there is no genuine issue as to any material fact and that the moving party is entitled to judgment as matter of law.c.an issue is genuine if the evidence is such that a reasonable factfinder could return a verdict for the nonmoving party,and material facts are those that might affect the outcome of the suit under governing law.hayes douglas dynamics,cir quoting anderson liberty lobby,d.in assessing the summary judgment record,the facts,as well as the reasonable inferences that may be drawn from them,must be viewed in the light most favorable to the party.see,cooperman individual,cir.
rosen,the party here,pressed two legal malpractice claims against mintz levin.first,rosen claims that mintz levin negligently failed to draft the fill agreement to protect rosen right to secure a permanent interest in the edison site.second,rosen urges that mintz levin negligently advised rosen regarding its desire to obtain an easement on the edison site from.the parties agree correctly that the substantive law of massachusetts provides the rules of decision in this diversity case,pitts aerolite spe,and that massachusetts specifies a statute of limitations for legal malpractice claims.ch.under massachusetts law,the limitations period begins to run o nce a client or former client knows or reasonably should know that he or she has sustained appreciable harm as a result of the lawyer conduct williams ely.a plaintiff must have knowledge or sufficient notice that she was harmed,and knowledge or sufficient notice of what the cause of the harm was.bowen eli lilly,cited with approval in williams,at.
rosen malpractice allegation regarding its right to secure a permanent interest in the edison site 
the continuing representation doctrine 
at least by march,when mintz levin sent a letter to counsel asserting that rosen option to secure a permanent interest in the edison site survived prepayment of the edison note,rosen began spending time and money disputing interpretation of the fill agreement.rosen continued expending time and money to defend its claim under section b,which it now alleges was negligently drafted by mintz levin,throughout the summer and fall of.more letters were sent from counsel to,and rosen and its attorneys prepared to sue in state court.
for purposes of accrual of a legal malpractice claim,harm occurs when a client expends additional legal fees to ameliorate the harm caused by his original attorney error.levin berley,cir interpreting.see also cantu paul,massachusetts fletcher,tilton whipple.on these facts,there is no question that rosen suffered harm related to its rights under section b prior to september,the cutoff date under the tolling and standstill agreement.accordingly,we turn now to the causation component of the accrual analysis.
the critical inquiry here is when rosen knew,or reasonably should have known,that mintz levin alleged malpractice,and not purported breach,was the cause of rosen harm.williams,at.rosen claims that it should not reasonably have known at any time outside the statute of limitations period that mintz levin caused the harm because,in part,mintz levin itself led rosen to believe that it would prevail in its suit against.as evidence of this claim,rosen points to a letter mintz levin drafted in july to send to counsel,which included the following passage 
our client feels very strongly that he negotiated a valid agreement and that he deserves to reap the benefits of that negotiation.if need be,we are prepared to initiate and prosecute an action against for breach of the fill agreement and other related claims.we are confident that we will obtain the following preliminary and permanent relief rosen right to continued ownership,up to an undivided interest,in the boston edison site,with all attendant rights,notwithstanding payoff of the edison mortgage 
even though this letter ultimately was not sent to,it is probative of mintz levin representations to rosen regarding the strength of its case against.mintz levin supported rosen interpretation that had breached the fill agreement and rosen belief that,not mintz levin,was the source of its harm.
furthermore,defendant leonard,one of rosen primary lawyers at mintz levin,testified during his deposition that although the firm did not represent rosen in the litigation commenced against in state court in november,w e worked both with that other counsel farrah and with rosen directly in trying to resolve the dispute with.leonard further testified that during the fall of,mintz levin attorneys were rosen lawyers for the purpose of seeing whether we could memorialize a resolution of his dispute with.
these facts implicate the doctrine of continuing representation,which tolls the statute of limitations while the defendant attorney continues to represent the plaintiff cantu,at.the continuing representation doctrine recognizes that a person seeking professional assistance has a right to repose confidence in the professional ability and good faith,and realistically can not be expected to question and assess the techniques employed or the manner in which the services are rendered.murphy smith.thus explained,the continuing representation doctrine affirms the relevance of ongoing legal representation to the critical cause of action accrual rosen should have known that mintz levin alleged malpractice,and not purported breach,was the cause of rosen harm.mintz levin assurances that rosen would prevail in its suit against,and mintz levin participation in the preparation for that suit,are consistent with the innocent reliance that the continuing representation doctrine protects.
the factually apposite case of eck kellem,demonstrates the importance of the continuing representation doctrine to the outcome here in eck,plaintiffs brought a legal malpractice suit against kellem,the attorney who prepared the purchase and sale agreement in a real estate transaction in which the purchaser successfully sued eck for misrepresentations regarding the property.eck had instructed kellem to draft the purchase and sale agreement to protect eck from future claims by the purchaser for liability for hazardous waste contamination on the property.however,the purchaser did sue eck for the contamination,and eck chose another attorney to represent him because kellem would be a witness in the litigation.kellem,however,reassured both eck and his new attorney that eck would prevail at trial.this prediction did not prove lost at trial and then sued kellem for legal malpractice.kellem moved for summary judgment,arguing eck malpractice claim against him was time barred.
the massachusetts appeals court noted that t hese facts bring the case close to the doctrine of continuing representation.eck.at.it framed the question as whether it was the commencement of the purchaser suit,or the judgment therein,that was the first event reasonably likely to put eck on notice that kellem sale agreement may have caused his injury id.at.in finding that the statute of limitations began to run from the time of judgment,the eck court relied on kellem reassurances to eck that the purchase and sale agreement would protect him and that w hether,in fact,kellem was negligent in the preparation of the sale agreement had to await the outcome of the purchaser suit id.at.accord spilios cohen,holding that since it was only possible to determine whether there was legal malpractice after a verdict on the underlying dispute was rendered,the statute of limitations did not begin to run until that time.
rosen situation is similar to eck.mintz levin continued to assure rosen that it would prevail in its action against and that the fill agreement protected rosen rights.furthermore,rosen engaged another attorney,as did eck,for reasons unrelated to any dissatisfaction with mintz levin.until the massachusetts state court ruled that did not breach the fill agreement,rosen reasonably believed that,not mintz levin,was the cause of its harm 
to start the statute of limitations running,t here must be notice of a causal relationship between the harmful event attributed to the defendant and the harm suffered by the plaintiff.eck.at,internal citations omitted emphasis added.see also int l mobiles corroon ellis,notice here refers to discovery of the plaintiff injury as causally connected to the defendant negligence.emphasis added.the judgment of the massachusetts court provided rosen with notice of that causal relationship between mintz levin drafting of the fill agreement and the harm rosen suffered when prepaid the edison note.
knowledge of actual harm 
mintz levin argues that rosen is not protected by the continuing representation doctrine because rosen actually knew that it suffered appreciable harm because of mintz levin conduct.lyons nutt,the doctrine has no application where the client actually knows that he suffers appreciable harm as a result of his attorney conduct.the district court held that rosen indeed had actual knowledge that mintz levin caused its harm because letters in april and june of,setting forth its position regarding the interpretation of the fill agreement,at the very least called to rosen attention that the exclusivity provision it had desired was missing from the fill agreement and put rosen on notice that the conduct of mintz levin had caused rosen harm.
the district court further found that clifford rosen september,memorandum to file,stating that he understood that as with most loan s,she could prepay at anytime,indicates that rosen knew that it lacked the exclusive option to acquire a interest in the edison site because it lacked the exclusive option to reduce the edison note.on appeal,mintz levin seeks to bolster the district court grounds for the summary judgment ruling in its favor by drawing attention to four other items in the summary judgment record that,in its view,support the finding that rosen had actual knowledge of being harmed as well as of the cause of that harm.
for the sake of clarity in our explanation,we discuss these items in a slightly different order than mintz levin presented them.first,according to mintz levin,its draft complaint against did not include a cause of action for breach of section b of the fill agreement.second,mintz levin urges that the plain language of the fill agreement itself was sufficient to put rosen on notice that it lacked an exclusive option to secure a reduction in the edison note.third,donald anastasia,boston edison attorney who negotiated with rosen regarding the edison note,memorialized their may,conversation in handwritten notes that stated rosen concern o onnell pays off note soon,little left to discount.fourth,michael northrup,rosen counsel,stated in his deposition that he was concerned about ambiguities in the fill agreement and that mintz levin drafting of the fill agreement was sloppy.
we assess these four contentions in turn,keeping in mind our obligation to consider the facts,and their reasonable inferences,in the light most favorable to rosen,the party.we will then consider the grounds explicitly relied upon by the district court.
a.the draft complaint 
mintz levin points to its draft complaint against,which it discussed with rosen,and the draft omission of a cause of action against for breach of section b.mintz levin argues that this omission is significant because it shows that rosen understood at that time that did not breach its obligations under section b.reading the draft complaint as a whole,we find mintz levin argument unpersuasive.although count i of the draft complaint,titled breach of contract and action for specific performance,does not specifically allege breach of section b,the draft complaint contains several passages regarding section b that could reasonably lead a client to believe that his allegations of breach were addressed in the complaint.
for example,the draft complaint states that o n or about april,notwithstanding section b of the fill agreement,and without any notice to rosen,odsg paid off the outstanding balance due on the note and mortgage two years in advance of the scheduled final payment date of march,count ii of the draft complaint,alleging breach of the covenant of good faith and fair dealing,alleges that 
odsg actions,namely paying down the entire note and mortgage on the edison site in may,rather than march,as contemplated by the parties and according to the express schedule in the secured promissory note,and without the consent of or notice to rosen,the owner of the property as a tenant in common,with knowledge that rosen was actively negotiating a reduction or discount in the outstanding principal due on the mortgage with boston edison,has purportedly eliminated rosen right to retain an ownership interest in the edison site under the fill agreement.
by such conduct,odsg has breached the covenant of good faith and fair dealing.
similarly,count iii of the draft complaint,alleging intentional interference with advantageous business relations,characterized prepayment of the edison note as interfering with rosen right under section b to obtain a permanent interest in the edison site.count vi,seeking declaratory relief,asserts that rosen is entitled to retain an ownership interest in the edison site at the time reconveyance of its interest is triggered pursuant to the fill agreement on account of odsg breach of contract and breach of covenant of good faith and fair dealing in paying down the boston edison mortgage thereby purportedly preventing rosen from securing a reduced or discounted mortgage.finally,the draft complaint prayer for relief urges that rosen is entitled to retain an ownership interest in the edison site,in an amount to be determined at trial,on account of odsg breach of contract and breach of covenant of good faith and tortious interference with rosen business relationship in paying down the boston edison mortgage thereby preventing rosen from securing a reduced or discounted mortgage.
on the whole,mintz levin draft complaint characterizes prepayment of the edison note as a breach of duties to rosen imposed on it by section b.the absence of this language in the specific count alleging breach of contract is not sufficient to charge rosen with knowledge of mintz levin alleged malpractice in drafting section b.this is especially true since the affidavit of one of the defendants,stephen leonard,is the only statement in the record alleging that rosen discussed with mintz levin whether a count for breach of section b could be included in the draft complaint reading these facts and drawing inferences in the light most favorable to rosen,we find that the absence in the draft complaint of a specific count of breach of contract under section b is insufficient to charge rosen with actual knowledge that mintz levin alleged drafting error caused its harm,particularly because the draft complaint amply referenced obligations to rosen under section b.
language in the fill agreement 
we also are unpersuaded that the language in the fill agreement was sufficient to apprise rosen that it lacked the exclusive option to secure a permanent interest in the edison site by reducing the principal balance of the edison note.the relevant portion of section b states that if rosen,in its sole discretion,is able to negotiate with edison a forgiveness of,or a reduction in,the principal amount due in order to obtain a discharge of the edison mortgage it is a reasonable inference that a lay person,even an experienced real estate developer,may not have realized that this language failed to protect rosen right to secure a permanent interest in the edison site.
indeed,mintz levin draft complaint against supports rosen argument that it reasonably thought that section b of the fill agreement,as drafted,protected its right to secure a permanent interest in the edison site by negotiating a forgiveness of or a reduction in the principal amount of the edison note,even though the express language of section b does not prohibit from prepaying the balance of the edison note.in rosen view,its right to negotiate a reduction in the edison note in exchange for a permanent interest in the edison site implied that could not terminate that right at any time simply by paying off the principal balance with no warning to rosen.otherwise,rosen right to secure a permanent interest through the negotiations with edison would have little value.mintz levin articulated that view of the meaning of section b when it alleged in the draft complaint that the covenant of good faith and fair dealing precluded from paying off the edison note almost two years early.
on these facts,it is not enough to argue,as mintz levin does,that the express language of section b was sufficient to apprise rosen that it lacked the rights rosen thought it had negotiated,and that mintz levin drafting was the source of that exposure.rosen relied on mintz levin expertise to draft an agreement that would protect its ability to secure a permanent interest in the edison site.the attorney is an expert,and much of his work is done out of the client view.the client is not an expert he can not be expected to recognize professional negligence if he sees it,and he should not be expected to watch over the professional or to retain a second professional to do so.hendrickson sears.until the massachusetts state court told rosen that the express language of section b did not protect its right to secure a permanent interest in the edison site,rosen reasonably thought it was protected.in consequence,we decline to hold that the plain language of section b is enough to apprise rosen of mintz levin alleged negligence in drafting the agreement.
anastasia note 
donald anastasia note of may,a month after the fill agreement was executed,mentions his rosen concern o onnell pays off note soon,little left to discount.this notation also does not carry the import that mintz levin seeks.the notation is set forth on a sheet of paper covered with informal handwritten commentary by boston edison attorney about an array of subjects discussed during a phone conversation with rosen,all apparently related to the status of the shopping center project.the topics include an upcoming commission meeting,barging in the required fill,a physical on the railroad crossing,and rosen needs for meeting dpu criteria,which presumably refers to the massachusetts department of public utilities.on the top right hand corner of the page,inserted at an angle,is the note give him status june his concern o onnell pays off note soon,little left to discount.
the language mintz levin cites is ambiguous.on one view,it could simply refer to the payment schedule of edison note.if continued making payments on the note according to schedule,the balance on the note would be reduced to a million dollars by june,just over a year into the future.at that point,rosen would be precluded from obtaining the full ownership interest in the edison site it sought because there would be less than a million dollars to discount although other readings of anastasia note are possible,we decline to hold that a third party brief,ambiguous note recorded during a phone conversation with rosen proves that rosen had actual knowledge that mintz levin allegedly was negligent in drafting the fill agreement.
northrup testimony 
mintz levin claims that 
rosen counsel,michael northrup,analyzed section b of the fill agreement.he warned clifford rosen that the provision was inconsistent with the terms that clifford rosen had told northrup had been negotiated with.he told rosen that he thought that mintz,levin drafting of this part of the fill agreement had been sloppy.
although mintz levin cites primarily to northrup deposition testimony for these propositions,northrup testimony does not fully substantiate this characterization.during his deposition,when questioned about a proposed amendment to section b that he had drafted,northrup replied that 
my primary concern is,when i first saw section b and prepared the second amendment it was the fact that clifford had always told me his deal was that he had an ability to come in and get his in almost any scenario.when i read it i did think it expressly or clearly stated that.i do remember if prepayment was in my mind.i just generally did think it was fully developed as it should be to protect him.i do recall at this time all of the various concerns i might have had in particular.
when asked if he brought those concerns to rosen attention,northrup replied that i certainly engaged him in conversation about them,depending upon his patience and listening ability as to how many of them got to him,but i i emphasized one or two,i do remember for sure,but i would have tried to have a thorough discussion.when asked if he recalled having a particular conversation with rosen about paragraph b to the fill agreement as it related to mary ability to prepay the edison note and extinguish any right he had to obtain the interest in the edison site,northrup responded that he did not recall specifically that point.northrup testified that he characterized mintz levin drafting of section b as sloppy or that kind of language,and that he tried to deal with it in a letter to mintz levin,that is the particular issue of what if he negotiated a reduction in the note,but it did go into effect prior to such time as she started getting the note down below the million dollars,and how could it be that she still would have to pay and that he could retain his interest.
reading this testimony in the light most favorable to rosen,northrup testified that he had concerns about the drafting of section b,that he thought it was sloppy,and that he tried to address with mintz levin the specific issue of what would happen if rosen negotiated a reduction in the edison note that did not go into effect until after had paid down the outstanding balance to less than a million dollars.this concern could have been motivated by the quick pace of the regular payment schedule between and edison,which provided that the balance would fall below a million dollars in june,giving rosen little more than a year to achieve its permanent interest in the edison site through negotiating with edison.most importantly,however,northrup testified that he did not recall having a conversation with rosen about section b as it related to mary ability to prepay the edison note and extinguish any right he had to obtain the interest in the edison site.this testimony,then,read in the light most favorable to rosen,establishes that northrup did not recall a discussion with rosen about potential prepayment of the edison note and that northrup was unsure to what degree rosen heard and understood any of northrup general concerns about section b.this testimony is not enough to charge rosen with actual knowledge of mintz levin alleged malpractice.
e.the grounds cited by the district court 
finally,we turn to the two grounds relied upon by the district court for granting summary judgment in favor of mintz levin clifford rosen september memo to file,stating that he was under the understanding that as with most loan s,could prepay at anytime,and letters to rosen in april and june setting forth its interpretation of the fill agreement.the district court found that the letters were sufficient to apprise rosen that conduct of mintz levin had caused rosen harm and that they at the very least called to rosen attention that the exclusivity provision it had desired was missing from the fill agreement.the district court also found that lette
