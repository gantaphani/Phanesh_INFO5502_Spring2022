introduction 
sandra musser appeals from a judgment of the marin county superior court,following the entry of nonsuit against her for indemnity.she claims the trial court erred in ruling that she could not maintain an indemnity action against her former cocounsel following her settlement of a malpractice claim with their mutual client.specifically,she contends cocounsel are not barred from seeking equitable indemnity against one another where one counsel has associated another to assist in a particular aspect of the case,and the associated counsel commits malpractice in the course of that representation for which the associating counsel is held liable to the client.she further contends the court erred in ruling that her insurance company,which paid the damages claimed by the client,could not be subrogated to her indemnity cause of action against cocounsel the court erred in holding that musser settlement of the main action with the client barred her from seeking recovery of her fees and the costs incurred in representing the client as an element of damages in her indemnity action against cocounsel and the court erred in ruling that she could not prove as damages the insurance policy deductible which she paid to the client.
facts procedural background 
musser is an attorney who practices family law.she represented pam scott in divorce proceedings in.musser filed a petition for spousal and child support set to be heard on july.at that hearing,scott husband declared that he had filed for bankruptcy and the support hearing was continued.musser arranged for respondent douglas provencher,a bankruptcy specialist,to obtain relief from the automatic stay imposed by the bankruptcy court.provencher did not obtain relief from the stay,but advised musser that she could proceed with the hearing to set support.provencher advised musser that the support hearing would not violate the stay if the court did not enter the support order until after the stay was lifted.this advice was contrary to legal authority.musser asserts provencher did not even attempt to research the issue.acting on provencher advice,musser continued with the hearing,although the family law judge warned her she might be violating the automatic stay in so doing.
thereafter,mark scott appealed the grant of spousal and child support and in an unpublished opinion in re marriage of scott,the court of appeal reversed the support awards on the grounds they were void ab initio as the hearing setting support violated the automatic stay.
facing punitive damages for violation of the automatic stay,scott settled with her former husband for less than the original support order.she then sued musser for malpractice and breach of contract.musser against scott for attorney fees and costs.musser moved for summary judgment on the ground that scott had not sued the sole negligent party,provencher.the court denied musser summary judgment motion,finding musser was vicariously liable for provencher negligence.
musser requested that provencher and his insurance carrier contribute to a settlement offer to scott,but provencher refused.musser then filed a against provencher for indemnity and settled the case with scott.mark scott also filed a complaint against musser for her part in the violation of the automatic stay.musser again requested provencher and his insurer to contribute to a settlement but was again refused.musser then amended her against provencher to allege these additional damages,and settled with mark scott.
the settlements paid to pam and mark scott included of which was paid directly by musser as her insurance policy deductible and in waived legal fees and costs.in addition,musser and her insurer,home insurance company hereafter home spent in defending both malpractice actions 
musser first amended cross complaint for indemnity against provencher alleged three causes of action implied contractual indemnity,equitable indemnity,and tort of another.the first two sought as damages the money paid by musser and home and the in waived fees and costs the tort of another cause of action sought expended in defending the malpractice actions.provencher answered,raising several affirmative defenses,including that musser had violated code of civil procedure section in failing to join home as a party,since home paid all but the deductible toward the settlement and that musser had split her cause of action for waived fees because musser had failed to name provencher in her against scott for fees.he also raised statute of limitations defenses.in november,musser moved for summary adjudication as to several of provencher affirmative defenses.after hearing,judge gary thomas ruled that home was in essence a party to the action,and was authorized to sue in musser name that musser had not split her cause of action,as the same cause of action was not involved in musser fee action against scott and her indemnity action against provencher.the court also ruled that the action against provencher was not barred by res judicata or collateral estoppel for the same reason.the judge also ruled in favor of musser on the statute of limitations issue,finding the indemnity causes of action within the limitations period and that the tort of another cause of action was for malpractice,the statute of limitations for which was triggered by discovery so that triable issues of fact remained as to when musser discovered her actual harm.
by january,provencher was represented by new counsel and the case had been transferred to a new trial judge.in pretrial motions in limine,provencher moved to bar musser from seeking damages based on the settlements because home and not musser had paid the settlement.provencher also urged that musser had waived her claim for fees in the settlement and that the dismissal with prejudice following settlement barred musser fee and cost claim.finally,he argued that the action was in reality a legal malpractice action which could not be assigned to home.musser argued these issues had been decided in the summary adjudication motion and that the new motion was therefore an impermissible motion for reconsideration,made without new law or facts.
judge vernon smith ruled that the action was in fact a legal malpractice claim that could not be assigned to the insurer.therefore,musser could not introduce evidence of the settlements paid by home.judge smith further found that musser could not introduce evidence of fees and costs she had waived when she settled with scott and that the dismissal with prejudice following the settlement included those waived fees and costs.these rulings effectively struck all damage claims,except for the deductible paid by musser personally.thereafter,on april,the trial court granted a motion for nonsuit as to the deductible claim,preventing that damage claim from being presented to the jury.on october,following its grant of nonsuit on all musser claims,the court entered judgment against musser and in favor of provencher on musser.this timely appeal followed.
discussion 
a.the threshold question is whether cocounsel may sue each other for indemnity in these particular circumstances in this case being that musser hired provencher to assist with the bankruptcy aspect of the case,musser and not provencher was sued by their mutual client scott for malpractice to which both attorneys allegedly contributed,and that musser settled with scott.
numerous decided cases have addressed variations of the issue of when one attorney may sue another for malpractice or breach of fiduciary duty in connection with the representation of a mutual client.these cases have come to somewhat different conclusions.see,shaffery wilson,elser,moskowitz,edelman dicker th,d discussing cases in detail saunders weissburg aronson th,d kroll tract paris paris th,d pollack d.
one exception to the ordinary rules of implied equitable indemnity has been established a will not be permitted where an attorney sued for malpractice by a former client seeks indemnification from a successor attorney hired by the client to extricate him or her from the situation allegedly caused by the first attorney.citations.kroll tract paris paris,supra,at,d.the various public policy reasons supporting this exception have been pointed out in several cases among them are the threat of such a lawsuit by a client adversary impinges upon the individual loyalty of the second attorney in advising his client one consequence of such a is to preclude the second attorney from trying the lawsuit,thus depriving the party of the attorney of his choice the threat of such a results in the injection of undesirable reservations into the second attorney counseling role,thereby diminishing the quality of legal services received by the client and such lawsuits jeopardize the policy of encouraging confidence and preserving inviolate the relationship citation.kroll tract paris paris,supra,at,d.
musser contends that the policy reasons underlying the exception prohibiting predecessor attorneys from suing successor attorneys for indemnification do not apply to cocounsel seeking indemnification.musser relies primarily upon pollack lytle,supra,d.pollack and crouse brobeck,phleger harrison th,d crouse to support her argument.
in pollack,supra,d.the court considered an attorney duty to concurrent counsel.there,the plaintiff attorney pollack represented his client in a medical malpractice lawsuit on a contingency fee basis.the plaintiff associated the defendant attorney,lytle,as trial counsel,relying upon lytle false representations that he would obtain a qualified neurosurgeon to testify in the action in exchange for of pollack contingent fee.id.at.lytle did not properly prepare the case for trial.unaware of this,pollack and the client rejected a pretrial settlement offer.due to lytle conduct of the trial,the jury returned a defense verdict in the medical malpractice action.lytle then induced the client to sue pollack for legal malpractice.pollack sued lytle for breach of fiduciary duty,fraud,breach of contract,legal malpractice,and declaratory relief.the court of appeal,over a strong dissent,reversed the trial court sustaining of a demurrer.
the court of appeal held that pollack could maintain a suit for indemnity against lytle,concluding that simple agency principles governed the relationship of associate counsel in the circumstances presented.id.at.acknowledging the growing body of law which holds,as a matter of public policy,that a successor attorney owes no duty to his predecessor id.at,the majority found the policy rationale of those cases inapplicable to the role of associate counsel.the roles of successor and associate attorneys are decidedly different.in the fulfillment of his duty of undivided loyalty to the client,a successor attorney must view the client situation as of the moment when he is engaged.hence public policy requires that he not be subjected to any possible conflict of interest which may deter him from determining the best interests of the client by the possibility that he may be held liable for his acts by his predecessor.citation.in contrast,an associate attorney acting as the agent of the principal attorney replaces no one,but acts at the behest of his principal.admittedly,he remains bound to act in the best interests of the client,but this creates no unavoidable conflict.should he find that the principal attorney actions to date pose a potential danger to the client best interests,the is dutybound to make the fullest disclosure of these material facts to the principal attorney s hould the principal attorney choose to ignore the client interests,the remains free to terminate the agency relationship and withdraw as associate counsel.furthermore,the associate attorney duty to exercise reasonable professional care,skill and diligence on behalf of the client is precisely equivalent to the duty he owes his principal in dealing with the subject matter of the agency.accordingly,public policy considerations do not mandate that an associate remain free from liability for a breach of the duty owed to his principal.id.at.
the pollack court reasoned that h olding that an associate attorney owes no duty to anyone but the client would create the potential for a battle of wills over promotion of the client interests,a situation which could well rebound to the client detriment,for the determination of a client best interests is at best a subjective value judgment upon which reasonable minds could differ.moreover,in view of the principal attorney liability for the acts of subordinate counsel under the doctrine of respondeat superior,it would be manifestly unfair to relieve an of accountability to his principal.an application of agency principles to the relationship of an associate attorney with the principal attorney would entitle plaintiff to indemnification from defendant as to liability resulting from his tortious conduct.the right to indemnity is implied from the relationship of the parties.citations.absent the public policy considerations found in the relationship of attorneys,there is no reason to deny a principal attorney the benefit of indemnity.id.at.in sum,although the majority agreed that prior decisions precluded an implied duty to successor counsel for policy reasons,it concluded that the duty owed by associated counsel arose from the specific express agency relationship created by contract.consequently,the claim of a breach of fiduciary duty could be supported by a duty arising from the agency relationship.see mallen smith,legal malpractice ed.
in dissent,assigned justice barbara jean johnson warned that recognizing a duty between cocounsel would create unavoidable conflicts.pollack,supra,d at.dis.opn.of johnson.in terms of public policy rationale,i see no logical distinction that should be based on litigants status as cocounsel as opposed to successor counsel id.at.dis.opn.of johnson.regardless of context,the underlying rationale,that the possibility of a cause of action for indemnity in legal malpractice cases,whether sought against a predecessor or successor attorney,would create such potentially burdensome conflicts of interest for an attorney representing a client,public policy dictates that such a cause of action should be barred.id.at.dis.opn.of johnson.the potential for conflict is manifest.by recognizing a fiduciary duty between cocounsel the exposure of attorneys to liability is increased,thus placing them in an untenable position of divided loyalties to their clients and associated counsel.id.at.dis.opn.of johnson.nonrecognition of a duty to cocounsel may seem to impose a harsh burden on a wronged attorney.however,in balancing the interests of attorneys in protecting their fees and the public policy of protecting clients rights to receive the undivided loyalty of all counsel who represent them,the wiser course is to reject the recognition of a fiduciary duty between cocounsel.id.at.dis.opn.of johnson.
in crouse,supra,th,d,the court of appeal held that a successor law firm and partner sued for malpractice by a former client may seek indemnity from a predecessor attorney and firm who has also been sued by the client.the appellate court reasoned that the policy concerns underlying cases refusing to allow predecessor attorneys to seek equitable indemnity from successor attorneys that is,concerns that the threat of an indemnity suit against the subsequent attorney would create conflicts of interest for the subsequent attorney and difficult problems for him or her in protecting privileged communications and work product do not appear applicable when,as here,the subsequent attorney seeks equitable indemnity against the former attorney.the former attorney is not subject to any conflict of interest and has no continuing privileged communications or work product to protect.id.at,d.the crouse court distinguished munoz davis d.munoz in which the subsequent attorney tortfeasor was not allowed to seek indemnity from the original tortfeasor.in munoz,the original tortfeasor was the driver of a car involved in a collision in which the client,a passenger,had been injured.the attorney retained by the client failed to timely file an action against the original tortfeasor and was sued for malpractice by the client.in refusing to allow the attorney to seek indemnity from the original tortfeasor,the appellate court reasoned that the two were not jointly and severally liable for the same injury and it would not impose a duty on the original tortfeasor for harm resulting when the client legal claims were incompetently managed.munoz,supra,at.moreover,permitting indemnity for subsequent malpractice would create irreconcilable obligations for the original tortfeasor attorney who is obligated to protect the tortfeasor interest,but at the same time would be required to assure that the claim against the tortfeasor was competently managed or expose the tortfeasor to a subsequent indemnity claim from the victim attorney.id.at.the crouse court found munoz distinguishable on the ground that t he negligence of the original tortfeasor did not cause or contribute to the subsequent malpractice of the attorney,and because there was no nexus between the conduct of the original tortfeasor and the attorney there was no joint and several liability between them for the two distinct injuries.citations.crouse,supra,th at,d.in contrast,in crouse,the alleged negligence of the predecessor and successor law firms contributed to or solely caused the single injury to the client.ibid.the crouse court recognized a theoretical possibility that the former lawyers would have to protect their former client from malpractice by her new attorneys,but looked at the specific factual allegations involved to find no substantial ethical dilemma.a t least in the context of this case,we are not persuaded that the dilemma is sufficiently real to overcome the general principles of american motorcycle superior court cal d.id.at,d.
pollack and crouse were distinguished by the court in kroll tract paris paris,supra,th,d kroll tract.in kroll tract an insured company that had been sued successfully brought a legal malpractice action against the law firm retained by the company insurer subject to a reservation of rights kroll tract.the company did not sue its independently retained counsel paris paris although both firms actively participated in the defense of the company until just before trial when kroll tract took over.kroll tract against paris paris for equitable indemnity.the court of appeal affirmed an order dismissing the,rejecting plaintiff kroll tract claim that the policy reasons that preclude the first lawyer from against the successor lawyer are not present were two lawyers shared responsibility in the underlying action in which the client claims the malpractice occurred and where neither of the lawyers is representing the client in the malpractice action.id.at,d.the court reasoned that although the two counsel shared the common goal of defending the client in the underlying lawsuit,they filled separate roles.kroll tract was hired by the insurer who provided a defense under a reservation of rights,while paris paris,was the client personal counsel,and remained as counsel.id.at,d.the insurance defense attorney is placed in a position of conflict,however,when issues of coverage are asserted by the insurer through a reservation of rights since it is almost unavoidable that,in the course of investigating and preparing the insured defense to the third party action,the insured attorney will come across information relevant to a coverage or similar issue,it is quite difficult for an attorney beholden to the insurer to represent the insured where the insurer is reserving its rights regarding coverage citation.id.at,d.t he issues of undivided loyalty,tendencies,and the preservation of the privilege remain under these circumstances.id.at,d.rejecting the contention that because paris paris no longer represented the company,the cumis considerations no longer applied,the court observed that t he possibility that the interests of the insured may become adverse to those of the insurer,and thus to those of the insurer attorney is exactly the reason cumis counsel exists.see rowell transpacific life ins.d.id.at,d,italics added.the kroll tract court also expressed concern about the impact of allowing the indemnity on client confidences.the court observed that the client had expressly preserved the privilege as to paris paris by choosing not to sue it for malpractice.citation.if the indemnity action were allowed,paris paris would be unable to defend itself to the extent that its actions depended upon client communications id.at,d.
the appellate court in kroll tract distinguished pollack,supra,d,on the ground that pollack was decided on an agency theory the first attorney had hired the second to assist him with an expert witness in a medical malpractice case in return for a percentage of the first attorney contingency fee.thus,the second attorney had an agent duty to his principal.kroll tract,supra,at,d.
the court also noted that t he threat of an adversarial relationship and the concomitant conflict between the attorney duty to the client and his or her instincts is a significant factor when considering the applicability of the indemnity prohibition in diverse factual situations,more significant than the chronological relationship of the parties.id.at,fn,d,citing major clients agency diemer th,d in which the court held the same public policy considerations present in the subsequent attorney malpractice cases were applicable to the concurrent representation of a client by an agent and an attorney and barred the agent action against the client attorney for negligence because the agent was a potential adverse party on the issue of commission obligations by the client to the agent.id.at,d.
in distinguishing crouse,kroll tract contrasted the concurrent representation situation with the suit against the dissatisfied client former attorney in crouse.although the kroll tract court was not prepared to agree with the crouse court sweeping statement that the policy reasons prohibiting an indemnity claim by the predecessor attorney against the subsequent attorney do not apply to suit by the subsequent attorney against the former attorney,the court,nevertheless agreed that the particular facts in crouse showed there were no conflicting duties during the former attorney representation of the dissatisfied client,thus the court result was correct.id.at,fn,d.similarly,the court observed that although it agreed with the holding in major clients,we do not suggest that a for indemnity would never be allowed against an attorney involved in the concurrent representation of a joint client.ibid.
the kroll tract court would appear to advocate examination of the particular facts of the case to determine whether at the time of the concurrent representation,as well as thereafter,there were actual or potential conflicts in the duties or roles of the concurrent counsel which could present a conflict of interest,a potential for violation of privileged communications with the client,or a conflict between the attorney duty to the client and his or her instincts.
kroll tract was followed in shaffery wilson,elser,moskowitz,edelman dicker,supra,th,d shaffery.in that case,an insurer filed a malpractice action against an attorney it had hired,who unsuccessfully represented an insured in an employee action against the insured.that attorney filed a for indemnity against a second law firm also hired by the insurer to act as monitoring counsel in the underlying action.the court of appeal affirmed the trial court dismissal of the sued attorney indemnity action against the monitoring counsel following sustaining of a demurrer.the appellate court held the same policy considerations underlying the rule barring indemnity suits by former counsel against successor counsel on the same matter barred the lawyer hired by the insurer and sued by the insurer from seeking indemnity from the monitoring counsel.the court relied upon kroll tract,stating it is immaterial that,from one case to the next,the parties are not in precisely the same position as the parties in the other reported decisions.in substance if not in form,we find the case before us analytically indistinguishable from kroll tract paris paris,and conclude the result must be the same.id.at,d.
finally,in saunders weissburg aronson,supra,th,d saunders,the court held that a law firm associating with a second law firm to jointly represent the client hospital in contingency fee litigation against the medicare program could not sue the second firm for breach of fiduciary duty,fraud,negligence and other claims.the associated firm had alleged it was injured when,as a result of the second firm manipulation of the case and misrepresentations,the matter was settled for less than its true value,lessening the contingency fee the associated attorney would have received had the matter not been settled for less than it was worth.id.at,d.relying upon the line of cases holding that a successor attorney has no duty to his predecessor,the court found justice johnson dissenting opinion in pollack more soundly reasoned than the pollack majority.id.at,d.the saunders court reasoned that contrary to the distinction posited in pollack between concurrent counsel and successor counsel,the duty of both the associate and successor attorney is the same to serve the best interests of the client.id.at,d.the client interests must be protected from even the possibility of less than total devotion to his interests by the attorney of his choice.id.at,d,quoting pollack,supra,d at,fn.omitted.dis.opn.of johnson.
looking at the facts before it,the saunders court rejected the plaintiff attorney claim that the defendant firm duties to the client were precisely the same as its duty to cocounsel,so that it was faced with no conflict.the record indicated that the clients were satisfied with the defendant firm representation,but that plaintiff attorney was not.that surely indicates that recognition of a duty on the part of defendant firm to its cocounsel potentially conflicts with defendant firm duty to its clients of undivided loyalty and total devotion to their interests.indeed,the mason levy van bourg d.court envisioned just this situation in observing that public confidence in the legal system may be eroded by the spectacle of lawyers squabbling over the of a concluded lawsuit,even when the client has indicated no dissatisfaction with the outcome.mason levy van bourg,supra,d at.saunders,supra,at,d.
although the saunders court adopted the reasoning of justice johnson dissent in pollack,which would appear to embrace a rule barring all indemnity actions between cocounsel for alleged malpractice,neglect or breach of fiduciary duty arising from their concurrent representation of a client,saunders did not itself involve an indemnity claim.the client in saunders did not initiate an action against the suing counsel.rather,the case involved an independent action by associated attorney against cocounsel for the loss of fees expected by the associated counsel.plaintiff counsel was seeking nothing less than the recognition of a duty between cocounsel to do nothing during the course of representing the mutual client which might impact the other fee expectation.the facts in that case presented a manifest potential for conflict between counsel duty to the client and the asserted duty to cocounsel,should the court recognize such a duty 
we believe the facts of this case and the attendant policy concerns are more like those present in pollack and crouse than those presented by saunders,kroll tract or shaffery.as tempting as it may be to avoid a analysis of the potential conflicts which were raised in a particular concurrent representation in favor of a general rule,we believe that the concurrent representation situation presents a much less certain potential for conflict of interest than where predecessor counsel seeks indemnity from successor counsel.like the plaintiff attorney in pollack and crouse and unlike the plaintiff attorney in saunders,musser was sued by the client for malpractice.like the plaintiff in pollack,musser associated provencher to perform a particular and specialized role in the pursuit of the client interests and is seeking indemnity under usual principles of agency for the portion of damages allegedly caused by provencher malpractice and breach of fiduciary duty.unlike the relationships between cocounsel in saunders,kroll tract and shaffery,we can not see at any time during the joint representation of scott by musser and provencher that there was a real potential for conflict of interest between provencher duties to scott and his duties to musser.moreover,musser was sued not simply for her own asserted neglect in the case,but also under a respondeat superior theory for damages caused by provencher malpractice.it would appear extremely unjust to bar musser from seeking indemnity or contribution from provencher when musser was sued by scott for damages allegedly attributable to provencher tortious conduct,absent a real potential for conflict between provencher duty to scott and his duty to musser during the course of their joint representation or of a real impact upon confidentiality presented by musser indemnity action.we are convinced that confidentiality concerns are not affected here.
in kroll tract,the court was concerned that the priviledge would render the defendant lawfirm unable to defend itself to the extent its actions depended upon client privileges.it is true that in this case,as in kroll tract,the client did not sue the defendant attorney for malpractice.kroll tract held that by choosing not to sue the defendant attorney,the client in that case expressly preserved the privilege as to that firm.id.at,d.the appellate court refused to speculate on the intent of the client in making communications relevant to the joint representation where such communications were unrevealed to the court.consequently,that court rejected the plaintiff firm contention that such communication might be excluded from the privilege.id.at,d.
here,mussser asserts that scott has expressly waived her privilege with provencher,whom she had not sued,by expressly waiving these rights in her settlement with musser.the record supports this assertion insofar as this instant litigation against provencher is concerned.the settlement agreement and mutual release between scott and musser,executed in october,provides in relevant part that scott waives her privilege as to the dissolution files and that musser will have full access to those files before and during trial that scott family waives their privilege with the cooley godward firm,limited to the facts and circumstances under which provencher was initially retained and that scott will stipulate to allow a to be filed against provencher in the litigation and will cooperate with musser prosecution of the,including entering into a reasonable witness agreement in lieu of being subpoenaed for trial.at provencher deposition,taken in connection with this litigation,it was asserted that scott had waived the and work product privileges and doctrines solely as to your provencher initial retention and your work done on getting relief from the stay and the later motion for relief nunc pro tunc,and the following motion for reconsideration.but that your work on her bankruptcy estate,which is not germane to this action,that the privilege still is in effect.counsel for musser and provencher both acknowledged that that was correct 
therefore,it appears that scott has waived the privilege with respect to provencher representation of her in the bankruptcy portion of the dissolution action.insofar as she continues to assert the privilege in connection with her personal bankruptcy,the parties apparently agreed that that provencher representation of scott in her personal bankruptcy was not germane to this action.
in these circumstances we see no public policy that would be advanced by barring musser from maintaining this indemnity against provencher.
our conclusion that musser is not as a matter of law precluded from pursuing an equitable indemnity claim against provencher does not resolve this appeal.musser contends that the trial court also erred in ruling that home could not be subrogated to her indemnity cause of action against provencher.in the unusual circumstances of this case,we agree with musser that home was entitled to pursue its action to recover amounts it paid to settle and defend the scott action on musser behalf as musser subrogee.
it is the general rule in this state that legal malpractice claims are nonassignable and that subrogation is subject to the prohibition against assigning legal malpractice actions,fifield manor finston cal d,american casualty th,d fireman fund ins.mcdonald,hecht solberg th,d goodley wank wank,d.see mallen smith,supra,and cases cited fn.
goodley wank wank,supra,is the seminal case which articulates the policy considerations underlying the rule,which relate to the uniquely personal nature of the relationship.fireman fund ins.mcdonald,hecht solberg,supra,at,d kracht perrin,gartland doyle d.in goodley the client assigned her rights against her attorneys for their negligence in handling her divorce.the court held that important policy reasons preclude assignment of the client action for legal malpractice.it is the unique quality of legal services,the personal nature of the attorney duty to the client and the confidentiality of the relationship that invoke public policy considerations in our conclusion that malpractice claims should not be subject to assignment.goodley wank wank,supra,at.goodley noted the attorney owes a duty of undivided loyalty and diligence in representing the client.such duty is personally owed by the attorney and may not be delegated to others,and is owed solely to the client,the attorney one intended beneficiary.assignability would encourage commercialization of claims,and would force attorneys to defend themselves against persons to whom no duty was ever owed.moreover,the legal profession is debased by such commercialization,because it could encourage unjustified lawsuits generate increased malpractice lawsuits,burdening the profession,the court system and to the extent malpractice premiums would inevitably rise and be passed to the consumers the public and promote champerty.citation.assignability could conceivably reduce the public access to legal services,since the ever present threat of assignment by irresponsible clients seeking quick financial gain could cause lawyers to evaluate more selectively the desirability of representing a particular client.citation.kracht perrin,gartland doyle,supra,at.fireman fund ins.mcdonald,hecht solberg,supra,at,d.the policy considerations underlying the goodley decision usually have been persuasive for the courts that have considered the issue.mallen smith,supra,fn.omitted.
the foregoing policy concerns underpin the rule prohibiting a third party from succeeding to the client cause of action for legal malpractice against his or her former attorney.they have no application here,where the insurer is not seeking to succeed to the rights of the client against counsel,but to its insured attorney right to seek indemnity from cocounsel for the proportionate fault of the latter.
the rule against assignability and subrogation of legal malpractice actions should be contained by the context in which the rule of a third party including the client insurer attempting to succeed to the client legal malpractice action against the client former attorney.we decline to extend the rule beyond this context to prohibit an insurer from subrogating to the right of its insured attorney to bring an action for indemnity against a specialist associated by the attorney to provide assistance in representing the mutual client.
respondent relies upon fireman fund ins.mcdonald,hecht solberg,supra,th,d fireman fund in support of his argument that the rule against subrogation of legal malpractice claims applies here.in fireman fund,having been held liable to homeowners,developer clients sued their former law firm for legal malpractice and the clients insurers sought to assert a cause of action in subrogation.the court of appeal affirmed the dismissal of the insurers as plaintiffs,holding that legal malpractice claims are not assignable or subject to subrogation absent express statutory authorization.
the insurer subrogee argued that its interests were aligned or virtually identical with and indeed derivative of the insured client interests against the attorney.id.at,d.acknowledging that the insurer policy arguments have substance ibid,the court nevertheless pointed out that the prohibition on assignment was well settled ibid and explained that we are not the proper tribunal to depart from established law.id.at,d.california courts have consistently held legal malpractice claims are nonassignable to protect the integrity of the uniquely personal and confidential relationship.citations.further,under principles of stare decisis we are bound to follow the supreme court holding in fifield manor finston,supra,cal d,that absent express statutory authorization nonassignable claims are not subject to subrogation.auto equity sales,superior court cal d,fireman fund,supra,th at,d,fn.omitted.
again,a critical distinction from fireman fund is that musser the party to whose rights home is subrogating is not the client.the client,scott,has already sued musser for professional negligence,and that suit encompassed the negligence of provencher under a theory of respondeat superior.
fireman fund itself noted the rule allowing an insurer to be subrogated to a vicariously liable employer cause of action against an employee for recoupment.continental cas.phoenix const.co cal d.id.at,fn,d.however,it distinguished that situation on the facts,pointing out that the law firm defendant was not insured the plaintiff client subrogors employee and,moreover,in the homeowners action liability was imposed on insureds not vicariously under the doctrine of respondeat superior but instead for insureds own conduct ibid.
the situation distinguished in fireman fund is almost precisely the case here.musser the insured was in a real sense the employer of provencher.she hired him to provide bankruptcy advice to her in her representation of scott.she was sued by scott not only for her own alleged negligence,but also based upon the theory that she was liable for mistakes made by provencher.consequently,the client sought to impose liability on musser for provencher neglect vicariously under the doctrine of respondeat superior as well as for musser own conduct.
similarly,the supreme court in fifield manor finston,supra,cal d,the case relied upon by fireman fund for the proposition that claims which are not assignable are not subject to subrogation,also acknowledged the holding of continental cas.phoenix const,supra,cal d,that an employer insurer who had paid a judgment against the act of his employee was subrogated to the employer cause of action for recoupment against the employee or the employee insurer.cal d.id.at.the employer cause of action against the employee in such circumstances is based upon the breach of the servant duty to his master and is one for indemnification citations id.at.
we understand fireman fund reluctance to depart from settled law prohibiting assignment or subrogation of a client malpractice claim against counsel,even though the policy reasons underpinning the rule might not pertain in the factual setting before it.however,in the instant case,we do not believe we are departing from settled law.the subrogor in this case is not the client,but the defendant attorney held liable to the client for negligence at least partially attributable to the associated attorney.we do not believe the rule against assignment and subrogation was intended to operate in such circumstances.
the fireman fund court also rejected the contention that the rule against subrogation of a nonassignable claim should not apply to claims for indemnity or contribution against the attorney liable to the insured client.id.at,d.according to the court r egardless whether styled as a claim for subrogation,indemnity or contribution,the gravamen of insurers claim was legal malpractice as insureds actionable injury was allegedly the result of law firm professional negligence.citations.accordingly,insurer cause of action was barred by the rule against assignment of legal malpractice claims.citations.fireman fund,supra,th at,d see also,baum duckor,spradling metzger th,d.however,in fireman fund,the insured client right of action against the former counsel was for legal malpractice.
