background 
in,attorney brian trentman,a clair county assistant public defender,represented rodney woidtke in a trial for the murder of audrey cardenas.vincent lopinot was trentman supervising attorney.prior to and during woidtke trial,trentman also represented dale anderson,who later was deemed a suspect in cardenas murder.woidtke submits that trentman failed to investigate fully his claim of innocence.had a competent investigation been conducted,woidtke asserts,the attorney would have uncovered evidence supporting the view that anderson,not woidtke,had committed the murder of cardenas.woidtke was convicted of cardenas murder and sentenced to a term of years in prison.
trentman also undertook woidtke representation during his state proceedings from october until january.at that point,trentman withdrew from the case.on may,after woidtke had obtained new counsel,the appellate court of illinois issued a final mandate vacating his conviction and remanding the case for a new trial.woidtke was retried for cardenas murder,and on march,he was found not guilty.at the time of his release,woidtke had been incarcerated for twelve years.
on march,woidtke filed this action against the defendants,alleging that they were negligent in representing him.specifically,woidtke alleged that,by representing both woidtke and anderson,attorney trentman had a direct conflict of interest and that trentman had failed to present evidence at woidtke trial that would have established his innocence.woidtke also alleged that trentman,knowing there was a conflict of interest,nevertheless continued his representation in proceedings.woidtke further alleged that lopinot failed to supervise trentman and to take steps necessary to remedy the direct conflict of interest.
the defendants moved to dismiss woidtke complaint as under the relevant statute of limitations,ilcs,and statute of repose,ilcs c.attorney lopinot also asserted immunity under ilcs determination of policy or exercise of discretion and ilcs acts or omissions of another person.defendant clair county also contended that it could not be held liable under ilcs for the acts or omissions of its employees trentman and lopinot if the employees themselves were not held liable on november,the district court granted the defendants motion to dismiss woidtke complaint on the ground that it was barred by the statute of limitations.under ilcs,any action against a local entity or its employees must be commenced within one year from the date that the cause of action accrued.
in submitting their motion to dismiss,the defendants had taken the view that woidtke complaint was untimely because his cause of action accrued on may,when the illinois appellate court issued its final mandate vacating his conviction.because woidtke did not file suit within one year of that date,his claim was barred.woidtke,on the other hand,argued that his complaint was timely because his cause of action did not accrue until march,when he was found not guilty after a retrial.he contended that,because he had filed suit within one year of that date,he had complied with the statute of limitations.the district court,relying primarily upon griffin goldenhersh,d,determined that woidtke cause of action accrued on may,when the state appellate court issued its final mandate overturning woidtke conviction and remanding the case for a new trial if the state chose to pursue woidtke prosecution.at.the court reasoned that,as of may,all of the elements of woidtke cause of action were present.id.
discussiona.
woidtke does not dispute that he had one year from the date when his cause of action accrued to file suit against the defendants.see ilcs no civil action may be commenced in any court against a local entity or any of its employees for any injury unless it is commenced within one year from the date that the injury was received or the cause of action accrued.he submits,however,that the district court erred when it dismissed his complaint as because his cause of action did not accrue until march,when he was acquitted upon retrial.the defendants,on the other hand,maintain that the district court correctly determined that woidtke cause of action accrued on may,when the illinois appellate court issued its final mandate overturning his conviction.
we review de novo the district court decision to dismiss a complaint based on a statute of limitations defense.see perry sullivan,cir.in undertaking our review,we must accept as true all of plaintiff factual allegations and the reasonable inferences drawn from them.id.because the jurisdiction of the district court was based on diversity of citizenship,our task is to ascertain the substantive content of state law as it either has been determined by the highest court of the state or as it would be by that court if the present case were before it now.allstate ins.menards,cir.
under illinois law,a cause of action for legal malpractice accrues when the client discovers,or should have discovered,the facts establishing the elements of his cause of action.see profit mgmt.dev.group jacobson,brandvik anderson,d,kohler woollen,brown hawkins,d.the elements of a cause of action for attorney malpractice are an relationship a duty arising from that relationship a breach of that duty and actual damages or injury proximately caused by that breach.see sorenson law offices of theodore poehlmann,d,profit mgmt.dev.group,at.in the case of a malpractice action brought against a criminal defense attorney,the plaintiff has the additional burden of proving his innocence of the crime for which the defendant represented him.see moore owens,d,holding that a plaintiff must prove actual innocence in a malpractice action against his criminal defense counsel kramer dirksen,d,holding that a plaintiff must prove his own innocence before he may recover for his criminal defense attorney malpractice see also levine kling,cir holding that,under illinois law,a plaintiff suing his former criminal defense counsel must prove his own innocence and that a plaintiff is precluded from doing so if the conviction has not been overturned.
the supreme court of illinois has not addressed the issue of when a former criminal defendant cause of action for legal malpractice accrues against his former counsel.i n the absence of prevailing authority from the state highest court,federal courts ought to give great weight to the holdings of the state intermediate appellate courts and ought to deviate from those holdings only when there are persuasive indications that the highest court of the state would decide the case differently from the decision of the intermediate appellate court.allstate,at.
the illinois appellate court has addressed the issue on two separate occasions,once in johnson halloran,d,aff on other grounds,and again in griffin goldenhersh,d.in both johnson and griffin,the court determined that a former criminal defendant cause of action accrues against his former counsel for legal malpractice when his conviction is overturned.see griffin,at a cause of action accrues when the reviewing court gives a final mandate overturning the conviction that is not stayed pending an appeal to another court.j
