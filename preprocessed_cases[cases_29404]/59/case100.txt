facts and procedural history 
plaintiff,monica,sustained an injury on december,while working for jackson creek dental group jackson creek.plaintiff had arrived at work that morning and began turning on a bank of switches that controlled the lights and equipment in the office.when she turned on a switch that controlled an air compressor,plaintiff heard a loud bang like a shotgun going off and saw a little bolt of lightening come shooting out at her.she was zapped and knocked back into the closet area.
later that morning,plaintiff started perspiring,shaking and feeling sick.her head began aching and her vision blurred.plaintiff was taken to the hospital,where it was determined she had received second degree burns on the tips of her thumb and forefinger.while at the hospital,plaintiff hand began to swell and her leg became numb from the knee to the hip.she also noticed the ball of her foot was sore,and she could not bend the last three toes of her foot.
over the next several years,plaintiff was examined and treated by a number of medical doctors.the general consensus among the medical professionals was that,as a result of the incident,plaintiff developed a condition called reflex sympathetic dystrophy,also known as autonomic reflex dystrophy,or complex regional pain syndrome hereafter crps.crps has been described as pain out of proportion to the apparent injury or the physical findings,resulting from some noxious event,trauma,or some sort of binding like casting.it normally affects a region of the body and is accompanied by a continuous pain,frequently described as a burning pain,and the presence of hypersensitivity 
shortly after the incident,plaintiff was advised to see an attorney and called defendant.plaintiff met with an attorney employed by defendant,who advised her she had a workers compensation claim.defendant thereafter pursued the claim on plaintiff behalf.defendant never advised plaintiff she might have a viable personal injury claim against third parties.rather,sometime after the statute of limitations had run,defendant sole shareholder,harold miller,informed plaintiff the workers compensation insurer had investigated the matter and would not have paid benefits had there been third parties responsible for the incident.
defendant continued to represent plaintiff in the workers compensation matter until may,when she moved out of the area and hired a new attorney.at that time,plaintiff was informed defendant should have filed a personal injury claim on her behalf.plaintiff then initiated this legal malpractice action against defendant and harold miller,individually.
the matter went to trial,where the following facts were established regarding the incident and the possible responsibility of third parties,the ron ask began practicing dentistry in and later formed jackson creek.in,ask hired john matta to construct a square foot office building to house jackson creek and other tenants.d r electric was hired to do the electrical work.one of the tenant improvements put into the building for jackson creek was an air compressor to power the dental equipment.also installed was a bank of switches to control the lights and equipment in the dental office,including the compressor.
the plans for the building indicated the use of a compressor with amps of current and watts of power.the plans also showed a mag starter switch to be used with the compressor,but that notation had been crossed out.the wall switch that was installed to control power to the compressor was too small to do the job.it was not rated for a motor.
plaintiff theory at trial was that the undersized switch installed by d r electric,under the supervision of ask,in his capacity as a landlord,and john matta,allowed a condition to develop inside the switch that eventually triggered the event that caused plaintiff injuries.according to plaintiff,the defendant should have recognized she had a viable claim against those parties and taken steps to preserve her claim before the statute of limitations ran.defendant did not.defendant presented evidence that the incident could not have occurred as plaintiff reported and that she could not have been injured by the switch.
the jury returned a special verdict as follows defendant was negligent harold miller was not negligent third parties were negligent in connection with the incident that caused plaintiff injuries the negligence of those third parties proximately caused plaintiff injuries the negligence was apportioned percent to ask,percent to john matta,and percent to d r electric plaintiff suffered damages as a result of the negligence of third parties and the damages were economic and noneconomic.
defendant filed a motion for judgment notwithstanding the verdict,arguing plaintiff failed to present evidence that any judgment against third parties was collectible.defendant also moved for a new trial,arguing,among other things,there was no evidence of collectibility,the court erroneously instructed the jury on res ipsa loquitur,and the jury committed misconduct.finally,defendant moved to amend,or vacate,the judgment on the grounds plaintiff suffered no net damages and the trial court failed to deduct for workers compensation benefits received and attorney fees and costs plaintiff would have incurred in an action against the third parties.
the trial court granted defendant motion for judgment notwithstanding the verdict.the court also granted defendant motion for a new trial on the basis of the res ipsa loquitur instructions and jury misconduct.the court denied the motion to vacate,or amend,as moot.
plaintiff appeals both the judgment notwithstanding the verdict and the order granting a new trial.although plaintiff also appealed the judgment in favor of harold miller,individually,she has abandoned that portion of the appeal by raising no arguments in that regard.defendant from the order denying its motion to vacate the judgment.

the elements of a cause of action in tort for professional negligence are the duty of the professional to use such skill,prudence,and diligence as other members of his profession commonly possess and exercise a breach of that duty a proximate causal connection between the negligent conduct and the resulting injury and actual loss or damage resulting from the professional negligence.budd nixen cal d.this dispute concerns the third any loss suffered by plaintiff was proximately caused by defendant negligence.california follows the majority rule that a malpractice plaintiff must prove not only negligence on the part of his or her attorney but that careful management of the would have resulted in a favorable judgment and collection of same campbell magana d,italics added.
the trial court concluded that plaintiff failed to present any evidence of collectibility.in particular,the court noted there was no evidence of insurance,property with equity value,or other assets held by any of the third party defendants.
plaintiff contends defendant is estopped from arguing the jury improperly resolved the collectibility issue because defendant failed to request an instruction defining collectibility.the jury was instructed pursuant to baji as follows in order to recover damages from an attorney for negligence in the handling of a lawsuit,which negligence resulted in the plaintiff loss of the prior lawsuit,the plaintiff must establish.the attorney was negligent in the handling of the prior lawsuit.the proper handling of the prior lawsuit by the professional would have resulted in a collectible judgment.no further guidance was given.plaintiff argues that defendant is relying on a strict definition of collectibility,not presented to the jury,which requires proof of exactly how much of the verdict plaintiff could have collected.plaintiff further argues that defendant essentially hid the issue of collectibility from the plaintiff,the court and the jury until after a verdict was reached.
plaintiff does not dispute that the burden of raising and proving collectibility resided with her.it was an element of her case rather than an affirmative defense.campbell magana,supra,d at.campbell.hence,her argument that defendant somehow hid the issue holds no water.the question on appeal is whether plaintiff satisfied her burden of proof,whether there is substantial evidence in the record to support the jury implicit finding of collectibility.
before considering the evidence presented at trial,we shall explain what plaintiff was required to prove.in a handful of cases,the california appellate courts have addressed the notion of collectibility in a manner that allows for confusion as to its meaning.
in lally kuster cal,the plaintiff employed an attorney to collect an overdue note and mortgage,but the collection action was dismissed by the court over four and years later due to lack of diligent prosecution.regarding the plaintiff burden in the subsequent malpractice action,the state high court quoted from corpus juris as follows in a suit by a client against an attorney for negligence in conducting the collection of a claim,whereby the debt was lost,the burden rests on the former to allege and prove every fact essential to establish such liability.he must allege and prove that the claim was turned over to the attorney for collection that there was a failure to collect that this failure was due to the culpable neglect of the attorney,and that,but for such negligence,the debt could,or would,have been collected.hence,where a claim is alleged to have been lost by an attorney negligence,in order to recover more than nominal damages it must be shown that it was a valid subsisting debt,and that the debtor was solvent.id.at,quoting corpus juris attorney and client,italics added.
in feldesman mcgovern d,the plaintiff sued his attorney for failure to file a petition for discharge in bankruptcy.the court of appeal explained that the plaintiff in a malpractice action must prove the attorney proper performance would have resulted beneficially to the client.id.at.the court reiterated the language of lally requiring the plaintiff to prove that the debt could,or would,have been collected feldesman,at,and that the debtor was solvent and the judgment would have been collected id.at.
campbell magana,supra,d,involved attorney negligence in handling a lawsuit for the plaintiff.relying on both lally and feldesman,the court indicated that the plaintiff must prove that careful management of the suit would have resulted in recovery of a favorable judgment and collection of same campbell,at.in walker porter d.walker,the court cited campbell for the proposition that a malpractice plaintiff must prove that any judgment she could have obtained would have been collectible.walker,at.there,the trial court had not considered collectibility,having resolved the matter on other grounds.in reversing,and to justify returning the matter to the trial court for trial,the court of appeal noted,in passing,that appellant alleged collectibility in her complaint.she should be given the opportunity to prove it.implicitly it appears from the bare allegation that county is solvent county would be assumed to do business with a solvent contractor and,even as to appellant landlord,a complexion of some solvency is suggested,fn.omitted italics added.
in dipalma seldman th,d dipalma,an appeal challenging the trial court decision to grant a nonsuit on the ground that a judgment was not collectible,the court picked up on the complexion of some solvency language of walker,supra,d at page,and concluded that collectibility had been established by virtue of real estate owned,and mortgages held,by the parties against whom the plaintiff had a claim.dipalma,at,d.although the court chose to use the phrase from walker,in returning the matter for further trial,it also observed there was substantial evidence the defendants in the underlying action had assets available to satisfy the judgment dipalma,at,d.
as our survey of these cases demonstrates,a plaintiff in a malpractice action must prove he would have obtained a judgment in the underlying action and that the judgment,or some portion of it,could have been collected.some courts and commentators have,unfortunately as it turns out,employed the term solvent to describe a judgment debtor from whom a judgment could have been collected.and some have used the inexplicit phrase complexion of solvency when they mean that there was sufficient reason to believe that a plaintiff would be able to prove that the underlying judgment could have been collected when the matter was returned for trial.but these cases do not stand for the proposition that a malpractice plaintiff need only show solvency,as the word is used in the practice of accounting,or as it is defined in the dictionary,or a complexion of solvency in order to prevail in the malpractice action.the issue continues to be that which it has always been the plaintiff must prove that the underlying judgment could have been collected.
we have alluded to cases where a plaintiff could not prove that he could have collected the full amount of the underlying judgment but only a portion thereof.his damages in the malpractice action are then limited to that portion of the underlying judgment he could have collected.this is consistent with the fundamental principle of tort law that a plaintiff claiming negligence must prove causation.as in other negligence actions,an attorney who fails to exercise due care in the handling of a client affairs is liable for all damages directly and proximately caused by his negligence.pete henderson d.the attorney negligence causes the plaintiff to lose only that portion of the underlying judgment that could have been collected.
in mcdow dixon,the georgia court repeated the common refrain that a malpractice plaintiff must prove solvency of the debtor.however,the court explained that this requirement is simply an application of the doctrine,everywhere recognized,that a party claiming damages must prove not only the wrong,but the amount of his damages as well.id.at.the court continued a client suing his attorney for malpractice not only must prove that his claim was valid and would have resulted in a judgment in his favor,but also that said judgment
