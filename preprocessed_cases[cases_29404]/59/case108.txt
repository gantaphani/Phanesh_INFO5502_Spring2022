in this case we hold public policy considerations do not bar a suit for indemnity by an accountant against a lawyer who represented the same client at the same time,where the client originally sued both lawyer and accountant for malpractice but the client malpractice suit against the lawyer was barred by the statute of limitations.therefore we reverse the trial court order sustaining respondents demurrer without leave to amend.
facts and proceedings below 
this case arises out of divorce litigation between deborah pratt and don bellisario,who were married in june.bellisario is a successful writer,creator,producer and director of many television shows including magnum pi,airwolf,and quantum leap.pratt filed for dissolution of marriage on september,and retained respondent wasser,rosenson carter as her counsel in.the wasser firm negotiated a marital settlement agreement on pratt behalf,which was signed on october.a judgment of dissolution of marriage status only was entered on october,and a further judgment of dissolution of marriage on reserved issues was entered on october.the wasser firm withdrew as counsel for pratt in december.
after the wasser firm withdrew as her counsel,pratt discovered bellisario had failed to disclose significant community property assets including certificates of deposit,individual retirement accounts,pension plans,and fees relating to the quantum leap television program.she filed a motion to set aside the judgment of dissolution on reserved issues,contending she signed the marital settlement agreement because of bellisario fraud.the motion was supported by a declaration from pratt business manager regarding the undisclosed assets.the family court denied the motion,observing pratt remedy was a malpractice action against her former counsel and accountants.
pratt filed a malpractice action against the wasser firm and three of its members on april.wasser successfully moved to compel arbitration,and on july,the arbitrator jerry fields,judge of the superior court,retired ruled in favor of wasser based on the statute of limitations.
pratt also sued gursey,schneider and two of its employees,michael miskei and david cantor,who had been employed as forensic accountants in connection with her dissolution action.miskei represented pratt at a meeting of pratt and bellisario accountants,during which they reached agreement on the primary financial issues in the dissolution case.after pratt malpractice action was ordered to arbitration,the arbitrator found the gursey defendants failed to adequately review bellisario financial records,and although they did not review the records and had failed to inform pratt of said fact,they not only allowed pratt to settle her dissolution action with don bellisario,but encouraged her to do so indicating that it was the best she could do even in a trial.the arbitrator awarded pratt the sum of against defendants gursey,schneider,llp,michael miskei,and david cantor jointly and severally.
on december,gursey,miskei and cantor filed suit against the wasser firm and the individual respondents seeking equitable indemnity,declaratory relief,and apportionment in connection with the arbitration award against gursey and in favor of pratt.
wasser demurred to the complaint,arguing public policy bars equitable indemnity claims against attorneys by.gursey opposed the demurrer on the ground it was an intended beneficiary of the attorneys legal services.the trial court sustained the demurrer without leave to amend.in so doing,it relied on major clients agency diemer in which the court of appeal discussed public policy considerations surrounding the relationship,and held an entertainment agent could not maintain a suit against the client attorneys gursey timely appealed from the resulting judgment,and we now reverse the trial court ruling sustaining the demurrer.
discussion 
public policy considerations do not bar gursey indemnity action against wasser.
we review de novo the trial court order sustaining the demurrer.an appeal from a judgment entered after the sustaining of a demurrer without leave to amend presents anew the question whether it appears that the plaintiff is entitled to any relief at the hands of the court against the defendants,which is a pure question of law citations.we construe the allegations of the complaint liberally with a view to substantial justice between the parties.citations.in other words,the complaint is reviewed de novo to determine whether it contains sufficient facts to state a cause of action.citation.in doing so,we accept as true the properly pleaded material factual allegations of the complaint,together with facts that may be properly judicially noticed.for purposes of the demurrer at issue here,gursey has adequately alleged wasser partial responsibility for the harm suffered by pratt.however respondents argue,and the trial court agreed,public policy considerations nevertheless bar gursey claim for indemnity.
ordinarily,the equitable indemnity rule established in american motorcycle superior would permit a concurrent tortfeasor gursey to obtain partial indemnity from another concurrent tortfeasor wasser on a comparative fault basis.however,many california courts have held suits for partial equitable indemnity against lawyers are a different matter,based on public policy considerations which bar such lawsuits in certain circumstances the question in this case is whether these same public policy considerations,or some form of them,likewise apply to prevent gursey suit.we hold they do not.
a.the majority rule among california courts of appeal precludes an indemnity suit by a lawyer against another lawyer,where such a suit would create a conflict of interest or interfere with an existing relationship.
in its tentative ruling,which it ultimately adopted as its final ruling on wasser demurrer,the trial court stated third parties may generally not pursue equitable indemnity and negligence claims against attorneys as a matter of law and public policy.citation.the policy for such preclusion under the law is that such third party actions arising out of an attorney malpractice may threaten the attorney undivided loyalty to the client.citation.while the general rule and most cases concern attorney indemnity and negligence claims against predecessor attorneys who represented the same client,the rule has been extended to.citation.as will be explained below,the rule is not as broad as the trial court suggested in this statement.nor does the rule or its underlying policies apply to the allegations in appellant complaint.
although the california supreme court has not spoken on the issue,according to the majority of court of appeal decisions in california,a lawyer sued by a former client for professional negligence can not seek indemnity from a successor lawyer,subsequently retained by the client most of the california cases announcing the rule involve facts where the public policy is strongest against allowing indemnity actions for example,in goldfisher superior court the two law firms provided serial representation to the same client in the same matter.law firm i mishandled the case,and the client replaced it with law firm ii.the client directed law firm ii to sue law firm i for malpractice,and law firm i filed a for indemnity against law firm ii the court,following a line of similar cases held to encourage claims of indemnification where two lawyers successively represented the same client is not for the benefit of the client.differences between lawyer and client respecting malpractice should be limited to themselves.the facts which generally germinate the relief sought at bench are pregnant with the seed of exacerbated conflict.the inevitable consequence is a corrosion of the sacred attributes of complete confidentiality and undivided loyalty which are the heart of the relationship between lawyer and client.it is our considered judgment the potential damage involved is grave and inevitable.on balance any loss of an asserted right is of small consequence when measured against the public interest.
certainly in cases like goldfisher,there is a real conflict on the part of law firm ii.in filing litigating and potentially settling the legal malpractice law firm i,law firm ii must be mindful it may be compelled to contribute some of its own money to the verdict or settlement being sought on behalf of an existing client.in such a case,there indisputably is an actual and existing conflict because the more law firm ii wins for the client,the greater the firm own potential exposure in the indemnity action.moreover,in many cases law firm i may be using the indemnity suit as a tactic to disqualify law firm ii from prosecuting the malpractice case against law firm i,thereby denying the client his or her counsel of choice in the malpractice action.finally,the confidentiality of the client communications with law firm ii,before and even after it filed the malpractice suit against law firm i,may be compromised.the public policy concerns are obvious in these cases where the malpractice defendant,law firm i,pursues an indemnity action against the firm representing the plaintiff in the malpractice case,law firm ii.however,a handful of california cases have extended the attorney public policy exception beyond this classic scenario.
in kroll tract paris paris,the court of appeal held the attorney public policy exception was properly extended to bar an indemnity between two law firms who had concurrently represented the dissatisfied client,firm i as independant cumis counsel pursuant to a reservation of rights by the client insurer and firm ii as insurance defense counsel the two firms represented the client concurrently,until firm i asked firm ii to take on the full defense just days before trial the client lost the lawsuit and sued firm ii for malpractice.firm ii against firm i for equitable indemnity the court of appeal held the trial court correctly sustained firm i demurrer to firm ii,citing the public policy reasons underlying the attorney public policy exception.the court gave particular weight to the importance of protecting confidential communications it held the client expressly preserved the privilege as to firm i by choosing not to sue it for malpractice,thus if the indemnity action were allowed,firm i would be unable to defend itself to the extent that its actions depended on client communications.accordingly,the indemnity action was barred.the court noted,however,its decision would not cause firm ii to pay more than its fair share of malpractice damages,because even without the indemnity,firm ii can show the negligence of firm i was the cause of the client injury through the affirmative defense of comparative negligence,thereby reducing any liability it may have.in contrast,the arbitrator in the present case specifically disallowed this defense and found gursey liable for all of the client malpractice damages,even while conceding wasser negligence contributed to the damages moreover,even though it did not permit the indemnity action to proceed on the facts before it,the court recognized the necessity for analyzing the public policy issues based on the facts of each particular case,stating we do not suggest that a for indemnity would never be allowed against an attorney involved in the concurrent representation of a joint client.
another appellate decision applied the attorney public policy exception to prevent an indemnity suit by a third party against a law firm.in rowell transpacific life ins,an insured sued its insurer for bad faith.the insurer sought indemnity from the lawyer who had represented the insured in the underlying litigation over the insurance claim and was also representing him in the bad faith action.in its indemnity action the insured argued,inter alia,the lawyer delay in pursuing the claim exacerbated the damage caused by its own delay the court held the indemnity action could not proceed.the policy rationale for precluding such a suit was the same as in the classic law firm i law firm ii cases.once again,the effect of allowing the indemnity suit would have been to drive a wedge between the client and the client current lawyer in their bad faith action against the insurance company.the court held in such a situation,the potential of conflict between the client best interest and the course which the lawyer must take to minimize his own exposure to a from the adversary is untenable in view of the lawyer duty of undivided loyalty to his or her client.
in major clients agency diemer the case relied on by the trial court herein,the court refused to permit a suit by a agent against the lawyer.respondents and the dissent herein construe major clients as yet another extension of the attorney public policy exception to the general rule permitting equitable indemnity.however,as explained below,major clients is not an equitable indemnity case and does not support the trial court ruling.
public policy considerations do not bar an indemnity suit between lawyers who jointly represented the same client in the same matter,where neither lawyer still represents the client at the time of the indemnity suit.
the present case is readily distinguishable from those relied upon by wasser and by the trial court.in major clients agency diemer the case relied upon most heavily by the trial court and the dissent herein,the agent sought compensation for damages he himself suffered in the form of a reduced commission,rather than indemnity for the client damages caused by the lawyer and agent joint malpractice.moreover,as we have seen,the facts of the present case are vastly different from the law firm i sues law firm ii while law firm ii is still representing client fact pattern seen in cases such as goldfisher the present case arose out of a joint malpractice suit by pratt against both gursey and wasser,both of whom jointly represented pratt in the underlying action,and neither of whom still represented her at the time of gursey indemnity action.accordingly,neither confidentiality nor loyalty concerns are sufficiently compelling to bar gursey indemnity action against wasser.
gursey indemnity action is not barred by considerations of confidentiality.
one of the policies underlying the general rule against indemnity in the law firm i law firm ii scenario is the importance of protecting confidentiality.this policy of confidentiality is embodied in the privilege,which protects from disclosure a confidential communication between client and lawyer.there can be no doubt this policy is a venerable and important one.in mitchell superior court,the california supreme court held while it is perhaps somewhat of a hyperbole to refer to the privilege as sacred,it is clearly one which our judicial system has carefully safeguarded with only a few specific exceptions.
one of these few specific exceptions is codified in evidence code section,which provides there is no privilege under this article as to a communication relevant to an issue of breach,by the lawyer or by the client,of a duty arising out of the relationship.generally,a client who sues his or her lawyer for legal malpractice waives the privilege by doing so,thus enabling the defendant lawyer to disclose,to the extent necessary to defend against the action,information otherwise protected by the privilege 
in the law firm i law firm ii indemnity scenario the two law firms represented the client in successive stages of a case.by the time the second law firm is employed the first law firm already has committed its alleged malpractice and completed its representation of the client.indeed the second lawyer usually is hired in an attempt to minimize the damages the client suffers from the first lawyer malpractice.because they are involved in completely different phases of the case,the client confidential communications with law firm i are not intertwined with his confidential communications with law firm ii.accordingly,when the client hires law firm ii to sue law firm i,he only waives the privilege as to those communications he had with law firm i during the phase of the underlying case during which he was represented by law firm i.according to the rationale of the majority california rule,allowing law firm i to pursue an indemnity action against law firm ii would place firm ii in an untenable situation.the client has not sued law firm ii for malpractice and therefore has not waived the privilege as to the phase of the underlying litigation during which law firm ii provided representation.therefore law firm ii can not defend the indemnity lawsuit without divulging privileged client communications or obtaining an express waiver from the client.furthermore,since law firm ii is representing the client in the malpractice case against law firm i,the indemnity suit might also open up communications between the client and law firm ii related to the pursuit of the malpractice action,communications once again law firm ii could not reveal without obtaining an express waiver from the client.this is a dilemma law firm ii and the client should not be forced to confront.in such a situation,the indemnity lawsuit is barred,based in part on the important public policy of preserving confidences 
however,the policy of protecting confidentiality is not implicated in the present case.here the client,pratt,employed gursey and wasser to work together on the same case.this was not successive but concurrent representation in the same matter.the confidential communications the client made to her representatives during that single litigation were so interrelated the client waiver as to one constitutes a waiver as to both.moreover,in this particular case,pratt sued both gursey and wasser for malpractice,thereby explicitly waiving the privilege as to her communications with both of them as to matters relating to the alleged malpractice.there is no existing relationship between pratt and wasser to protect,and the privilege has already been waived as to the alleged malpractice.therefore,permitting gursey indemnity suit to proceed does not offend the important public policy of safeguarding confidences.in the words of the dissent herein,confidentiality is not a concern in this case 
gursey indemnity action is not barred by considerations of conflict of interest.
the cases relied on by wasser,the trial court,and the dissent placed great emphasis on the lawyer duty of undivided loyalty to the client,which in those cases would be impinged upon by permitting an indemnity action to go forward.in rowell the indemnity defendant was the client lawyer in the malpractice action.thus the indemnity suit against the client current lawyer raised policy concerns regarding that law firm undivided loyalty in its present representation of the client in the malpractice action.in kroll tract the court of appeal found a potential for divided loyalties based on the unique tripartite relationship between the client,its personal counsel,and defense counsel retained by its insurance carrier 
in the case before this court,however,the public policy concerns raised by the facts of cases like kroll tract,rowell,and goldfisher are not present.thus,they do not bar the for equitable indemnity.first,the indemnity plaintiff and indemnity defendant were involved in joint successive the client.that representation occurred at the same time in the same case second,there could be no impairment of either ongoing loyalty to the client because this case presents no issue of conflicting loyalties between personal counsel and insurance defense counsel,and neither the lawyer nor the accountant was still representing the client at the time of the indemnity action.third,the client sued both for their joint malpractice,and thus waived whatever remaining conflicts or duties of loyalty that may have existed between either the law firm or the accounting firm and their former joint client.indeed,the client action would have proceeded to trial on the merits against both malpractice defendants but for the shorter statute of limitations for attorney malpractice permitting gursey indemnity action to proceed does not raise any new conflict issues beyond those the client waived by filing the malpractice action against both the law firm and the accounting firm.
california courts have permitted indemnity suits based on joint representation,where the indemnity defendant does not represent the client at the time of the indemnity action.
our analysis is consistent with several california cases permitting indemnity suits by and against lawyers.for example,in crouse brobeck,phleger harrison,the court of appeal permitted an attorney action for equitable indemnity against the client former counsel in crouse,lawyer gave client legal advice about the sale of a limited partnership.when the transaction turned out badly,client brought an action against lawyer,the law firm in which lawyer was a former partner firm i,and firm ii,in which lawyer became a partner during the representation of client.lawyer and firm ii filed a for equitable indemnity against firm 
in permitting the action to proceed,the court of appeal reasoned the public policy concerns were not applicable in a case where the subsequent attorney seeks equitable indemnity against the former attorney,because the former attorney is not subject to any conflict of interest and has no continuing privileged communications or work product to protect the court also held lawyer and firm i could be concurrent tortfeasors for the injury caused during lawyer tenure at firm i,and thus there was no impediment to lawyer right to equitable indemnity from firm i under traditional ama principles of equitable indemnity among concurrent tortfeasors whose acts of negligence unite to cause a single injury.ama,supra,cal d at.
similarly,in pollack lytle the court permitted a suit for indemnity between lawyers who had represented the client at the same time in the same matter.law firm i arranged for law firm ii to act as trial counsel,but law firm ii did not properly prepare the case for trial.unaware of law firm ii failure to properly prepare the case,law firm i and the client rejected a lucrative pretrial settlement offer.law firm ii took the case to trial,lost,and induced the client to sue law firm i for malpractice.law firm i for indemnity against law firm ii,and the trial court sustained law firm ii demurrer without leave to amend.the court of appeal reversed.it recognized the general rule holding a successor law firm owes no duty to its predecessor,but held the public policy considerations underlying the rule did not apply in the case of associate counsel working concurrently it concluded under agency principles,the associate law firm owes the principal law firm the same duties it owes the client,and accordingly,public policy considerations do not mandate that an associate remain free from liability for a breach of the duty owed to its principal.
most recently,a suit for indemnity between concurrent counsel was permitted in musser provencher musser represented the client in divorce proceedings.when the client husband filed for bankruptcy,musser arranged for provencher,a bankruptcy specialist,to obtain relief from the automatic stay imposed by the bankruptcy court.provencher failed to obtain such relief,and instead erroneously advised musser to go ahead with a hearing regarding spousal and child support.musser obtained an award of support,but the award was reversed on appeal because the hearing had violated the automatic stay the client settled with her husband for less than the original support order,and brought suit against musser for malpractice and breach of contract.musser settled with the client,and also settled the client husband claim,which was based on the violation of the automatic stay.she then against provencher,and the trial court granted nonsuit.the court of appeal reversed.
the court of appeal reviewed at some length the california case law dealing with suits for indemnity among lawyers it concluded the concurrent representation situation presents a much less certain potential for conflict of interest than where predecessor counsel seeks indemnity from successor counsel.analyzing the facts of the case before it,the court held we can not see at any time during the joint representation of scott by musser and provencher that there was a real potential for conflict of interest it would appear extremely unjust to bar musser from seeking indemnity or contribution from provencher when musser was sued by scott for damages allegedly attributable to provencher tortious conduct,absent a real potential for conflict between provencher duty to scott and his duty to musser during the course of their joint representation or of a real impact upon confidentiality presented by musser indemnity action.
major clients agency diemer is inapposite and does not support the trial court ruling.
the reliance of the trial court and the dissent on major clients agency diemer is based on a misunderstanding of the facts and procedural posture of that case.while the court of appeal in major clients discussed at some length the policy considerations implicated in the attorney indemnity cases,the outcome of the case was ultimately compelled by two and unrelated rules of law.thus the court public policy discussion was neither necessary nor even particularly germane to the outcome 
in major clients,the court of appeal affirmed the trial court sustaining of a demurrer without leave to amend in a suit by a agent against the lawyer.the lawyer and the agent had together negotiated a contract for their mutual client with a television company,and the agent was entitled to commissions under the contract.when the was terminated,he sued the television company and settled for less than the full amount due under the contract.the client and the agent settled their own controversy over the agent commissions,with the agent receiving less than he would have if the client had received the full amount due under the contract with the television company.the agent then sued the writer lawyer,claiming the lawyer failed to protect his client interests during the contract negotiations,thus causing a diminution in the agent commission the outcome of the case rested on two longstanding rules of california law the absence of a duty owed by a lawyer to a,and the requirement an indemnity plaintiff allege he has become liable to pay economic damages to a third party,which should equitably have been paid by the indemnity defendant 
first,the agent in major clients sought compensation for his own damages,not for damages suffered by the client.such suits have long been barred in california,as the court noted in major clients an attorney generally will not be held liable to a third person not in privity of contract with him since he owes no duty to anyone other than his client.this rule has a sound grounding in public policy because a lawyer whole duty must be to his client,he can not have a duty to a third party the lawyer in major clients would have a clear conflict if he were required to maximize the agent compensation,because his only proper goal was maximization of the client compensation.
second,the court in major clients observed the agent complaint alleged as damages sums which it may be required to pay to the client,but held such language was insufficient to assert the agent had suffered a pecuniary loss by way of payment of a judgment or settlement for alleged negligent conduct.citation.therefore,it concluded i nasmuch as the basis for the remedy of equitable indemnity is restitution,a pleading is fatally defective if there is an absence of an allegation that the agent has discharged a liability that should be the responsibility of the lawyer to pay.citation.in the absence of such an allegation,it held the demurrer was properly sustained for failure to state a cause of action for indemnity 
perhaps in an attempt to avoid these two obvious and fatal flaws in his complaint,the agent argued his case should proceed under the rationale in parker morton the sole california case permitting an attorney to sue his successor for indemnity.in response,the lawyer cited held arant and other law firm i law firm ii cases prohibiting indemnity actions against successor counsel the court of appeal correctly noted the successor attorney malpractice cases relied upon by major clients and diemer are not directly relevant.nevertheless,in dicta it opined the law firm i law firm ii cases should apply to bar the agent suit because the agent was a potential adversary on the issue of commission fees which became an actual adversary when it sued the writer for fees.if an attorney is saddled with a duty to a potentially adverse party,then his loyalty to the client can not be undivided.
the nature of the potential adversity constitutes a crucial factual difference which provides the principled distinction and discernable difference the dissent finds lacking between the present case and major clients.whatever the merits of the conflict of interest analysis in major clients,it has nothing to do with the case before us because the type of adversity identified by the court in major clients is simply not present in this case.gursey was pratt accountant,not her show business agent,and gursey and wasser were providing litigation services on an hourly basis,not negotiating a contract which would determine the commission fees one or both would receive 
here,both gursey and wasser owed duties only to pratt,not to one another,during their joint representation of pratt in the underlying matter.we can not agree with the dissent conclusion an attorney duty of loyalty is compromised by permitting an indemnity suit between two lawyers who jointly represented the client in the same matter,where neither of them represents the client at the time of the indemnity action.while the dissent is concerned with whether,during the time it represents its client,wasser should also have to consider the possibility of a subsequent suit for by its client advisors,we fail to see any additional potential conflict of interest in such a scenario.first,as discussed above,gursey sued wasser for indemnity,not for malpractice.that is,gursey did not claim wasser breached a duty it owed gursey,but rather alleged the law firm had breached a duty it owed pratt.second,the dissent apparently assumes the two firms involved in a joint representation will have undesirable reservations or less than total devotion to the client,only if law firm a is allowed an indemnity suit against law firm b should the client choose to sue only law firm a for malpractice.we find this assumption unrealistic.
as the dissent points out,a law firm is always subject to a suit for malpractice by its own client.we suspect this specter of a suit by the client,rather than of an indemnity suit by the client other advisors,is the cause of most of the conduct the dissent refers to.a lawyer who is inclined to fill the file with memos designed to build a defense to the case the client might file will do so whether or not there is another lawyer also working on the case.at the time the joint representation is occurring neither firm will know whether the client would sue one or both of,if only one,which,of course,whether there will be occasion to file a malpractice suit against either.thus,we still do not see any conflicts of interest which are caused or even exacerbated by the availability of an indemnity action against joint counsel.
indeed,a rule leaving it to clients to choose which of two joint counsel to sue and barring the chosen one from seeking indemnity would encourage both firms to distort their representation.faced with all or nothing liability should the client eventually bring a malpractice action against one of them,both firms would have an incentive to spend time currying favor with the client and discrediting the other firm,in order to avoid the possibility of having to bear the full financial burden of the client malpractice damages.surely such tactics the client and illustrate just the sort of divided loyalties the dissent wishes to avoid.
courts have long approached indemnity actions on a basis,as described by the court of appeal in herrero atkinson the duty to indemnify may arise,and indemnity may be allowed,in those fact situations where in equity and good conscience the burden of the judgment should be shifted from the shoulders of the person seeking indemnity to the one from whom indemnity is sought.the right depends upon the principle that everyone is responsible for the consequences of his own wrong,and if others have been compelled to pay damages which ought to have been paid by the wrongdoer,they may recover from him.thus the determination of whether or not indemnity should be allowed must of necessity depend upon the facts of each case.in a case such as the one before us,where gursey and wasser jointly represented pratt and both representations had ceased by the time of the indemnity action,there is no public policy reason to bar gursey claim for indemnity.
indeed,while analysis is appropriate,for the reasons set forth above we do not hesitate to hold where the indemnity suit is between lawyers who concurrently represented the same client in the same matter,and neither party still represents the client at the time of the indemnity suit,an indemnity suit generally should be permitted to proceed.as we have seen,in such cases the policy considerations favoring indemnity far outweigh the policy considerations underlying the attorney indemnity exception set forth in cases like goldfisher to the contrary,the policy considerations support permitting suits in such cases.the client will receive more undivided loyalty from both firms involved in the joint less time wasted trying to curry favor and discredit the other indemnity is allowed than if both firms are at the mercy of the client choice of which firm to sue for malpractice.accordingly,we see no reason,in equity and good conscience,to deny gursey its day in court against wasser.
ii.the arbitrator could not and did not adjudicate wasser liability for the damages suffered by pratt.
in our view,the public policy considerations discussed above,standing alone,require us to reverse the judgment of the trial court.therefore we need not discuss the merits of gursey contention the arbitrator found wasser jointly and severally liable for pratt damages.however because the parties have extensively briefed the issue,and because it is likely to recur on remand,we address it,and hold the arbitrator decision could not and did not constitute an adjudication of wasser liability for the damages suffered by pratt.
in its complaint,gursey alleged in the arbitration award,the arbitrator found that gursey and wasser,rosenson carter both were a cause of injury that pratt sustained.further,the arbitrator held that wasser,rosenson carter and gursey were jointly and severally liable for any injury that pratt sustained.this allegation constitutes a conclusion of law more than an allegation of fact,and therefore it need not be accepted as true.moreover,this allegation is contradicted by the arbitrator award,which is attached as exhibit g to gursey complaint because wasser had been found not liable by reason of the statute of limitations in bifurcated proceedings before the arbitrator,it was not a party to the subsequent arbitration proceedings.accordingly,wasser liability to pratt was never an issue in the arbitration.
while the arbitrator clearly thought wasser was also a cause of pratt damages,he plainly and properly found only the gursey defendants jointly and severally liable.the finding of joint and several liability against gursey means gursey negligence was a proximate cause of the injury to pratt,and gursey is therefore liable for the entire amount of her damages.this was not intended to,nor could it,have any affect on gursey ability to sue wasser for equitable indemnity 
although we reject gursey contention regarding the effect of the arbitrator ruling,we nevertheless hold its first cause of action for equitable indemnity states facts sufficient to constitute a cause of action,because it reasonably can be read to allege gursey has suffered damages which should in fairness be paid by wasser.
disposition 
the judgment of the trial court is reversed and the cause is remanded for further proceedings consistent with this opinion.appellant is entitled to recover its costs on appeal.
i disagree with the majority conclusion that there is no public policy reason to bar gursey claim for indemnity against wasser.a lawyer client should be protected from even the possibility of less than total devotion to his interests by the attorney of his choice.in my view,that possibility exists if a lawyer must consider,during his representation of the client,the prospect of personal exposure to suit by the client other advisors.moreover,if there is a balance to be struck between the public policy interest in ensuring the undiluted loyalty of a lawyer to his client interests,and the policy considerations favoring the equitable allocation of damages among wrongdoers,the former should be given precedence.accordingly,i respectfully dissent.
as the majority acknowledges,california courts over the last twenty years or so have held that public policy considerations bar lawsuits for partial equitable indemnity against lawyers in a variety of circumstances.the most obvious of these is that a lawyer sued by a former client for professional negligence can not seek indemnity from a successor lawyer,subsequently retained by that client.the reason is that the prospect of such a suit threatens to inhibit the successor attorney undivided loyalty to the client.that is easy to discern the second lawyer decision about how to handle the problem created by the first lawyer should not be affected by considerations such as the potential for an indemnity suit by the first lawyer.other policy reasons may also apply in cases involving successor lawyers.these are summarized in kroll tract paris paris they include that a a for indemnity by the predecessor lawyer in a malpractice suit may effectively deprive the client of her attorney of choice in the malpractice suit,and b such lawsuits jeopardize the preservation of the relationship and privilege.over the years,courts have applied these policy considerations to other suits against lawyers,including suits by one law firm against another which concurrently represented the dissatisfied client and suits by other third parties against lawyers 
the majority says that public policy concerns are not present in this case because the representation by gursey and wasser was concurrent,neither lawyer nor accountant was still retained by the client,so there could be no impairment of either ongoing loyalty to the client,and the client tried to sue both of them and could have done so but for the statute of limitations,so confidentiality is not a concern.all that is true,but does not eliminate the other policy concern namely,that subjecting an attorney to the prospect of legal obligations to his client other advisors may inject undesirable reservations into the attorney counseling role during the underlying representation.i consider this principle,which protects the client from even the possibility of less than total devotion to his interests by his attorney,as more important than ensuring that one negligent professional be indemnified by another.
the case of major clients agency diemer described in the majority opinion,is illustrative.there,the court refused to permit a suit for indemnity by a agent against the lawyer.the court observed that the policy considerations that applied in other cases dictated the same result it cited the principles that a an attorney may be reluctant to accept cases that might result in indemnity claims,and b more importantly,if an attorney is faced with a potential indemnity claim,a sense of might impinge on the duty of undivided loyalty to the client 
the court in major clients agency specifically rejected the agent argument that the undivided loyalty rationale did not apply.the agent argued there was no problem of undivided loyalty because the lawyer and the agent were not adversaries,worked together in the negotiation of the client contract,and the lawyer was not faced with any conflict between his client interests and those of his client agent the lawyer merely failed to recognize a flaw in the contract.even so,the court said 
e ven where there is but one course of action for an attorney to follow,the attorney must be free from the threat of potential liability in order to devote undivided loyalty to the client.major clients was a potential adversary on the issue of commission fees which became an actual adversary when it sued the writer for fees.if an attorney is saddled with a duty to a potentially adverse party,then his loyalty to the client can not be undivided.
no principled distinction exists between major clients agency and the circumstances here.even where the lawyer has only one course to follow,the duty of loyalty to the client should not be diminished by imputing to him legal obligations to the client other advisors,be they attorneys or acting in some other capacity,unless such parties are clearly intended beneficiaries of the legal services being rendered.
the majority says the type of adversity identified in major clients agency is not present in this case,and that this factual difference in the nature of the potential adversity is crucial.certainly the facts are entirely different,but i see no discernable difference in principle in the potential adversity in the two cases.in major clients agency,the agent was representing and negotiating for the writer in the underlying transaction,just as gursey was acting to further pratt interests in this case.there is always a potential for fees or the result of the something goes wrong,as it did here 
in short,allowing the client forensic expert to sue the attorney for indemnity for the attorney inadequate advice to the client would mean,in practical effect,that the attorney owes legal obligations to the client other advisors as well as to the client.while one can not predict precisely how this additional consideration might affect the lawyer duty of loyalty to the client in any particular case it seems unwise to permit the introduction of a necessarily distracting,consideration into the relationship 
i am well aware that there are cases in which other courts have permitted a partial indemnity action against a lawyer.these include crouse brobeck,phleger and musser provencher in crouse an attorney and his present law firm were permitted to sue his former law firm,where the client had sued all three of them for malpractice.the court found that the policy concerns that prohibit a suit by a predecessor lawyer against the subsequent conflicts of interest and protecting privileged communications and work not applicable to an indemnity claim by the subsequent attorney against the predecessor attorney while it is not necessary to argue the correctness of the principle stated in crouse for all purposes,crouse does not contradict the fundamental premise on which i would decide this case.here,as in crouse,there are no privileged communications to protect.however,other policy considerations,such as the duty of loyalty unimpaired by considerations,exist.in crouse,the former law firm,during its representation of the client,had no conflicting or potentially conflicting interests at all.the firm duty of loyalty to its client was completely unimpaired by any reservations,since there was no one else in the picture who might even potentially divert the firm attention from its client interests.here,the court decision to allow suit means that the lawyer has the client other advisors to consider.
finally,there is the recent case of musser provencher,also described in the majority opinion,allowing a suit for indemnity between concurrent.i do not disagree with the musser court conclusion that concurrent representation situations may present a much less certain potential for conflict of interest than successor counsel cases i simply place a higher value on avoidance of even the possibility of dilution of the lawyer total devotion to his client interests.moreover,musser is distinguishable on its facts.for one thing,the court thought it extremely unjust to bar musser indemnity suit when she was also sued by her client under a respondeat superior theory for damages caused by provencher malpractice for another,in musser the court found no real potential for conflict of interest between provencher duties to the client and his duties to the lawyer who hired him musser in the case before this court,the question is not one of potential conflict between wasser duty to the client and its duty to gursey wasser had no duty to gursey.the question is whether wasser should have to consider,during its representation of pratt,possible exposure to a suit by pratt other advisors to whom wasser otherwise owes no duty.i would answer no.
to sum up in my view,a lawyer should not have to consider a possible personal exposure to suit by a client other advisors during the representation of a client.that would tend to divert the attorney from devotion to his client interests.the policy considerations discussed in major clients agency and its predecessor cases are applicable here,and gursey suit for partial equitable indemnity should be barred 
henceforth we will refer to appellants collectively as gursey,and to respondents collectively as wasser.
