in a client action against an attorney for legal malpractice,the client must prove,among other things,that the attorney negligent acts or omissions caused the client to suffer some financial harm or loss.when the alleged malpractice occurred in the performance of transactional work giving advice or preparing documents for a business transaction,must the client prove this causation element according to the but for test,meaning that the harm or loss would not have occurred without the attorney malpractice the answer is yes 
in,plaintiffs michael viner and his wife,deborah raffin viner,founded dove audio,dove.the company produced audio versions of books read by the authors or by celebrities,and it did television and movie projects.
in,dove went public by issuing stock at a share.in,the viners and dove entered into employment contracts guaranteeing the viners,among other things,a certain level of salaries,and containing indemnification provisions favorable to the viners.the viners received a large share of dove common stock and all of its preferred cumulative dividend series a stock.
thereafter,michael viner discussed with longtime friend david povich,a partner in defendant law firm williams connolly in washington,the possibility of selling the viners interest in dove.in the fall of,norton herrick proposed buying the viners entire interest in dove.attorney povich assigned the matter to his partner,defendant charles sweet,a corporate transactional attorney.sweet was not a member of the california bar and was not familiar with california law.during the negotiations with herrick,sweet learned that under the viners employment agreements with dove,the latter owed the viners a substantial amount of unpaid dividends on their preferred stock.sweet also learned that the viners wanted to preserve their right to engage in the television and movie businesses.
when the negotiations with herrick were unsuccessful,ronald lightstone of media equities international mei approached the viners.thereafter,in march,the viners and mei entered into an agreement under which mei was to invest million,and the viners million,to buy dove stock.by may,disputes arose,and the parties to the agreement each threatened litigation.that same month,ronald lightstone of mei and michael viner,without defendant attorney sweet involvement,agreed that mei would buy the viners stock in dove and the viners would terminate their employment with dove.
defendant attorney sweet and lightstone of mei negotiated the final agreement,which the parties signed on june.the deal consisted of a securities purchase agreement and an employment termination agreement.under the former,mei agreed to buy a significant portion of the viners stock for more than million.under the latter agreement,the viners employment with dove was terminated,mutual general releases were given,and dove was to pay the viners a total of million over five years in monthly payments,with dove series e preferred stock to be held in escrow for distribution to the viners if dove defaulted on the monthly payments to them.
the employment termination agreement contained a noncompetition provision stating that the viners would not compete in any way,directly or indirectly,in the audio book business for a period of four years in any state in which dove was doing business.the agreement also had a nonsolicitation provision that the viners would not directly or indirectly contract with,hire,solicit,encourage the departure of or in any manner engage or seek to employ any author or,for purposes of audio books,reader,currently under contract or included in the company book or audio catalogues for a period of four years.
in addition,the employment termination agreement provided that deborah raffin viner would receive producer credit on audiobook work initiated during her employment with dove that dove would not amend documents to terminate or reduce its obligation to indemnify the viners and that disputes would be submitted to arbitration,whose costs were to be split equally between the parties,with attorney fees to the party seeking to enforce the arbitration in court.
defendant attorney sweet led the viners to believe that the employment termination agreement gave them three years of monthly payments by dove,retained the indemnity protection they had with dove,and provided credit for work done before their departure from dove.the viners also thought that they could use their celebrity contacts for any work that did not compete with dove audiobook business and involvement in film and television productions,and that if dove defaulted on the monthly payments to them,the noncompetition clauses would be voided.the contracts did not so provide.
later,several arbitration proceedings took place to resolve disputes between the viners and mei,including a claim by the viners that the noncompetition provision of the employment termination agreement violated business and professions code section restrictions on noncompetition agreements.the arbitrator rejected the claim,and the superior court confirmed the arbitrator decision.
on june,the viners brought a malpractice action against attorney sweet and the law firm of williams connolly.presented at trial were these seven claims sweet told the viners that the nonsolicitation clause of the employment termination agreement prohibiting plaintiffs from using their contacts to obtain work in television and movie projects applied only to the book and audiobook parts of dove business,but dove,because the clause was ambiguous,asserted that the clause also encompassed dove television and movie projects sweet negligently agreed to the noncompetition provision,which violated business and professions code section restrictions on such provisions the viners had asked for an attorney fees provision,but the employment termination agreement disallowed attorney fees in any disputes,permitting them only in enforcing an arbitration award ambiguous language in the producer credit provision caused dove not to give deborah raffin viner credit as a producer the viners lost rights to dividends on dove series a preferred stock the employment termination agreement did not contain an indemnity provision providing the same level of protection as the viners agreement with dove and the series e stock afforded inadequate security to the viners if dove defaulted on the monthly payments due them under the employment termination agreement.
after deliberating five days,the jury found defendants liable on all seven claims of malpractice,awarding the viners in damages.defendants moved for judgment notwithstanding the verdict or in the alternative for a new trial,arguing that the trial court erred in not instructing the jury that the viners needed to prove they would have received a better deal but for defendant attorney sweet negligence.the trial court denied both motions.
the court of appeal reduced the damage award to,but otherwise affirmed the judgment.the court first noted that it was undisputed that the viners did not attempt to prove that without defendants alleged negligence mei would have given them a better deal on the contract terms here in issue.the court determined that the case presented a pure question of law whether plaintiffs in a transactional legal malpractice action must show that the harm would not have occurred but for the alleged negligence.it held that the but for test of causation did not apply to transactional malpractice.
the court of appeal distinguished transactional malpractice from litigation malpractice,in which the plaintiff is required to prove the harm would not have occurred without the alleged negligence,and it offered three reasons for treating the two forms of malpractice differently.first,the court asserted that in litigation a gain for one side is always a loss for the other,whereas in transactional work a gain for one side could also be a gain for the other side.second,the court observed that litigation malpractice involves past historical facts while transactional malpractice involves what parties would have been willing to accept for the future.third,the court stated that business transactions generall
