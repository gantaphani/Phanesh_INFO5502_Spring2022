order modifying opinion 
no change in judgment 
it is ordered that the opinion filed herein on october,be modified as follows 
on page,after the period at the end of the last full sentence reading although the defendants may ultimately defeat sprengel claims by proving the absence of an relationship,that does not alter the substance of her claims,footnote shall be added that states 
defendants contend that,in this particular case,we may reject sprengel claim of an implied relationship under the first prong of the section test because the undisputed evidence shows they were hired only to represent the llc purposeful press,not sprengel and under settled,black letter law,an attorney for an llc owes no professional duties to the llc individual members.even if we were to assume that defendants evidence established they were properly retained to represent the llc only a fact sprengel disputes,defendants have cited no authority holding that an attorney for an llc has no obligations to the llc individual members.instead,defendants rely solely on cases holding that an attorney for a corporation generally does not represent the corporation officers or shareholders in their individual capacities.see ante,at fn.our courts have applied a different rule in the context of partnerships,explaining that a factual inquiry is used to determine whether in a particular case the partnership attorney has established an relationship with the individual partners.johnson superior court th,see also responsible citizens superior court th,rejecting bright line rule that a partnership attorney may never have a duty of loyalty to individual partners see wortham van liew superior court d,attorney for partnership also represents partners in matters of partnership business.defendants have not identified any decision addressing whether the rules governing the representation of corporations,rather than those governing the representation of partnerships,apply in the context of an llc in this case,a llc.to the extent the partnership rules were found to apply,a factual inquiry would be necessary to determine what duties if any the defendants owed to the llc members,including sprengel.thus,based on the arguments and evidence presented in their briefs,defendants have not conclusively negated the possibility of an relationship between themselves and sprengel it would therefore be improper to resolve that issue under the first prong of the statute test.flatley mauro cal th,under first prong analysis,section is inapplicable in rare cases where the defendant assertedly protected speech or petitioning activity is conclusively demonstrated to have been illegal as a matter of law in the absence of such a showing,any claimed illegitimacy of the defendant conduct must be resolved under the second prong of the section test.

defendants filed a special motion to strike pursuant to code of civil procedure section.the trial court denied the motion,concluding that sprengel claims did not arise from defendants protected litigation activities,but rather from their alleged breach of professional and ethical duties that attorneys owe to their clients.we affirm.
factual background 
summary of events preceding sprengel malpractice action.formation of purposeful press 
in,jean sprengel,a licensed anesthesiologist,wrote and published a guidebook for treating the side effects of chemotherapy.in march of,lanette mohr and sprengel agreed to form a business to market the guidebook.they retained kenneth stream to assist them in forming purposeful press,a limited liability corporation that would develop and distribute sprengel work.stream prepared an operation agreement stating that sprengel and mohr were each percent owners of the company.under the terms of the agreement,sprengel was to provide an initial cash investment of and mohr was to provide organizational and business planning services with an value of.the agreement identified mohr as the sole manager of the company.
in the fall of,mohr informed sprengel she would not continue to manage the company unless her salary was increased.in response,sprengel told mohr she was willing to take over the managerial duties and requested that mohr turn over the corporate records.mohr,acting through her attorney roger rosen,refused to surrender the books and records of the c ompany and instead asserted for the first time that she was the sole manager of the company and that sprengel had no right to participate in any of the decisions affecting the c ompany.
in march of,mohr,purportedly acting as manager of purposeful press,retained gregory zbylut to provide legal services related to the dispute with sprengel.zbylut and mohr thereafter arranged for vincent cox and his firm,leopold petrich smith collectively lps,to enter into a retainer agreement with purposeful press.the agreement,which was signed by cox and mohr,stated that lps had been retained to investigate and confirm the company intellectual property rights in the guidebook.
sprengel lawsuits against mohr and purposeful press 
in september of,sprengel filed a complaint for involuntary dissolution against mohr and purposeful press,which was described as a nominal defendant that had been named as a necessary party to an action of dissolution.the complaint alleged that purposeful press could no longer carry out its duties in conformity with the articles of organization or operating agreement because the management of the company had become deadlocked or subject to internal dissension.
one month later,sprengel filed a separate action against mohr alleging that she had infringed sprengel copyrights to the original guidebook and various derivative works.the complaint asserted that although sprengel had initially granted purposeful press a revocable implied license to sell the original and derivative works,she had later revoked the license.the complaint further alleged that despite sprengel revocation,mohr,acting through purposeful press,had continued to market and sell the works.
after the suits were filed,lps and mohr signed amendments to the original retainer agreement with purposeful press stating that the parties had agreed to expand the scope of legal services to address problems lps had discovered in the copyright registrations that kenneth stream had prepared and filed on behalf of the company pursue a declaratory relief action to confirm purposeful press rights in its intellectual property and pursue damage claims against sprengel,who had allegedly transferred over out of purposeful press bank accounts without mohr authorization.
in december of and january of,a federal district court presided over a bench trial on sprengel copyright claims.after the trial was completed,the court issued its findings of fact and conclusions of law,which declared sprengel as the sole author and owner of the intellectual property rights of the chemotherapy guidebook and various derivative works.the court further found,however,that sprengel had provided mohr and purposeful press an implied license to publish and sell the works,thereby absolv ing them of any liability for copyright infringement.the court findings also noted that,prior to trial,it had ruled purposeful press need not actively participate in the litigation because the company did not appear to have any interests independent of its two members and neither sprengel nor mohr could be trusted to retain independent counsel to provide purposeful press with neutral representation.
sprengel malpractice action against zbylut and lps 
summary of sprengel complaint 
in september of,sprengel filed the current lawsuit against zbylut and lps.the complaint alleged that when mohr retained defendants to represent purposeful press in the underlying dissolution and copyright actions,there was an understanding between them that defendants would provide legal services for the benefit of mohr,and to the prejudice of sprengel,under the pretext that the legal services were for the benefit of the c ompany.the complaint further alleged that defendants had solicited payment from the c ompany for their legal services in conjunction with the d issolution c ase and the c opyright c ase without sprengel knowledge or consent.the legal services provided by d efendants in the d issolution c ase and the c opyright c ase were primarily devoted to the best interests of mohr and assisting mohr individual counsel rose in his representation of mohr in those cases,at the c ompany expense.
sprengel alleged four causes of action professional negligence malpractice breach of fiduciary duties constructive fraud and common count for money had and received.in her malpractice claim,sprengel asserted that b y undertaking to provide legal services and soliciting payment from purposeful press in the dissolution and copyright cases,d efendants became obligated to sprengel to exercise reasonable care and skill with the standard of care for attorneys and in accordance with california rules of professional conduct rules and.she further alleged defendants had breached the professional obligations they owed to her by fail ing to provide reasonable care and skill in undertaking the legal services fail ing to communicate with sprengel and inform her of material facts and information relating to the legal services provided and charged to purposeful press and fail ing to avoid conflicts of interest and violat ing rules of professional responsibility governing representation involving conflicts of interest including the failure to obtain written waivers from sprengel and mohr.
sprengel second claim for breach of fiduciary duty similarly alleged that by undertaking to provide legal services regarding the affairs of purposeful press including the disputes between the c ompany two percent owners and causing the c ompany to pay for those legal services,a fiduciary relationship existed between sprengel and d efendants such that d efendants owed to sprengel the duties of honesty,good faith,undivided loyalty and full disclosure of material facts and were obligated to comply with all of the rules of professional conduct including rules a and.defendants allegedly breached their fiduciary duties by,among other things,concealing material facts,engaging in and concealing a conflict of interest,charging purposeful press for legal services calculated to benefit the interests of mohr and prejudice sprengel and failing to obtain sprengel consent for payment of legal services.
sprengel third and fourth claims for constructive fraud and common count for money had and received were each based on defendants breach of the professional obligations and fiduciary duties they allegedly owed to sprengel.the constructive fraud claim asserted defendants misconduct was willful,malicious and done with a conscious disregard for plaintiff rights and interests,thereby entitling sprengel to punitive damages.the count for money had and received asserted that sprengel was entitled to recover any money the defendants had received from purposeful press by reason of d efendants violation of their ethical duties including rules of professional responsibility.
defendants special motion to strike under code of civil procedure section 
defendants filed specials motion to strike the complaint pursuant to code of civil procedure section arguing that sprengel claims arose from constitutionally protected petitioning activity because the alleged conduct which purportedly gives rise to their liability was comprised solely of activities in connection with civil litigation.according to defendants,such conduct was unquestionably covered by the statute as a matter of law.
defendants also argued there were several reasons sprengel could not establish a probability of prevailing on her claims.first,defendants asserted that a ll of sprengel claims either directly or implicitly allege the existence of an relationship between her and defendants based on her status as a percent owner of purposeful press.defendants contended sprengel could not establish the existence of such a relationship because the complaint expressly acknowledged that defendants only agreed to represent purposeful press and california law is patently clear that an attorney for a corporate entity does not owe a duty of care to the company members by virtue of representing the company.
second,defendants argued that the litigation privilege set forth in civil code section operate d as a complete defense because the conduct sprengel had challenged in her complaint consisted entirely of legal communications related to anticipated or pending lawsuits involving purposeful press.defendants explained that s ince the very basis of sprengel c omplaint is the attorney conduct in representing the c ompany,the litigation privilege bars the c omplaint in its entirety.third,defendants argued that to the extent sprengel was assert ing breaches of duties the defendants owed to purposeful press,she was required to bring such claims through a derivative action on behalf of the company rather than through an individual action.
in her opposition,sprengel argued that her claims did not arise from the defendants protected litigation activities,explaining that multiple published opinions have held the statute does not apply to claims of attorney malpractice or breach of fiduciary duties or engaging in conflicts of interest.sprengel also argued that defendants arguments regarding the existence or non existence of an attorney client relationship were not relevant to determining whether her claims arose from protected activity.
sprengel further contended that even if her claims were subject to section she had established a probability of prevailing on the merits because there were issues of fact regarding whether an attorney client relationship existed between her and d efendants.although sprengel admitted she did not enter into an express agreement with any of the defendants,she argued that several factors support ed a finding that there was an implied attorney between them,including the limited size of purposeful press,which suggest ed an individual representation of the company members the defendants legal services were paid with funds that belonged to sprengel the subject matter of the representation involved sprengel copyrights and her intellectually property rights and the district court order in the copyright action had specifically found that purposeful press had no interests independent of its two members.sprengel also argued that the litigation privilege did not provide a defense to her claims because the privilege was inapplicable where a client has asserted claims against an attorney for breaches of duties and conflict of interest.
in their reply briefs,defendants argued that the cases sprengel had cited in support of her assertion that section does not apply to claims predicated on an attorney breach of professional obligations were wholly distinguishable because unlike the present case,the attorney defendants in those decisions actually represented and,were counsel of record for,the plaintiff clients at one time or another.according to defendants,the recurring theme in each case cited by sprengel is that claims by clients current or former against their attorneys are not protected by the statute because these claims arise from the attorneys alleged breach of professional and ethical duties owed to clients,not from the attorneys protected litigation activity defendants,however,never represented sprengel.defendants explained that while sprengel had allege d the existence of an relationship between her and defendants based on her status as a percent owner of purposeful press,california case law made clear that an attorney for a corporate entity owes no duty to the corporation shareholders.accordingly,there were no grounds to support a finding of an individual relationship.
the trial court denied defendants motions to strike,concluding that sprengel claims did not arise from constitutionally protected activity within the meaning of section.the court explained the statute was inapplicable because the gravamen of sprengel claims was that by representing purposeful press llc and mohr interests against sprengel and being paid out of llc funds,defendants breached a fiduciary duty owed directly to sprengel as a percent member of the llc and undertook to represent a party with interests adverse to sprengel in violation of an alleged duty of loyalty.the court further explained that whether or not d efendant attorneys actually owed such duties toward sprengel is an inquiry addressed to the second prong of the analysis,but not the first prong.the court emphasized that although defendants will have an opportunity to establish any defense to sprengel claim,a section special motion to strike is not the proper procedural device for representing such defenses.
discussion 
summary of applicable law and standard of review 
section,commonly referred to as the statute citation is intended to provide for the early dismissal of unmeritorious claims filed to interfere with the valid exercise of the constitutional rights of freedom of speech and petition for the redress of grievances.citation.the section authorizes the filing of a special motion that requires a court to strike claims brought against a person arising from any act of that person in furtherance of the person right of petition or free speech under the united states constitution or the california constitution in connection with a public issue unless the court determines that the plaintiff has established that there is a probability that the plaintiff will prevail on the claim,subd.b.
section requires that a court engage in a process when determining whether a defendant motion should be granted.citation.first the court decides whether the defendant has made a threshold showing that the challenged cause of action is one arising from protected activity.citation.a defendant meets this burden by demonstrating that the act underlying the plaintiff cause of action fits one of the categories spelled out in section,subdivision e citation.citation.if the defendant makes this showing,the court proceeds to the second step of the analysis.citation.in the second step,the court decides whether the plaintiff has demonstrated a reasonable probability of prevailing at trial on the merits of its challenged causes of action.conversely,if the defendant does not meet its burden on the first step,the court should deny the motion and need not address the second step.citation.
an appellate court reviews an order granting an motion under a de novo standard.citation.in other words,we employ the same procedure as the trial court in determining whether the motion was properly granted.citation.hunter cbs broadcasting,th,hunter.
defendants failed to establish that sprengel claims arise from protected activity 
the sole inquiry under the first prong of the statute is whether the plaintiff claims arise from protected speech or petitioning activity.citation.our focus is on the principal thrust or gravamen of the causes of action,the allegedly wrongful and conduct that provides the foundation for the claims.castleman sagaser th,castleman.a cause of action does not arise from protected activity simply because it is filed after protected activity took place.citation.nor does the fact t hat a cause of action arguably may have been triggered by protected activity necessarily entail that it arises from such activity.citation.the trial court must instead focus on the substance of the plaintiff lawsuit in analyzing the first prong of a special motion to strike.peregrine funding,sheppard mullin richter hampton llp th,peregrine see also freeman schack th,freeman when the allegations referring to arguably protected activity are only incidental to a cause of action based essentially on nonprotected activity,collateral allusions to protected activity should not subject the cause of action to the statute.we review the parties pleadings,declarations,and other supporting documents at this stage of the analysis only to determine what conduct is actually being challenged,not to determine whether the conduct is actionable.citation.castleman,supra,th at.
sprengel claims allege that defendants are liable for breaching professional obligations an attorney owes to his or her clients,including the duty of loyalty set forth in rule of the california rules of professional conduct and various fiduciary duties.sprengel asserts defendants violated these obligations by pursuing the interests of purposeful press and mohr in the underlying dissolution and copyright actions,which were directly adverse to her own interests in those matters,and then using sprengel assets to pay themselves for their legal services without her consent.although sprengel admits she did not enter into an express agreement with any of the defendants,she alleges that defendants representation of purposeful press gave rise to an implied agreement that they would also represent her individually because she owned percent of the company.thus,sprengel effectively asserts she shared an individual relationship with defendants based on her status as a percent shareholder of purposeful press.
defendants argue that sprengel claims necessarily arise from protected petitioning activity because she seeks to impose liability based on the legal services they provided to purposeful press.although defendants are correct that an attorney activities kolar donahue,mcintosh hammerton th,kolar,including the filing and prosecution of a civil action on behalf of a client rusheen cohen cal th,constitute acts in furtherance of a person right of petition,numerous cases have held that actions based on an attorney breach of professional and ethical duties owed to a client are generally not subject to section even though protected litigation activity features prominently in the factual background.castleman,supra,th at.
for example,in benasra mitchell silberberg knupp llp th benasra,a decision issued by this district,the plaintiffs alleged their former attorneys had violated the duty of loyalty set forth in rule by accepting representation of a rival company whose interests were adverse to the plaintiffs.defendants brought a motion to strike the complaint,arguing that their representation of the plaintiffs rival was a protected activity within the meaning of section.the court disagreed,ruling that the plaintiffs claims were not based on the legal services defendants had provided to the rival company,but rather were based on their fail ure to maintain loyalty to a client.id.the court explained that the breach of loyalty occurs not when the attorney steps into court to represent the new client,but when he or she abandons the old client in other words,once the attorney accepts a representation in which confidences disclosed by a former client may benefit the new client due to the relationship between the new matter and the old,he or she has breached a duty of loyalty.the breach of fiduciary duty lawsuit may follow litigation pursued against the former client,but does not arise from it.ibid.
similarly,in freeman,supra,th,the fourth district ruled that section did not apply to plaintiffs claims alleging that their attorney had breached professional obligations set forth in rule when he abandoned them in order to represent adverse interests in the same and different litigation.id.at.relying on the reasoning in benasra,supra,th,the court held that while the defendant litigation activities were a major focus id.at of plaintiffs claims,the principal thrust of the conduct underlying the causes of action was defendant undertaking to represent a party with interests adverse to plaintiffs,in violation of the duty of loyalty he assertedly owed them.id.at.the court explained that plaintiffs allegations concerning the defendant protected petitioning activities were incidental to the allegations of negligence in failing to properly represent their interests and breach of fiduciary duty arising from his representation of clients with adverse interests.id.at.
in prediwave simpson thacher bartlett llp th prediwave,the plaintiff,a corporate entity,was sued by an investor who alleged that a prediwave board member had induced the investor to purchase prediwave through a series of false representations.prediwave retained simpson thacher to defend the company and the board member in the investor suit.after the investor prevailed at trial,prediwave sued simpson thacher,alleging that the firm had engaged in a defense strategy that protected the individual board member while compromising prediwave interests.simpson thacher filed a section motion asserting that prediwave claims arose from protected litigation activities that occurred during the course of representing the plaintiff and its agent.
the sixth district rejected the argument,reasoning that the principal thrust of prediwave causes of action is that defendants simultaneously represented both prediwave and the board member in matters in which they had an irreconcilable conflict of interest.this conflict of interest allegedly adversely affected defendants choice of legal strategy and resulted in defendants repeated failures to take action to safeguard prediwave against the board member misconduct.prediwave,supra,th at.citing benasra and freeman,the court held that defendants allegedly improper continuation of joint representation id.at did not qualify as a form of protected activity.
more recently,in castleman,supra,th,the fifth district held that section did not apply to claims alleging that an attorney had committed various ethical violations,including breaches of the duties of loyalty and confidentiality owed to plaintiffs as former clients under the state bar rules of professional conduct.id.at.the defendant,peter sagaser,had previously worked at a law firm that represented plaintiff peter castleman in acquiring real estate from james bratton.several years after the real estate transaction was completed,sagaser resigned from the firm under acrimonious terms stemming from an internal dispute between sagaser and his law partners.id.at.before his resignation became effective,sagaser remotely accessed the firm document management system and reviewed files related to castleman transaction with bratton.shortly thereafter,sagaser met with a law firm and bratton.the law firm then filed a complaint on behalf of bratton alleging that castleman and sagaser former firm had conspired to defraud bratton out of the properties at issue in the prior real estate transaction.castleman and his related entities filed a separate suit against sagaser alleging he had breached his professional obligations by using confidential information his former firm had obtained in connection with its representation of castleman and advising bratton in the suit against castleman.sagaser brought a section claim asserting that castleman claims were predicated on protected petitioning activity,including communications with bratton counsel and participating in bratton lawsuit.
after reviewing benasra,freeman and similar cases,the court concluded castleman claims were not subject to section.according to the court,t he foundation of each claim wa s the allegation that sagaser chose to align himself with plaintiffs adversaries,in direct opposition to plaintiffs interests,thereby breaching duties of loyalty and confidentiality owed to them by virtue of a prior relationship.plaintiffs complaint specifically alleges that sagaser violated the state bar rules of professional conduct,including rule,which is the principal thrust of their lawsuit.castleman,supra,th at.
finally,in loanvest i,llc utrecht th loanvest,decided earlier this year,the first district concluded section was inapplicable to claims that are highly analogous to those at issue here.the plaintiff,a corporate entity,sued its former attorney for malpractice,alleging he had breached his duty of loyalty by taking legal positions in a prior litigation that were intended to benefit the company previous manager,who controlled the company.more specifically,the complaint alleged the attorney never represented the company interests,instead egregiously breaching the duty of loyalty owed to his purported client by aid ing his true client,the company manager,in looting the company to pay the manager obligations.id.at.
the appellate court ruled the claim was not subject to section,explaining that numerous prior decisions had found the statute did not apply w here a legal malpractice action is brought by an attorney former client,claiming that the attorney breached fiduciary obligations to the client as the result of a conflict of interest or other deficiency in the representation of the client.loanvest,supra,th at.quoting prediwave,the court agreed with these prior decisions conclusion that it would be unreasonable to interpret section,subdivision b to include a client causes of action against the client own attorney arising from activities undertaken for that client.citation.id.at.
several other cases have followed the reasoning set forth in benasra,freeman,prediwave,castleman and loanvest,concluding that section is generally inapplicable to claims seeking to impose liability based on an attorney violation of the conflict of interest rules set forth in the rules of professional conduct or other attorney actions taken on behalf of a client.see united states fire ins.sheppard,mullin,richter hampton llp th,section inapplicable to claim seeking relief based on a successive representation conflict of interest in violation of rule hylton frank rogozienski,th,section inapplicable to claim alleging that attorney breached his fiduciary duty by inducing client to pursue unnecessary causes of action to extract unconscionable fees coretronic cozen th coretronic section inapplicable to claims alleging that defendant breached professional obligations owed to a by conceal ing representation of the plaintiff adversary while obtaining sensitive information of benefit to the adversary in its lawsuit against plaintiffs chodos cole th,california courts have held that when a claim by a client against a lawyer is based on a breach of the fiduciary duty of loyalty or negligence,it does not concern a right of petition or free speech,though those activities arose from the filing,prosecution of and statements made in the course of the client lawsuit.the reason is that the lawsuit concerns a breach of duty that does not depend on the exercise of a constitutional right.our courts have similarly concluded that malpractice claims that challenge the competency of an attorney legal services are not subject to section because,in such cases,the client is not suing because the attorney petitioned on his or her behalf,but because the attorney did not competently represent the client interests while doing so.kolar,supra,th at see also jespersen zubiate beauchamp th,section inapplicable to a attorney malpractice claim predicated on defendants failure to serve timely discovery objections and comply with various discovery orders.
sprengel claims against defendants can not be meaningfully distinguished from the claims at issue in benasra,freeman,prediwave,castleman and loanvest.the principal thrust of sprengel claims is that defendants violated the duty of loyalty they owed to her as a client by aligning themselves with purposeful press and mohr in the underlying dissolution and copyright actions,in direct opposition to sprengel interests in those matters.sprengel also alleges defendants breached fiduciary duties owed to her by virtue of a n relationship castleman,supra,th at by accepting sprengel funds to pay for their legal services without her consent.thus,the activit ies that give rise to defendants asserted liability freeman,supra,th at are undertaking a representation in which they had an irreconcilable conflict of interest failing to competently represent sprengel interests in the underlying litigation and failing to obtain sprengel permission before using her funds to pay for the litigation.although sprengel claims may have been triggered by or associated with id.at defendants litigation activities,they do not arise out of those acts.see also coretronic,supra,th at any assertedly protected activity is not the root of the complaint it is merely the setting in which the claims arose.instead,they arise out of defendants breach of professional obligations they allegedly owed to sprengel as the result of an implied relationship arising out of defendants representation of purposeful press.
defendants do not dispute that the gravamen of sprengel claims is that they breached various professional duties arising from an implied relationship they argue,however,that benasra and subsequent cases that have adopted its reasoning are distinguishable because,despite the allegations of sprengel complaint,there is absolutely no evidence that defendants were retained to represent her individually.rather,according to defendants,sprengel complaint makes clear that they only agreed to represent purposeful press.defendants contend that,under case law,an attorney representation of a corporate entity does not give rise to an implied relationship with the individual shareholders of the entity.see generally koo rubio restaurants,th,koo t he attorney for a corporation represents it,its stockholders and its officers in their representative capacity.he in nowise represents the officers or shareholders personally la jolla cove motel hotel apartments,superior court th,la jolla cove motel i n representing a corporation,an attorney client is the corporate entity,not individual shareholders or directors,and the individual shareholders or directors can not presume that corporate counsel is protecting their interests skarbrevik cohen,england whitfield d,skarbrevik c orporate counsel direct duty is to the client corporation,not to the shareholders individually.defendants assert that because there is no evidence that an relationship was ever created between sprengel and defendants,her claims do not arise from an relationship and do not sound in legal malpractice claims.
defendants arguments regarding the absence of an relationship with sprengel improperly conflate the first and second prongs of the section test.the sole inquiry under the first prong of the test is whether the plaintiff claims arise from protected speech or petitioning activity.castleman,supra,th at.in making this determination,w e do not consider the veracity of the plaintiff allegations id.at nor do we consider m erits based arguments.freeman,supra,th at m erits based arguments have no place in our threshold analysis of whether plaintiffs causes of action arise from protected activity see also coretronic,supra,th at a rguments about the merits of the claims are irrelevant to the first step of the analysis.if the defendant demonstrates the plaintiff claims do arise from protected activity,we then review the potential merits of the plaintiff claims in the second step of the analysis.episcopal church cases cal th,if the court finds the defendant has satisfied the first prong,it then must consider whether the plaintiff has demonstrated a probability of prevailing on the claim.however,w here defendant can not meet his threshold showing,the fact he might be able to otherwise prevail on the merits under the probability step is irrelevant.freeman,supra,th at.whether sprengel actually shared an relationship with defendants relates to the merits of her claims and is therefore not relevant to our first prong analysis.although the defendants may ultimately defeat sprengel claims by proving the absence of an relationship,that does not alter the substance of her claims.see peregrine,supra,th at the court must focus on the substance of the plaintiff lawsuit in analyzing the first prong of a special motion to strike.
because we agree with the trial court finding that defendants failed to establish plaintiff claims arise from protected petitioning activity,we need not address the second step of the analysis.see hunter,supra,th at if the defendant does not meet its burden on the first step,the court should deny the motion and need not address the second step.
disposition 
the trial court order denying appellants special motions to strike is affirmed.respondent shall recover her costs on appeal.
perluss,dissenting.
the first step in the process in ruling on a special motion to strike under code of civil procedure section is to decide whether the defendant has made a threshold showing that the challenged cause of action is one arising from protected activity.the moving defendant burden is to demonstrate that the act or acts of which the plaintiff complains were taken in furtherance of the defendant right of petition or free speech under the united states or california constitution in connection with a public issue as defined in the statute.equilon enterprises consumer cause,cal th,accord,oasis west realty,llc goldman cal th,see city of cotati cashman cal th,i n the context,the critical point is whether the plaintiff cause of action itself was based on an act in furtherance of the defendant right of petition or free speech.
a lawyer prelitigation and activities on behalf of a client constitute protected speech or petitioning activity within the meaning of section.rusheen cohen cal th,briggs eden council for hope opportunity cal th,see coretronic cozen th.yet,as the majority opinion accurately states,numerous appellate decisions have held actions based on an attorney breach of professional and ethical duties owed to a client fail to satisfy the first prong of the section analysis and are not subject to a special motion to strike even though protected litigation activity features prominently in the factual background castleman sagaser th,in fact,even though,as here,the lawyer defendants conduct that gives rise to their asserted liability the alleged breaches of fiduciary duty and violations of ethical standards consisted almost entirely of protected activities.see,loanvest i,llc utrecht th,legal malpractice action alleging breach of fiduciary duty based on attorney conflict of interest in representing client in litigation not subject to special motion to strike under freeman schack th,claim that attorney abandoned client in order to represent party with adverse interest in same and different litigation not subject to motion kolar donahue,mcintosh hammerton th,malpractice claim alleging attorney incompetent handling of lawsuit not subject to motion.why 
a comprehensive explanation for this development was set forth by our colleagues in the sixth district in prediwave simpson thacher bartlett llp th,prediwave in determining the applicability of the statute,we think a distinction must be drawn between clients causes of action against attorneys based upon the attorneys acts on behalf of those clients,clients causes of action against attorneys based upon statements or conduct solely on behalf of different clients,and nonclients causes of action against attorneys.in the first class,the alleged speech and petitioning activity
