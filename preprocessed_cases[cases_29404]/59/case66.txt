introduction 
plaintiff and appellant broadway victoria,llc plaintiff sued its former attorneys,norminton,wiita,fuster,thomas norminton,and thomas norminton,pc defendants for legal malpractice and breach of fiduciary duty arising from defendants representation of plaintiff in an earlier breach of contract action.on appeal from a judgment in favor of defendants,plaintiff contends that the trial court erred when it granted defendants nonsuit motions on one of plaintiff malpractice claims and its breach of fiduciary duty claim.plaintiff also contends that the trial court abused its discretion in denying plaintiff motion in limine to exclude evidence of alleged prior fraud by failing to weigh the prejudicial effect of that evidence against its probative value,as required under evidence code section section.
in the published portion of this opinion,we affirm the grant of nonsuit on plaintiff breach of fiduciary claim because plaintiff did not adduce any evidence in support of that claim beyond the evidence offered in support of its malpractice claim for professional negligence.we also affirm the judgment in all other respects.
background 
i.the underlying breach of contract action 
because plaintiff malpractice and breach of fiduciary duty claims arise from defendants representation of plaintiff in an underlying suit against a for breach of contract,we first discuss the events giving rise to the breach of contract claim and the results of that lawsuit.
a.the lease and right of first refusal 
plaintiff,a limited liability company in the business of owning and leasing commercial real estate,was owned by anita lorber lorber and her husband lorber and her husband also owned a textile manufacturing business,lorber industries of california,lorber industries.
in,lorber industries leased a parcel of industrial land the lease in carson the property from elixir industries elixir.the lease for the property provided,inter alia,that lorber industries had a right of first refusal,if,during the term of the lease,elixir received an offer to buy the property,elixir was required to provide lorber industries written notice of the offer,which lorber industries then had the right to match.the lease also included an option to purchase the property at the end of the lease and an attorney fees provision entitling the prevailing party in any lease dispute to recover its attorney fees.
after lorber industries entered into the lease,plaintiff constructed a square foot industrial building on the property.plaintiff spent between and million to construct the building.
in,elixir sold the property to sahm broadway property,llc sahm.according to lorber,elixir never provided lorber industries with written or oral notice that elixir was selling the property to sahm 
lorber industries bankruptcy 
in february,lorber industries filed a voluntary petition under chapter of the bankruptcy code.in june,lorber industries filed a motion in the bankruptcy court seeking an order authorizing it,as,to assume and assign the lease to sahm or the highest bidder.plaintiff,represented by the law firm of buchalter nemer buchalter,made the highest bid for the lease assignment.in august,the bankruptcy court granted lorber industries motion and entered a stipulated order authorizing lorber industries to assume the lease and assign it to plaintiff.the order provided that plaintiff was assigned the lease for the following consideration a credit bid of,based on the settlement of a million secured claim against the bankruptcy estate filed by lorber an guaranty by lorber a payment and a release between plaintiff,lorber,and other entities,on the one hand,and lorber industries,the creditors committee,and the bankruptcy estate,on the other.the stipulated order further provided that the bankruptcy court retained jurisdiction to determine all matters arising from the implementation of that order.
plaintiff sues elixir in state court 
according to lorber,in september,she first learned through her real estate broker that elixir had sold the property to sahm.in october,defendants,through attorney thomas norminton norminton,agreed to represent plaintiff concerning its claim against elixir for selling the property without providing plaintiff an opportunity to exercise its right of first refusal.there was no written retainer agreement governing that representation.
in late october,in the superior court of los angeles county,defendants filed on behalf of plaintiff a complaint against elixir,alleging breach of contract elixir action.plaintiff alleged that it had purchased all of lorber industries rights under the lease,including lorber industries cause of action against elixir for breach of the right of first refusal provision.according to plaintiff,elixir breached the right of first refusal provision when it sold the property to sahm without providing lorber industries with notice of the sale.in january,elixir filed an amended answer that asserted an affirmative defense alleging that plaintiff lacked standing to bring the suit.
in april,elixir filed a motion for judgment on the pleadings on the ground that plaintiff did not have standing to sue for breach of the right of first refusal provision.according to elixir,plaintiff lacked standing because such standing reside d with the bankruptcy trustee.defendants opposed the motion on plaintiff behalf,arguing that the assignment of the lease to plaintiff passed the cause of action against elixir to plaintiff.in june,the trial court denied the motion for judgment on the pleadings.the trial court also denied elixir subsequent motions to amend its discovery response that admitted elixir had no facts to support its affirmative defense based on lack of standing.
in january,elixir filed a motion for summary judgment,again asserting that the assignment of the lease to plaintiff did not include the cause of action against elixir for breach of the right of first refusal provision.plaintiff opposed the motion,maintaining that the cause of action transferred to plaintiff as part of the lease assignment.
in may,the trial court granted elixir summary judgment motion,concluding that neither the motion to approve assignment of the lease nor the stipulated bankruptcy court order approving the assignment transferred the cause of action against elixir as part of the lease assignment to plaintiff.in august,the court of appeal affirmed the trial court order granting elixir summary judgment motion and,in november,the supreme court denied plaintiff petition for review.
in connection with the elixir action,plaintiff ultimately paid defendants approximately in attorney fees and costs for services rendered.in addition,plaintiff paid elixir to settle elixir claim for attorney fees as the prevailing party pursuant to the lease attorney fees provision.
ii.the instant malpractice suit 
in november,plaintiff sued defendants for legal malpractice and breach of fiduciary duty in connection with the elixir action.in june,plaintiff filed the operative first amended complaint asserting the same causes of action.
plaintiff malpractice claim included the following two theories of legal malpractice that are relevant to this appeal defendants failure to advise plaintiff of a potential claim it had against buchalter for purported malpractice in the bankruptcy case over buchalter handling of the right to sue elixir in connection with the assignment of the lease to plaintiff and defendants failure to seek in the bankruptcy court clarification of whether the cause of action against elixir was included in the lease assignment instead of litigating the issue in the elixir action.the breach of fiduciary duty claim was based on the exact same conduct and acts alleged as the basis for the malpractice claim.
the matter proceeded to jury trial in april following the presentation of plaintiff,defendants filed motions for nonsuit on the breach of fiduciary duty claim and on that part of the legal malpractice claim based on the alleged failure to advise plaintiff about a potential malpractice claim against buchalter.following argument on the nonsuit motions,the trial court ruled that defendants did not have a duty to advise plaintiff about a potential malpractice claim against buchalter and that,in any event,defendants advised plaintiff to consult a legal malpractice attorney about such a claim.the trial court also granted the nonsuit motion on the breach of fiduciary duty claim.
following the completion of trial on plaintiff remaining malpractice claim that defendants negligently failed to seek clarification of plaintiff rights in the bankruptcy court,the jury returned a special verdict finding that defendants did not breach any duty of care owed to plaintiff in representing plaintiff on its claims against elixir for breach of the lease.the trial court entered judgment on the verdict,and plaintiff filed a timely notice of appeal.
discussion 
defendants motions for nonsuit 
a defendant is entitled to a nonsuit if the trial court determines that,as a matter of law,the evidence presented by plaintiff is insufficient to permit a jury to find in his favor.campbell general motors cal d.in determining whether plaintiff evidence is sufficient,the court may not weigh the evidence or consider the credibility of witnesses.instead,the evidence most favorable to plaintiff must be accepted as true and conflicting evidence must be disregarded.the court must give to the plaintiff evidence all the value to which it is legally entitled,indulging every legitimate inference which may be drawn from the evidence in the plaintiff favor,at.a mere scintilla of evidence does not create a conflict for the jury resolution there must be substantial evidence to create the necessary conflict.witkin,cal.procedure ed.trial,italics in original.in reviewing a grant of nonsuit,we are guided by the same rule requiring evaluation of the evidence in the light most favorable to the plaintiff.carson facilities development cal d.we will not sustain the judgment unless interpreting the evidence most favorably to plaintiff case and most strongly against the defendant and resolving all presumptions,inferences and doubts in favor of the plaintiff a judgment for the defendant is required as a matter of law,quoting mason peaslee d.nally grace community church cal d.

nonsuit on malpractice claim 
plaintiff contends that the trial court erred when it granted the nonsuit motion on its malpractice claim arising from defendants failure to advise plaintiff that it might have a potential malpractice claim against buchalter for its handling of the assignment of the lease in the bankruptcy action.we find no error because defendants had no duty to so advise plaintiff.
attorney duty of care 
to prove a legal malpractice cause of action,the plaintiff must show a duty by the attorney to use such skill,prudence and diligence as members of his or her profession commonly possess and exercise breach of that duty a proximate causal connection between the breach and the resulting injury and actual loss or damage resulting from the attorney negligence.citations redante yockelson th.
with respect to an attorney duty of care,an attorney may have a duty to advise a client about related matters that fall outside the scope of the representation.a n attorney who undertakes one matter on behalf of a client owes that client the duty to at least consider and advise the client if there are apparent related matters that the client is overlooking and that should be pursued to avoid prejudicing the client interests.e ven when a retention is expressly limited,the attorney may still have a duty to alert the client to legal problems which are reasonably apparent,even though they fall outside the scope of the retention.citations.janik rudy,exelrod zieff th,janik.
the existence and scope of duty are legal questions for the court.merrill navegar,cal th.
defendants had no duty to advise of potential malpractice suit 
the evidence during plaintiff established that,when lorber met with norminton to hire defendants to represent plaintiff,the scope of such representation was to sue elixir for breach of the right of first refusal provision in the lease.norminton agreed to that representation as discussed.thus,the duty to provide advice concerning malpractice by buchalter in the bankruptcy action fell outside the scope of the representation established by the evidence at trial 
moreover,although an attorney may have a duty to advise a client about related matters beyond the scope of the representation,if such matters present legal problems that are reasonably apparent janik,supra,th at,the evidence presented during plaintiff did not demonstrate that a claim against buchalter for malpractice should have been reasonably apparent to defendants.to the contrary,although the trial court ultimately found in the elixir action that plaintiff lacked standing,that summary judgment ruling came after defendants had successfully opposed both elixir motion for judgment on the pleadings based on lack of standing and elixir motion to amend its discovery response that admitted elixir had no facts to support its affirmative defense based on lack of standing.plaintiff own expert,christopher rolin,testified that the california supreme court decision in national reserve metropolitan trust cal d holding that,in the absence of any contra indication by the parties,assignment of a contract also transfers any causes of action arising from the contract,supported the position that the cause of action against elixir transferred with the lease assignment approved by the bankruptcy court,thereby conferring plaintiff with standing.given the seemingly close call throughout the litigation over whether plaintiff had standing,we can not conclude that it should have been reasonably apparent to defendants that buchalter had committed malpractice when handling the assignment of the lease in the bankruptcy action.
indeed,as was made clear from an email from norminton to lorber that was introduced at trial,legal malpractice is a specialty,and norminton was not a malpractice attorney plaintiff expert rolin also confirmed that norminton was not a malpractice lawyer.by contrast,the testimony of plaintiff other expert,march,who opined that buchalter handling of the lease assignment in the bankruptcy action fell below the standard of care,proves the point march rendered that opinion based on her service as a federal bankruptcy court judge for years,followed by years of bankruptcy law practice.it is simply not reasonable to conclude that an attorney in norminton position would have been alerted to a potential claim for malpractice against buchalter for its actions in the bankruptcy proceedings.see nichols keller th,noting that f oreseeability of harm is a chief factor in deciding whether a duty arose.
because we conclude that a claim for malpractice against buchalter would not have been reasonably apparent to defendants under the circumstances,defendants did not have a duty to advise plaintiff of such a claim.we therefore affirm the trial court grant of nonsuit on this claim of malpractice against defendants 
nonsuit on fiduciary duty claim 
plaintiff contends the trial court erred when it granted the nonsuit motion on its breach of fiduciary duty claim.that claim was premised on plaintiff theory that,in order to generate greater attorneys fees by continuing to litigate the issue of standing in state court,defendants did not inform plaintiff of the potentially faster and cheaper option of seeking in the bankruptcy court clarification of whether the assignment of the lease to plaintiff included the right to bring the breach of contract action against elixir.we conclude that nonsuit was properly granted on this claim.
breach of fiduciary duty 
the elements of a cause of action for breach of fiduciary duty are existence of a fiduciary duty breach of the fiduciary duty and damage proximately caused by the breach.pierce lyman th,d.stanley richmond th.
the scope of an attorney fiduciary duty may be determined as a matter of law based on the rules of professional conduct which,together with statutes and general principles relating to other fiduciary relationships,all help define the duty component of the fiduciary duty which an attorney owes to his or her client.mirabito liccardo th,d david welch erskine tulley d.whether an attorney has breached a fiduciary duty to his or her client is generally a question of fact.david welch erskine tulley,supra,d at.expert testimony is not required id.at,but is admissible to establish the duty and breach elements of a cause of action for breach of fiduciary duty where the attorney conduct is a matter beyond common knowledge id.at mirabito liccardo,supra,th at see also day rosenthal d.stanley richmond,supra,th at.
a breach of fiduciary duty is a tort claim entirely distinct from a malpractice claim based on professional negligence.barbara john d,budd nixen cal d,elements of cause of action for professional negligence.beyond mere allegations of professional negligence,a cause of action for breach of fiduciary duty requires some further violation of the obligation of trust,confidence,loyalty to the client.mallen smith,legal malpractice,f iduciary breach allegations that constitute negligence,which do not implicate a duty of confidentiality or loyalty,and are merely duplicative of a negligence cause of action,do not support a cause of action for fiduciary breach.
it appears that no california court has explicitly held that a breach of fiduciary duty claim can not merely duplicate a claim for professional negligence.see buehler sbardellati th,fn.noting there is authority for the view the breach of fiduciary duty theory is separate from the professional negligence theory but leav ing any resolution of this separate cause of action question to another case.in other jurisdictions,however,there appears to be universal agreement that a breach of fiduciary claim can not stand if it is merely based on duplicative allegations of professional negligence by the attorney.see,pippen pederson and houpt,finding breach of fiduciary duty claim duplicative where plaintiff negligence and breach of fiduciary duty claims share the same operative facts and injuries and those injuries were actually caused by defendant allegedly negligent acts cosmetics plus group,traub,w e find that the cause of action for breach of fiduciary duty was properly dismissed as duplicative of the legal malpractice claim.it arose out of the same facts as the legal malpracice claim crist loyacono so d,the law recognizes a clear distinction between allegations of legal malpractice based on negligence sometimes called a breach of the standard of care and those based on breach of fiduciary duty sometimes called a breach of the standard of conduct illinois national ins.wiles,boyle,burkholder bringardner,ohio,ohioapp.lexis,at affirming grant of summary judgment against plaintiff on breach of fiduciary duty claim where n o other alleged conduct occurred apart from that forming the basis of the legal malpractice claim nettleton stogsdill,because plaintiff claim for breach of fiduciary duty was based on the same operative facts and alleged the same injury as her claim for legal malpractice,the dismissal of plaintiff breach of fiduciary duty claim was appropriate pereira thompson,noting that the two claims are distinct because a n attorney negligence claim concerns competence and a breach of fiduciary claim concerns loyalty murphy gruber,this court has differentiated between claims against a lawyer for professional negligence and breach of fiduciary duty aller law office of carole schriefer,when a legal malpractice claim and a breach of fiduciary duty claim arise from the same material facts,the breach of fiduciary duty claim should be dismissed as duplicative and vallinoto disandro,distinguishing between malpractice claim and claim for breach of fiduciary duty.
moreover,we have found no authority in this jurisdiction or elsewhere concluding otherwise.indeed,neither party to this appeal has disputed this proposition.
we also note that,in an analogous context,our courts have adopted the principle that,if a tort cause of action for insurance bad faith is based solely upon the facts which give rise to a related contract cause of action,no separately actionable tort claim is stated.if the allegations do not go beyond the statement of a mere contract breach and,relying on the same alleged acts,simply seek the same damages or other relief already claimed in a companion contract cause of action,they may be disregarded as superfluous as no additional claim is actually stated.careau security pacific business credit,d,see also congleton national union fire ins.d.
accordingly,we conclude that,when the basis for a claim of breach of fiduciary duty arises from the same facts and seeks the same relief as the attorney negligence claim for malpractice,the claim for breach of fiduciary duty is duplicative and should be dismissed.
plaintiff evidence 
plaintiff expert kathleen march testified that there was an alternative to litigating in state court the issue of whether the lease assignment transferred the cause of action for breach of the right of first refusal provision.march testified that plaintiff could have filed in the bankruptcy court a motion for clarification of whether that cause of action transferred to plaintiff as an incident of the lease assignment because the order granting the assignment explicitly retained jurisdiction over enforcement of the order and gave the parties the right to return to bankruptcy court for that purpose.according to march,a motion for clarification in the bankruptcy court would have been heard within days of service and filing,or perhaps on shortened time.
plaintiff expert christopher rolin testified that defendants had a duty to communicate the bankruptcy court option to plaintiff because it was a direct path to the determination of whether the accrued cause of action had transferred to plaintiff as an incident of the lease assignment.according to rolin,the decision of whether to proceed in state court or seek bankruptcy court clarification was a big decision such that defendants should have advised plaintiff of the risks,the costs,and the likelihood of success in the bankruptcy court.rolin opined that because state court litigation was an expensive proposition,it should have been diagrammed for the client.he concluded that,by failing to advise plaintiff of the option to seek bankruptcy court clarification,while continuing to litigate the issue in state court,defendants breached the fiduciary duty owed to plaintiff.
lorber testified that she never received any written communication from norminton in which he discussed the option of returning to the bankruptcy court for clarification of the stipulated bankruptcy court order.lorber also maintained that norminton did not advise her of this option in any of their meetings or telephone conversations regarding the elixir action.
in his testimony,norminton confirmed that he never communicated the bankruptcy court option to plaintiff in writing.norminton also testified that he was aware of the bankruptcy court retention of jurisdiction at the time he filed the elixir action and that he never had any question in his mind that plaintiff could have gone back to bankruptcy court,whether it was under the stipulated bankruptcy court order or in another way,to seek clarification.norminton further testified that,although he did not consider the bankruptcy court option at the time he filed the elixir action,he did certainly consider,at length,that option later,and thought about it a number of times over the course of days and weeks,but ultimately decided not to seek bankruptcy court clarification.
plaintiff evidence did not establish a claim for breach of fiduciary duty 
drawing all inferences in favor of plaintiff,the evidence presented in plaintiff showed that norminton was aware of and considered the bankruptcy court option the option would have been less expensive and more expeditious than the state court litigation strategy pursued by defendants and norminton chose not to pursue the bankruptcy court option,but did not inform plaintiff through lorber or otherwise.such evidence,without more,does not establish a breach of fiduciary duty claim.
we recognize the evidence adduced by plaintiff might have been suffici
