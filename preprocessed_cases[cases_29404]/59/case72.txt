factual and procedural background 
as client patent counsel,firm one duties included obtaining patent rights in all applicable foreign countries.in june or july,firm one informed client that it failed to timely file applications for patent rights in japan and brazil.in august,firm one admitted that it was negligent.on september,client retained firm two for the purpose of investigating whether firm one negligence in failing to timely file the patents in japan and brazil amounted to legal malpractice.
on november,firm one received a fax from firm two stating that client was making a malpractice claim against it.firm two requested that firm one tender this claim to your insurance carrier.
on november,firm one sent an email to client stating that,in view of the malpractice claim,it must withdraw as counsel.consequently,the firm relationship with client is terminated forthwith,and we no longer represent it with regard to any matters.firm one continued,please tell us immediately where we should send client files,and we will arrange for their delivery.you should retain patent counsel to handle your patent matters.
in a november,letter to firm one,client requested that firm one immediately make all necessary preparations and take all necessary actions to deliver all of client files to lucas wenthe at armstrong teasdale,llp.client had previously engaged the services of armstrong teasdale to render legal work,primarily in the realm of trademarking.in the letter client noted it would be helpful to transfer all electronic files by,and remaining original hard copies where electronic copies are available by.the concluding sentence states,client sincerely appreciates the services provided by firm one.on november,client emailed to firm one a signed copy of the request for transfer of files from firm one to lucas wenthe at armstrong teasdale,llp.
on november,firm one emailed a letter to client stating pursuant to your request,this will confirm that we have terminated the attorney client relationship with you w e are no longer representing you with regard to your patent matters.as requested,we are transferring your files to lucas wenthe of armstrong teasdale,llp.on the same date,firm one sent to armstrong teasdale via fedex a cd with all pertinent gotek energy files.in its opening brief,client alleges that the record clearly establishes that on november,firm one transferred to client its files.
steven herbruck,client chief executive officer,testified that he believed the relationship with firm one had ended on november,b ecause the files had been transferred.as far as we were concerned,then they no longer represented us on any matters.
the following year,on november,client filed the malpractice action against firm one.in its motion for summary judgment,firm one argued that the statute of limitations began to run no later than november,when client consented to the termination of the relationship and demanded that its files be sent to its replacement patent counsel.thus,the complaint filed on november,was too late.
in its ruling granting the motion for summary judgment,the trial court reasoned arguably,the relationship ended on november,but it clearly terminated the following day when client responded to the letter telling firm one where to send its files.following that correspondence,a reasonable client would no longer entertain the belief that firm one would provide further legal services.the administrative functions the transfer of client files to replacement counsel that took place after november,were not legal services and therefore do not change this result.
