herman minkin and h m aeronaut tool company,h m collectively minkin,allege that the law firm of gibbons,gibbons committed legal malpractice in prosecuting the patent application for a hand tool called extended reach pliers erp.in early,patent the patent issued to minkin,the sole inventor,based on an application written and prosecuted by gibbons.the danaher tool company danaher,a minkin customer,subsequently developed its own version of the erp based on a simple design around and began competing against the minkin device.minkin sued gibbons,alleging that the patent was so negligently drafted that it offered no meaningful protection against infringers.in the malpractice litigation,minkin expert proposed alternate claim language that allegedly could have been patented and enforced against danaher.the district court granted summary judgment in favor of gibbons,finding that minkin failed to raise a genuine dispute of material fact regarding causation,a necessary element in new jersey legal malpractice cases.minkin gibbons,dist.lexis,at.because minkin did not raise a genuine dispute of material fact as to the patentability of its alternate claims,we agree that the causation element was not shown as a matter of law and we affirm.
background 
minkin worked as an airplane mechanic,serving in the united states navy and as an employee of several airlines.in the,he devised a tool that could reach deep inside airplane engines without disassembling external components.the erp was designed with two pivots instead of one such that the jaws could grip in very narrow areas.minkin drew a sketch of his erp,reproduced below 
in,minkin sought to patent his invention and retained the gibbons law firm minkin gave the prosecuting attorneys access to his sketches,a working prototype,and a prior art search conducted years earlier by an independent firm.the search revealed at least eleven relevant prior art patents,many teaching multipivoted gripping tools dating back to the nineteenth century.as a measure,minkin requested that gibbons not supplement the prior art search.
gibbons prepared and filed application the application with the united states patent and trademark office pto on june.the application included three independent claims claims,and and several dependent claims.originally filed claim was directed to a tool having two handles joined by a first pivot,and two jaw elements joined by a second pivot.the claimed length of the long end of the handle was twice as long as the short end,and the claimed length of the working end of the jaw was at least twice as long as the tail end of the jaw.
the examiner rejected all claims in an office action dated october,citing,inter alia,anticipation and obviousness under and.the examiner relied primarily on a reference she uncovered,patent brindos,disclosing tiehandling tongs.brindos was cited by the examiner for both the b and a rejections original claims and were rejected as anticipated by brindos the balance of the claims were rejected as obvious over brindos alone or in combination with teachings of other prior art references.
gibbons responded to the office action with an amendment dated december,the amendment.the amendment added the following language to the end of claim wherein the distance between the second end and said first pivot on each handle element is at least three times longer than the distance between said tail end and said second pivot on each jaw element.joint appendix.plainly stated,the amendment required a minimum ratio between the lengths of the components connecting the two pivots of the erp.the amendment,minkin argued,provided for an increased mechanical advantage previously unavailable.minkin,dist.lexis,at.
the examiner issued another office action dated april.while the amendment successfully overcame the anticipation rejection,brindos was again cited by the examiner as the basis for a continuing obviousness rejection,now including amended claim.the examiner stated that even though brindos did not disclose the relative lengths of the handles as claimed in the application,it would have been obvious to one of ordinary skill in the art at the time the erp was made to have placed the pivot points in the claimed locations.brindos was also cited in view of other prior art,including patent grieshaber,zlotnicki,and neff to reject as obvious the remainder of minkin claims.
on august,gibbons filed a,serial the cip application,and abandoned the application.the cip application carried forward claim as modified in the amendment,added drawings,and included a declaration directed to the examiner earlier obviousness rejections.
the examiner conducted an interview on july.during the interview,the examiner handled a working erp prototype and,as minkin tells it,indicated that one day every mechanic would have an erp in their toolbox and that a patent would issue on minkin cip application.following the interview,the examiner noted on the record that she had changed her opinion as to patentability,but provided no reasons.the patent issued on january,with the pivot ratio limitation at the end of independent claim figure of the patent,is reproduced below 
minkin,through his company,h m,began manufacturing and marketing the patented erp.by,major tool companies,including danaher a supplier for downstream retailers such as sears and napa,were significant customers.minkin,dist.lexis,at.in mid,however,minkin learned that danaher had successfully designed around the constraints of the patent to make and sell its own version of the erp.minkin,recognizing that the danaher tool was as it avoided the ratio for the pivots,sued gibbons for patent prosecution malpractice in state court.
the case was removed to the united states district court for the district of new jersey.id.at.minkin alleged that gibbons committed malpractice by negligently drafting the claims in the patent so narrowly as to offer virtually no protection against competitors,resulting in damages.id.at.the district court applied state law and this court guidance that an essential element of minkin causation proof would be to show that hypothetical alternate claims would have been patentable.id.at citing davis brouse mcdowell.the parties agreed that for such a patentability determination in new jersey,the trial court should perform a or analysis.see minkin,dist.lexis,at.
to prove the patentability of alternate claims with additional breadth,minkin offered the expert testimony of richard gearhart gearhart,a patent attorney.minkin introduced two expert reports prepared by gearhart.the initial expert report offered two alternate claims for the minkin erp,which gearhart asserted could have been patented 
an article of manufacture,comprising 
two handles,each handle having a holding end,a handle intermediate point,and a connecting end,the handles being pivotably connected at the handle intermediate point 
two jaw pieces,each jaw piece having a gripping end,a jaw intermediate point,and a second connecting end,the handles being pivotably connected at the jaw intermediate point 
wherein each connecting end is pivotably connected to a second connecting end and 
the distance between the handle intermediate point and the connecting end is greater than the distance between the second connecting end and the jaw intermediate point.
a device comprising 
a first pair of parallel arms having a first connecting end and a handle end,said first parallel arms able to swing about a first offset hinge,said first offset hinge located between said first connecting end and said handle end 
a second pair of parallel arms having a straight clasping end and a second connecting end,said second set of parallel arms able to swing about a second offset hinge,said second offset hinge located between said straight clasping end and said second connecting end 
each said second connecting end being capable of forming an offset hinge by attaching to each said first connecting end and 
a motion of said first pair of parallel arms about said first offset hinge being capable of causing a mutual motion of said second pair of parallel arms about said second offset hinge.
both of gearhart alternate claims notably eliminated the ratio limitation added by gibbons through the amendment.the initial gearhart expert report mentioned no prior art except for brindos,and indicated nothing about the impact of the prior art on the patentability of the alternate claims other than to state that they would have avoided the cited prior art.minkin,dist.lexis,at.
on december,a page supplemental gearhart expert report was served.the supplemental report compares the alternate claims to prior art in the context of anticipation,but there was no discussion of nonobviousness.id.at.in deposition,gearhart testified that his analysis of the prior art in the expert reports was limited to patentability under and that he had not,for various reasons,addressed whether his alternate claims would have been allowed under.id.
gibbons moved for summary judgment pursuant to federal rule of civil procedure.in granting the summary judgment motion,the district court found that 
gearhart utterly fails to provide any sort of analysis with respect to the alleged nonobviousness of his claims and gives no opinions or explanation showing why his claims would not be deemed obvious.he makes no attempts to set forth the content of the prior art,to describe how the sample claims differ from the prior art,nor even to identify the level of ordinary skill in the field.indeed,he makes nothing more than a bald assertion that his samples would have avoided the prior art without explaining what he means by this,how he arrived at such a conclusion,or how it relates to obviousness.as such,this statement is merely an inadmissible net opinion that fails to shed any light on the question of obviousness.
minkin,dist.lexis,at.the district court also noted concessions by gearhart himself,including that he had no particular opinions on the topic of nonobviousness,and that a nonobviousness analysis would have taken too long,and would have been too difficult for his colleagues to read.id.at.indeed,found the court,gearhart admits that it would be very speculative to say the pto would have issued his sample claims.id.at.
the district court concluded that minkin expert did not provide any sort of evidence demonstrating that his sample alternative claims are.as such,he has failed to provide the necessary proof that a patentable alternative to the patent exists.id.at.accordingly,the district court held that minkin did not carry its causation burden,an essential element of a new jersey malpractice claim,and entered judgment as a matter of law.id.minkin timely appealed.
ii.discussion 
jurisdiction 
analyzing jurisdiction,the district court found that a substantial question of federal law exists and that resolution of this question by the federal courts will not disrupt the balance of power between state and federal government.id.at.neither party contends that jurisdiction is lacking.notwithstanding,we have an obligation to satisfy ourselves that there is jurisdiction on appeal.mansfield,coldwater lake.ry.swan,immunocept,llc fulbright jaworski,llp.
state law patent attorney malpractice cases inherently pose complex jurisdictional issues they require our careful consideration,for example,to ensure the existence of a substantial question of federal patent law.nevertheless,this court binding precedent recognizes our jurisdiction in patent attorney malpractice cases such as this one,in which the plaintiff is required to establish that,but for attorney negligence,he would have obtained valid claims of sufficient scope that competitors could not easily avoid.see see also air measurement techs,akin gump strauss hauer feld.in immunocept,for example,this court held that jurisdiction is proper where allegedly negligent patent drafting allowed competitors to avoid narrow claim scope by a simple work around.at.and in davis,this court held that jurisdiction is proper if in order to succeed the plaintiff must establish that it would have received a patent but for attorney negligence during prosecution.at see also warrior sports,dickinson wright.we conclude that our exercise of jurisdiction in this case is proper under a.
suit within asuit analysis 
the crux of minkin allegations is that gibbons negligently drafted patent claims overly narrow in scope,constituting legal malpractice.because state law creates minkin cause of action for legal malpractice,this court must apply the law of new jersey to decide whether gibbons is liable.see,warrior sports,at applying michigan law davis,at ohio law air measurement,at texas law.to establish legal malpractice in new jersey,a variation on the tort of negligence,a plaintiff must demonstrate in its the existence of an relationship imposing a duty of care upon the attorney breach of that duty,defined as deviation from the standard of care proximate causation and damages.see garcia kozlov,seaton,romanini brooks,conklin hannock weisman.this case hinges on the third prong,that is,whether gibbons actions proximately caused the loss to minkin.
new jersey law provides several ways of establishing proximate causation in malpractice cases,including a.garcia,at.the approach applies where recovery depends on success in the underlying matter and aims to clarify what would have taken place but for the attorney malpractice.see also conklin,at cause in fact is sometimes referred to as but for causation the simplest understanding of cause in fact in attorney malpractice cases arises from the concept.new jersey trial courts commonly employ this approach where the parties agree to that process.garcia,at.
there can be no causation demonstrated under the rubric for patent prosecution malpractice where any claim drawn to the alleged invention would have lacked patentability ab initio.davis,at.thus,a required element of the causation proof is for the plaintiff to demonstrate that the invention would have been patentable.see id.at.malpractice suits in a patent prosecution context most frequently arise where attorney negligence results in a final pto rejection.here,minkin complains not that a patent did not issue,but that the allowed claims were drafted too narrowly to protect the erp against competitors,namely danaher.because the parties agree that the analysis applies,minkin must prove by preponderant evidence that alternate claim language would have been deemed patentable by the pto and that it would have read on the danaher tool.id.requiring plaintiff to prove by a preponderance of evidence that the pto would have issued a patent on the invention but for attorney negligence in preparing and filing the application warrior sports,at requiring plaintiff to prove proximate causation by showing that it would have prevailed in an infringement suit against the competitor garcia,at requiring plaintiff in a format to prove by a preponderance of evidence that he would have recovered a judgment in an action against the main defendant see also byrne wood,herron evans,llp,app x,in the context of a malpractice suit in which a plaintiff alleges that,but for the attorney negligence,he would have obtained broader patent claims,a plaintiff must show that broader patent claims would have been held patentable on examination in the pto,in accordance with the criteria of patentability applied during examination.quoting davis,at.
the patentability of minkin alternate claims 
in granting summary judgment,the district court held that minkin failed to raise a genuine dispute of material fact regarding patentability.specifically,minkin provided no evidence showing that gearhart alternative claim language would have overcome an obviousness rejection at the pto.see minkin,dist.lexis at in short,gearhart has entirely failed to provide any evidence demonstrating that his sample claims are not obvious.
