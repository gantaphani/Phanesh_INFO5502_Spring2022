in this legal malpractice action,plaintiff village nurseries appeals from a summary judgment entered in favor of defendants martin greenbaum,dennis ferentz,greenbaum ferentz collectively the greenbaum defendants,raymond king,and the coulombe law firm.the trial court granted the greenbaum defendants motion for summary judgment on the ground that plaintiff claims were barred by the judgmental immunity doctrine.in order to establish judgmental immunity,a defendant must prove the law was unsettled at the time professional advice was rendered,and the advice was based upon the exercise of informed judgment.because neither the greenbaum defendants nor the coulombe law firm showed they exercised informed judgment when they rendered professional advice to village nurseries,they failed to establish the second prong of the judgmental immunity test and were not entitled to summary judgment on that basis.
the greenbaum defendants and the coulombe law firm moved for summary judgment on the ground the statute of limitations barred village nurseries claims,but the trial court denied those motions.we conclude village nurseries claims against the greenbaum defendants and the coulombe law firm were barred by the statute of limitations pursuant to code of civil procedure section.therefore,we affirm judgment in their favor.
village nurseries retained defendants for legal advice and services regarding perfection of liens on real property.village nurseries was actually injured by defendants alleged malpractice when a bankruptcy trustee asserted a viable argument against the validity of village nurseries liens on the ground they were not properly perfected.village nurseries should have discovered the facts constituting defendants wrongful acts or omissions and their link to the trustee position when attorney king informed village nurseries that its liens may be invalid because a statutory notice had not been served,the trustee argued the liens were unperfected,the judge in the case expressed doubt as to the validity of the liens,and village nurseries should look into the possibility of legal malpractice.section was not tolled as to the greenbaum defendants and the coulombe law firm because their representation of village nurseries ceased months before the complaint was filed.
defendant raymond king notices of joinder in the summary judgment motions of the greenbaum defendants and the coulombe law firm were not motions seeking judgment in favor of king as required by code of civil procedure section.king did not file a separate statement.we therefore reverse the grant of summary judgment in favor of king.
chronology 
village nurseries,a landscape and irrigation systems contractor,was retained by baldwin building contractors baldwin to provide services for various properties in orange and san diego counties the baldwin projects.in july,baldwin filed for chapter bankruptcy protection,but its owners continued doing business as debtors in possession.village nurseries continued to perform services for the baldwin projects and recorded several mechanic liens for amounts owed village nurseries in connection with such services.
in august,village nurseries retained attorney raymond king of coulombe,kottke king for legal advice regarding the ramifications of the baldwin bankruptcy and its impact on village nurseries ability to collect receivables on the baldwin projects.in september,tom house,president of village nurseries,wrote a letter to king,stating,i am concerned about the cost of perfecting the recorded liens we have against baldwin work.we were told by one of our suppliers that they were able to inexpensively accomplish this through a service that filed notices of perfection of security interest with the bankruptcy court per section code.house was referring to a notice pursuant to the bankruptcy code under title united states code section b section b,which has been interpreted to provide where state law requires commencement of an action to accomplish perfection,or maintenance or continuation of perfection of an interest in property and the action has not been commenced prepetition,perfection of such interest shall be maintained or continued,by giving notice within the time fixed by such law for such commencement.in re baldwin builders.
king responded to house by letter dated october,which stated,in response to your inquiry regarding a cost effective means of perfecting mechanics liens,i do not believe the bankruptcy code section procedure outlined in your september,letter will be effective.to my knowledge,that section provides a means for notifying parties in a bankruptcy that a lien is claimed.however,i believe that the only means to perfect a mechanic lien is to file suit in the appropriate state court in the county where the property is located.italics omitted.
in october,village nurseries retained the greenbaum defendants to perfect various mechanic liens previously filed by village nurseries on the baldwin projects.after advising house that filing foreclosure lawsuits would perfect village nurseries liens,the greenbaum defendants filed complaints to foreclose on the mechanic liens in orange and san diego counties the foreclosure actions,but did not serve the complaints or otherwise prosecute the actions because of the automatic stay imposed by the baldwin pending bankruptcy action.on january,village nurseries filed a proof of claim in the baldwin bankruptcy,which listed its mechanic liens with a total value of.
village nurseries continued to perform work for baldwin through may.in june,baldwin was removed as debtor in possession and a trustee the trustee was appointed.shortly thereafter,the bankruptcy court approved an allocation order including a procedure to pay the secured creditors in the baldwin bankruptcy.the trustee also submitted a joint plan of reorganization,providing that mechanic lienholders,including village nurseries,were considered secured creditors and would be paid on a periodic basis.
about the same time,village nurseries rehired king as its bankruptcy law specialist to address the ongoing issues of the maintenance and perfection of its mechanic liens.in july,king and coulombe,kottke king terminated their professional affiliation with each other.king set up his own practice and took the village nurseries file with him.at some point thereafter,coulombe,kottke king became the coulombe law firm.on august,the greenbaum defendants were formally substituted out as counsel for village nurseries,and raymond king was substituted in as counsel in the foreclosure actions.
the trustee filed a motion to transfer baldwin toyon park property to the city of anaheim free and clear of liens.king opposed the motion on behalf of village nurseries,arguing this transfer did not adequately protect the interests of village nurseries as a lienholder on that property.at the hearing on the motion on august,the trustee argued it appeared village nurseries failed to file a section b notice regarding its liens and if it failed to do so,its lien is history.judge riblet granted the trustee motion.
judge riblet stated she had serious doubts whether village nurseries liens on the property were properly perfected,the trustee motion to transfer toyon park was rather urgent,and village nurseries would not be harmed by the transfer because the trustee was required to provide replacement liens for disenfranchised lienholders.judge riblet declined to rule on the validity of village nurseries liens because that issue was not before the court and required additional legal research.the same day,king contacted house and advised him that village nurseries should immediately refile its liens on toyon park so king could file a section b notice.village nurseries refiled its liens later that afternoon,but the refiling was untimely.
according to village nurseries verified interrogatory responses,in early september,king and house discussed judge riblet statement doubting the liens validity.during this discussion,king expressed the gravity of the judge statement,suggested village nurseries consider obtaining another attorney due to king lack of success and rapport with judge riblet,and stated village nurseries may want to look into the possibility of malpractice given the judge statement re our lien status.king also told house that in his view the steps already taken to perfect the liens were appropriate and village nurseries would eventually prevail.
on october,king sent house a letter stating that during the august hearing the trustee argued that village nurseries liens were unperfected and judge riblet questioned the validity of the liens,expressing her view that the filing of foreclosure actions was insufficient to perfect lien interests.in his letter,king expressed his concern that the claims of village nurseries are being targeted for exclusion from payment on a theory that they are unperfected lien claims.
pursuant to the allocation order,village nurseries received payments on certain of its baldwin projects liens from october,through september.however,there is no evidence that village nurseries received any payments related to its toyon park liens after august.
by,village nurseries had not been provided any replacement liens.in may,village nurseries filed a motion to compel the trustee to comply with the court order.the motion was heard on september,at which time the court denied the motion on the ground that village nurseries liens were invalid because village nurseries failed to serve a section b notice required to perfect its mechanic liens on toyon park.
four months later,on january,village nurseries filed its complaint for legal malpractice.village nurseries also filed an appeal of judge riblet september,decision with the united states bankruptcy appellate panel.on march,the appellate panel affirmed judge riblet ruling,holding that village nurseries mechanic liens were invalid because its foreclosure complaints were void as violations of the automatic stay and village nurseries failed to satisfy the notice requirements of section b.in re baldwin builders,supra,at.
b.the summary judgment motions 
in march,the greenbaum defendants filed a motion for summary judgment based on judgmental immunity and the statute of limitations.the coulombe law firm then filed a motion for summary judgment on statute of limitations and vicarious liability grounds.on march,king served notices of joinder in the greenbaum defendants and the coulombe law firm motions for summary judgment.the trial court denied the motions on statute of limitations grounds,explaining,i did think that the plaintiff interrogatory response conclusively established knowledge as of august,because the plaintiff indicated that it was awaiting a ruling by the bankruptcy court,and that came later.the trial court also denied the coulombe law firm motion based on the argument it was not vicariously liable for defendant king conduct.
after the parties filed supplemental briefs on the issue of judgmental immunity at the court request,the trial court granted king request for joinder in the greenbaum defendants motion and granted the greenbaum defendants motion on the grounds of judgmental immunity.citing cost efficiency reasons,village nurseries stipulated at the hearing to an order granting judgment in favor of the coulombe law firm on judgmental immunity grounds as well,even though the coulombe law firm moved for summary judgment on other grounds and did not otherwise join in the greenbaum defendants motion.
village nurseries appealed.the greenbaum defendants on the ground the trial court should have also granted their summary judgment motion on the statute of limitations ground.
ii.discussion 
standard of review 
a trial court properly grants summary judgment where no triable issue of material fact exists and the moving party is entitled to judgment as a matter of law.citation.we review the trial court decision de novo,considering all of the evidence the parties offered in connection with the motion except that which the court properly excluded and the uncontradicted inferences the evidence reasonably supports.citation.in the trial court,once a moving defendant has shown that one or more elements of the cause of action,even if not separately pleaded,can not be established,the burden shifts to the plaintiff to show the existence of a triable issue to meet that burden,the plaintiff may not rely upon the mere allegations or denials of its pleadings but,instead,shall set forth the specific facts showing that a triable issue of material fact exists as to that cause of action citations.merrill navegar,cal th,d.
to speak broadly,all of the foregoing discussion of summary judgment law in this state,like that of its federal counterpart,may be reduced to,and justified by,a single proposition if a party moving for summary judgment in any action would prevail at trial without submission of any issue of material fact to a trier of fact for determination,then he should prevail on summary judgment.aguilar atlantic richfield cal th,d.
appealability of judgment 
the court june,order reflects its grant of summary judgment in favor of all defendants however,the judgment signed by the court the same day erroneously omitted the coulombe law firm.on october,the court signed an amended judgment,clarifying judgment had been rendered in favor of all defendants,including the coulombe law firm.the coulombe law firm points out village nurseries notice of appeal states that it appeals from the june,judgment.the coulombe law firm argued the judgment expressly rendered in its favor on october,is not before this court.the coulombe law firm then addressed the merits of the appeal.
the reviewing court may treat a notice of appeal filed after the superior court has announced its intended ruling,but before it has rendered judgment,as filed immediately after entry of judgment.cal.rules of court,rule d.pursuant to rule d,we treat plaintiff notice of appeal as filed immediately after entry of the amended judgment as to all defendants,including the coulombe law firm.lee newman,wells fargo bank th,d.
defendants were not entitled to summary judgment on the ground of judgmental immunity 
village nurseries contends the trial court erred in granting summary judgment based on the judgmental immunity doctrine.the doctrine immunizes attorneys from liability resulting from an honest error in judgment concerning a doubtful or debatable point of law.davis damrell d.t he controlling test for judgmental immunity invokes a inquiry whether the state of the law was unsettled at the time the professional advice was rendered and whether that advice was based upon the exercise of an informed judgment.ibid.
village nurseries directs its challenge to the first prong of the test,arguing the state of the law was not unsettled at the time defendants advised village nurseries about perfecting its mechanic liens after baldwin filed for bankruptcy protection.the parties cited authorities showing the extent to which the law was settled or unsettled during the relevant time period.we need not decide,however,whether defendants satisfied the first prong of the judgmental immunity test because they failed to establish the second they exercised informed judgment at the time they advised village nurseries.
in smith lewis cal d,the california supreme court explained that the judgmental immunity doctrine does not apply unless an attorney establishes both the unsettled state of the law that was the subject of professional advice and the attorney efforts to perform reasonable research in an effort to ascertain relevant legal principles and to make an informed decision as to a course of conduct based upon an intelligent assessment of the problem.id.at.thus,in determining whether to grant summary judgment based on the judgmental immunity doctrine,it is a n attorney who has conducted a thorough,contemporaneous research effort,demonstrated detailed knowledge of legal developments and debate in the field,and made a decision which represented a reasoned exercise of an informed judgment grounded upon a professional evaluation of applicable legal principles,who may be entitled to judgment as a matter of law.stanley richmond,supra,th,d.
in aloy mash,supra,cal d,our supreme court reversed a grant of summary judgment based on defendant failure to establish the second prong of the judgmental immunity test,holding,defendant,by contrast,relied on a single case for the proposition that a nonmatured military pension was not subject to division on dissolution in sum,this is not a case where the defendant attorney,basing his judgment on all available data,made a rational professional judgment not to claim an interest in the husband pension.rather,he acted more precisely,failed to act on an incomplete reading of a single case,without appreciating the vital difference between a member of the armed forces who has not yet served long enough to be eligible to retire and one who has but chooses to stay in the service in sum,the record on which the motion for summary judgment was argued presented a triable issue of negligence.id.at.
here,the greenbaum defendants and the coulombe law firm separate statements do not address whether they performed any legal research or considered any particular authorities before advising village nurseries.the record is also silent regarding defendants experience in this area of the law.defendants do not present any evidence establishing the second prong of the test but merely conclude in their briefs it has been satisfied.
defendants argue because their conduct was consistent with treatises,it necessarily follows their actions were based on informed judgment.we disagree.they wrongly suggest that once the first prong is established,the second prong of the judgmental immunity test is no longer required or is automatic.defendants must establish not only that the law was unsettled,but also that they conducted sufficient research and analysis to exercise informed judgment.
on the one hand,defendants suggest because there was no ninth circuit law on the subject of section b notices in the context of perfecting mechanic liens at the time they advised village nurseries,there was nothing to research before exercising informed judgment.on the other hand,defendants cite cases and treatises which,they argue,support their interpretation of the law.defendants hoist themselves on their own petard they establish by their own argument the existence of relevant authorities they could have consulted before exercising judgment.
we disagree with defendants contentions that king october,letter to house,stating that section b procedures would not perfect village nurseries mechanic liens,indicates king was exercising informed judgment.neither king letter nor any evidence in the record reveals king performed any any defendant relied on any this issue at the time king rendered his advice to village nurseries in october.king cited marsh,california mechanics lien law in support of his interpretation of section b during the august,hearing before judge riblet however,king reference to an authority almost one year later does not establish an exercise of informed judgment at the time he advised village nurseries in.
defendants also argue plaintiff failed to set forth in its separate statement any evidence showing the attorneys did not do what the treatises advised and did not draw upon their knowledge,skill,experience,training,and general understanding of the law.but defendants moved for summary judgment in this case,and thus it is their burden to show village nurseries can not establish its cause of action against the other way around.code of civil procedure section,subdivision o provides,in part a defendant or has met his or her burden of showing that a cause of action has no merit if that party has shown that one or more elements of the cause of action,even if not separately pleaded,can not be established,or that there is a complete defense to that cause of action.once the defendant or has met that burden,the burden shifts to the plaintiff or to show that a triable issue of one or more material facts exists as to that cause of action or a defense thereto.italics added.because defendants failed to introduce any evidence supporting the second prong of the judgmental immunity doctrine,the burden never shifted to village nurseries to show that a triable issue of fact exists on this point.
we conclude summary judgment should not have been granted based on judgmental immunity.therefore,we need not address village nurseries arguments that the doctrines of collateral estoppel and judicial estoppel also preclude judgment by application of the judgmental immunity doctrine.for the same reason,we need not address village nurseries objections to evidence presented by defendants in support of their motions for summary judgment based on a judgmental immunity theory.
village nurseries claims against the greenbaum defendants and the coulombe law firm are barred by the statute of limitations of code of civil procedure section 
code of civil procedure section,subdivision a and village nurseries contentions 
e ven if summary judgment was granted on an incorrect basis,we must affirm if it would have been proper on another ground.barkley city of blue lake th,d.thus,we next consider whether the trial court should have granted the motions for summary judgment on statute of limitations grounds.
the statute of limitations for claims of legal malpractice is set forth in code of civil procedure section.in relevant part,code of civil procedure section,subdivision a provides an action against an attorney for a wrongful act or omission,other than for actual fraud,arising in the performance of professional services shall be commenced within one year after the plaintiff discovers,or through the use of reasonable diligence should have discovered,the facts constituting the wrongful act or omission,or four years from the date of the wrongful act or omission,whichever occurs first.in no event shall the time for commencement of legal action exceed four years except that the period shall be tolled during the time that any of the following exist the plaintiff has not sustained actual injury the attorney continues to represent the plaintiff regarding the specific subject matter in which the alleged wrongful act or omission occurred 
village nurseries argues its claims are not because it did not sustain actual injury as a result of defendants alleged wrongful acts or omissions until september when the bankruptcy court determined its liens were invalid a triable issue of fact exists regarding when it discovered or reasonably should have discovered defendants alleged wrongful acts or omissions in light of king assurances that village nurseries liens were properly perfected and the statute was tolled because a triable issue of fact exists as to whether defendants continued to represent village nurseries.we disagree with these arguments as they relate to the greenbaum defendants and the coulombe law firm.
village nurseries sustained actual injury as a result of defendants alleged malpractice no later than august,
there is no rule to apply in determining when actual injury has occurred within the meaning of code of civil procedure section.adams paul cal th,d.instead,actual injury issues require examination of the particular facts of each case in light of the alleged wrongful act or omission.jordache enterprises,brobeck,phleger harrison cal th,d,fn.jordache.although it is well settled that determining when actual injury occurred is predominantly a factual inquiry,w hen the material facts are undisputed,the trial court can resolve the matter as a question of law in conformity with summary judgment principles.id.at,d.
our supreme court explained in jordache,supra,cal th,d,that in determining actual injury,t he inquiry necessarily is more qualitative than quantitative because the fact of damage,rather than the amount,is the critical factor.id.at,d.although t he mere breach of a professional duty,causing only nominal damages,speculative harm,or the threat of future yet realized does not constitute actual injury under the statute,actual injury may consist of impairment or diminution,as well as the total loss or extinction,of a right or remedy.id.at,d.
in jordache,plaintiff alleged that defendant committed malpractice by failing to advise plaintiff to tender a complaint filed against it to its insurance carrier.jordache,supra,cal th at,d.as a result of defendant omission,significant time passed before plaintiff tendered the complaint to the insurer.id.at,d.the insurance carrier argued that plaintiff late tender relieved its obligation to provide benefits.ibid.plaintiff initiated litigation against the insurer regarding the coverage issue and the viability of the insurer late tender defense.ibid.plaintiff did not file its professional malpractice claim against defendant until after resolution of the coverage litigation.id.at,d.
in evaluating when actual injury occurred under code of civil procedure section,our supreme court in jordache concluded that in addition to incurring legal fees to prosecute the coverage dispute,defendant alleged omissions also gave the insurers an objectively viable defense jordache,supra,cal th at,d,which consequently reduced those insurance claims settlement value id.at,d.because the insurer objection rendered plaintiff claims immediately less valuable than they were prior to the assertion of such defense and because the defense arose as a result of plaintiff counsel omission,plaintiff was actually injured within the meaning of section at the time the insurer defense was asserted.id.at,d.it does not matter whether a plaintiff is able to quantify the amount by which its claims were devalued at the time such a defense accrued and was asserted because actual injury may well precede quantifiable financial costs.adams paul,supra,cal th at,fn,d.
here,defendants failed to advise village nurseries in that a section b notice was necessary to perfect and maintain its mechanic liens on toyon park and other baldwin properties.at the august,hearing on the trustee motion to transfer toyon park,the trustee questioned the validity of village nurseries interests in toyon park and asserted the objectively viable argument that village nurseries liens were not perfected due to the lack of a section b notice.judge riblet expressed her doubt the liens were perfected without the section b notice.following the reasoning in jordache,the settlement value of village nurseries claims for payment on its liens was reduced and thus impaired at the moment the trustee questioned the validity of the liens on august.the trustee position was asserted as a result of defendants failure to perfect village nurseries mechanic liens on toyon park.therefore,village nurseries sustained actual injury as a result of that act or omission no later than august.
in light of the foregoing,we reject village nurseries argument that it did not sustain actual injury until the bankruptcy court ruled that the liens were invalid in september.as discussed in jordache,a plaintiff need not suffer a complete loss of a right or reach final adjudication of an issue to sustain actual injury pursuant to code of civil procedure section.jordache,supra,cal th at,d,t he result of jordache coverage litigation could only confirm,but not create,jordache actual injuries from the late tender of the complaint to the insurer.jordache right to an defense existed or not when that action first embroiled jordache.the right to that insurance benefit,the impairment of that right,and jordache expenditures while that right was unavailable,did not arise for the first time when jordache settled with the insurers.
we also reject village nurseries contention that it sustained only speculative harm until september because it received various payments from the trustee as a secured lienholder following the august,hearing.village nurseries did not show it received any payment related to its toyon park liens from the trustee after august.in fact,its own verified interrogatory responses show the opposite,stating village nurseries received approximately against other liened projects,thereby indicating village nurseries was not paid on its toyon park liens.italics added.
we conclude that village nurseries sustained actual injury within the meaning of code of civil procedure section no later than august.
village nurseries reasonably should have discovered the facts constituting defendants alleged wrongful acts or omissions no later than october 
village nurseries argues that the statute of limitations did not begin to run on its malpractice claims against defendants until judge riblet september ruling invalidated its toyon park liens.village nurseries contends it did not discover and should not have discovered the facts constituting defendants wrongful acts or omissions until then.
under code of civil procedure section,the period is triggered by the client discovery of the facts constituting the wrongful act or omission,not by his discovery that such facts constitute professional negligence,by discovery that a particular legal theory is applicable based on the known facts.it is irrelevant that the plaintiff is ignorant of his legal remedy or the legal theories underlying his cause of action.worton worton d.
village nurseries retained king for advice regarding perfecting and maintaining its mechanic lien interests in the baldwin projects and to protect and preserve those interests.village nurseries retained the greenbaum defendants to perfect its mechanic liens.the wrongful acts or omissions alleged by village nurseries in its complaint were defendants failures to properly advise village nurseries and otherwise perfect its mechanic liens.the uncontradicted evidence shows that at a minimum,no later than october,village nurseries constructively discovered the facts underlying the defendants wrongful acts or omissions and their link to the trustee position that the liens were unperfected and invalid.
in september,house wrote a letter to king asking about section b notices with regard to perfecting village nurseries mechanic liens.king replied that section b notices are not effective to perfect mechanic liens i do not believe the bankruptcy code section procedure outlined in your september,letter will be effective.instead,king advised,the only means to perfect a mechanic lien is to file suit village nurseries retained the greenbaum defendants to file foreclosure lawsuits in an effort to perfect its mechanic liens.
after the august,hearing,king contacted house and requested that village nurseries immediately refile its toyon park liens so that king could file a section b notice to ensure the liens validity.village nurseries refiled its liens later that same afternoon,but the filing was untimely.
king informed house in september and october of that village nurseries liens on toyon park may not have been properly perfected by defendants.in its interrogatory responses verified by house,village nurseries specifically admitted,in a phone conversation with king on september,he suggested the gravity of the judge statement re the validity of the liens,and that we should consider looking for another attorney to handle the case,and we may want to consider consulting another attorney re what had been done to date.in another verified interrogatory response,village nurseries stated that in early september,king said we should consider obtaining another attorney for the case due to his lack of with judge riblet.additionally,he stated that village may want to look into the possibility of malpractice given the judge statement re our lien status.italics added.
additional notice of defendants wrongful acts or omissions was contained in a letter from king to house,which house admitted was sent to him o n or about october.in that letter,king stated,in part as you know,at the hearing on august,judge riblet of the bankruptcy court granted the trustee motions including the motion to transfer the toyon park property free and clear of mechanic liens.while the trustee attorney made an argument that village nurseries mechanic lien claims are unperfected,that was not the basis for the court ruling.she specifically found that all mechanic lien claims were adequately protected by a replacement lien on the surrounding homes.however,the court did note that she followed a view of the law that perfection of the mechanic liens under state law by filing suit might be insufficient and a violation of the automatic stay of the bankruptcy code.at least one authority marsh on mechanic liens takes
