background 
in,george and janis garlock purchased an eighty percent interest in the limited trust,which owned the laundromat business.the remaining twenty percent interest was held by the realty trust trust,which owned the laundry equipment and held title to the real property.appellants penelope nicol and patricia washburn were joint trustees of the trust,and appellant terrence washburn was the beneficiary of this trust.
after the relationship between the garlocks and the washburns deteriorated,nicol and patricia washburn sued the garlocks in illinois state court on behalf of the trust.the garlocks filed a complaint against patricia washburn and nicol,as trustees of the trust,and against terrence washburn,individually and as a beneficiary of the trust.glen washburn also filed an action against the same three individuals,alleging that nicol and terrence washburn had misrepresented,concealed,and failed to disclose material facts regarding the ownership of the real property held by the trust.this action was consolidated with the suit involving the washburns and the garlocks.all of the individuals involved in these suits were illinois residents.
jerry soper represented the washburns in the proceedings.soper,licensed to practice law in both illinois and iowa,maintained his office in davenport,iowa.on june,soper participated in a hearing on the consolidated suits.during this hearing,the trial court encouraged the parties to settle,and soper engaged in settlement discussions on behalf of his clients.by the next day,the parties attorneys reached an agreement regarding all of the pending claims.according to the washburns,soper coerced them into agreeing to the terms of this settlement.
the illinois trial court entered an order dismissing both cases pursuant to the settlement agreement.on january,the washburns,through new counsel,moved to vacate this order.the washburns motion was denied,and their subsequent appeals were also unsuccessful.

in granting the firm motion for summary judgment,the district court determined that the iowa supreme court would apply the revised version of restatement second of conflict of laws restatement section if presented with the issue in accordance with revised section,illinois statute of limitations governs the washburns malpractice claim and this statute bars the washburns claim.on appeal,the washburns contend that iowa conflict of law rules require us to apply iowa statute of limitations to their claim,and that,even if illinois statute of limitations governs,it does not bar their claim as a matter of law.
applicable choice of law rule 
the washburns first argue that the district court applied the wrong choice of law provision.in this diversity case,we apply iowa choice of law principles.klaxon stentor.iowa rules generally require the application of local law to matters of procedure.cameron hardisty,iowa citing brooks engel,iowa.iowa courts have historically viewed statutes of limitations as procedural,and therefore a local matter.harris clinton corn processing,iowa.the iowa supreme court recognized that this approach was consistent with the general rules set forth in restatement section,which provided as follows 
an action will not be maintained if it is barred by the statute of limitations of the forum,including a provision borrowing the statute of limitations of another state.
an action will be maintained if it is not barred by the statute of limitations of the forum,even though it would be barred by the statute of limitations of another state,except as stated in.
id.the iowa supreme court also adopted the exception to the general rule of section,as found in section a n action will not be entertained in another state if it is barred in the state of the otherwise applicable law by a statute of limitations which bars the right and not merely the remedy.restatement second of conflict of laws restatement see harris,at.
in,sections and were revised and replaced with the following provision 
whether a claim will be maintained against the defense of the statute of limitations is determined under the principles stated in.in general,unless the exceptional circumstances of the case make such a result unreasonable 
the forum will apply its own statue of limitations permitting the claim unless a maintenance of the claim would serve no substantial interest of the forum and b the claim would be barred under the statute of limitations of a state having a more significant relationship to the parties and the occurrence.
restatement.iowa appellate courts have not yet had the opportunity to consider this revision.
the washburns contend that the district court erred in using the revised version of section to determine the applicable statute of limitations.they assert that there was no need for the district court to predict what the iowa supreme court would do,as that court has already addressed the issue.referring us to the harris and cameron cases,the washburns contend that iowa law requires application of the analysis embodied in the version of sections and.we disagree.
the supreme court has stated that w hen the highest court of a state has spoken,its pronouncement is to be accepted by federal courts as defining state law unless it has later given clear and persuasive indication that its pronouncement will be modified,limited or restricted.west am.citation omitted see gillette dairy,mallard,cir.as the firm notes in its brief,the iowa supreme court has repeatedly turned to the restatement in analyzing choice of law issues.see,veasley crst int,iowa noting,in the context of a personal injury case,that w e now follow the restatement most significant relationship methodology for choice of law issues citations omitted gabe constr,united capitol ins,iowa we determine issues in insurance policy cases by the intent of the parties or the most significant relationship test.citation omitted cole state auto.cas.underwriters,iowa we think it is clear that questions involving contract issues are now to be determined under the restatement second test intent of the parties or the most significant relationship.cameron,at iowa has adopted the modern choice of law rules with respect to tort issues see also grove principal mut.life ins,d,iowa has adopted the second restatement of conflicts as its provision.citing cole,at harlan feeders,grand,iowa applies the most significant relationship test to or questions involving either contract or tort claims.citations omitted.the iowa supreme court commitment to the restatement supplies the requisite clear and persuasive indication that it will modify its approach to conflicts involving statutes of limitations when presented with the issue.accordingly,we conclude that the district court applied the correct choice of law rule.
interest analysis under revised section 
next,the washburns contend that even if the district court was correct in concluding that the iowa supreme court would adopt the revised version of section,the court erred in applying this provision.under revised section,iowa longer limitations period will apply unless the following conditions exist maintenance of the claim would not serve any substantial interest of iowa,illinois has a more significant relationship to the parties and the occurrence,and the illinois statute of limitations would bar the cl
