background 
from july,to may,hall was the executive vice president and chief operating officer of incarnate word health services incarnate word,a company that operated hospitals in texas and missouri.as an employee of incarnate word,hall was covered by a group disability policy issued by hartford.under that policy,hall was eligible for benefits if he became totally disabled while employed at incarnate word.
on may,hall was injured in an automobile accident in particular,he suffered a whiplash injury and later complained of weakness in his extremities,loss of balance,and fatigue in the days following the accident,hall attended one staff meeting but did not otherwise return to work.on may,incarnate word notified hall that his employment would be terminated effective may.the termination was apparently unrelated to hall physical condition after the accident.
during and,hall consulted two physicians,and both indicated that he had become totally disabled on may,as a result of the automobile accident.in april,hall submitted a claim for disability benefits under the hartford policy,but hartford denied the claim.
in response to this denial,hall retained houston attorney harvill weller,on a basis.weller filed suit against hartford on hall behalf in bexar county,texas.when hall disagreed with certain recommendations that weller made concerning the case,their relationship began to suffer.in february,just a few months before the trial date,hall and weller decided to terminate their relationship.hall replaced weller with,a firm based in cleveland,ohio.hall chose because the firm had previously represented him in ohio in a similar lawsuit against new england mutual life insurance company.on april,hall and weller executed a mutual release and agreement to terminate legal relationship.under the terms of that agreement,hall reimbursed weller for his expenses and released him from malpractice liability weller,in turn,released hall from any claim for attorney fees.
the suit against hartford went to trial on june.during a hearing on unresolved pretrial matters,the state district judge granted hartford motion to exclude hall medical expert witnesses because his attorneys had not supplemented his responses to interrogatories relating to those witnesses.without medical experts,hall had no possibility of winning his case,so he settled with hartford for 
hall later filed this action against in texas state court,alleging that the firm failure to supplement discovery responses constituted legal malpractice.removed the case to federal court on the basis of diversity jurisdiction and then filed a complaint for contribution against weller.weller filed a motion for summary judgment,contending that he was released from all liability for potential malpractice claims in his april,agreement with hall texas law provides that no defendant has a right of contribution against a settling person and by virtue of the release,he was a settling person as a matter of law.the district court agreed that weller was a settling person under the relevant texas statute because he gave up his attorney fees in exchange for hall releasing him from malpractice liability.the court therefore granted weller motion for summary judgment and dismissed him from the case.
after dismissing weller from the case,and upon the parties consent,the district court assigned this case to a magistrate judge,who granted motion for summary judgment and dismissed hall complaint the magistrate judge concluded that the underlying suit was without merit because hall could not show that he was totally disabled as that term was defined in the hartford policy.hall appealed to this court,and we reversed and remanded,finding that he had presented sufficient evidence of his total disability to withstand summary judgment 
on remand,the parties filed for summary judgment on an affirmative defense of offset that had pleaded in its first amended answer.that defense was based on a provision of the hartford policy that permitted hartford to reduce the benefits it owed to hall by the amount of income benefits he had received from other sources as a result of his disability reasoning that a favorable damages award against hartford in the underlying suit would have been offset by hall other income benefits,argued that hall recovery in this action was likewise limited but hartford never pleaded its offset right as an affirmative defense in the underlying suit.hall therefore contended that hartford waived the defense and that,as a consequence,could not raise it in a malpractice action.the magistrate judge agreed that hartford failure to plead offset amounted to a waiver of that defense under texas law and further found that i n this case,hall measure of damages is the amount he would have received from the jury if his lawyers had properly prosecuted his claim,considering all the applicable affirmative defenses hartford pleaded in the underlying lawsuit and nothing more.in accordance with this finding,the magistrate judge entered an order granting hall for partial summary judgment and striking affirmative defense of offset.
this case went to trial in august.the jury returned a verdict in hall favor in the amount of and determined that was responsible for of the negligence that resulted in hall injuries and that weller was responsible for the remaining soon after the trial,the magistrate judge requested briefings from the parties to assist her in entering judgment on the verdict.contended in its brief,as it had throughout this action,that it was entitled to a settlement credit under b of the texas civil practice and remedies code equal to of the damages award.its theory was that hall had settled his malpractice claim against weller for that amount when they executed the mutual release.in her order on entry of judgment,the magistrate judge agreed that the mutual release was a settlement for purposes of b and that was entitled to a credit equal to the dollar amount of the settlement.the judge also agreed with that the dollar amount of the settlement was of hall damages award and reduced the award accordingly.
both parties filed timely notices of appeal.
ii.analysis 
we face two issues.first,hall contends that the mutual release was not a settlement and that,even if it was,the magistrate judge misapplied b of the texas civil practice and remedies code.second,challenges the magistrate judge order striking its affirmative defense of offset.the firm contends that texas law does not limit a malpractice defendant to the defenses actually raised in the underlying suit because both of these issues concern the magistrate judge application of texas law,our review is de novo 
settlement credit 
section b of the texas civil practice and remedies code provides that if a claimant in a tort action has settled with a person who bears some responsibility for his injuries,the trial court must reduce the claimant damages award to account for the settlement 
if the claimant has settled with one or
