under our supreme court holding in wiley county of san diego a convicted criminal defendant must allege actual innocence in order to state a cause of action for legal malpractice against former defense counsel.the issue before us is whether a convicted criminal defendant must allege actual innocence in order to state a cause of action against former defense counsel for breach of contract and related torts arising from a fee dispute between the parties.
when the primary rights asserted in the complaint are the rights to be billed in accordance with specific contractual provisions and to be free from unethical or fraudulent billing practices on the part of defense counsel,we hold a criminal defendant client need not allege actual innocence in order to state a cause of action for breach of contract,breach of fiduciary duty,fraud and money had and received.
facts and proceedings below 
plaintiff john reiner brought this action against his former attorneys bird,marella,boxer wolpert and individuals at that firm alleging breach of written contract,breach of fiduciary duty,fraud,and money had and received for purposes of reviewing a demurrer we accept as true the well pleaded facts in the complaint.the first amended complaint alleges in pertinent part 
reiner retained defendants by written contract to represent him in a criminal matter.defendants represented reiner from april to december,after which reiner discharged them and retained a different firm.in april,reiner was convicted of various criminal offenses.reiner does not allege in this action he was innocent of the charges for which he was convicted and he specifically renounces any claim defendants were negligent in their representation.
the written retainer agreement provides defendants will charge reiner only for services reasonably required.reiner alleges in breach of this provision defendants charged him an unconscionable fee by,among other things 
charging plaintiff for work defendants did not perform 
grossly overcharging plaintiff for work they did perform 
the time charged to plaintiff 
manufacturing work not to advance plaintiff cause but instead solely to increase their fees 
and double charging for costs and 
charging for costs not incurred on behalf of plaintiff.
defendants also breached other specific provisions of the contract including 
the agreement to bill reiner in minimal units of a tenth of an hour 
the agreement to use paralegals for tasks which did not require attorneys 
the agreement to bill reiner only for costs incurred in performing legal services under this agreement and 
the agreement to bill travel costs only for out of town travel.
reiner further alleges defendants breached their contract by billing for costs not provided for in the contract charging for meals that were not related to any work performed for plaintiff and and inflating the cost of meals.
in his claim for breach of fiduciary duty reiner alleges defendants breached their duties to exercise the utmost care,integrity,honesty,loyalty,good faith and candor with respect to their dealings and communications with plaintiff,to refrain from deception of any form,and to place plaintiff interests before their own interests by 
charging and collecting an unconscionable fee in violation of rule of the rules of professional conduct 
providing false and fraudulent responses to plaintiff inquiries regarding defendants billing and other practices and by concealing the true facts that would have alerted plaintiff to defendants misfeasance 
using block billing rather than separately list the time expended to perform each task 
not perform ing the work for which they charged plaintiff 
bill ing for costs not incurred on behalf of plaintiff and 
grossly inflat ing the time entries for work they did perform.
the fraud claim alleges on at least four separate occasions reiner wrote and spoke to defendants expressing his concerns regarding defendant firms use of block billing its vague descriptions of the work allegedly performed its apparently excessive fees and inflated billings for performing simple tasks its charging for unusual costs and its charging for costs that were not reimbursable under the contract.in response,reiner alleges d efendants falsely represented to plaintiff the use of block billing was the standard method of conveying invoice information that the time entries were honest and accurate and reflected work actually performed and the time actually spent to perform the tasks listed and that the designated costs set forth in the invoices were actually incurred on behalf of plaintiff and accurately charged to plaintiff.reiner alleges he justifiably relied on defendants representations and in reliance thereon paid each and every invoice,promptly and in full.according to reiner,if he had known the true facts he would have immediately terminated defendants representation and would not have continued to pay defendants invoices.
incorporating the breach of contract allegations by reference,the count for money had and received alleges defendants became indebted to plaintiff for money paid and expended to defendants at defendants insistence and request in excess of,plus prejudgment interest as of the date of each of plaintiff payments to defendants.
defendants demurred to each cause of action on the ground reiner did not and admittedly could not allege he was actually innocent of the crimes for which he was convicted and that he had obtained postconviction exoneration.defendants also demurred to the fraud cause of action on the ground the facts allegedly constituting fraud were not pled with sufficient specificity.
the trial court overruled the demurrers on the ground this is not a malpractice action and therefore wiley county of san and its progeny are inapposite.
defendants brought this petition for a writ of mandate ordering the trial court to vacate its ruling and issue a new ruling sustaining defendants demurrers without leave to amend.we issued an order to show cause and stayed further proceedings in the trial court.
discussion 
defendants contend a convicted client can not sue his defense attorneys over a fee dispute unless he alleges in the complaint he was actually innocent of the crime for which he was convicted and has obtained postconviction exoneration.reiner has not made either allegation with respect to this action.
in support of their demurrer,defendants relied on a trio of cases in which convicted criminal defendants sued their attorneys for legal malpractice wiley county of san diego coscia mckenna cuneo and lynch warwick 
under our supreme court opinions in wiley and coscia t he failure to provide competent representation in a criminal case may be the basis for civil liability under a theory of professional negligence only if the convicted client can establish actual innocence and exoneration by postconviction relief.in lynch,the court of appeal held the rule applies to any claim for legal malpractice even if the convicted client seeks only contract damages 
the court holdings in wiley and coscia were based principally on public policy considerations.a requirement of actual innocence prevents those convicted of crime from taking advantage of their own wrongdoing and shift ing much,if not all,of the punishment for their criminal acts to their former attorneys.requiring actual innocence and postconviction exoneration also recognizes the fact that i n the criminal malpractice context a defendant own criminal act remains the ultimate source of his predicament irrespective of counsel subsequent negligence.in sum,the court concluded,the notion of paying damages to a plaintiff who actually committed the criminal offense solely because a lawyer negligently failed to secure an acquittal is of questionable public policy and is contrary to the intuitive response that damages should only be awarded to a person who is truly free from any criminal involvement.
the court also identified practical considerations and pragmatic difficulties which support a requirement of actual innocence and exoneration.a civil matter lost through an attorney negligence is lost forever,the court observed.in contrast,a criminal defense lost through an attorney negligence can be corrected by postconviction relief in the form of an appeal or writ relief pragmatic difficulties include the difficulty in quantifying damages as,for example,in the case of a defendant whose counsel incompetence results in a longer sentence and the confusion which would arise when a jury has to decide by a preponderance of the evidence whether,but for the negligence of his attorney,another jury could not have found the client guilty beyond a reasonable doubt finally,the requirement for postconviction exoneration protects against inconsistent verdicts and promotes judicial economy by collaterally estopping frivolous malpractice claims in cases where the defendant has already been denied postconviction relief on the basis of ineffective assistance of counsel 
in lynch warwick,lynch,a convicted criminal defendant,sued warwick,his former defense counsel,for negligence,breach of contract and breach of fiduciary duty.his complaint alleged he paid warwick to represent him in several criminal matters.warwick advised lynch to plead guilty.lynch rejected this advice,fired warwick and retained new counsel at an additional cost of.after the second attorney also advised a guilty plea,lynch pled guilty to two charges.he then sued warwick alleging defendant failed to perform the professional services for which he was retained.specifically,the complaint alleged warwick failed to interview key witnesses,sought unnecessary continuances,failed to prevent the loss or destruction of evidence,failed to establish a relationship of trust and confidence with plaintiff and failed to adequately communicate with plaintiff about the case 
lynch breach of contract cause of action sought to recover the he had paid to warwick.the breach of fiduciary duty cause of action sought general and punitive damages.the trial court granted warwick motion for summary judgment on the ground lynch could not show facts establishing his actual innocence.on appeal,lynch argued the actual innocence requirement should not apply at least insofar as he sought to recover the fees he paid to warwick because he was not seeking damages for being wrongfully convicted or receiving a longer sentence and the damages he was seeking were quantifiable,losses.
the court of appeal rejected lynch attempt to avoid the actual innocence requirement.regardless of how he labeled his causes of action,lynch is seeking recovery for legal malpractice.therefore,even if his damages were limited to expenses,proof of his case would involve the same public policy considerations and pragmatic difficulties which underlie the actual innocence requirement.lynch complaint alleged that had warwick exercised proper care,skill and diligence,lynch would have received a proper or reasonable defense with respect to the underlying criminal charges.by claiming warwick conduct caused him to lose meritorious defenses lynch put his guilt or innocence in issue.moreover,he sought to shift the blame to warwick for his lack of a meritorious defense rather than accepting his responsibility for having committed the crimes the court also concluded even if lynch sought only quantifiable,losses,the trial would involve the same difficulties in proving causation which exist when the plaintiff seeks general damages for wrongful conviction or a longer sentence.in addition,the jury would be faced with the same pragmatic difficulty in applying a preponderance of the evidence standard to issues treated under a reasonable doubt standard 
finally,the court in lynch noted there is a remedy other than a legal malpractice action through which a former criminal defendant client can recover fees unlawfully collected by defense counsel.the client can seek fee arbitration through the state bar 
defendants in the present case urge us to follow the holding in lynch and order the trial court to sustain their demurrers because reiner complaint does not allege he was actually innocent of the charges against him and that he has been exonerated by postconviction relief.reiner,like lynch,claims he incurred fees for services not performed.like lynch,he seeks to recover the fees paid as well as general and punitive damages.and,like lynch,he can not prove his claims without producing or refuting evidence bearing on his guilt or innocence.reiner,like lynch,has an available remedy against defendants through state bar arbitration of the fee dispute.
we conclude,however,the present case is distinguishable from lynch and the actual innocence rule does not apply here.
as the court in lynch recognized,the nature of a cause of action does not depend on the label the plaintiff gives it or the relief the plaintiff seeks but on the primary right involved it is clear from the allegations in lynch complaint the primary right involved in his suit against warwick was the right to competent legal representation it is equally clear from the allegations in reiner complaint the primary rights involved in his suit against the defendants are the right to be billed in accordance with the terms of the retainer agreement and the right not to be subjected to unconscionable,fraudulent or otherwise unlawful billing practices 
although,broadly speaking,it could be said both complaints sought damages for professional services not performed,the professional services not performed by warwick involved failing to interview key witnesses,failing to preserve evidence,and failing to enforce his client right to a speedy trial conduct clearly implicating warwick duties of competence and due care in the representation of lynch on the charges against him.in contrast,the professional services which allegedly were not performed by defendants in the case before us involved not performing the work they claimed they performed,not incurring the costs they claimed they incurred,not using paralegals to perform tasks when appropriate,not confining bills for travel costs to travel,and similar nonfeasance which does not implicate defendants competence and due care in their representation of reiner on the criminal charges against him.indeed,reiner complaint specifically renounces any claim defendants conduct or the quality of defendants services affected the outcome of the criminal case.
a fee dispute between a convicted criminal defendant client and his former counsel does not entail the policy considerations which arise from a malpractice suit.the client does not seek to shift the punishment for his criminal acts to his former counsel nor is the client own criminal act the ultimate source of his predicament as evidenced by the fact a client acquitted of the criminal charges against him could have suffered the same unlawful billing practices as reiner.furthermore a fee dispute between client and counsel does not give rise to the practical problems and pragmatic difficulties inherent in a malpractice action brought by a convicted criminal defendant client.in litigation over a fee dispute there is no difficulty in quantifying damages for a wrongful conviction or a longer prison sentence and there is no problem of applying a standard of proof within a standard of proof.a judgment for the client in a fee dispute is not inconsistent with a judgment for the people in the criminal case.and,there is no duplication of effort since a fee dispute obviously can not be resolved through postconviction relief.
courts in other states which have adopted the actual innocence rule in criminal malpractice cases have recognized the rule does not automatically apply to every dispute between a convicted client and former counsel.in morris margulis for example,a convicted criminal defendant sued his former attorneys claiming,among other things,they had breached their fiduciary duty to him by disclosing privileged communications to the prosecution.the court concluded applying the actual innocence rule to such a case would be unconscionable and held the actual innocence rule will not be applied to situations where an attorney wilfully or intentionally breaches fiduciary duties he owes to his criminal defense client.in labovitz feinberg the court reversed a summary judgment in favor of the d
