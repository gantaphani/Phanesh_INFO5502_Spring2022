standard of review 
review of demurrer on grounds of bar of statute of limitations 
on appeal from a judgment of dismissal following the sustaining of a demurrer without leave to amend,the reviewing court must accept as true not only those facts alleged in the complaint but also facts that may be implied or inferred from those expressly alleged.marshall gibson,dunn crutcher th,d.a demurrer on the ground of the bar of the statute of limitations will not lie where the action may be,but is not necessarily barred.moseley abrams d.liptak diane apartments,d.it must appear clearly and affirmatively that,upon the face of the complaint,the right of action is necessarily barred.valvo university of southern california d.mangini d.this will not be the case unless the complaint alleges every fact which the defendant would be required to prove if he were to plead the bar of the applicable statute of limitation as an affirmative defense.farris merritt cal.
standard of review for judicial notice 
under section of the evidence code,reviewing courts have both a mandatory duty and a discretionary power to take judicial notice.a reviewing court is required to take judicial notice of any matter the trial court has properly judicially noticed or should have judicially noticed,subd.a.however,a reviewing court is not required to take judicial notice of such matters in the same tenor as that used by the trial court,subd.a.
in determining the propriety of taking judicial notice of a matter,or its tenor,the reviewing court has the same power the trial court has under.b.jefferson,cal.evidence benchbook ed,at.
ii.judicial notice of truth of facts in court records 
judicial notice is the recognition and acceptance by the court,for use by the trier of fact or by the court,of the existence of a matter of law or fact that is relevant to an issue in the action without requiring formal proof of the matter.jefferson,cal.evidence benchbook,supra,at.the court may in its discretion take judicial notice of any court record in the united states.this includes any orders,findings of facts and conclusions of law,and judgments within court records.see,columbia cas.northwestern ins.d.day sharp d.however,while courts are free to take judicial notice of the existence of each document in a court file,including the truth of results reached,they may not take judicial notice of the truth of hearsay statements in decisions and court files.williams wraxall th,fn,d.courts may not take judicial notice of allegations in affidavits,declarations and probation reports in court records because such matters are reasonably subject to dispute and therefore require formal proof.see,magnolia square homeowners ass safeco ins.d.
the underlying theory of judicial notice is that the matter being judicially noticed is a law or fact that is not reasonably subject to dispute,subd.f post prati d.by making an order establishing the law of the case,it seems that the facts are no longer in dispute and can therefore be considered true as set forth in an order,findings of fact,or conclusions of law.jefferson,cal.evidence benchbook,supra,at.such facts would not be the proper subject of judicial notice.ibid.
the appropriate setting for resolving facts reasonably subject to dispute is the adversary hearing.it is therefore improper for courts to take judicial notice of any facts that are not the product of an adversary hearing which involved the question of their existence or nonexistence.jefferson,cal.evidence benchbook,supra,at.a litigant should not be bound by the court inclusion in a court order of an assertion of fact that the litigant has not had the opportunity to contest or dispute.ibid.
the impropriety of taking judicial notice of the truth of factual findings not stemming from an adversary hearing is aptly illustrated in people rubio d.disapproved on other grounds in people freeman cal d.in rubio,the defendant was charged with robbery.when the defendant failed to appear at a hearing,the magistrate issued an order stating the defendant had done so without sufficient excuse.at trial,the prosecution requested the trial court take judicial notice of the magistrate minute order as evidence of the defendant flight and guilt.the trial court took judicial notice of the minute order and the defendant was subsequently convicted.the court of appeal reversed the conviction,stating the trial court erred in taking judicial notice of the truth of facts asserted in the minute order.judicial notice of the truth of the facts asserted in the minute order was improper because the magistrate finding was made without an adversary hearing.
the court in people tolbert elaborated the principle set forth in rubio.in tolbert,the court determined that it was improper for the trial court to have judicially noticed the truth of a magistrate findings in a preliminary examination.the court reasoned that a magistrate is not the ultimate trier in fact,nor are his findings binding on the superior court if unsupported by substantial evidence.people tolbert d.
here,the order sustaining the demurrer is premised upon law office assertion it did not represent lockley in connection with the c law office proof for this assertion comes from footnote of the court of appeal modified concurring opinion and the trial court below took judicial notice of the truth of this proof.there is nothing,however,in the record before us which demonstrates the finding asserted in footnote was the product of an adversary hearing.furthermore,there is no evidence lockley was given the opportunity to contest or dispute this finding.as such,we are unable to conclude that the court of appeal finding in footnote of the modified concurring opinion,was based on an adversary hearing that involve d the question of the existence or nonexistence of that fact.in addition,we fail to find any substantial evidence in the instant record to support the proposition law office did not provide lockley legal representation in connection with the c r agreement.lockley correctly points out the absence of law office signature on the c r agreement does not indisputably prove law office did not advise lockley with regard to the agreement.on the contrary,lockley complaint alleges richard cantrell,an attorney at law office,advised him to execute a c r agreement with city.lockley complaint further alleges law office had a duty to advise him on all related claims and statute of limitations in the event city breached the agreement.consequently,having been neither contested,nor supported by substantial evidence,the court of appeal finding remains reasonably subject to dispute.in sum,the trial court erred in taking judicial notice of the truth of the finding.
it is one thing to recognize the court of appeal made factual findings with regard to law office legal representation of lockley in connection with the c r negotiations.it is another to assert those factual findings are indisputably true.the only facts not reasonably subject to dispute in the court of appeal modified opinion are that the opinion exists and that the court added a factual finding in a footnote to the concurring opinion.whether law office represented lockley in connection with the c r negotiations is still reasonably subject to dispute.we therefore conclude that until the finding asserted in footnote of the court of appeal modified concurring opinion is contested in a proper adversary hearing and supported by substantial evidence,it is not the proper subject of judicial notice.
nevertheless,law office cites weiner mitchell,silberberg knupp d.for the proposition courts may take judicial notice of pertinent facts and judgments stated in appellate opinions.in weiner,the plaintiff hired attorneys to represent him in a securities fraud investigation.the plaintiff was subsequently indicted and convicted of securities fraud.the plaintiff sued the attorneys for legal malpractice.in demurring to the plaintiff second amended complaint,the attorneys requested the trial judge to take judicial notice of facts pertaining to plaintiff securities fraud conviction in a ninth circuit court of appeals opinion.the weiner court noted the propriety of taking judicial notice of the truth of facts asserted in documents such as orders,findings of fact,conclusions of law and judgments.it concluded federal appellate decisions and judgments were either official acts of the judicial department of the united states under evidence code section,subdivision b,or court records of the united states under subdivision d of the same section.the court reasoned facts stated in appellate opinions generally have an accuracy and reliability as least as great as orders,findings of fact,conclusions of law and judgments.
weiner does not support law office position,as it is factually distinguishable from the instant case.unlike weiner,the instant case involves judicial notice of the truth of a matter which was never the product of an adversary hearing.lockley never had a chance to contest the court of appeal determination law office did not represent him with respect to the settlement agreement.by contrast,the matter judicially noticed in weiner did issue from an adversary hearing.the plaintiff in weiner had the opportunity to contest the criminal charges brought against him at trial.
in addition,the weiner decision contravenes substantial california authority.in sosinsky grant th,d,the court stated that t he weiner court view of judicial notice indicates an erroneous concept of judicial notice and is clearly fallacious and indefensible.judicial notice substitutes for formal proof only because the matters judicially noticed are not reasonably subject to dispute.emphasis in original,sosinsky grant,supra,th,d quoting jefferson cal.evidence benchbook ed.
moreover,the weiner decision appears to run counter to the principle that courts may not take judicial notice of hearsay allegations.an appellate court description of facts is merely the hearsay assertions of the justices who delivered the opinion.hearsay statements within the opinion are inadmissible unless they fall within an exception to the hearsay rule.under section of the evidence code,appellate opinions do come within the exception to the hearsay rule for official records.however,an official record is evidence of a writing made as a record of an act,condition,or event offered to prove the act,condition or event ibid.thus,while an official record of an appellate opinion can be admitted to prove the truth of the facts asserted,the most it may prove is that the appellate opinion was delivered and that the court made orders,factual findings,judgm
