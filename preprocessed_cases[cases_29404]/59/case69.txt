introduction 
ecc capital corporation and its subsidiary,performance credit,llc,formerly known as encore credit,collectively,ecc appeal from a judgment confirming a final arbitration award of almost million against them and in favor of manatt,phelps phillips,llp manatt.the award was for attorneys fees,expert fees,and costs incurred by manatt as the prevailing party in an arbitration of legal malpractice claims ecc brought against manatt.
ecc contends the trial court erred in confirming the arbitrator interim award denying ecc claims because the arbitrator violated mandatory disclosure rules governing arbitrations.ecc also contends the trial court erred in confirming the final award because manatt engagement agreement was illegal,manatt obtained the award by fraud,and the arbitrator limited ecc rights to take discovery and present evidence at the arbitration on the issue of manatt conflict of interest.because we conclude ecc arguments are either meritless or forfeited,we affirm.
factual and procedural background 
ecc contracts with and then sues bear stearns 
in october ecc capital and bear stearns residential mortgage corporation bear stearns entered into an asset purchase agreement apa providing that bear stearns would buy ecc capital subprime mortgage loan origination business,encore credit corp encore.the apa required encore to originate a minimum average of million in mortgage loans per month for as many months as it took the parties to close the transaction,a period they expected to last approximately three months.the apa required bear stearns to purchase and securitize the loans encore originated during this period.
ecc capital hired latham watkins latham as deal counsel for this transaction.ecc capital also hired manatt partner ellen marshall to help negotiate and draft section of the apa,the portion of the agreement governing bear stearns obligation to purchase and securitize the loans encore originated during the period.according to ecc capital,bear stearns had agreed,and ecc capital understood and intended,that bear stearns would purchase those loans before the borrowers first payments were due,so that bear stearns would assume all risk of early defaults.ecc capital claimed it communicated its intention on this point to marshall and,based on conversations with her,understood the final draft of section reflected that intention 
by december,however,a dispute had arisen between ecc capital and bear stearns about the timing of bear stearns obligation to purchase the loans encore originated.roque santi,president of ecc capital and encore,felt bear stearns was not living up to the spirit of the deal because bear stearns was not purchasing all of the loans promptly upon origination.bear stearns position was that the apa did not obligate it to purchase the loans before the first payments were due,but did prohibit it,after purchasing a loan,from requiring encore to repurchase the loan in the event of an early payment default or breach of a representation or warranty,as bear stearns had required when previously purchasing loans from encore.
ecc capital and bear stearns ultimately closed the transaction contemplated by the apa on february.approximately two months later,ecc filed suit in federal court against bear stearns,seeking damages for bear stearns alleged breach of the apa by,among other things,not buying all of the loans encore originated during the period before the due dates of the loans first payments.the case settled in july,with ecc receiving million.
ecc sues latham and manatt,who compel arbitration 
in january ecc filed this action in state court against latham and manatt,asserting causes of action for legal malpractice,breach of contract,breach of fiduciary duty,and breach of the implied covenant of good faith and fair dealing.ecc alleged that poor drafting by latham and manatt of section of the apa had enabled bear stearns to refuse to buy loans promptly during the period,forced ecc to sue bear stearns to recover ecc resulting losses,and weakened ecc position in that litigation,leaving ecc to settle for much less than the million it sought.ecc also asserted latham and manatt failed to make full written disclosure of conflicting interests to ecc and to obtain ecc informed written consent,but made no specific factual allegations to support this assertion.
manatt moved to compel arbitration,citing arbitration provisions in an april engagement agreement between manatt and encore and a january engagement agreement between manatt and ecc capital.latham also moved to compel arbitration,citing an arbitration provision in a march engagement agreement between latham and ecc capital,although latham conceded it lacked a fully executed copy of that agreement.latham also argued it could compel arbitration under ecc engagement agreements with manatt because ecc alleged latham acted as manatt agent and vice versa in providing legal services to ecc.
in opposing the motions,ecc did not dispute the validity of the engagement agreements or arbitration provisions cited by manatt.rather,ecc argued it had no enforceable arbitration agreement with latham and,because ecc claims against latham and manatt arose out of the same transaction,the court should try the claims against both defendants pursuant to code of civil procedure section,subdivision c to avoid conflicting rulings on common issues of law and fact.the court granted the motions to compel arbitration under the manatt contract.
in october ecc initiated arbitration against latham and manatt before the american arbitration association aaa,asserting the same claims it had asserted in court shortly before the arbitration hearing began in january,ecc settled with latham.
ecc takes discovery on manatt alleged conflict of interest 
the arbitrator limited discovery to requests for production of documents and depositions.one category of documents ecc requested from manatt was a ll documents concerning manatt communications or analysis of conflicts of interest concerning the representation of ecc in connection with the bear stearns transaction.ecc also requested billing records for any legal services manatt provided to the bear stearns companies,and its affiliates,including bear stearns residential mortgage corporation and emc mortgage corporation,from through.
when manatt objected to these requests,ecc sought to compel the production of responsive documents on the grounds that the documents were necessary to discover whether manatt had a conflict of interest,arising from legal services provided to bear stearns when manatt represented ecc in the sale of encore,and whether manatt had obtained conflict waivers.ecc cited a september email exchange among marshall,manatt partner robert sherman,and ecc capital general counsel,alanna darling,in which darling asked marshall and sherman to provide comments on bear stearns proposed amendments to an agreement relating to the transaction for the sale of encore.in doing so,darling commented,i think you have a waiver for these agreements but if not,let me know.sherman responded that he was not aware of any waiver from bear.marshall replied,i think we talked about getting a waiver the last time this came up,but because of the timing we did not do the work.at least that what i recall.i think we could get the waiver readily.rob,the best person to connect with bear on this is manatt partner barbara polsky.darling responded,please do try to get a waiver.
after holding at least two hearings on these and other discovery issues,the arbitrator sustained manatt objection to ecc request for manatt billing records.and although the arbitrator directed manatt to supplement its response to ecc request for communications or analyses concerning conflicts of interest in connection with representing ecc in its sale of encore,the arbitrator ruled manatt did not have to search barbara polsky emails or use her name as a search term when searching the email accounts of other custodians of record 
when ecc later deposed sherman,counsel questioned him about his september email exchange with darling and marshall,the conflict waiver referred to in the exchange,and any communications he may have had with polsky concerning the issue.sherman could not recall communicating with polsky about such a waiver or actually seeing one,but he believed manatt obtained one because manatt was not in the habit of doing work when we had a conflict without getting a waiver.
counsel for ecc asked similar questions when deposing marshall.when asked whether bear had historically been a client of manatt,marshall answered,from time to time,including at the time of the september email exchange with darling.marshall stated she recalled manatt sought and obtained a conflict waiver from ecc in connection with the sale of encore to bear stearns.she also stated that in february,when ecc began considering litigation against bear stearns to enforce ecc understanding of section of the apa,marshall told ecc she could not bring one of manatt litigation partners to a meeting to discuss the issue because manatt conflict waiver from bear excluded litigation work.
ecc did not seek to depose polsky or any other manatt attorneys,though the arbitrator did not prohibit ecc from doing so.nor did ecc call polsky as a witness at the arbitration hearing.
ecc designated robert kehr as its expert on issues of standard of care,professional ethics,and professional responsibility.when counsel for manatt asked kehr during his deposition whether he was giving any opinion in the case regarding a conflict of interest on the part of manatt,kehr said he was not.consistent with this answer,kehr gave no opinion during the arbitration hearing that manatt had any conflict of interest.
d.the arbitration hearing and the interim award 
the arbitration hearing was held from january to march.in advance of the hearing,ecc submitted a brief setting forth all its contentions,including its principal contention that manatt was negligent in drafting the apa because,among other reasons,manatt failed to include a provision obligating bear stearns to purchase the loans encore originated before the first payments on those loans were due.ecc brief did not contend manatt had any conflict of interest or fraudulently induced or coerced ecc to sign the engagement agreement.
the arbitrator heard testimony from numerous witnesses and considered approximately pages of deposition testimony.at no time did ecc argue or seek to present evidence that manatt had a conflict of interest or induced ecc through any inappropriate means to sign the engagement agreement.in fact,during the hearing,counsel for ecc expressly disavowed that ecc was seeking testimony to claim that manatt had a conflict or breached some fiduciary duty with respect to conflicts.at the conclusion of the hearing,the parties submitted closing briefs,and on may,the arbitrator heard closing arguments.again,ecc made no mention of any conflict of interest,fraud,or coercion on the part of manatt.
on august,the arbitrator issued a interim arbitration award,denying all of ecc claims against manatt.the arbitrator found ecc had not proved by a preponderance of the evidence that manatt was negligent in drafting section or that any losses ecc may have incurred in the transaction with bear stearns were the fault of manatt.the arbitrator deemed manatt the prevailing party in the arbitration and directed it to submit an application to recover its reasonable attorneys fees,expert fees,and costs,as provided in the engagement agreement.
ecc requests disqualification of the arbitrator 
on october,before manatt filed its application for fees and costs,ecc wrote the arbitrator and aaa requesting the arbitrator disqualification from the proceeding and suggesting there were grounds to vacate the interim award.ecc contended the arbitrator failed to comply with his disclosure obligations by not disclosing his role as a panelist in a prior matter involving manatt that took place in.ecc identified that matter as tom leykis damian macafee dba qtk internet name proxy,a uniform domain name dispute resolution policy udrp proceeding before the national arbitration forum in which the arbitrator served as a panelist and the claimant was represented by jill pietrini,an attorney who at that time and until approximately january worked for manatt ecc stated it only recently discovered these facts and believed the arbitrator failed to disclose other matters he was statutorily required to disclose.in letters to aaa in october and november,manatt responded to ecc contentions and asked the arbitrator not to disqualify himself.
on november,the arbitrator notified the parties by letter that he did not intend to disqualify himself.the arbitrator stated that,at the time he undertook the present matter in december,he was unaware that an attorney from manatt had been listed as counsel in an uncontested,documents only domain name dispute arbitration,in which he served as an arbitrator almost five years previously.he stated that since he had served approximately times as an arbitrator in udrp proceedings administered by the national arbitration forum,almost all of which were,like the leykis matter,uncontested.
the arbitrator explained his involvement with those proceedings these cases are documents only matters in which,as an arbitrator,i have no direct contact with the parties or their representatives.in fact,my total involvement in preparing a decision takes well less than one hour.when an uncontested matter is assigned to me,i access a portal where i can download the documents pertaining to the matter.the complaining party files a complaint online,there is in addition a letter assigning the matter to an arbitrator,a staff memorandum proposing a resolution to the matter,and a template of the decision.i do not add the names of the parties or their representatives to the template or give any consideration to the names,if any,of a party representative.the staff memorandum proposes a resolution to all of the issues.in the case of uncontested matters,like the leykis case,the resolutions proposed in the staff memorandum are almost always adopted with only modest editing.
the arbitrator further explained because of the sheer volume of these cases,the fact that they are uncontested,documents only matters,in which no consideration is given to any one listed as a party representative,i can state with absolute certainty that when i filled out the disclosure information in this case i was unaware that an attorney from the manatt firm had been listed as a party representative in one of those matters.i do maintain an excel spreadsheet where i record contested arbitrations and mediations.i do not include in that excel spreadsheet these domain name matters because they are uncontested,documents only matters,where identification of a party,or a party representative,is completely irrelevant to the resolution of the dispute.so,when i did my customary due diligence by reviewing the excel spreadsheet,the manatt firm did not appear.
on november,ecc sent a second letter to aaa,requesting aaa disqualify the arbitrator and vacate the interim award,and describing additional pertinent evidence.ecc stated that after receiving the arbitrator letter it searched the national arbitration forum online database and discovered that in the arbitrator was a panelist in kevin spacey alberta hot rods,a contested proceeding in which the claimant,represented by manatt,prevailed.ecc conceded the spacey matter was not within the five year disclosure period,but argued it was relevant to ecc consideration of whether to allow the arbitrator to serve in this case,and ecc would have discovered and considered it had the arbitrator disclosed the leykis matter as ecc contended was required.on december,aaa notified the parties it was denying ecc request to disqualify the arbitrator.
f.the trial court confirms the interim award 
in december ecc filed a petition to vacate the interim award and disqualify the arbitrator,contending the arbitrator failed to comply with his statutory disclosure obligations.in january manatt filed a competing petition to confirm the interim award.in february ecc amended its petition to include a request to vacate the orders compelling arbitration.
in its amended petition ecc argued the court should vacate the orders compelling arbitration and the interim award because ecc engagement agreement with manatt,which ecc referred to as the arbitration agreement,was procured by manatt fraud and coercion.ecc contended the evidence of manatt fraud and coercion emerged only during the arbitration hearing,when marshall testified section of the apa was in ecc words drafted to provide only a discretionary obligation on the part of bear.according to ecc,this testimony conflicted with marshall previous statements indicating she shared ecc view that section required bear to purchase and securitize monthly all the loans originated during the period.this testimony also established,according to ecc,that manatt engaged in fraud and coercion when it requested ecc to sign an engagement agreement in january,on the eve of ecc and bear closing their transaction under the apa.ecc contended marshall testimony demonstrated that,at the time manatt asked ecc to sign the engagement agreement,marshall knew she had not performed the job she was specifically hired to do,was concealing her belief that bear obligations were discretionary,and knew a potential claim for legal malpractice would be likely.
ecc also argued the court should vacate the interim award and the orders to compel arbitration because the engagement agreement was illegal.ecc argued the agreement was illegal because manatt had an undisclosed conflict of interest arising from its dual representation of ecc and bear,for which manatt had not obtained a written waiver from ecc.
on march,the trial court denied ecc amended petition.the court also granted manatt petition to confirm the interim award.
g.the arbitrator issues his final award 
in march manatt presented the arbitrator with its application for more than million in attorneys fees,expert fees,and costs as the prevailing party in the arbitration.ecc opposed the application on several grounds,including that the engagement agreement under which manatt sought fees and costs was unenforceable because manatt committed ethical violations in obtaining it.ecc again contended manatt had an undisclosed conflict of interest.
in january the arbitrator issued his final award,granting manatt application for attorneys fees,expert fees,and costs in the amount of.in his ruling,the arbitrator discussed at length ecc contention that the engagement agreement was unenforceable.the arbitrator rejected that contention because there was no evidence manatt had a conflict of interest,ecc had forfeited the argument by failing to raise it during the arbitration hearing,and ecc had sought to enforce the terms of the engagement agreement when it requested attorneys fees,expert fees,and costs in its arbitration demand.
in concluding manatt had no conflict of interest,the arbitrator noted marshall had submitted a declaration to the effect that manatt never represented any of the companies affiliated with bear stearns,involved in the apa bear stearns residential mortgage corporation,emc mortgage corporation,and bear stearns mortgage capital corporation,but that manatt did represent previously bear stearns,in unrelated matters.the arbitrator stated that,because of the importance of these facts to the issues ecc raised,he had directed counsel for manatt to conduct further inquiry,and after consulting with manatt managing partner,counsel for manatt had sent an email to the arbitrator and counsel for ecc stating the following 
during the period,but not thereafter,manatt represented an entity named bear stearns mortgage capital,which apparently was one of the many bear subsidiaries.the counterparty to the repo agreement in the apa transaction was an entity named bear stearns mortgage capital.we do not yet know if the two entities are the same entity with a name change,or different entities.i have also been informed that manatt represented pmg securities corporation not a bear entity in an nasd arbitration in which another bear affiliate,bear stearns securities,was a.i am informed that pmg securities corporation indemnified bear stearns securities and that manatt appeared in the arbitration as counsel for both.
thus,the arbitrator observed,counsel for manatt acknowledged that marshall declaration was false.the arbitrator then noted he had asked the parties during the hearing on manatt application for attorneys fees whether they believed further investigation an evidentiary hearing was necessary to establish the precise nature of manatt prior representation of any bear stearns affiliated entity.counsel for the parties stated they were satisfied with the record as it stood,taking into account this most recent communication from manatt counsel.
the arbitrator concluded,although it appears manatt previously had an attorney client relationship with bear stearns,and bear stearns mortgage capital potentially the same entity as one of the parties engaged in the negotiation of the apa,no such relationships existed in when manatt represented ecc in drafting portions of the apa.to the extent there are unknown issues regarding the nature of these relationships or the reason why manatt obtained a waiver letter from bear stearns,the gap in the evidence was caused by the delay on the part of ecc in raising its allegations of unethical conduct.fns.omitted.
the arbitrator also rejected ecc argument that manatt agreement not to represent ecc in litigation relating to the apa constituted a conflict.the arbitrator noted that,in response to the september email exchange in which darling requested that sherman and marshall p lease do try to get a waiver,manatt prepared a conflict waiver letter that a senior managing director of bear stearns,subsequently signed it was this conflict waiver letter to which marshall was referring when in january,in response to a request from ecc that she bring a litigator to a meeting to discuss disputes over the apa,marshall wrote i took a look at the conflict waiver letter that we got from bear stearns,and it specifically excludes representation in a litigation.the arbitrator concluded the conflict waiver letter thus amounted to a relationship with bear stearns,which apparently extended to bear stearns residential mortgage corporation wherein manatt agreed not to engage in any litigation relating to the apa.
the arbitrator determined this relationship,however,did not constitute a conflict of interest because there was no evidence it materially and adversely affected manatt representation of ecc or ecc interests.the arbitrator noted the engagement agreement between ecc and manatt defined the matter for which ecc was retaining manatt as general corporate advice and all the evidence in the arbitration showed that manatt role was limited to drafting and negotiating selected portions of the apa documentation.in addition,the arbitrator observed,ecc promptly retained extremely competent counsel to represent it in litigation with bear stearns.
h.the trial court confirms the final award 
on february,ecc and manatt filed respective petitions to vacate and confirm the final arbitration award.ecc argued the trial court should vacate the final award under section,subdivision a,because,among other reasons,the arbitrator exceeded his powers by awarding fees and costs pursuant to an illegal agreement,the final award was procured by fraud,coercion undue means,and the arbitrator failed to disclose a ground for disqualification of which he was aware.
on march,the trial court denied ecc petition to vacate the final award and granted manatt petition to confirm it.neither party requested a statement of decision.on july,the trial court entered judgment in favor of manatt and against ecc in the amount of.ecc timely appealed.
discussion 
ecc argues the trial court erred in confirming the interim award because the arbitrator violated mandatory disclosure rules.ecc also contends the trial court erred in confirming the final award because the arbitrator exceeded his powers by enforcing an illegal agreement,manatt procured the final award by fraud or undue means,and the arbitrator refused to allow ecc to take discovery and present evidence relating to manatt alleged conflict of interest.

ecc did not establish the arbitrator violated mandatory disclosure rules 
section,subdivision a a,provides the court must vacate an arbitration award if the arbitrator failed to disclose within the time required for disclosure a ground for disqualification of which the arbitrator was then aware.see haworth superior court cal th,under section,subdivision a,an arbitrator failure to make a required disclosure requires vacation of the award,without a showing of prejudice.specifically,as relevant here,w ithin days of receiving notice of his or her nomination to serve as a neutral arbitrator,the proposed arbitrator is required,generally,to disclose all matters that could cause a person aware of the facts to reasonably entertain a doubt that the proposed neutral arbitrator would be able to be impartial.haworth,at,quoting,subd.a accord,united health centers of san joaquin valley,superior court th,see,subds.a,b.
section,subdivision a,enumerates specific matters the arbitrator must disclose.see haworth,supra,cal th at united health centers,supra,th at.subdivision a of that section requires disclosure of t he names of the parties to all prior or pending noncollective bargaining cases involving any party to the arbitration or lawyer for a party for which the proposed neutral arbitrator served or is serving as neutral arbitrator,and the results of each case arbitrated to conclusion,including the date of the arbitration award,identification of the prevailing party,the names of the parties attorneys and the amount of monetary damages awarded,if any.prior cases in this description means noncollective bargaining cases in which an arbitration award was rendered within five years prior to the date of the proposed nomination or appointment,subd.d.lawyer for a party means any lawyer or law firm currently associated in the practice of law with the lawyer hired to represent a party,subd.c.
to similar effect,subdivision a of section requires the arbitrator to disclose a ny matters required to be disclosed by the ethics standards for neutral arbitrators adopted by the judicial council pursuant to this chapter.those ethics standards require an arbitrator to disclose whether he or she is serving or,within the preceding five years,has served a s a neutral arbitrator in another prior or pending noncollective bargaining case involving a party to the current arbitration or a lawyer for a party.ethics standards,std.d a i see united health centers,supra,th at,fn.
ecc contends the leykis matter the udrp proceeding in which the arbitrator participated within the previous five years and a manatt lawyer represented the claimant was a prior noncollective bargaining case that section,subdivisions a and a,required him to disclose within days of his proposed appointment to serve as arbitrator in this case.because he failed to do so,ecc argues,the trial court erred in not vacating the interim award pursuant to section,subdivision a a.
as manatt points out,however,section,subdivision a a,provides for vacatur only where the arbitrator fails to disclose a ground for disqualification of which the arbitrator was then aware.casden park la brea retail llc ross dress for less,th illustrates this knowledge requirement.after the trial court in that case vacated an arbitration award because the court found the neutral arbitrator improperly failed to disclose business dealings between his employer and a party and that party arbitrator,the court of appeal reversed.id.at.acknowledging section,subdivision a,required disclosure of a ny professional or significant personal relationship the proposed neutral arbitrator has or has had with any party to the arbitration proceeding,the court in casden nevertheless held vacating the arbitration award under section,subdivision a,was improper because the arbitrator did not know of the business dealings when he made his disclosures.casden,at.the court explained a n arbitration award may be vacated only upon a finding that a neutral arbitrator failed to disclose a ground for disqualification of which the arbitrator was then aware citation,and this requirement of scienter is a deliberate expression of the legislature intent to prevent the undoing of an arbitration award based upon an arbitrator unknowing failure to disclose information.id.at.because no one disputed the arbitrator was unaware of the business dealings,the court observed,it follows that the arbitrator had no duty to disclose those transactions.id.at.
the parties here similarly do not dispute that at the time of his disclosures the arbitrator was not aware a former manatt lawyer had participated in the leykis udrp matter.as the arbitrator stated in his letter responding to ecc request that he disqualify himself l et me state unequivocally that at the time i undertook this matter in december i was unaware that an attorney from manatt had been listed as counsel in the lyekis matter.the letter i received from ecc was the first,and only time,i became aware that an attorney from manatt had been listed as a party representative in that matter.because the arbitrator was not aware a former manatt lawyer participated in the leykis udrp proceeding,his failure to disclose that matter is not a ground for vacating the interim award under section,subdivision a a.
ecc argues that,although the arbitrator may not have been aware a manatt lawyer participated in the leykis udrp proceeding,he should have been aware,and therefore his failure to disclose the matter requires vacating the interim award.as ecc puts it an arbitrator can not render himself unaware of arbitrations he is required to disclose by failing to inform himself before making disclosures.ecc points to what the court in advantage medical services,llc hoffman th referred to as a duty of inquiry imposed by the ethics standards.id.at.the court in advantage medical services noted standard a of the standards clearly states a person who is nominated or appointed as an arbitrator must make a reasonable effort to inform himself or herself of matters that must be disclosed under standards and.id.at.ecc argues these authorities required the arbitrator to inform himself of the leykis matter by reviewing the udrp proceedings in which he participated,and ecc contends his failure to do so and resulting failure to discover and disclose the leykis matter requires vacatur.
there are two problems with ecc argument,one legal and one factual.as a legal matter,ecc does not explain how the arbitrator failure to disclose a ground for disqualification of which the arbitrator was not aware but reasonably should have been requires vacating an award under section,subdivision a a,when that statute requires vacating an award only when an arbitrator fails to disclose a ground for disqualification of which he or she was actually aware.section,subdivision a a,requires actual awareness,not inquiry or constructive awareness.see knight et,cal.practice guide alternative dispute resolution the rutter group t he arbitrator duty to investigate for conflicts is narrower than the duty to disclose known conflicts.as a factual matter,because the trial court did not issue a statement of decision,we must presume the court found the arbitrator made a reasonable effort to inform himself of matters he was required to disclose and therefore it was not unreasonable for him to exclude the udrp proceedings from his review.
that implied factual finding is supported by substantial evidence.the arbitrator explained it was not his practice to include the udrp proceedings in his review because of the nature and number of those proceedings,and he stated this practice comported with his understanding of his ethical duties and disclosure obligations under california law.manatt submitted declarations from three people with relevant experience and expertise who concurred with the arbitrator approach.one of those,david sorkin,a panelist in approximately udrp proceedings and an arbitrator in approximately private contractual arbitrations,is a law professor whose scholarship focuses on internet law,udrp mandatory administrative proceedings,and arbitration laws and practices.sorkin explained that any person contesting another person internet domain name registration can initiate a udrp proceeding.he then highlighted what he considered important differences between such a proceeding and those proceedings an arbitrator would normally recognize as arbitrations subject to the disclosure requirements under section and the ethics standards.for example,udrp rules refer to udrp proceedings as mandatory administrative proceedings,not arbitrations,and refer to the people who decide such disputes as panelists,not arbitrators.udrp proceedings are,in that e ither side can file a court action at any time,before,during or after a decision.and udrp proceedings typically involve no or telephonic hearings,no witnesses,no discovery,and no contact with the panelist.given these characteristics,sorkin opined,it would be reasonable for an arbitrator to believe that serving as a panelist in a udrp mandatory administrative proceeding would not trigger a required arbitration disclosure under california ethics standards or section.the other two expert declarations on this subject included similar statements.
ecc cites no authority suggesting the arbitrator understanding of his disclosure obligation was unreasonable.in fact,ecc suggests whether a udrp proceeding is,as it contends,an arbitration subject to mandatory disclosure under section,subdivision a,and the ethics standards,is an issue of first impression in california.that ecc has found cases where arbitrators and some federal courts outside california may have referred to udrp proceedings as arbitrations,without addressing and analyzing whether that label is appropriate,is not dispositive.see,storey cello holdings,cir,retail services,freebies pub.d,see also borikas alameda unified school district th,fn.a case is not authority for a proposition it does not address.moreover,although there are no cases addressing whether a udrp proceeding is an arbitration subject to disclosure under the provisions of the california arbitration act et,federal cases addressing whether a udrp proceeding is an arbitration under the federal arbitration act et have concluded it is not.see dluhos strasberg cir,parisi netlearning.d,see also speidel,icann domain name dispute resolution,the revised uniform arbitration act,and the limitations of modern arbitration law small emerging bus,the udrp is not an arbitration within the scope of american statutory arbitration law,whether that law is found in international treaties,the faa,or state arbitration law,fns.omitted.
finally,ecc suggests the arbitrator should have disclosed,at a minimum,that he had participated in numerous udrp proceedings that he did not review for required disclosures,so that the parties could have undertaken their own review of and investigation into those matters.that might have been a better arbitrator disclosure practice.but ecc cites no authority for vacating an arbitration award on that ground.the trial court did not err when it denied ecc petition to vacate the interim award based on the arbitrator alleged failure to make mandatory disclosures.
ecc forfeited its argument the engagement agreement was illegal 
section,subdivision a,requires a court to vacate an arbitration award if it determines t he arbitrators exceeded their powers and the award can not be corrected without affecting the merits of the decision upon the controversy submitted.ecc contends the trial court erred in refusing to vacate the final award because,in making the award,the arbitrator exceeded his powers and violated a public policy by enforcing an illegal agreement.specifically,ecc argues that,in awarding fees and costs under the engagement agreement,the arbitrator gave effect to a contract that was illegal because manatt procured it in violation of rules b and c of the rules of professional conduct and section of the business professions code.
rule b of the rules of professional conduct prohibits a lawyer from,among other things,accepting or continuing representation of a client without providing written disclosure to the client where the lawyer has a legal,business,financial,professional,or personal relationship with a party or witness in the same matter.rules conduct,rule b.ecc contends manatt violated this rule because it represented ecc without providing written disclosure that manatt had entered into a legal,business or professional relationship with bear in when it contractually committed that it would not represent ecc in litigation.
rule c of the rules of professional conduct provides that a lawyer must not,without the informed written consent of each client,a ccept representation of more than one client in a matter in which the interests of the clients potentially conflict or a ccept or continue representation of more than one client in a matter in which the interests of the clients actually conflict.rules conduct,rule c.ecc contends manatt violated these provisions by failing to obtain ecc informed written consent to manatt dual representation of ecc and bear.
ecc also contends manatt violation of these rules of professional conduct means that the engagement agreement was obtained in violation of business professions code section.that section provides,in relevant part,that a lawyer commission of any act involving moral turpitude,dishonesty or corruption constitutes a cause for disbarment or suspension.bus.code.
we agree with manatt,the arbitrator,and the trial court that ecc forfeited these arguments by failing to raise them earlier in the proceedings.cummings future nissan th is instructive.in that case,the appellant received a favorable result at the first level of a arbitration proceeding,but had that result reversed at the second,review level.id.at.
