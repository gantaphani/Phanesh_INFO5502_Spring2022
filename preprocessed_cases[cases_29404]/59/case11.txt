defendants thomas stiles and the law firm of stiles wright collectively,stiles appeal from a judgment entered in the united states district court for the southern district of new york casey,granting summary judgment in favor of ocean ships,on its legal malpractice claim against stiles.the district court held that stiles failure timely to perfect a meritorious interlocutory appeal challenging personal jurisdiction over ocean ships in the underlying personal injury action was the proximate cause of ocean ships loss,and that the loss is measured by the full amount of the personal injury judgment.we conclude that stiles raised a material issue of fact as to whether the personal injury plaintiff would have pursued his tort claim against ocean ships in texas if the new york action was dismissed for lack of personal jurisdiction.we therefore vacate the judgment and remand for further proceedings on the issue of the amount of damages if any caused by the malpractice.
background 
in the underlying suit,matthew horan sued his employer,ocean ships,in for a personal injury he suffered aboard ship off the british coast.the suit was brought in state court in new york under the jones act,app.horan ocean ships.ocean ships alleged lack of personal jurisdiction in new york,and moved to dismiss on that ground.the trial judge denied the motion immediately before trial in february,but did not publish the corresponding order until after the trial,on may,may,order.just in case,horan had engaged texas counsel who filed a protective suit against ocean ships in harris county,texas,on august.
in march,the new york jury returned a verdict against ocean ships in the sum of.
stiles was retained soon afterward to assist with ocean ships motions and to be solely responsible for the appeal.on april,ocean ships filed a motion to set aside the verdict and reargue the prior decision on personal jurisdiction.while that motion was pending,the trial court issued the may,order,which denied the motion to dismiss for lack of personal jurisdiction stiles filed a notice of appeal from that order on june,the initial appeal.
by decision and order dated october,the trial court decided the reargument motion and reaffirmed its ruling that ocean ships was subject to personal jurisdiction in new york.by then,the ruling on personal jurisdiction had become more vulnerable between the submission of the motion and the court decision,two other cases against ocean ships in new york were dismissed for lack of personal jurisdiction.
additional disputes delayed entry of the final judgment until december.the verdict plus interest totaled.
procedure in the appellate division,second department requires that appeals be perfected within six months of filing the notice of appeal by filing of appellant brief and the record.see regs.tit.the initial appeal was never perfected,however.in january,the dismissal calendar published in the new york law journal warned that the initial appeal would be dismissed unless a motion was made within ten days to enlarge the time to perfect.stiles failed to do so,and the initial appeal was dismissed on february.
stiles explains that he decided not to perfect the initial appeal because he believed that the personal jurisdiction issue would be subsumed in the appeal from the trial court decision on the reargument motion.acting on that belief,stiles perfected a new appeal after the december final judgment was entered,raising the personal jurisdiction issue among others.the appellate division,however,ruled that the dismissal of the initial appeal amounted to an adjudication on its merits,refused to consider personal jurisdiction,and affirmed the judgment.see horan ocean ships,dep t.
ocean ships liability insurer was the steamship mutual underwriting association steamship mutual.in february,steamship mutual paid into stiles escrow account,and the judgment was satisfied.
ocean ships later filed this diversity action in the southern district of new york,alleging that stiles negligently failed timely to perfect the appeal on the personal jurisdictional issue,breached his professional services contract,and negligently failed to ensure that the final judgment in horan was entered timely so as to prevent the accumulation of interest.
on for summary judgment,the district court granted summary judgment in favor of ocean ships on its claim that stiles committed legal malpractice by failing timely to perfect the appeal on the personal jurisdiction issue,and awarded as damages,representing the amount paid to horan,plus interest from the date the judgment was paid,plus disbursements.because ocean ships thereby received the full measure of its damages,the district court did not address the other two causes of action.
discussion 
subject matter jurisdiction 
stiles contends that because steamship mutual paid all of the horan judgment except for the policy deductible,the maximum malpractice damages incurred by ocean ships is,and argues that ocean ships therefore can not satisfy the requirement of a we disagree.
our analysis is controlled by the legal certainty test announced by the supreme court 
the rule governing dismissal for want of jurisdiction in cases brought in the federal court is that,unless the law gives a different rule,the sum claimed by the plaintiff controls if the claim is apparently made in good faith.it must appear to a legal certainty that the claim is really for less than the jurisdictional amount to justify dismissal.

the complaint alleges legal malpractice,breach of contract,and negligence claims and seeks no less than in damages,alleged to be the difference between the horan judgment and the lesser judgment horan would have won in texas if the new york action had been dismissed on appeal.this court recognizes a rebuttable presumption that the face of the complaint is a good faith representation of the actual amount in controversy.vocational instruction project cmty,cir.
stiles attempts to rebut this presumption by claiming that ocean ships is limited to recovering only its deductible.but this ignores new york law,which as the parties agree provides the substantive law in this case.new york generally follows the collateral source rule under which damages recoverable for a wrong are not diminished by the fact that the party injured has been wholly or partially indemnified for his loss by insurance effected by him and to the procurement of which the wrongdoer did not contribute.healy rennert,see also hugo boss fashions,fed.ins,cir kish bd.of.ocean ships recovery therefore is not necessarily limited to to any other figure below the requirement 
real party in interest 
stiles argues that steamship ocean the real party in interest within the meaning of rule a because steamship mutual paid the entire judgment and all costs in the horan action,minus only the deductible.
rule a requires that e very action shall be prosecuted in the name of the real party in interest.a.status as a real party in interest is a procedural matter therefore,in diversity cases federal law governs the issue of in whose name a lawsuit must be brought.brocklesby transp.states escort,cir the supreme court has provided the rule a analysis applicable to subrogation arrangements 
if the subrogee has paid an entire loss suffered by the insured,it is the only real party in interest and must sue in its own name.if it has paid only part of the loss both the insured and insurer have substantive rights against the tortfeasor which qualify them as real parties in interest.
united states aetna cas.sur.internal citation omitted.ocean ships payment of the deductible created a sufficient independent interest.see brocklesby,at see also charles alan wright,arthur miller mary kay kane,federal practice and procedure,at ed.ocean ships is therefore a real party in interest under rule a and if the policyholder achieves a judgment that exceeds the deductible amount,that is a matter of contract between the policyholder and the insurer.
