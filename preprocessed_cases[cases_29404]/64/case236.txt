introduction 
in these consolidated appeals,plaintiff,kevin cavalli,appeals from a judgment dismissing his civil complaint and an order denying his first amended probate code section petition.we reverse the judgment and the order.
ii.background 
these appeals concern two testamentary qualified terminable interest property trust the qtip trust,and a grandchildren under the will of plaintiff grandfather,thomas bowles.plaintiff is a remainder beneficiary of the qtip trust and a beneficiary of the grandchildren trust.plaintiff father is defendant,richard alan cavalli,who also is a beneficiary of the qtip trust.defendant,walter henry reid,is not a beneficiary of either trust.but reid is alleged to have induced the trustee,mary bowles,to sell qtip trust property to him at less than fair market value.reid allegedly acted with knowledge the transactions breached the trustee fiduciary duties.
bowles died in.the probate court appointed his surviving spouse,bowles,as trustee of the qtip trust.the trustee of the qtip trust was to pay the net income of the trust to bowles during her lifetime.the trustee was also authorized to make payments of principal to bowles if necessary for her health,support,and maintenance.in other words,bowles,as trustee,controlled payments of trust income and distributions of trust principal to herself.
upon bowles death,the qtip trust estate was to be distributed with a share to each of bowles sons,anthony herman cavalli anthony and richard alan cavalli richard,or their issue.when necessary for purposes of clarity and not out of any disrespect,we will refer to certain individuals who share a common surname by their first names.the remaining of the qtip trust estate was to be distributed in equal shares to bowles four grandchildren,including plaintiff.the grandchildren shares were to be distributed outright or held in trust depending upon their ages at the time of bowles death.in an october,final order in bowles estate proceeding,the probate court directed that be distributed to anthony to richard and in trust to bowles.bowles share was to be divided in four equal shares for her four grandchildren the grandchildren trust.
bowles continued to act as trustee of both the qtip trust and the grandchildren trust until her death in march.following bowles death,on plaintiff petition,first regional bank the bank was appointed successor trustee of the qtip trust.no successor trustee of the grandchildren trust has been appointed.there is no probate pending as to bowles estate.
sometime prior to august,bowles created a separate revocable mary bowles trust.the trust remained revocable until bowles death.richard is the successor trustee of the mary bowles trust.bowles estate consists entirely of the mary bowles trust.
plaintiff filed two separate actions concerning the qtip or grandchildren trusts.both actions arise out of bowles alleged breaches of trust.first,plaintiff filed his first amended section petition in the probate department of the superior court the probate court seeking to surcharge bowles estate consisting of the mary bowles trust assets for her alleged fiduciary duty breaches in relation to the qtip and the grandchildren trusts.second,plaintiff filed a civil complaint in the superior court seeking damages against richard and reid for allegedly inducing bowles to breach the qtip trust for their own gain.both proceedings have been dismissed,giving rise to these appeals.
iii.discussion

b.the civil complaint superior court case no.
plaintiff filed a march,complaint against richard and reid for damages,including punitive damages to impose a constructive trust on wrongfully received qtip trust property and for an accounting of all property they received from the trust.plaintiff alleged bowles breached her fiduciary duties as trustee of the qtip trust richard and reid,in furtherance of their own financial gain,induced,aided,and abetted bowles fiduciary duty breaches and richard and reid accepted qtip trust property with knowledge the distributions breached bowles fiduciary duties to the trust.plaintiff alleged defendants active participation in bowles fiduciary duty breaches included inducing her to sell them qtip trust property at less than fair market value make risky and imprudent loans from the qtip trust to richard and to businesses in which he had an interest make risky and imprudent investments in businesses in which richard had an interest and give defendants qtip trust property when they had no right to such property.defendants demurred to the complaint on grounds plaintiff had no standing and the probate department had exclusive jurisdiction of the claims,which concerned the internal affairs of the trust.the trial court agreed,sustained defendants demurrer without leave to amend,denied reconsideration,and entered a dismissal judgment.
defendants argue plaintiff has no standing to bring this action against richard and reid.we conclude plaintiff has standing.as a general rule,the trustee is the real party in interest with standing to sue and defend on the trust behalf,code civ,wolf mitchell,silberberg knupp th,d pillsbury karmgard th,d saks damon raike th,d.conversely,a trust beneficiary can not sue in the name of the trust.pillsbury karmgard,supra,th at,d saks damon raike,supra,th at,d powers ashton d.but a trust beneficiary can bring a proceeding against a trustee for breach of trust.work county national bank trust cal d,city of atascadero merrill lynch,pierce,fenner smith,th,d pierce lyman th,d.moreover,it is well established,and this court has held,that a trust beneficiary can pursue a cause of action against a third party who actively participates in or knowingly benefits from a trustee breach of trust.harnedy whitty th,d wolf mitchell,silberberg knupp,supra,th at,d city of atascadero merrill lynch,pierce,fenner smith,supra,th at,d pierce lyman,supra,th at,d morales field,degoff,huppert macgowan d.rest d trusts,scott on trusts ed,bogert,the law of trusts and trustees ed,witkin,summary of cal.law ed trusts,d trusts.
scott on trusts explains i f a third person commits a tort with respect to the trust property,the trustee and not the beneficiary is ordinarily the proper party to bring an action against him.the beneficiary can maintain a suit in equity against the tortfeasor only if the trustee improperly refuses or neglects to bring an action,or if the trustee can not be subjected to the jurisdiction of the court,or if there is a vacancy in the office of trustee.in such a case the third person is acting adversely to the trustee he is liable to the trustee to the same extent to which he would be liable if the trustee held the property free of trust he does not,save indirectly,incur any liability to the beneficiary.the situation is different where the trustee in breach of trust transfers property to a third person.in this situation the third person is not acting adversely to the trustee,and would have done no wrong and incurred no liability if the trustee had held the property free of trust.the wrong that he commits is a wrong to the beneficiaries in taking or retaining the property after he has notice of the breach of trust,and he thereby incurs a liability to them unless,indeed,he is a bona fide purchaser.in this situation,therefore,the beneficiaries can maintain a suit in equity against the transferee,if he took with notice of the breach of trust or paid no value.it is true that the trustee,if he can be subjected to the jurisdiction of the court,should ordinarily be joined as a party.but this is in order that the whole controversy may be determined in a single suit,and not because the right of the beneficiaries against the transferee is only a derivative right through the trustee.primarily the liability of the transferee is to the beneficiaries rather than to the trustee,and the right of the beneficiaries against the transferee is a direct right and not one that is derivative through the trustee.scott on trusts,supra,fns.omitted.this comment,with minor language revisions,is repeated in volume,scott and ascher on trusts ed section,pages.
bogert,the law of trusts and trustees,is in accord,if the trustee and a third person join in committing a breach of trust,there are two alternative causes of action available for enforcement against the third party.the wrongdoing trustee is permitted to repent of his misdeed and to sue the third person to recover the trust property or its value.and this privilege is also open to his executor,or to a successor as trustee,or to a in such a case the beneficiary may also sue.he has two causes of action,one against the trustee for his part in the breach,and the second against the third person who participated.he may sue them separately or join them in a single suit it is immaterial whether the wrongdoing trustee could have sued the third.the beneficiary is enforcing a cause of action belonging to him,and is not acting as a representative of the guilty trustee in realizing upon a claim held by the later.the court permission that the beneficiary may sue the third person in case of collusive participation is based on practical considerations.the wrongdoing trustee is apt to conceal the breach in order to shield himself from liability,and,instead of repenting and seeking a cure for the breach,will generally ignore it and fail to take action against the third party.if he alone were given the power to sue the participant,in many cases the cause of action would be barred by delay in enforcement.to obviate this result it is necessary to give the beneficiary an independent cause of action.bogert,the law of trusts and trustees,supra,fns.omitted.
contrary to defendants assertions,there is no requirement that the third party stand in a fiduciary relationship with the trust or intentionally direct misrepresentations or other wrongdoing at the beneficiaries.harnedy whitty,supra,th at,d wolf mitchell,silberberg knupp,supra,th at,d city of atascadero merrill lynch,pierce,fenner smith,supra,th at,d saks damon raike,supra,th at,d pierce lyman,supra,th at,d morales field,degoff,huppert macgowan,supra,d at.rest d trusts,scott on trusts,supra,bogert,the law of trusts and trustees,supra,witkin,summary of cal.law,supra,trusts,d,supra,trusts.further,contrary to defendants argument,the beneficiary cause of action is independent and not derivative through the trustee therefore,the trustee is not a necessary party to the action.harnedy whitty,supra,th at,d city of atascadero merrill lynch,pierce,fenner smith,supra,th at,d scott on trusts,supra,bogert,the law of trusts and trustees,supra.
the court of appeal has explained w hen the claim being asserted rests in whole or in part on alleged breaches of trust by the trustee,a beneficiary has standing to pursue such a claim against either the trustee directly,the trustee and third parties participating in or benefiting from his,her,or its breach of trust,or such third parties alone.harnedy whitty,supra,th at,d,accord,d,supra,trusts.the court of appeal has further held ordinarily,when a third party acts to further his or her own economic interests by participating with a trustee in such a breach of trust,the beneficiary will bring suit against both the trustee and the third party.however,it is not necessary to join the trustee in the suit,because primarily it is the beneficiaries who are wronged and who are entitled to sue scott on trusts,supra.the liability of the third party is to the beneficiaries,rather than to the trustee,and the right of the beneficiaries against the third party is a direct right and not one that is derivative through the trustee.id,italics added.city of atascadero merrill lynch,pierce,fenner smith,supra,th at,d.
here,plaintiff alleges the defendants actively participated in bowles fiduciary duty breaches.the complaint alleges,among other things,bowles was induced to sell defendants trust property for less than its fair market value make risky and imprudent loans from the trust to richard and to businesses in which he had an interest make risky and imprudent investments of trust funds in businesses in which richard had an interest and give defendants trust assets when they had no right to such property.we assume the truth of those allegations.stop youth addiction,lucky stores,supra,cal th at,d,aubry hospital,supra,cal th at,d.plaintiff allegations bring him within the rule that a trust beneficiary can pursue a cause of action against a third party who actively participates in or knowingly benefits from a trustee breach of trust.therefore,it was error to sustain defendants demurrer without leave to amend and dismiss the complaint.
jurisdiction 
defendants argue that only the probate department has jurisdiction to resolve the dispute that is the subject of the matters raised in the complaint.we conclude the civil complaint is not a probate matter under section but the civil complaint is related to the section petition and whether the related civil complaint should be heard in the probate court must be resolved pursuant to local superior court rules.
first,subject matter jurisdiction,in the strict sense,is not at issue.dowdall superior court cal,harnedy whitty,supra,th at fn,d superior court had jurisdiction of beneficiary action against trustee for fraud.the superior court was competent to hear the civil action and had the inherent authority to do so.harnedy whitty,supra,th at,d see williams superior court cal d.the superior court is divided into departments,including the probate department,as a matter of convenience but the subject matter jurisdiction of the superior court is vested as a whole.williams superior court,supra,cal d at,graziani denny cal,glade glade th,d people madrigal th,d d courts.
second,by statute,the probate department has exclusive jurisdiction of the first amended section petition,but only concurrent jurisdiction of the civil complaint.david hermann th,d.section states a the superior court having jurisdiction over the trust pursuant to this part,judicial proceedings concerning trusts,has exclusive jurisdiction of proceedings concerning the internal affairs of trusts.b the superior court having jurisdiction over the trust pursuant to this part had concurrent jurisdiction of the following actions and proceedings to determine the existence of trusts.actions and proceedings by or against creditors or debtors of trusts.other actions and proceedings involving trustees and third persons.section,subdivision a states in part,a trustee or beneficiary of a trust may petition the court concerning the internal affairs of the trust or to determine the existence of the trust.proceedings concerning the internal affairs of a trust include modification of trust terms changes in a designated successor trustee deviations from trust provisions authority over the trustee actions and the administration of the trust financial arrangements.harnedy whitty,supra,th at,d estate of mullins d.additionally,a trustee or beneficiary may petition the court to compel redress of a breach of a trust,subd.b.
at issue here are two separate proceedings.the first proceeding,the first amended section petition,sought to redress bowles alleged breaches of trust,which concerns the internal affairs of the trusts.the second proceeding is the civil complaint,which is for damages against third persons and does not directly concern the trust internal affairs.harnedy whitty,supra,th at,d.the probate court has exclusive jurisdiction over the first amended section petition concerning the internal affairs of the trust.but the probate court possesses concurrent jurisdiction of the complaint,which seeks redress against third persons.in re marriage of perry th,d family court had jurisdiction over child support modification matter which was,in substance,litigation commenced by a creditor of the trust,not a proceeding concerning the trust internal affairs.
we find the pertinent question is whether the civil action should be assigned to the probate department in which the first amended section petition is pending.further,that question must be determined,on remand,under the superior court local rules governing related probate and cases.los angeles county superior court local rules,rule b,which is part of the probate rules,states,relating cases to probate cases is governed by rule f of the los angeles superior court rules.local rule f sets forth the procedure to be followed in order that a civil case can be ordered related to another case because the cases a arise from the same or substantially identical transactions,happenings or events or b require a determination of the same or substantially identical questions of law fact or c are likely for other good reasons to require substantial duplication of labor if heard by different judges.the probate court has the power to determine the whole controversy including the civil action.estate of baglione cal d,estate of heggstad th,d.but the authority of a probate department to resolve the merits of the civil action along with the first amended section petition was not a proper basis for sustaining the demurrer to the complaint.
c.the section first amended petition superior court case no.
plaintiff filed a july,first amended section petition.the first amended petition alleges,by this proceeding petitioner seeks redress for bowles breaches of fiduciary duty in her capacities as trustee of the qtip trust and as trustee of the grandchildren trust.paralleling the civil complaint,the first amended petition alleged bowles breached her fiduciary duties as trustee of the qtip trust in that she distributed trust principal to herself when it was not necessary for her health,support,or maintenance failed to prudently invest trust property commingled qtip trust assets with other assets,including those of the mary bowles trust and made imprudent loans to richard.the first amended petition also alleged that richard provided no security and,after receiving the proceeds from those loans,later defaulted.also,the first amended petition alleged bowles sold trust property to richard and to reid for less than fair market value distributed trust property to richard when he had no right to the property failed to maintain complete and accurate records of transactions preferred her own interests over those of the remainder beneficiaries,in breach of her duty to act impartially encouraged richard to file for bankruptcy so he would obtain a discharge of debts he owed to the qtip trust and failed to distribute income and principal of the grandchildren trust according to the trust terms.plaintiff further alleged bowles breached her duties as trustee of the grandchildren trust by failing to make required distributions to him.he sought to surcharge bowles estate,consisting of the mary bowles trust,for her fiduciary duty breaches.richard was named as a defendant in his capacity as successor trustee of the mary bowles trust.additionally,plaintiff sought a liability finding against richard and reid,to the extent of distributions they allegedly received from the mary bowles trust.
at the probate court direction,the successor trustee of the qtip trust,the bank,investigated the alleged fiduciary duty breaches.the bank reported the qtip trust had decreased in value from million in to about million in,a loss described as striking.additionally,the bank reported the documents it had reviewed did not explain the loss.the bank reported that bowles had extensively commingled the assets of the qtip trust and those of the mary bowles trust.further,there was no evidence of any effort to keep track of which trust owned which portion of which asset.the documents the bank had received from richard and his attorneys fell far short of what would be needed to track the qtip trust receipts and expenditures.the documents revealed several major qtip trust assets were sold,but did not show whether the proceeds of those sales ended up in the trust.the bank also reported richard was the only person who would be able to explain what had happened to the assets his involvement with the two trusts had been significant and he was a principal of at least three companies in which the trust had made major investments.the bank concluded the trustee investigation to date has been unable to explain why a qtip trust worth million in was worth only million in,despite limited principal invasion rights by bowles,the trustee and income beneficiary of the qtip trust.the incomplete documents received from richard and reviewed by the trustee forensic accountants offer no explanation for the dramatic drop in value.as to more specific concerns raised in plaintiff pleadings,neither the documents produced nor the narrative provided by richard lawyers satisfactorily answer plaintiff allegations.because of the extensive commingling of the assets of the qtip trust and the mary bowles trust,the lack of separate accountings for the two trusts,and the absence of records showing the disposition of the proceeds from the sale of qtip assets,the trustee can not recommend that no further action be taken.however,given the incompleteness of the documents available to the trustee,and the trustee limited success in securing voluntary explanations from richard and his attorney,it is unlikely that further informal investigation,without the tools of formal discovery,will be productive.
defendants demurred to plaintiff first amended section petition on grounds he lacked standing.they argued the bank,as successor trustee of the qtip trust,was the real party in interest with standing.the probate court agreed.we respectfully disagree with defendants standing contention.section plainly and clearly states a except as provided in section when a trust is revocable,a trustee or beneficiary of a trust may petition the court under this chapter concerning the internal affairs of the trust b proceedings concerning the internal affairs of a trust include,but are not limited to,proceedings for any of the following purposes compelling redress of a breach of the trust by any available remedy.italics added see patton sherwood th,d any beneficiary of an irrevocable trust has standing to seek redress for breach of a trust.in determining legislative intent,we first look to the words in the statute.people lopez cal th,d,delaney superior court cal d.section does not,by its terms,limit the beneficiary right to compel redress of a breach of trust to a petition against a current trustee.nor is there any decisional authority to that effect.see evangelho presoto th,d section petition against former trustee.here,plaintiff,a beneficiary of the qtip trust and of the grandchildren trust,could properly file the first amended section petition at issue to compel redress of bowles al
