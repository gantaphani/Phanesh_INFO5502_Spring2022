this appeal presents a mare nest of exotic legal problems.at the outset,it requires us to resolve a novel question of bankruptcy jurisdiction.after deciding that question,we must then determine whether,under massachusetts law,a nonprofit organization that has ceased operations may nonetheless receive a charitable bequest.because the charitable organization was still functioning as such at the time its entitlement to the bequest vested,we conclude that the bequest may be paid.
background 
elizabeth krauss executed her last will and testament in.that instrument bequeathed the residue of her estate in equal shares to the new england sanitarium and hospital of stoneham,massachusetts new england sanitarium,first lutheran church of boston first lutheran,and first church of christ,scientist the mother church.it specified that the bequest to the new england sanitarium was to be used to provide a bed for indigent patients.
in,a state probate court adjudged krauss incompetent and placed her under guardianship.eight years later,the court appointed successor guardians in the persons of gary douglas rose krauss and hanson reynolds an attorney.the new guardians found krauss financial affairs in disarray.they concluded that it would be best to sell her realty,thus making her estate more liquid and raising funds that could be used to settle her debts and defray the costs of her nursing care.
to minimize potential tax liabilities,the guardians proposed to transfer the real estate to certain inter vivos charitable trusts as a precursor to any sale.these transfers would render the testamentary bequests nugatory but,to effectuate krauss original intent,the guardians drew the trust indentures to provide that,upon krauss death,the remaining corpus would be divided in equal portions among the three residuary beneficiaries named in the will.by then,the new england sanitarium had changed its name to boston regional medical center brmc,and the indentures of trust named brmc,first lutheran,and the mother church as residuary beneficiaries.this stipulation did not include the preexisting limitation on the gift to brmc that the funds be used to provide a bed for indigent patients.according to reynolds,the guardians deliberately eliminated the restriction because they believed that it was ambiguous and,as such,might cause a failure of the bequest.
on october,the probate court confirmed the guardians plan for transferring and then selling krauss assets.the real estate was transferred and sold,and the trusts were funded.the guardians were named as.
on march,krauss died at the age of.the trustees neither initiated any contact with the named beneficiaries at that time nor made any immediate distribution of the corpus.the record does not indicate that brmc even knew of krauss death,let alone of the windfall that her demise betokened.
approximately eleven months later,brmc closed its doors,halted hospital operations,and filed for bankruptcy protection under chapter of the bankruptcy code.at the time,it was still not aware that it was a beneficiary of the krauss trusts.thus,brmc did not list any expected distribution from the trusts among the assets of the bankruptcy estate.
on january,the bankruptcy court confirmed brmc plan of reorganization the plan.the plan was strictly a liquidating plan.under it,all of brmc assets were vested in a reorganized brmc,which we shall call liquidating brmc or sole purpose is to liquidate the marshaled assets and distribute the net proceeds to brmc creditors in accordance with the provisions of the plan.
in may of,the nature and extent of krauss philanthropy became known to her intended beneficiaries.citing brmc bankruptcy,first lutheran and the mother church filed a complaint against the trustees and in the probate court seeking to prohibit any distribution from the trust corpus to the bankrupt hospital.objected on several grounds,asserting in the first instance that the injunctive provisions of the plan barred the maintenance of the suit the churches agreed to drop from the state court proceeding and filed a motion in the bankruptcy court for relief from the injunction so that the probate court proceeding could go forward.the bankruptcy court denied that motion on july.
shortly thereafter,initiated an adversary proceeding in the bankruptcy court to compel the trustees to turn over the hospital share of the trust assets.the churches intervened and counterclaimed for reformation of the indentures of trust,seeking to reimpose the bed limitation that had been contained in krauss will.first lutheran simultaneously moved to dismiss the turnover complaint and the mother church filed a motion entreating the bankruptcy court to abstain.the bankruptcy court denied both of these motions.in re boston reg l med,brmc i.although it agreed that the adversary proceeding was not appropriately characterized as a turnover action and,thus,was not a core proceeding,the court nevertheless found related to jurisdiction under b,id.at,and determined that abstention would be inappropriate,id.at.
on february,the bankruptcy court held a hearing on the merits.it thereafter concluded that because krauss died before brmc ceased to function as a hospital and because brmc incurred its debts in furtherance of its charitable mission,there was no obstacle to paying out a share of the trust residue.in re boston reg l med,brmc ii.the court further determined that the churches counterclaim was barred by the doctrine of res judicata.id.at.based on these findings and conclusions,the bankruptcy court recommended that the district court enter an order directing the trustees to pay the disputed funds to.
the churches filed objections to the bankruptcy court recommended decision.see c fed.b.they also moved in the district court for i dismissal for want of subject matter jurisdiction,ii abstention,or iii certification of the state law questions to the massachusetts supreme judicial court sjc.the district court denied the motions,conducted a de novo review of the record,adopted the bankruptcy court proposed findings and conclusions with minor modifications,and entered judgment accordingly.in re boston reg l med,no.civ,wl,at,brmc iii.the churches now appeal.
ii.jurisdiction 
we start with the jurisdictional question.the churches strive to persuade us that there is no related to jurisdiction because this litigation arose after the bankruptcy court confirmed the plan.we are not convinced.
bankruptcy jurisdiction is governed principally by statute.the general grant of bankruptcy jurisdiction is contained in.that provision vests original jurisdiction in the district courts over all civil proceedings arising under title,or arising in or related to cases under title.id.b.in what is a typical arrangement,the district of massachusetts,by standing order,has delegated to the bankruptcy court all cases in which jurisdiction is premised on section,see,subject to review by the district court or,alternatively,by the bankruptcy appellate panel in accordance with.
the statutory grant of related to jurisdiction is quite broad.congress deliberately allowed the cession of jurisdiction to the bankruptcy courts to enable them to deal efficiently and effectively with the entire universe of matters connected with bankruptcy estates.see pacor,higgins,cir.thus,bankruptcy courts ordinarily may exercise related to jurisdiction as long as the outcome of the litigation potentially could have some effect on the bankruptcy estate,such as altering debtor rights,liabilities,options,or freedom of action,or otherwise have an impact upon the handling and administration of the bankrupt estate.in re,cir quoting in re smith,cir.
in this instance,the bankruptcy court found the adversary proceeding to be related to a case under title,as that phrase is used in section b.at first blush,this seems to be a application of the general rule.whether or not brmc prevails will directly affect the amount of the liquidating dividend paid to creditors.there is,therefore,a fairly close connection between the adversary proceeding and the administration of the bankruptcy estate.that seemingly would suffice to bring this case within the bankruptcy court related to jurisdiction.see in re toledo,cir finding related to jurisdiction when the outcome of the suit would affect the amount of funds available to creditors.
the churches urge us not to apply the general rule here.in their view,the distinguishing feature is that commenced this proceeding after the bankruptcy court confirmed the plan.this argument presupposes that the scope of the bankruptcy court related to jurisdiction narrows dramatically once a plan of reorganization has been confirmed and that,thereafter,related to jurisdiction only includes those matters that have a particularly close nexus to the confirmed nexus that the churches assert is absent in this case.
on its face,section does not distinguish between and jurisdiction.nonetheless,courts sometimes have found a need to curtail the reach of related to jurisdiction in the context so that bankruptcy court jurisdiction does not continue indefinitely.see,in re pegasus gold,cir suggesting that bankruptcy court jurisdiction is necessarily more limited than jurisdiction in re resorts int l,cir similar.
the rationale behind this line of decisions starts with the premise that a reorganized debtor is emancipated by the confirmation of a reorganization plan.it emerges from bankruptcy and enters the marketplace in its reincarnated form.from that point forward,it is just like any other corporation it must protect its interests in the way provided by the applicable law,without any special swaddling.pettibone easley,cir.given the broad sweep of related to jurisdiction,applying the general rule without qualification after the confirmation of a reorganization plan easily could result in the bankruptcy court retaining jurisdiction of all cases affecting the reorganized debtor for many years thereafter.this prospect not only would work an unwarranted expansion of federal court jurisdiction but also would unfairly advantage reorganized debtors by allowing such firms to funnel virtually all litigation affecting them into a single federal forum.see id.at.
the solution,however,is not to discard the baby with the bath water.while courts have interpreted the term related to more grudgingly in some settings,context is important.those narrowing interpretations have been invoked only with respect to actions involving reorganized debtors that have reentered the marketplace.no case has suggested that courts should abandon the general rule in all cases.
here,the plan calls for the liquidation of brmc,not its continuation as a going concern.the most salient difference between the usual chapter reorganization and a liquidating plan is that,in the latter instance,the reorganized debtor sole purpose is to wind up its affairs,convert its assets to cash,and pay creditors a pro rata dividend.by definition,it has no authority to reenter the marketplace.that fact undercuts the primary purposes for parsimoniously policing the perimeter of jurisdiction the specter of endless bankruptcy jurisdiction and a kindred concern about unfairly advantaging reorganized debtors.accordingly,there is much less reason to depart from the general rule for related to jurisdiction where a claim involves a liquidating plan of reorganization.
there is another,perhaps more important,reason for distinguishing between liquidating plans and true reorganization plans.courts that have limited the scope of jurisdiction have based their holdings on the conclusion that,once confirmation has occurred,fewer proceedings are actually related to the underlying bankruptcy case.see,resorts int l,at in re craig stores of,cir.that makes good sense as the corporation moves on,the connection attenuates.
this justification is absent in the case of a liquidating plan.typically,a reorganized debtor is attempting to make a go of its business.thus,its actions including any involvement in litigation redound primarily to that end and only affect the underlying bankruptcy proceeding in a tangential or derivative way.see pettibone,at.by contrast,a liquidating debtor exists for the singular purpose of executing an order of the bankruptcy court.any litigation involving such a debtor thus relates much more directly to a proceeding under title.
this case is a paradigmatic example success or lack of success in securing a share of the trust corpus will directly impact the amount of the liquidating dividend eventually paid to brmc creditors.that is a matter intimately connected with the efficacy of the bankruptcy proceeding 
we add,moreover,that in the case of a liquidating plan of reorganization,there exists a substantial policy interest in favor of adhering to the general rule governing related to jurisdiction the strong federal policy in favor of the expeditious liquidation of debtor corporations and the prompt distribution of available assets to creditors.see in re holiday mart,cir in re cartridge television,cir.this policy is furthered by concentrating in a single forum any litigation that will impede or advance that goal.
the existence vel non of related to jurisdiction must be determined.see pegasus gold,at recognizing that related to jurisdiction should be determined with a certain flexibility.the language of the jurisdictional statute,is protean,and what is related to a proceeding under title in one context may be unrelated in another.with this in mind,we feel confident that there will be situations in which the fact that particular litigation arises after confirmation of a reorganization plan will defeat an attempted exercise of bankruptcy jurisdiction.see,resorts int l,at.we are equally confident,however,that there are other situations in which the fact that particular litigation arises after confirmation of a reorganization plan will not defeat an attempted exercise of bankruptcy jurisdiction.
insofar as we can tell,no court has yet addressed the scope of related to jurisdiction in a case involving a liquidating plan of reorganization.for the reasons alluded to above,we hold that when a debtor or a trustee acting to the debtor behoof commences litigation designed to marshal the debtor assets for the benefit of its creditors pursuant to a liquidating plan of reorganization,the compass of related to jurisdiction persists undiminished after plan confirmation.based on this holding,we affirm the bankruptcy court exercise of subject matter jurisdiction.
iii.the merits 
we turn now to the merits.in this court,the churches have abandoned their counterclaim for reformation of the trust indentures.see united states zannino,cir explaining that legal points alluded to in a perfunctory manner,but unaccompanied by developed argumentation,are deemed abandoned.instead,they focus on their thesis that is ineligible to receive a share of the trust residue.this thesis runs as follows.under massachusetts law,an organization is only eligible to receive a charitable bequest if it is capable of using the bequest for the purpose for which it was intended and an entity that exists solely for the benefit of creditors like is incapable of using such a bequest like krauss for the intended purpose provid ing a bed for indigent patients.
like the district court,we review de novo the bankruptcy court conclusions of law.in re mailman steam carpet cleaning,cir.we review its findings of fact,as modified by the district court,for clear error.id.inasmuch as the parties and the courts below have addressed this case on the plausible assumption that massachusetts law furnishes the substantive rules of decision,we follow suit.see in re newport plaza,cir see also ungar plo,cir.
massachusetts law on certain issues central to this appeal is fuliginous.we are therefore required to make an informed prophecy as to how the sjc would rule if confronted with the same questions.blinzler marriott int l,cir.in making this prediction,we rely first on settled massachusetts law and build from there by reference to case law in other jurisdictions and to the policies enunciated in the massachusetts cases.see moores greenberg,cir murphy,cir.we are entitled to assume that the highest court of the state would apply the rule that would best implement those policies.kathios motors,cir moores,at.
we begin with what can be gleaned from the massachusetts cases.in construing a will or other testamentary instrument,the testator intent governs.clymer mayo.charitable gifts are impressed with a kind of,which demands that they be applied to charitable purposes.see hillman roman catholic bishop of fall river,a gift with a general charitable intent,of course,imposes a trust of a sort in the sense that the grantee may not use the assets for private,personal purposes the assets must be used for charitable purposes consistent with those of the designated charity.see also brigham peter bent brigham,cir describing this phenomenon,under massachusetts law,as a quasi trust not a true trust smith livermore,stating that gifts to charitable corporations in massachusetts are considered gifts upon trust for charitable purposes.
in massachusetts,an organization that is the beneficiary of a charitable bequest is not disqualified from receiving the bequest merely because it has merged with another charity or has ceased actively to provide charitable services.see old colony trust winchester home for aged women,old colony trust third universalist soc y of cambridge,boston safe deposit trust stratton.in each of these cases,however,the beneficiary,though no longer itself providing charitable services,had the capacity to redirect its funds to another organization that was actively engaged in charitable endeavors.see,winchester home,at noting that although the named beneficiary itself no longer functioned as a home for elderly women,it continued to exist as a corporation and to use its resources to support a comparable facility in the same community.
this distinction seems to have driven the sjc decision in sleeper camp menotomy.there,a testator left a bequest to the arlington girl scouts ags.id.at.before the testator death,the corporation that previously had operated as ags disaffiliated with the girl scouts and went forward as the same corporate entity,albeit under the new name camp menotomy.id.at.as such,it ran a nonprofit summer camp for girls.id.the sjc held that the corporation was ineligible to receive the bequest because it no longer had any involvement in the scouting movement.id.at.
massachusetts law thus appears to require that a donee of a charitable bequest be able and willing,at a bare minimum,to direct the funds received to charitable purposes of the same general type and kind that it historically had performed.failing that,the courts will appoint a trustee to effectuate the testator charitable intent.see hubbard worcester art museum,explaining that i f the corporation,at the time of the probate of the will,was incapable of taking the property and carrying out the general charitable intent of the testator,the court would appoint a trustee to act in its place bliss am.bible soc y,similar.
we conclude,therefore,that the massachusetts cases point strongly to a rule that an organization can not receive a charitable bequest unless it is both capable of using that bequest for the intended purpose and willing to do so.against this backdrop,we must decide whether the bequest to brmc was intended for a charitable purpose and,if so,whether brmc had the capacity to carry out that purpose at the critical time.
under massachusetts law,a gift to a charitable organization is ordinarily construed as a gift for a charitable purpose.see wellesley coll.att y,osgood rogers.there is no dispute that both at the time krauss executed her will and at the time the probate court sanctioned the proposed trusts,brmc was a nonprofit corporation,duly qualified under section c of the internal revenue code,c,and,thus,a charitable organization.against this backdrop,we readily conclude that krauss intended the bequest to be used for a charitable purpose.the will explicit reference to a bed for indigent patients makes this clear,as does the trust article naming brmc as a beneficiary which states that the residue of the trust shall be distributed in equal shares to such of the following charitable organizations so long as each organization then qualifies as a charity under the internal revenue code.
viewed in this light,the question reduces to whether brmc,in its new incarnation as a corporation whose sole purpose is to marshal its assets,liquidate them,and distribute the proceeds to creditors,is eligible to receive a charitable bequest.on this issue,the massachusetts cases are silent and the authorities elsewhere are divided.compare,in re will of kraetzer,misc d,holding that a bankrupt hospital is not capable of implementing the purpose of a charitable bequest and that the hospital is therefore ineligible to receive the bequest,with,montclair bank trust seton hall coll.of med.dentistry,concluding otherwise on the ground that the payment of debts incurred in the furtherance of charitable purposes is itself a charitable purpose.
we navigate through these uncharted waters by following a pole star of massachusetts law the principle that,in construing testamentary instruments,courts,whenever possible,should give full effect to the testator intent.see clymer,at.the language that krauss used in her will offers a window into her intent she was concerned about helping sick persons who could not afford to pay for health care.that is a fairly typical species of charitable intent a charitable act generally is thought to be an act of benevolence or generosity toward others,in particular the needy.see.lifecare bd.of assessors,saltonstall sanders.
normally,a testator who leaves a charitable bequest acts with a prospective intention.see will of kraetzer,at.she intends that the bequest will increase the charity good works by helping it to continue furnishing services,to expand service delivery,or the like.we find it difficult to imagine that,in the absence of special circumstances,a person with a generic charitable intent would choose to subsidize a charitable organization if she knew that the funds would be used only to pay creditors and not to assist in providing any future or additional charitable services 
the bankruptcy court thought that since brmc incurred its debts in the furtherance of its charitable mission,the payment of those debts could be deemed charitable in nature.brmc ii,at.that reasoning has some superficial appeal it would have been impossible for brmc to function effectively as a hospital without credit and in that sense the provision of credit was vital to its ability to discharge its charitable function.in the usual case,however,the extension of credit is not itself an act of charity,and in a sense,the payment of debts after a hospital ceases operations does not further the hospital ability to carry out its charitable mission.for that reason,we think it would be inconsistent with krauss intent for a hospital to receive a portion of the trust corpus with the understanding that it would be spent solely to reimburse creditors for debts previously incurred.
we are also unpersuaded that holding a bankrupt hospital incapable of taking a charitable bequest will have the dire consequences predicted by the appellees.while a rule that charitable bequests could not be used to pay debts might have a crippling effect on a charity ability to obtain credit and,hence,on its ability to function,our holding is not nearly so broad.we decide only that,absent a contrary provision in the will or indenture of trust,a charitable organization that has ceased to perform any charitable work and that is incapable of redirecting new funds for charitable purposes is ineligible to receive a charitable bequest or gift.that rule will have the effect,in a few cases,of blocking a charity creditors from access to a new source of that is a small price to pay for honoring the testator intent 
this decision does not end our odyssey.we still must consider the significance if any of the time lapse between the testator death and the ensuing bankruptcy.when krauss died,brmc was running a fully functioning hospital and was actively engaged in performing its charitable mission.by any standard,it was then able to receive the bequest.the question is whether that datum makes a dispositive difference.
in the churches view,this accident
