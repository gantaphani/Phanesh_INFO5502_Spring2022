introduction 
plaintiff tammy king appeals from a judgment entered in favor of defendant barbara johnston.tammy a beneficiary of the arthur gilbert testamentary trust,sued barbara in a civil action,alleging that barbara had unduly influenced the trustee,lenora gilbert,to breach the trust according to tammy,barbara induced lenora to transfer a piece of trust property to herself,without consideration,after which barbara induced lenora to mortgage the property for a personal loan.the bank eventually foreclosed on the property,and lenora lost title.tammy also alleged that barbara took money and rents that belonged to the trust and used them for her own personal benefit.
tammy asserted,in the alternative,that barbara had essentially taken over the role of trustee while lenora was still alive but in failing mental and physical health,and that barbara actions during this period of time constituted a breach of trust.tammy further alleged that after lenora death,barbara acted as trustee and thus became a trustee de son tort and that barbara breached her duties as trustee during that period of time by failing to properly care for recover trust property.
after a bench trial,the trial court determined that tammy should recover nothing from barbara.specifically,the trial court concluded that tammy had failed to establish the existence of a conspiracy between lenora and barbara,that tammy had not established that barbara was a de facto trustee before lenora died,and that tammy,as a trust beneficiary,did not have standing to sue barbara without joining the current trustee,lloyd gilbert,in the action.
the trial court also concluded that barbara had unduly influenced lenora to breach the trust,and that barbara had acted as trustee after lenora death,before lloyd accepted his role as trustee.despite these findings,the court determined that because tammy lacked standing to sue barbara for barbara role as a participant in lenora breach,tammy could not recover under that theory.the court also declined to award tammy any relief as to her claim that barbara had acted as trustee after lenora death,because,the court noted,lloyd was actively recouping the value of the trust rental income that barbara had wrongfully retained by withholding her share of the trust distributions 
on appeal,tammy contends that the trial court erred in denying her relief in the form of the value of the trust property that lenora transferred out of the trust and lost after defaulting on her loan.specifically,tammy asserts that the court erred in concluding that she did not have standing to sue barbara for barbara role as a participant in lenora breach of trust.tammy also contends that the trial court erred in failing to grant relief to make the trust whole by rejecting tammy argument that barbara acted as a trustee de son tort during lenora tenure as trustee.tammy further contends that the trial court erred in failing to make a determination as to whether barbara became a trustee de son tort by acting as trustee after lenora death.if barbara were found to have been a trustee de son tort,she may have been obligated to fulfill the same duties a trustee would be required to fulfill,including protecting and restoring trust property.
we conclude that the trial court erred in determining that tammy did not have standing to sue barbara for barbara role as a participant in a trustee breach.we also conclude that the court erred in failing to consider and make the necessary findings as to whether tammy could recover from barbara under a theory that after lenora death,barbara became a trustee de son tort,and thus had duties to the trust beneficiaries,which she breached.we therefore reverse the judgment and remand the case.
factual and procedural backgrounda.factual background 
upon arthur gilbert death in,his widow lenora became the trustee of the arthur gilbert testamentary trust.upon lenora death,the trust estate was to be distributed as follows a percent to tammy and percent to tammy sister,brenda leifheit representing an even split of the percent that would have gone to their deceased father,one of arthur sons b percent to lloyd,arthur other son c percent to barbara,arthur stepdaughter and d percent to the church of christ 
during the distribution of arthur estate,lenora,as trustee,received title to two parcels of land,parcel and parcel,which are adjacent to each other.mark osterkamp rented both parcels for farming.
lenora personally received title to two other parcels of land,the gilbert residence,and a property identified as parcel.parcel sits directly west of parcel and directly north of parcel.osterkamp also rented parcel from the gilbert family.
arthur probate closed in.
in december,lenora suffered a seizure and spent approximately two weeks in the hospital.in january,lenora told her niece by marriage that she had been sick and that barbara was taking care of her finances.
in the summer of,lenora was living at a residence that she owned on dahlia lane in imperial,california.barbara lived approximately seven and a half or eight miles from lenora,on james road.that summer,lenora transferred parcel out of the trust without consideration,and used parcel and the dahlia lane property as security for a personal loan from ford consumer finance.the escrow officers who handled the transaction stated that a woman who identified herself as barbara johnston had directed that any mail concerning the transaction be sent to barbara james road address.
lenora physical and mental health continued to decline.after lenora was diagnosed with dementia,barbara opened a joint savings account with lenora.osterkamp rent checks were deposited into this account.over a number of months,thousands of dollars in rental income belonging to the trust was withdrawn from the joint account.during this time,lenora could not drive and had difficulty walking.
around march of,barbara began endorsing osterkamp rent checks by signing lenora name.that year,barbara entered into a lease with osterkamp.the lease included parcel.barbara signed both lenora name and her own name on the lease agreement.
lenora failed to make payments on the personal loan that was secured by the property that she had transferred out of the trust.the lender eventually foreclosed and took title to parcel and the dahlia lane residence.lenora then moved in with barbara and barbara husband.
lenora died on march.after lenora died,barbara told osterkamp to make his rent checks out to her as trustee osterkamp first rent check after lenora death was made payable to barbara arthur gilbert trust,and was dated march day after lenora died.osterkamp asked barbara to show him the trust documents,and then asked her about lloyd.barbara told osterkamp that she did not know where lloyd was,and said she did not know how to get in touch with him osterkamp continued to pay his rent to barbara,as trustee,for a number of months.barbara endorsed and deposited the checks,despite the fact that she had seen lloyd at lenora funeral in late march,and knew that he was the named successor trustee.barbara claimed that she believed that lloyd did not want to have anything to do with the trust because he had said,t ake care of things or something along those lines to her at the funeral.
in december,an attorney for lloyd wrote to barbara and inquired about the trust property.barbara did not respond to the letter.in may or june,another attorney for lloyd contacted barbara.barbara claimed at trial that she had no information regarding the trust to give to lloyd attorney at that time.on august,lloyd recorded a document entitled affidavit of succession trustee.barbara did not provide either lloyd or tammy with financial information about the trust barbara testified that she had burned receipts and money orders that could have shown how she spent the rental income from osterkamp after lenora death.
tammy presented evidence that lenora could have used her own personal property,namely parcel,as security for the personal loan barbara stood to inherit percent of lenora personal property upon lenora death,but was to inherit only a percent share of the trust property,which included parcel.an expert appraised parcel to be worth at the time of trial,but adjusted the value of the property to to account for the estimated that it would cost to address a drainage problem on the property.
procedural background 
tammy filed her original complaint against barbara on november.in her complaint,tammy alleged seven causes of action which she identified as conspiracy to breach of lots from the trust without consideration conspiracy to breach of trust property for personal advantage conspiracy to breach of trust property in violation of the terms of the trust conspiracy to breach to recover trust property conspiracy to breach in the place and stead of incapacitated trustee conspiracy to breach influencing incapacitated trustee and accounting.barbara answered the complaint on january.
the court granted tammy request to file an amended complaint fac,which she filed on november.tammy retained the same allegations as the original complaint in the fac,and added two causes of action entitled breach of trust and bad faith breach of trust.tammy allegations included the contention that barbara johnston,acting for her own personal advantage,induced,aided and abetted the foregoing breach of trust,lenora taking of parcel and using it as security for a personal loan all to plaintiff damage in an amount to be proved at trial.barbara answered the fac on february.
trial in the matter was set to begin on april.in the days just prior to trial,tammy moved to file a second amended complaint sac.in the proposed sac,tammy sought to add lloyd,as trustee,as a plaintiff in the action,as well as to clarify certain allegations in the fac.tammy submitted a declaration of lloyd in which he stated,i was reluctant to act as trustee in support of tammy king allegations in this case until i had determined that her allegations against barbara johnston were substantial.i am now convinced that the allegations are substantial,and i have agreed to become a plaintiff in this case with her.
after discussing the matter of adding lloyd as a plaintiff in the case,and in response to barbara attorney objection that discovery would have to be reopened if lloyd were added as a plaintiff,the trial court gave tammy the option of proceeding to trial without amending the complaint or postponing trial.tammy attorney indicated that tammy wanted to go forward with trial,and the trial court denied the motion to file the sac.
the court held a bench trial between april and may.at the conclusion of trial,the court requested that the parties brief the issue of tammy standing to bring the action.the parties filed their briefs on this issue on may.
the trial court issued its tentative decision on august.the court organized its tentative decision around a number of questions that also served as topic headings.specifically,the court asked,and then provided answers to,the following questions did defendant johnston conspire with lenora gilbert were the alleged breaches of trust of lenora gilbert the result of undue influence by defendant did defendant become the trustee does plaintiff,as a trust beneficiary,have standing to bring the instant suit the court final heading was not presented in the form of a question,but rather,as a statement defendant acts as trustee subsequent to the death of lenora.
among the trial court conclusions was its determination that the evidence created a strong inference that lenora actions were due to the undue influence of barbara.the court found that the evidence demonstrated that lenora was in failing physical and mental health at the relevant times lenora was dependent on barbara for assistance regarding financial matters and medical issues barbara communicated with the title company and a lender regarding a loan transaction secured by trust property barbara provided significant assistance to lenora regarding personal banking d ocuments regarding transactions involving trust property were sent to barbara address and barbara signed lenora name to transactional documents and checks.the trial court rejected barbara claims that she had not signed lenora name on documents and checks,and inferred from the lack of credibility of barbara testimony that barbara had,in fact,been involved in lenora actions concerning trust property.the court stated,the fact that barbara executed lenora signature was abundantly clear to the court sitting as trier of fact barbara falsehoods in this regard were further confirmed by uncontradicted expert testimony.
the court ultimately concluded that barbara had exercised undue influence over lenora with regard to lenora breach of her duties as trustee,explaining 
here,the evidence showed that lenora took actions inconsistent with her duties as trustee transferring property out of the trust without consideration at a time when she was in failing physical and mental health the evidence further shows that barbara was involved in the transactions.lenora was,to a great extent,dependent on barbara to assist her with financial and other matters.this,coupled with barbara false and patently unreasonable denial of any involvement with lenora financial affairs compels the conclusion that barbara did,in fact,exercise undue influence over lenora.
however,the trial court rejected tammy theory that barbara had acted in the capacity of trustee prior to lenora death.although the trial court referred to the theory under which tammy sought to hold barbara liable as a trustee for her conduct prior to lenora death as one involving a de facto trustee,and not,as tammy had argued,a trustee de son tort,the court did refer in its discussion to the primary case on which tammy had relied,and appeared to address tammy contention regarding the trustee de son tort theory.the court also concluded that barbara had not conspired with lenora because there was no evidence that the two had agreed to do anything.
the trial court concluded that tammy did not have standing to bring the lawsuit without naming lloyd as a defendant for his having failed to bring the lawsuit in the first place.
finally,the court made the following determination 
the court finds that defendant acted as trustee subsequent to the death of lenora and prior to the succession of lloyd.during this time,defendant took possession of funds belonging to the trust rental income defendant has failed to account for these funds or their disposition.the evidence shows that the current trustee is actively recouping the funds from defendant by means of withholding distribution of trust income.this appears to be an eminently practical method for the recovery of trust property.the court declines to interfere with the trustee discretion in recovery of the funds.
the court indicated that its tentative decision was to grant judgment in favor of barbara,and indicated that barbara was to prepare a proposed statement of decision if one was requested.
on august,tammy filed a request for a statement of decision.in her request,tammy asked the court to clarify a number of matters related to the issues that she has raised in this appeal,and specifically urged the court to consider case law that she had presented to the court,but to which the court had not referred in its tentative decision.
on september,tammy filed a proposed statement of decision.in that document,tammy specifically raised the issue of barbara participation in lenora breach of trust.in support of her proposed statement of decision,tammy also filed three memoranda of points and authorities,each of which argued an independent theory as to why the court should hold barbara the theories that barbara was a trustee de son tort,and that tammy has standing to bring a claim that barbara was a participant in lenora breach.tammy also filed a proposed judgment.
it appears that at some point tammy moved to amend the operative complaint,after trial,to conform to proof.although the motion is not in the record,the record contains barbara opposition to amending the complaint a third time,which was filed on september.that same day,the trial court filed an order adopting its tentative decision as its final statement of decision.the court rejected tammy request for a statement of decision,stating that tammy proposed statement of decision was replete with argument and citations to case law,and appears to be merely a posttrial brief.the court also noted that barbara method for responding to tammy proposed statement of was to do nothing more than file a notice of lodgment of the court tentative wholly inadequate.the trial court stated,the parties have utterly failed to comply with the statutes and rules of court relating to the preparation of a statement of decision.this failure is so complete that the court can not discern what controverted issues it is required to address.therefore,the c ourt finds that the parties have waived any further statement of decision herein the tentative ruling shall become the statement of decision of the court forthwith.
the court filed a judgment on november.tammy filed a timely notice of appeal on november.
discussion 
tammy contends on appeal that the trial court should have found barbara liable a value of tammy portion of the value of parcel,which was lost during lenora tenure as trustee.tammy offers multiple theories as to how she,as a beneficiary,should have been permitted to recover from barbara the value of parcel.tammy first theory is that she has standing to sue and may recover from barbara the value of parcel,which lenora transferred to herself without consideration,because barbara was a participant in lenora breach of trust.a second theory tammy proposes is that the trial court should have determined that barbara was a trustee de son tort of the trust,before after lenora death.with respect to the time period during which lenora was ostensibly the trustee,tammy contends that barbara fully assumed the character and duties of the trustee and managed the trust estate as trustee long before her mother died.according to tammy,barbara may be held liable as a trustee de son tort for allowing parcel to be removed from the trust without consideration and eventually foreclosed on.further,according to tammy,she,as a beneficiary,can maintain this action against barbara and recover for the trust the value of parcel because a beneficiary may always sue a tammy asserts includes a trustee de son his or her breach of trust.
with respect to the time period after lenora died and before lloyd accepted his position as successor trustee,tammy contends that even if barbara did not become a trustee de son tort before lenora death,she clearly became one when,after lenora death,she held herself out as trustee and took control of trust property.tammy asserts that barbara is therefore liable for any breach of her trustee duties during this time,and that a trust beneficiary may sue her for any such breach.
we conclude that the trial court erred in determining that tammy offered no theory pursuant to which she may recover from barbara.based on the trial court findings of fact,tammy could recover from barbara under either a participant theory,or,possibly,under a theory that barbara was a trustee de son tort after lenora death.the trial court clearly found that barbara was significantly involved in if not wholly responsible for lenora breach of,the breach that resulted in the trust losing parcel.based on this finding,the trial court should have permitted tammy to recover damages that the trust suffered under the participant theory.further,the court should have determined whether,and if so,to what extent,tammy may recover from barbara under the theory that barbara was a trustee de son tort for the trust property after lenora death.
tammy may recover from barbara the value of property that barbara helped lenora to transfer out of the trust,under the theory that barbara acted as a participant in the breach 
in the trial court statement of decision,the court posed the question,does plaintiff,as a trust beneficiary,have standing to bring the instant suit the court answer to this question was,no.citing saks damon raike th,d,the trial court noted that n ormally,the trustee is the real party in interest regarding claims of the trust against third parties,and the trustee has the exclusive right to bring an action.the trial court did acknowledge the existence of an exception to that general rule,stating that a beneficiary may bring an equitable action against the third party and the trustee,in situations where the trustee should bring the action against a third party but refuses to do so.however,because tammy had not named lloyd as a defendant in the action,the court concluded that tammy action failed to meet the requirements of the exception that permits a beneficiary to sue a third party however,the trial court failed to recognize another exception to the general that applies here.specifically,a beneficiary may pursue claims against a third party on his or her own,without participation by the trustee,when that third party actively participated in,or knowingly benefited from,a trustee breach of trust.
as a general rule,the trustee is the real party in interest with standing to sue and defend on the trust behalf.citations.conversely,a trust beneficiary can not sue in the name of the trust.citations.estate of bowles th,d bowles.but a trust beneficiary can bring a proceeding against a trustee for breach of trust.citations.id.at,d.moreover,it is well established,and this court has held,that a trust beneficiary can pursue a cause of action against a third party who actively participates in or knowingly benefits from a trustee breach of trust.citations.id.at,d.
ordinarily,when a third party acts to further his or her own economic interests by participating with a trustee in such a breach of trust,the beneficiary will bring suit against both the trustee and the third party.however,it is not necessary to join the trustee in the suit,because primarily it is the beneficiaries who are wronged and who are entitled to sue citation.the liability of the third party is to the beneficiaries,rather than to the trustee,and the right of the beneficiaries against the third party is a direct right and not one that is derivative through the trustee.citation.city of atascadero merrill lynch,pierce,fenner smith,th,d see also bowles,supra,th at,d t he beneficiary cause of action is independent and not derivative through the trustee therefore,the trustee is not a necessary party to the action.citations.thus,when the claim being asserted rests in whole or in part on alleged breaches of trust by the trustee,a beneficiary has standing to pursue such a claim against either the trustee directly,the trustee and third parties participating in or benefiting from his,her,or its breach of trust,or such third parties alone.bowles,supra,th at,d,citing harnedy whitty th,d d trusts.
tammy,according to the trial court findings,barbara actively participated in lenora breaches of fiduciary duty,including the transfer of parcel to lenora as an individual without consideration.specifically,the court found that barbara was involved in the transactions that resulted in lenora transferring property out of the trust without consideration at a time when lenora was in failing physical and mental health,and that barbara exercise d undue influence over lenora with regard to these transactions.in a typical case,these facts would bring tammy claim against barbara within the exception that a trust beneficiary may pursue a cause of action against a third party who actively participates in or knowingly benefits from a trustee breach of trust.
however,we have not found any california authority that directly addresses the unique situation presented,one in which a beneficiary brings a claim against a third party for her participation in a trustee breach,despite the fact that a successor trustee has taken over the duties of the breaching trustee.thus,it is an open question whether the appointment of a successor trustee extinguishes a beneficiary ability to sue that third party for involvement in a prior trustee breach of trust.
the authors of a well known treatise on trusts appear to be of the view that a successor trustee appointment might extinguish a beneficiary right to sue a third party in such a case where a trustee in breach of trust transfers trust property to someone who is not a bona fide purchaser and thereafter ceases to be trustee,it would seem that the beneficiaries can not maintain a suit against the transferee unless the successor trustee refuses to sue or is unavailable.scott ascher on trusts ed,italics added.however,scott and ascher cite no authority to support their conclusion that a beneficiary may not maintain an action in a situation in which a successor trustee has been appointed nor do they offer any reason why it would seem that such a rule is appropriate.
in contrast to scott and ascher position on this issue,the court in bowles implicitly determined that a beneficiary may bring a claim against a third party who participated in a trustee breach of trust,despite the appointment of a successor trustee.in bowles,the plaintiff beneficiary sued two defendants,alleging that bowles,the trustee,had breached her fiduciary duties as trustee,and that the two defendants had induced,aided and abetted bowles breaches with the knowledge that the transactions breached bowles duties as trustee.bowles,supra,th at,d.by the time the plaintiff filed the action,bowles had died and a bank had been appointed successor trustee.id.at,d.although the bowles court did not specifically address the issue of the existence of a successor trustee the effect of the appointment of a successor trustee on the beneficiary claims,the court concluded that the plaintiff had standing to bring the action against the third parties in that situation.
we affirmatively state here what the bowles court implicitly,that the naming of a successor trustee does not prevent a beneficiary from proceeding on a claim against a third party who participated in benefitted from a predecessor trustee breach of trust.if it is true that the right of the beneficiaries against the third party is a direct right and not one that is derivative through the trustee citation atascadero,supra,th at,d,we see no reason why an independent claim that exists prior to the appointment of a successor trustee should be extinguished upon that appointment,and barbara has offered no reason why the appointment of a successor trustee should serve to wipe out a beneficiary direct right against a third party.we therefore conclude that a beneficiary,like tammy,may maintain an action against and recover from a third party who has assisted a former trustee in committing a breach of trust,even where a successor trustee has been appointed.
barbara contends on appeal that w ithout a conspiracy,tammy king can not jump over the trustee and sue barbara johnston.she asserts that in bowles and in pierce lyman th,d,there was sufficient evidence produced at trial that the third party actively participated in a conspiracy to breach the trust.barbara further contends that in these cases,t here were conspiracies,but that in the present case,the trial court ruled that there was no conspiracy between barbara johnston and lenora.barbara misconstrues the scope of bowles and pierce.neither case involved a conspiracy,and neither case suggests that evidence of a conspiracy is required in order to hold a third party liable for participating in or benefiting from a trustee breach of trust.rather,bowles and pierce involved situations strikingly similar to the one here.thus,although the trial court in this case determined that tammy had not proved the existence of an actual conspiracy between lenora and barbara,this is of no consequence to tammy standing to bring a claim against barbara for barbara role as a participant in lenora breach of trust.
because the trial court concluded that tammy did not have standing to bring claims against barbara,the court did not make the necessary determinations with respect to barbara liability for her role as a participant in lenora breach of trust.for example,the court did not make a finding as to the amount of the loss that the trust suffered as a result of lenora breach of trust.we must therefore remand the case to the trial court for it to determine the relief available to tammy 
as a final note,in determining that tammy has standing to recover from barbara under a theory that barbara was an active participant in lenora breach,we must necessarily uphold the trial court conclusion that tammy may not at the same time prevail on her theory that barbara should be liable as a trustee de son tort for that same conduct,her conduct before lenora death.barbara was either a participant in a trustee breach of trust,or she was a trustee de son tort she can not have been both a third party and a trustee at the same time.since there is substantial evidence to support the trial court findings that barbara did not assume the role of trustee during lenora lifetime,and that barbara unduly influenced lenora and was involved in the transactions that amounted to a breach,we reject tammy trustee de son tort theory of liability for barbara conduct prior to lenora death.
tammy may recover from barbara for barbara breach of trust after lenora death 
in the alternative,tammy could possibly recover the value of parcel for the trust under the theory that barbara failed to meet her duties as a trustee a trustee de son tort after lenora died.although tammy requested in her proposed statement of decision that the trial court address this issue,the trial court limited its consideration of barbara liability for her conduct after lenora death to barbara failure to account for rental income that belonged to the trust.the trial court failed to address tammy contention that barbara should be held responsible for not seeking to redress the loss of trust property once barbara held herself out as trustee after lenora death.because tammy brought to the trial court attention the court failure to consider barbara liability as a trustee de son tort after lenora death,we can not infer from the court failure to address these issues that the court resolved these issues against tammy see,gallo cattle kawamura th,fn,d the trial court is required upon appropriate request to issue a statement of decision explaining the factual and legal basis for its decision as to each of the principal controverted issues.citation.if the trial court fails to resolve a controverted issue and the record shows that the omission or ambiguity was properly brought to the attention of the trial court,the appellate court may not draw factual inferences in support of the judgment.citation.
the trial court should have addressed whether barbara could be held liable as a trustee de son tort for her failure to protect recover parcel or its value after lenora death the fifth edition of black law dictionary defined a trustee de son tort as a p erson who is treated as a trustee because of his wrongdoing with respect to property entrusted to him or over which he exercised authority which he lacked.black law dict.ed.in england winslow cal,england,the supreme court explained the common law theory of imposing fiduciary duties on a person who acts as if he or she is a trustee by taking control of trust property,despite lacking the authority to do so.in england,the plaintiff was executrix of sophia winslow estate,and the defendant was sophia winslow husband at the time of her death.id.at.after winslow death,the defendant collected the rents from occupants of a building that had been winslow separate property.ibid.the plaintiff sought an accounting and the payment of all of the money that the defendant had collected from those tenants.id.at.the court determined that the defendant had essentially become the trustee of those funds by virtue of acting as trustee,by taking control of and managing estate assets.id.at.
the england court explained,one who has assumed the relation and undertaken to act in the capacity of a trustee and who has thereby come into the possession and control of the money or property of another can not be heard to deny the validity of the trust under which he has admittedly acted and the benefits of which he has received and holds.citation.a person may become a trustee by construction by intermeddling with and assuming the management of property without authority,and during the possession and management thereof by such constructive trustees they are subject to the same rules and remedies as other trustees,and can not avoid their liability as such by showing that they were not in fact trustees,nor can they set up the statute of limitations.england,supra,cal.at.the court further described the basis for the doctrine,as follows 
it is a well settled rule in the law of trusts that if a person not being in fact a trustee acts as such by mistake or intentionally,he thereby becomes a trustee de son tort.the rule is thus laid down by a recent writer a person may become a trustee by construction,by intermeddling with and assuming the management of property without authority.such persons are trustees de son tort just as persons who assume to deal with a deceased person estate without authority are administrators de son tort,during the possession and management by such constructive trustees they are subject to the same rules and remedies as other trustees.citations.it is plain that this branch of the law does not rest on the strict ground of estoppel as usually expounded in the law books.it rather depends upon a principle of public policy connected with the right administration of justice.citation.the principle to be extracted from the cases is that the party acting as trustee shall not be allowed,in a court of justice,to set up,as against parties interested in the administration of the trust,a state of things inconsistent with his assumed character.england,supra,cal.at.
although england is not recent authority,it appears to still be valid,and the equitable principles on which the notion of a trustee de son tort is based remain relevant today.the facts in this case seem to fit precisely with the notion espoused in england that one should not be permitted to assume the character of a trustee and wrongfully benefit from doing so without also having to assume the responsibilities of a trustee.there is evidence that barbara held herself out as the trustee to osterkamp,and that she went so far as to tell osterkamp that she did not know where lloyd was and that she could not get in touch with him.as the trial court apparently found,barbara assumed management of the trust rental income by accepting the rental income in her name,as trustee.barbara was seemingly the only person who took control of the trust assets after her mother died.the trial court specifically concluded that barbara acted as trustee and that she took possession of funds belonging to the trust during the period of time after lenora death and before lloyd accepted his position as trustee.however,the trial court did not address whether barbara conduct was such that she should be held to the same standards as a named trustee would be held.there were clearly sufficient facts to support a finding that barbara wrongfully took over some or all of the trust property after her mother died.the trial court will have to determine on remand whether barbara conduct was sufficient to hold her liable as a trustee de son tort of some or all of the trust property and,if so,whether she breached her duties in that role,and what relief would be appropriate if the court finds that such a breach occurred 
barbara does not offer any reason why she may not be held liable for her conduct after lenora death.she simply ignores the contention that she assumed the role of trustee after lenora death,instead focusing all of her attention on,and citing the trial court findings only with regard to,the time period before lenora died.barbara also incorrectly asserts that tammy did not raise the trustee de son tort theory in the trial court.however,it is clear that tammy did,in fact,raise this issue in the trial court.
thus,the trial court should have addressed whether barbara breached her duties as a trustee de son tort in the manner in which she managed the trust assets in failing to provide an accounting of the trust assets in failing to seek to recover property that the trust had lost as a result of lenora breach of trust.on remand,the trial court should consider the extent to which barbara may have owed fiduciary duties to the beneficiaries,and whether barbara fulfilled,or instead,breached,any such fiduciary duties when she acted as trustee after lenora death and prior to lloyd succession as trustee.
c.the trial court should determine the relief to be awarded 
tammy asserts that she may recover various forms of relief,depending on the theory of liability under which she prevails.for example,tammy contends that barbara should be held liable for tammy portion of the value of parcel for barbara role as a third party who actively participated in lenora breach.tammy contends that if barbara is liable as a trustee de son tort for her actions while lenora was still alive,then barbara is responsible to make the trust whole for the damages she caused to it,which,tammy contends,would include the value of parcel at the date of trial.tammy then suggests that if barbara is held liable as a trustee de son tort for her actions after lenora death,barbara should be responsible for damages in the amount of the current value of parcel,in order to make the trust whole,because she deprived the trustee and tammy of the opportunity to sue lenora estate for the value of parcel.alternatively,tammy argues that,the court may declare barbara beneficial interest in parcel to be held by barbara as constructive trustee for the benefit of the trust.
tammy also asserts that under any theory,barbara should be responsible for the amount that the attorney fees and costs of this litigation exceeded tammy share of the attorney fees and costs that lloyd,as successor trustee,would have incurred by a timely action against lenora estate.tammy also claims that barbara should be liable for double damages under probate code,and asks this court to impose such damages,or to direct the trial court to do so.
we decline to address any of tammy arguments concerning her requests for particular relief,for a number of reasons.first,the trial court made no findings with regard to damages because the court determined that tammy did not have standing to sue barbara,and because the court made no determination as to whether barbara might be liable as a trustee de son tort for her conduct after lenora death.in the absence of any findings by the trial court with regard to damages equitable relief,we decline to comment on what relief may or may not be appropriate available to tammy.
second,other than with respect to tammy argument asserting that she should be awarded excess attorney fees as damages,tammy provides no reasoned argument or authority on appeal to support her assertions with regard to any of the relief to which she claims she is entitled third and perhaps as a consequence of our second reason for declining to address possible relief,we are not convinced that tammy would necessarily be entitled to recover different amounts under the various alternative theories that she presents.rather,it appears that the essence of tammy complaints against barbara revolve around the loss of parcel.regardless of how that loss may be remedied,and whether it be under a theory of participant liability,or liability as a trustee de son tort,it would appear that the available relief would be similar,if not the same for example,tammy proposes that she may recover double damages under probate code section under any theory of liability.we leave to the trial court the determination as to the appropriate relief in these circumstances.
disposition 
the judgment of the trial court is reversed.the case is remanded to the trial court with the following directions 
the trial court shall consider the evidence presented at trial and determine whether tammy has prevailed on her claim that barbara is liable as a trustee for breaches of trust owed to the beneficiaries after lenora death under a trustee de son tort theory 
the trial court shall find in favor of tammy on her claim against barbara for barbara actions as a third party who actively participated in lenora breach of trust and 
after resolving the remaining issues of liability,the trial court shall determine the amount of damages barbara is to pay to reimburse the trust,under either or both
