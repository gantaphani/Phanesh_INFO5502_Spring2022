plaintiff william meyers,a former city of san jose employee,petitioned under probate code sections and for an order removing certain trustees of defendant the retirement fund of the federated city employees retirement fund,the retirement system for the city of san jose.the superior court dismissed the petition on the grounds the retirement fund is expressly excluded from the definition of a trust under section,and thus a petition to remove trustees under the probate code may not be maintained against it.
on appeal,meyers argues the judgment must be reversed,despite the exclusionary language of section,because the california constitution mandates that t he assets of a public pension or retirement system are trust funds cal,art.xvi,subd.a section and section,subdivision c section c specifically allows for the application of trust law to public pension funds.
we disagree and shall affirm the judgment.
factual and procedural background 
verified petition to remove trustees 
in august,meyers filed his verified petition to remove trustees.santa clara county,pr.in that petition,meyers alleged he began working for the city of san jose as an associate construction inspector in,remaining in that position for approximately four years.in february,he was injured in the course and scope of his employment and underwent cervical fusion surgery.
in september and april,meyers applied to the retirement fund for disability retirement benefits,submitting the opinions of at least eighteen different medical professionals,all of whom were in agreement that meyers was disabled as a consequence of the injury he suffered in.the physician paid by the city of san jose to evaluate disability claims,however,did not agree and the retirement fund denied meyers applications 
in his petition,meyers claimed the retirement fund trustees have breached their fiduciary duties to him and other beneficiaries by unreasonably delaying the beneficiary claim process,by refusing to consider relevant medical evidence,by withholding information from beneficiaries,and by essentially the opinion of the city of san jose physician and disregarding all other competent evidence regarding the disabilities of beneficiaries.meyers alleged the trustees are refusing to disburse benefits to disabled city of san jose employees because the city current budget crisis has made it politically unpopular to award disability pensions.meyers further alleged,on information and belief,that in,the retirement fund trustees approved six out of seven disability retirement applications,but in and,only two out of applicants were approved for disability retirement.
in his prayer for relief,meyers sought an order removing certain named retirement fund trustees,specifically matt loesch,edward overton,arn andrews,michael armstrong,lara druyan,stuart odell and martin dirks an order appointing a receiver or temporary trustee to administer the trust until new trustees are appointed and attorney fees and costs.
ex parte application and opposition 
in november,in connection with the petition to remove trustees,meyers brought an ex parte application for an order requiring the retirement fund to provide notice of hearing to all the beneficiaries.in that application,meyers stated he is not aware of the names and addresses of the beneficiaries to the retirement fund,each of whom is entitled to notice of hearing on his petition to remove the trustees.accordingly,the retirement fund,which has the necessary contact information,should be ordered to provide the required notice.
the retirement fund opposed the ex parte application,and in that opposition further argued meyers petition should be dismissed because,among other reasons,the retirement fund is not a trust under section,subdivision b section b thus the court lacked jurisdiction over the matter.the trial court set a hearing on the jurisdictional issue,and gave meyers an opportunity to brief the matter.
at the hearing,meyers contended section c specifically allows for the application of trust law to pension funds,despite the fact that pension funds are otherwise excluded from the definition of a trust by operation of section b.the trial court found,however,that the retirement fund was not a trust for the purposes of application of the probate code,relying on the exclusionary language of section,and dismissed meyers petition.
meyers timely appealed.
ii.discussion 
standard of review 
in this appeal,we examine the scope and application of certain statutes,specifically sections and,as well as section of the california constitution.questions of statutory interpretation are subject to de novo review.california teachers san diego community college dist.cal d.that review is guided by settled rules,all of which are designed to ascertain the intent of the lawmakers and avoid an interpretation that would lead to absurd consequences.cypress semiconductor superior court th.

b.the retirement fund is not subject to the trust law for purposes of petitions to remove trustees for breach of fiduciary duty 
section,which the trial court relied on in dismissing meyers petition is found in part of division of the probate code,a part entitled definitions,and defines the word trust as used in the probate code.pursuant to section,subdivision a,the word trust includes an express trust,private or charitable,with additions thereto,wherever and however created and a trust created or determined by a judgment or decree under which the trust is to be administered in the manner of an express trust.section,subdivision b,provides in pertinent part trust excludes the following trusts for the primary purpose of paying debts,dividends,interest,salaries,wages,profits,pensions,or employee benefits of any kind.
because the retirement fund is a pension plan,the plain language of section b would appear to foreclose any attempt to subject it to the probate code.the trial court found this to be the case and duly dismissed meyers petition.
as he did below,meyers asserts that,notwithstanding the express language of section,the trust law is applicable to public pensions by operation of the california constitution specifically section and section c.we examine each of these provisions in turn.
section grants retirement boards of public pension systems sole and exclusive fiduciary responsibility over the assets of the public pension or retirement system and sole and exclusive responsibility to administer the system in a manner that will assure prompt delivery of benefits and related services to the participants and their beneficiaries.cal,art.xvi,subd.a.it further provides that t he assets of a public pension or retirement system are trust funds and shall be held for the exclusive purposes of providing benefits to participants in the pension or retirement system and their beneficiaries and defraying reasonable expenses of administering the system.ibid.
section also directs how a retirement board should employ its plenary authority.for example,a retirement board must exercise its duties in the interest of participants and beneficiaries,minimizing employer contributions,and defraying reasonable expenses of administering the system.cal,art.xvi,subd.b.additionally,a retirement board must diversify the investments of the system so as to minimize the risk of loss and maximize the rate of return,art.xvi,subd
