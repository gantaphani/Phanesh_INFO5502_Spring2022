this diversity action arises from a dispute over the trust funds for several cemeteries located in the midwest.the district court dismissed the case on burford abstention grounds.because burford does not provide a basis for surrendering,as opposed to potentially suspending,the jurisdiction congress has given the federal courts in this instance,we reverse.
for many years,the meyer family of indiana owned several cemeteries and funeral homes.when the family decided to leave the business in,it sold its holdings to ansure mortuaries of indiana for.in acquiring the businesses,ansure became responsible for over in trust funds used for the perpetual care of the meyer cemeteries.under indiana law,cemetery owners must create an irrevocable perpetual care fund,the principal of which must permanently remain intact and the income from which must be devoted to the perpetual care of the cemetery.michigan imposes similar requirements.see.comp.laws.
to make the down payment required under the sale agreement,robert nelms,the owner of ansure,secured a loan through craig bush,who as it happens was also in the cemetery business.shortly before he loaned the money to nelms,bush sold cemeteries in michigan to indian nation.bush sent nelms from a personal bank account with smith barney,and nelms used the funds to close the sale in december.nelms transferred the meyer cemeteries trust funds to community trust and investment,and on the same day he directed community trust to transfer of the funds to bush in repayment for the loan and to his own account.
to say that these transactions did not go unchallenged is an understatement.in december,the michigan cemetery commissioner,andrew metcalf,filed a lawsuit in the ingham county circuit court challenging the sale of the bush cemeteries to indian nation.see metcalf albion memory gardens.cir,ingham cnty.the court appointed mark zausmer,a michigan attorney,as conservator over the cemeteries and enjoined any transfer of the cemeteries assets.the conservator sued bush on behalf of the cemeteries,alleging that bush converted nearly from the trust funds through his smith barney account.see zausmer bush.cir,ingham cnty.in august,the court ordered bush to transfer the in his smith barney account to an account with charles schwab in which the funds would be invested pursuant to joint instruction by the conservator and bush.
in december,commissioner metcalf sued nelms and asked the state court to appoint zausmer as conservator for chapel hill memorial gardens,one of the meyer cemeteries located in michigan.see metcalf chapel hill mem l gardens.cir,ingham cnty.once appointed,zausmer sued nelms on behalf of the chapel hill cemetery.see zausmer nelms.cir,ingham cnty.
in january,the state of indiana entered the fray,suing nelms in state court in indiana on behalf of the meyer family,claiming misappropriation of the trust funds and securities fraud under state law.see meyer ansure mortuaries of indiana,llc.cir,johnson cnty.the court appointed lynnette gray as receiver and directed her to t ake control of ansure and all of its subsidiaries.in view of the michigan court appointment of zausmer as conservator over the chapel hill cemetery,the indiana court disclaimed any intent to rule on control of chapel hill memorial gardens in kent county,michigan,as between the receiver and the michigan conservator.id.but it directed gray to communicate and coordinate with the michigan conservator to determine whether and to what extent any conflicts exist regarding their respective authorities and operations and the most appropriate manner in which to exercise control over the affairs of chapel hill memorial gardens.id.
in february,shortly after the indiana court appointed gray as receiver for ansure,the michigan court approved a plan in which zausmer would sell the bush cemeteries to midwest memorial group,a corporation.the court order authorized the transfer of the real estate,the funds held by the trusts,and the existing,pending,and future rights,claims,causes of action and defenses against all third parties related to the purchased assets including without limitation against all former owners of the cemeteries and their respective agents,advisors and representatives.at.consistent with the indiana court charge,gray met twice with zausmer and a representative of midwest memorial.she explained that she had tracked the payment of from the meyer cemeteries trust funds to bush smith barney account and told them she intended to recover the money on behalf of ansure and the meyer cemeteries.zausmer and midwest memorial expressed concerns that any claim gray brought against bush assets might affect their sale agreement.
ten days after the second meeting,the michigan court issued an order approving the sale between zausmer and midwest memorial.because the agreement assigned the bush cemeteries claims against bush to midwest memorial,the company took the helm in the michigan court litigation.the next month,midwest memorial filed an emergency petition for approval of settlement and an emergency motion regarding confidentiality of settlement.the court granted an immediate hearing and approved the confidential settlement four hours after the filing.the court order directed charles schwab,which held the assets from bush smith barney account,to disburse all the funds in accordance with letters of authority signed by the parties.at.other terms of the settlement have not been made public.
two days after the michigan court approved the settlement and the disbursement,gray filed this diversity action in the western district of michigan against bush,zausmer and midwest memorial.gray raised several claims against bush,including conversion of funds from the meyer cemeteries trusts,fraud and conspiracy.she also raised several claims against zausmer and midwest memorial based on their handling of the funds in bush account.gray initially sought a temporary restraining order and a preliminary injunction to prevent the defendants from removing,using,disposing of or transferring any funds or assets received from the charles schwab account and to require them to account for all of the charles schwab account funds in their respective possession,custody,control,at,but the district court denied the motion.
midwest memorial moved to dismiss the complaint based on burford abstention.see burford sun oil.bush moved for judgment on the pleadings and summary judgment,arguing that gray claims are and that at any rate he was a good faith purchaser for value.on august,the district court dismissed gray complaint under burford,holding that to exercise jurisdiction over this matter would unduly interfere with the independence of the concurrent state actions.at.gray appealed.
in view of the history of this litigation,now up to five state court cases and counting,one can hardly blame the district court for hesitating to allow another court from another sovereign to enter the fray.but it is not that easy.
