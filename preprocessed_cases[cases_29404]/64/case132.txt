petitions,judgment on the pleadings motion and defendant responses thereto

on january,plaintiff moved for judgment on the pleadings.the judgment on the pleadings motion was premised on all papers that had been filed.the judgment on the judgment on the pleadings motion synopsis states defendant claims a interest in real property belonging to dayan that she bequeathed in her w ill to a testamentary trust.defendant claims that dayan can not transfer this interest into the testamentary trust because of defendant purported interest in the property.the w ill contains a no contest clause that provides that if anyone asserts a property interest in any asset in contravention of the w ill,that person forfeits his interest in the w ill as though he predeceased dayan without issue.there is no provision in the no contest clause that limits the claim that constitutes the contest to any invalid claim or any claim not brought in good faith.after being warned on numerous occasions of the consequences of pursuing this claim,defendant filed an objection to the section petition to confirm dayan interest in the asset.according to the petition,defendant did not have an equitable interest in the property.the judgment on the pleadings motion asserts,all that matters is that a party seeks to invalidate a transfer based on their claim that they have a property interest in the subject property.thus,here,the law and facts compel the forfeiture of defendant interest in the estate of dayan.
trial and final order 
trial testimony 
trial regarding the section,subdivision a petition was held on august.daniel cheren,an estate planning attorney,testified on plaintiff behalf.cheren testified as to dayan capacity she was always,was even to the last time that i met her,a very intelligent woman,very gifted woman,a woman that was very sure of her own mind,sure of her own desires,understood what her property was.cheren prepared the quitclaim deed which transferred dayan interest in the property as trustee of the nathanson trust to her as an individual.cheren was unaware that defendant had a interest in the property.cheren also prepared the will.cheren testified dayan believed she had full interest in the property.cheren also testified,she was very clear as to what she wanted to do,who was in her will,who was out of her will.cheren never looked for any deeds or the chain of title concerning the property when preparing the will.
defendant testified he never paid or received any money for his interest in the property.defendant testified dayan did not want plaintiff to own property.defendant testified dayan never requested he give up his interest in the property.plaintiff testified he owns a boat repair shop located on the property.his parents helped finance his business and other costs,including the rent,mortgage,utilities and repairs.plaintiff,in exchange,gave his income to his parents.in plaintiff view,dayan had a very controlling personality.
tentative and final statements of decision 
on september,the probate court issued its tentative statement of decision.the probate court found cheren testimony that dayan possessed full title to the property was unpersuasive.the probate court found it was not plausible that dayan would not have remembered defendant owned a interest in the property.cheren admitted he did no research to determine ownership of the property.defendant interest was easily discoverable by a simple property search.during dayan lifetime,both plaintiff and marantz relinquished title to the property.however,dayan never made any request to defendant to do the same.the probate court found if dayan wished to have the entire property transferred for the benefit of plaintiff,she would have taken efforts to quiet title against defendant,or make a demand that defendant relinquish his one third ownership interest in the property.since dayan did not initiate a quiet title or demand defendant relinquish ownership,the court finds that it was dayan intent in signing the will for defendant to retain his ownership and the trust prepared for the benefit of plaintiff to receive the remaining ownership.
at the same time,the probate court also denied plaintiff judgment on the pleadings motion.the probate court ruled it could not determine,based on the face of the pleadings,whether defendant actions violated the no contest clause.the probate court ruled,from the face of the papers,the court can not determine if the no contest clause is enforceable or if defendant actions triggered the provisions of the no contest clause.the probate court ruled additional facts were potentially necessary in order to judiciously rule on the no contest issue after a trial or summary judgment motion.the probate court ordered a further hearing regarding plaintiff petition to enforce the no contest clause.on october,the probate court issued its final statement of decision and formally denied the section,subdivision a petition and the judgment on the pleadings motion.this appeal followed.
iii.discussion 
a.the probate court did not err by denying plaintiff section,subdivision a petition 
generally,we interpret written instruments de novo.parsons bristol development cal d,estate of powell th,ike doolittle th.we review the probate court resolution of disputed facts for substantial evidence.de anza enterprises johnson th,winograd american broadcasting th.substantial evidence supports the probate court findings.
the will provided that all title,rights and interests in the property would go to plaintiff trust.dayan intent was also described in the will,it is my intention by this will to dispose of all of the property of my probate estate.thus,a fair reading of dayan will is she did not intend to convey property not a part of her probate estate.the will is silent as to whether dayan had full title of the property.the probate court correctly examined evidence outside of the will to resolve this issue.
the probate court found dayan intended to convey a interest in the property to defendant.it is uncontradicted the august,quitclaim deed transferred title to dayan,marantz and defendant as joint tenants doing business as dayan and dayan enterprises.and the february,quitclaim deed transferred title in the property to defendant or dayan as trustees under a january agreement.then the september,quitclaim deed corrected the february,quitclaim deed.the september,quitclaim deed transferred title as follows an undivided interest was conveyed to defendant and dayan as trustees of the nathanson trust marantz received an undivided interest and defendant received an undivided interest.the quitclaim deeds relinquished whatever rights dayan may have had in the property at the time of the september,transfer.city of manhattan beach superior court cal th,in re marriage of gioia th.a quitclaim deed operates as a release of a grantor interest in the property.buller buller d,westlake silva d.and,as can be noted,on september,dayan only conveyed a interest in the property entirely to defendant.in our case,no subsequently executed quitclaim deed could override or affect the september,quitclaim deed which conveyed the interest to defendant.werner graham cal,rosenthal landau d.the legal effect of the september,quitclaim deed is sufficient to convey the interest in the property to defendant.moreover,the language appearing in the september,quitclaim deed demonstrates an intention to convey a interest to defendant.
and,the probate court noted cheren described dayan as a very intelligent woman with a very smart mind.cheren testified that dayan knew exactly what her property was and who she wanted in and out of the will.dayan executed wills within months,from october to november,the date the will currently under consideration was executed.as evidenced by the quitclaim and grant deeds,dayan had plaintiff and marantz return their interests in the property,but never did the same for defendant.there is no evidence that dayan ever sought to quiet title nor requested defendant relinquish his interest in the property.the probate court could reasonably find cheren testimony that dayan did not intend to give defendant interest was unpersuasive in light of other evidence.furthermore,the under oath inventory and appraisement,signed by plaintiff and defendant,states dayan estate held only a interest in the property.and as to the issue of intent,defendant testified dayan did want plaintiff to have an interest in the property.
plaintiff contends the probate court erred by not considering the no contest clause when interpreting the will to determine whether defendant had a interest in the property.to begin with,there is no evidence the trial court refused to give any consideration to the no contest clause in terms of dayan intent.the no contest clause does not prove dayan did not intend to have defendant own of the property separate from her probate estate.the no contest clause language does not identify the extent of dayan property interests when the will was executed nor those of defendant.accordingly,the probate court did not err in denying plaintiff section petition and finding that defendant owned a interest in the property.
b.the order denying the judgment on the pleadings motion 
introduction 
plaintiff argues the probate court should have granted his judgment on the pleadings motion.this contention raises two issues.the first issue is defendant argues the order denying plaintiff judgment on the pleadings motion,resolved contemporaneously with the section,subdivision a petition,is not appealable.the second issue is whether defendant violated the no contest clause when he filed an opposition to the section,subdivision a motion.we conclude the order denying the judgment on the pleadings motion may be considered in connection with the appeal from the section,subdivision a issue.in addition,we conclude that the trial court correct
