specifically,two physicians opined kevin was gravely disabled.darryl chagi,stated kevin presents symptoms of persecutory delusions,paranoia,poor insight,and low distress tolerance.kevin has a significant history of responding to belief system with physical aggression and dangerous behaviors.due to the fact that he does not believe he has a mental illness,it is unlikely he will remain med compliant without supervision.chagi opined kevin should be prohibited from possessing a firearm and from giving informed consent regarding his psychiatric treatment or medical treatment.further,he was not competent to enter a contract and should not be permitted to operate a motor vehicle as a result of his grave disability.john engers,also opined kevin should be prohibited from possessing a firearm and from giving informed consent regarding his psychiatric treatment or medical treatment,he was not competent to enter a contract,and should not be permitted to operate a motor vehicle as a result of his grave disability.engers stated kevin presents very poor insight and decision making about mental illness.due to poor insight,it has caused him to participate in aggressive behaviors towards others.he is unable to participate in a meaningful conversation about means for providing food,clothing and shelter at this time.

discussion 
waiver of jury trial 
kevin argues the trial court erred in accepting a waiver of jury trial over his objection.kevin maintains the law supports the proposition that the attorney may waive rights only if the attorney asserts that he or she is conveying the specific request of the client to waive the right.on the other hand,the public conservator contends california law permits an attorney to waive a client statutory right to jury trial over the client objection.moreover,the public conservator argues that even if personal waiver is required by the conservatee,kevin forfeited his right to jury trial by failing to make a timely demand.
