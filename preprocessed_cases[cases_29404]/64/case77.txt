dolores may smith,a citizen of minnesota,died after doctors who worked for the defendant allegedly failed to properly diagnose her illness.smith daughter,julie steinlage,brought this wrongful death action as a wrongful death trustee under.ann.steinlage is a citizen of nevada.during trial,the defendant moved to dismiss for lack of jurisdiction,arguing that c required the court to impute the decedent minnesota citizenship to steinlage for diversity purposes.the district court found that c applied and dismissed the case.steinlage appeals,and we reverse.a minnesota wrongful death trustee is a representative of a decedent surviving spouse,next of kin,and certain enumerated creditors,but not a representative of a decedent estate as required by the plain language of c.accordingly,a minnesota wrongful death trustee own state of citizenship controls for purposes of diversity jurisdiction.
the facts relevant to this appeal are undisputed.if c applies,complete diversity is destroyed and the federal courts lack jurisdiction.if c does not apply,steinlage,as a nevada citizen,may maintain this diversity action against the minnesota defendant.this case presents two questions of law first,does a minnesota wrongful death trustee represent the estate of a decedent second,if a minnesota wrongful death trustee does not technically represent the estate of a decedent,does c nevertheless apply we address these issues in turn.
a.the minnesota statute 
minnesota wrongful death statute provides for the appointment of a wrongful death trustee to sue for the recovery of pecuniary loss suffered by a decedent surviving spouse and next of kin as well as for recovery on behalf of a few specifically enumerated creditors.ann.the statute specifically provides 
subdivision.death action.when death is caused by the wrongful act or omission of any person or corporation,the trustee appointed as provided in subdivision may maintain an action therefor if the decedent might have maintained an action,had the decedent lived,for an injury caused by the wrongful act or omission the recovery in the action is the amount the jury deems fair and just in reference to the pecuniary loss resulting from the death,and shall be for the exclusive benefit of the surviving spouse and next of kin,proportionate to the pecuniary loss severally suffered by the death.the court then determines the proportionate pecuniary loss of the persons entitled to the recovery and orders distribution accordingly.funeral expenses and any demand for the support of the decedent allowed by the court having jurisdiction of the action,are first deducted and paid.punitive damages may be awarded as provided in section.
if an action for the injury was commenced by the decedent and not finally determined while living,it may be continued by the trustee for recovery of damages for the exclusive benefit of the surviving spouse and next of kin,proportionate to the pecuniary loss severally suffered by the death.the court on motion shall make an order allowing the continuance and directing pleadings to be made and issues framed as in actions begun under this section.
subd.when injury is caused to a person by the wrongful act or omission of any person or corporation and the person thereafter dies from a cause unrelated to those injuries,the trustee appointed in subdivision may maintain an action for special damages arising out of such injury if the decedent might have maintained an action therefor had the decedent lived.
subd.trustee for action.upon written petition by the surviving spouse or one of the next of kin,the court having jurisdiction of an action falling within the provisions of subdivisions or,shall appoint a suitable and competent person as trustee to commence or continue such action and obtain recovery of damages therein.the trustee,before commencing duties shall file a consent and oath.before receiving any money,the trustee shall file a bond as security therefor in such form and with such sureties as the court may require.
id.emphasis added.
a companion provision to minnesota wrongful death statute is.ann.regarding the survival of causes of action.section specifically provides 
a cause of action arising out of an injury to the person dies with the person of the party in whose favor it exists,except as provided in section.all other causes of action by one against another,whether arising on contract or not,survive to the personal representatives of the former and against those of the latter.
read together,these two provisions demonstrate that,upon death,the right to maintain existing actions based on personal injury to the decedent,as well as the right to institute new actions based on personal injury,belong to the wrongful death trustee.any recovery in either type of action under section inures exclusively to the benefit of the surviving spouse and next of kin except for the payment of funeral expenses and claims related to the support of the decedent.the wrongful death trustee is not authorized to obtain a judgment for the benefit of general creditors who may have claims against the decedent estate 
by contrast,if an injured party survives,litigates a personal injury action to completion,and recovers a judgment,anything recovered is subject to the claims of general creditors because the judgment is in favor of the injured party.even where an aggrieved party dies,causes of action other than personal injury actions may be maintained by the personal representatives of the decedent.ann.in minnesota,a statutory wrongful death trustee is not a personal representative of the decedent,shumway,at,and has no authority to maintain the type of actions described in section that might result in judgments available to satisfy the claims of general creditors.
sections and,therefore,operate together to draw a clear distinction between the personal representatives of the decedent administrator,executor,and the wrongful death trustee as the personal representative of the decedent surviving spouse and next of kin.the decedent estate and general creditors who hold claims against a decedent estate can not collect against judgments obtained by the wrongful death trustee because the wrongful death trustee is expressly authorized only to obtain judgments on behalf of persons who are separate from the estate of the decedent.see martz revier,recovery for wrongful death is not a part of the decedent estate.
prior to a amendment,minnesota wrongful death statute actually did permit the personal representative of the decedent to bring a wrongful death action.see.ann.even then,however,the recovery in such an action was not in any manner obtained for the benefit of the estate.rather,it was obtained exclusively for the benefit of the surviving spouse and next of kin as the enumerated beneficiaries under the version of the wrongful death statute.id.in other words,under that prior statute the personal representative of a decedent was empowered to serve a dual role.
even before that time,the minnesota supreme court had clarified that any recovery in a wrongful death action was separate and distinct from the general estate 
the damages do not go to the estate of the decedent for distribution under the laws of descent.this money is not liable for debts of the decedent,but belongs exclusively to those named in the statute.the probate court has no jurisdiction over this money.it must be handled under the jurisdiction of the district court.the widow can not select her worth of personal property,under the statute of descent,from this money.this money never belonged to the decedent.the statute,however,regulates the proportion in which damages recovered shall be distributed.this language is clear.
masek hedlund,internal citation omitted.accordingly,under prior law,when a personal representative of the decedent could bring a minnesota wrongful death action,the personal representative did not do so as a representative of the decedent estate,but rather,as a representative of the wrongful death beneficiaries.further,under current minnesota law,only a wrongful death trustee may maintain a wrongful death action,and the wrongful death trustee does not represent the e
