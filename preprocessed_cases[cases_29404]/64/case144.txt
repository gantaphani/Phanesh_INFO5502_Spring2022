background 
on march,petitioners filed a petition against their stepfather,frank staggers,to recover property belonging to their mother estate.the prayer of the petition requested among other things t hat the court determine whether frank staggers acted wrongfully in bad faith concealing assets of the estate from petitioners as,and if so,compelling frank staggers to pay a penalty of twice the value of the assets recovered.the basis of the claim for twice the value of the property was probate code section which provides in pertinent part as follows if a court finds that a person has in bad faith wrongfully taken,concealed,or disposed of property belonging to an elder,or the estate of a decedent,or has taken,concealed,or disposed of the property by the use of undue influence in bad faith or through the commission of elder or dependent adult financial abuse,as defined in section of the welfare and institutions code,the person shall be liable for twice the value of the property recovered by an action under this part.in addition,the person may,in the court discretion,be liable for reasonable attorney fees and costs.the remedies provided in this section shall be in addition to any other remedies available in law to a person authorized to bring an action pursuant to this part.
frank staggers died during the proceeding,and his son,frank staggers,real party,was substituted in as the respondent in the probate proceeding.
on april,real party filed a motion for summary adjudication that the claim for double damages had no merit because those damages can not be recovered against him as the successor to his father.the basis of the motion was code of civil procedure section,which states in its entirety as follows in an action or proceeding against a decedent personal representative or,to the extent provided by statute,against the decedent successor in interest,on a cause of action against the decedent,all damages are recoverable that might have been recovered against the decedent had the decedent lived except damages recoverable under section of the civil code or other punitive or exemplary damages.the memorandum of points and authorities supporting the motion cited one case estate of young th young.
petitioners filed their memorandum in opposition,which also relied on one case jahns nolting cal.jahns.
real party filed his reply,and the matter came on for argument on july,prior to which the court had issued a tentative ruling favorable to real party.after conclusion of argument,the trial court confirmed the tentative ruling and entered a minute order granting the motion.the sole substantive paragraph of the order read as follows double damages provided in probate code section are punitive in nature.estate of young th.the court finds that the attorney fees provision in probate code section is also punitive in nature as it is intended to be awarded in addition to the double damages after a finding of bad faith.the court does not find jhans sic nolting cal.controlling as the analysis is based on a predecessor statute.italics added.
petitioners sought a writ in this court,arguing essentially that jahns is controlling authority and that the superior court erred in following what was mere dictum in young.on september,we issued an alternative writ,stating that respondent superior court erred when it held that probate code section is a statute,and commanded the superior court to set aside and vacate its order of july,and to enter a new and different order denying real party motion for summary adjudication or,in the alternative,to appear and show cause before division two 
on october,the superior court advised that it would take no action in response to the alternative writ,and would let real party file a return.on october,real party filed a return to the petition for peremptory writ.on november,petitioners filed a reply and opposition to the return.
discussion 
as quoted,code of civil procedure section allows one to recover against a decedent successor in interest all damages that might have been recovered against the decedent except damages recoverable under section of the civil code or other punitive or exemplary damages.
the question here is whether double damages provided for under section are within that exception.we conclude they are not.
civil code section,subdivision a provides in pertinent part as follows in an action for the breach of an obligation not arising from contract,where it is proven by clear and convincing evidence that the defendant has been guilty of oppression,fraud,or malice,the plaintiff,in addition to the actual damages,may recover damages for the sake of example and by way of punishing the defendant.this is the statute that allows recovery of punitive,sometimes referred to as exemplary,damages.the purpose of punitive damages is to punish defendant and to deter future misconduct by making an example of him or her.ppg industries,transamerica ins.cal th.the purpose is a purely public one.the public goal is to punish wrongdoing and thereby to protect itself from future misconduct,either by the same defendant or other potential wrongdoers.adams murakami cal d.
witkin has an exhaustive discussion of p unitive or e xemplary d amages.see witkin,summary of cal.law ed.torts,pp.in the course of that discussion,the author makes several observations pertinent here,which begin in a section entitled statutory penalties distinguished.italics added.the discussion first observes that s ometimes a statute imposes a penalty in an arbitrary sum irrespective of actual damage suffered.the next section says that a nother type of statue allows treble damages,on proof of actual damage,an award of three times the amount may be given,pp.and then comes section.it is entitled recovery of both penalty and punitive damages,and it says this dual remedies permitted.the fact that a statutory penalty or even criminal liability is imposed for a particular wrongful act does not preclude recovery of punitive damages in a tort action where the necessary malice or oppression is shown,and it is possible that the defendant may be punished criminally and forced to respond in punitive damages for the same act.citations,pp.
many cases illustrate the point,including greenberg western turf cal,where the supreme court authorized both punitive damages under civil code section and a statutory penalty,both in addition to actual damages.th
