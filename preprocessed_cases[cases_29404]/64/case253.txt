in this case we must decide whether a widow has the right to use her late husband frozen sperm to attempt to conceive a child where her late husband signed an agreement with the company storing the frozen sperm providing that the frozen sperm was to be discarded upon his death.we conclude that in determining the disposition of gamete material,to which no other party has contributed and thus another party right to procreational autonomy is not implicated,the intent of the donor must control.in this judgment roll appeal,the widow can not challenge the probate court finding that the decedent intent was to have his frozen sperm discarded upon his death.accordingly,we affirm the decision denying distribution of the frozen sperm to the widow.
factual and procedural background 
joseph and iris kievernagel were married for years prior to joseph death.they contracted with the northern california fertility medical center,to perform in vitro fertilization ivf to allow iris to conceive.the fertility center operated a sperm cryopreservation storage program under which sperm was collected and stored at temperatures as low as degrees centigrade.the frozen sperm could then be thawed and used for insemination.the center required joseph to store a sperm sample under this program in case his live sperm could not used on the day of insemination.
as part of the sperm cryopreservation storage program,the center required an ivf sperm storage and consent agreement the agreement.iris completed the agreement and joseph signed it.the agreement provided that the sperm sample was joseph sole and separate property and he retained all authority to control its disposition.the agreement provided for two options for the disposition of the sperm sample upon death or incapacitation donate the sperm to his wife or discard the sperm sample.the box indicating the sperm sample was to be discarded was checked and joseph initialed it.the agreement also provided the sperm sample was to be discarded upon divorce.iris signed,acknowledging the sperm sample was joseph sole and separate property.
joseph died in a helicopter crash in july.
iris was appointed administrator of joseph estate.she petitioned under probate code section for a preliminary distribution of an asset of no financial value but of immense sentimental value to the widow.the item she sought was a vial of joseph frozen sperm.the fertility center would not release it without a court order.
joseph parents,as interested parties,objected to the preliminary distribution.they contended it was contrary to joseph express wishes,as set forth in the agreement,that upon his death,his sperm sample was to be discarded.the agreement comported with their understanding that their son did not wish to father a child posthumously.
after an evidentiary hearing,the probate court issued a tentative decision.the court found the following undisputed evidence.joseph and iris loved each other deeply and completely.joseph was opposed to having children,but agreed to the fertility procedures due to iris strong desire for children.the couple dispute over having children led them to marriage counseling.according to the marriage counselor,joseph believed iris would divorce him if he did not agree to have children and a divorce would devastate him.the agreement provided the sperm sample was to be discarded upon joseph death.this option was selected instead of the option to donate the sperm sample to iris.iris completed the agreement,making the selections.joseph signed it.
the probate court found the key issue was the intent of the decedent regarding use of his sperm.the court analysis was based on hecht superior court th,d hecht,a case involving a dispute over disposition of frozen sperm,and davis davis davis,involving a dispute over disposition of frozen preembryos.the court found the agreement evidenced the intent of both iris and joseph that the sperm be discarded upon his death.there was no evidence they ever discussed changing the provisions of the agreement.
iris objected to the tentative decision.she questioned the court analysis of intent.she argued her testimony that joseph did not even read the agreement was admissible evidence with probative value.finally,she asserted joseph intent was that she have his child.
the court denied the request for clarification of its analysis.it found iris failed to prove the agreement did not express joseph intent.by a preponderance of the evidence,the court found joseph intent was to stop the fertility process upon his death by discarding his frozen sperm.
the petition for distribution of the sperm sample was denied.
discussion 
in making its decision,the court below found little to no guiding precedent,but found some guidance in the hecht,supra,th,d,and davis,supra,cases.iris contends the court erred in applying hecht,argue that and its requirement of an unequivocable intent provides an unworkable standard.iris further contends the surviving spouse has a right to procreate that should be considered and the balancing test set forth in davis should be applied.in applying the balancing test,the surviving spouse interest prevails.
we begin our analysis by discussing the hecht and davis cases.we then conclude the probate court properly determined that the disposition of the frozen sperm is governed by the intent of the deceased donor and that the davis balancing test is inappropriate in these circumstances.
in hecht,supra,th,d,william kane deposited vials of his sperm in an account at a sperm bank and then took his own life.the storage agreement provided that upon kane death,the sperm bank was to continue to store the specimens upon request of the executor of kane estate or to release the specimens to the executor.kane will named his girlfriend,deborah hecht,as executor.the will also bequeathed the sperm specimens stored at the sperm bank to hecht for her to become impregnated,if she wished.id.at,d.kane wrote a letter to his children about family memories and why he was committing suicide.it was addressed to his two children from a previous marriage,but included the possibility that he could have posthumous children by hecht.id.at,d.
kane will was admitted into probate and a special administrator appointed.kane children contested the will.hecht,supra,th at,d.the parties attempted to settle the dispute,entering into two settlement agreements.the first was a tentative agreement that did not specifically mention the sperm.ibid.the second agreement sought to assign the estate interest in the sperm to hecht.id.at,d.in proceedings to settle the estate,the administrator,at the request of the children,petitioned for instructions to order the sperm destroyed on public policy grounds,or for an order of a preliminary distribution of either or percent of the sperm to the children on alternate theories of entitlement.id.at,d.the probate court ordered the sperm destroyed and hecht petitioned the appellate court for a writ of mandate or prohibition to vacate the order.id.at,d.
the appellate court first determined that the frozen sperm fell within the broad definition of property in probate code section,so the probate court had jurisdiction over it.hecht,supra,th at,d.the court began with the acknowledgment that the law on property rights in the human body was unsettled.id.at,d.it looked to ethical standards in the ivf field.the american fertility society took the position that gametes and concepti are the property of the donors and donors had the right to decide their disposition.id.at,d.the court also found the davis,supra,case informative.relying on davis,the court concluded the decedent interest in the frozen sperm vials occupies an interim category that entitles them to special respect because of their potential for human life.hecht,supra,at,d.at the time of his death,kane had an interest,in the nature of ownership,to the extent that he had decisionmaking authority as to the use of his sperm for reproduction.id.at,d.
the hecht court then turned to whether the probate court order to destroy the sperm could be upheld.it found the decision could not be upheld on the basis of the will or the parties settlement agreement becau
