background 
on september,plaintiff,who was then years old,suffered a stroke.after a week hospitalization,she was transferred to monterey pines skilled nursing facility monterey pines,where she remained for days until her discharge on october.plaintiff complaint describes the following events on september,about halfway through her stay at the facility,plaintiff told her daughter,bobbi,that she needed to leave immediately.though the stroke had impaired her ability to communicate,plaintiff managed to explain that she had woken up in bed the previous night with her catheter removed and laying sic out next to her on her bed,causing the entire bed and her body to be wet.she heard male voices next to her bed and seeing sic the curtains around her bed moving.she also heard someone fiddling with the nurse call button next to her bed.plaintiff later told the police that when she woke up her gown was off,and an unknown male assistant was looking at her naked in bed.the assistant said to her,this is why i love my job.
bobbi discovered that the call button had been unplugged,making plaintiff attempts to call a nurse fruitless.at about the same time,plaintiff developed unexplained deep bruising on her inner thigh and pelvis region and began complaining of severe pain to her pelvis and upper thighs for the first time.
bobbi arranged for plaintiff removal from the facility,and the family brought her home.plaintiff continued to have difficulty speaking and was not independently mobile,but o nce she was able to be moved more frequently and more easily and to speak clearer sic,she started complaining of extreme pain in her lower region,particularly her vaginal area,buttocks area,and her inner thighs.it turned out that plaintiff had contracted genital herpes.robert,her husband of nearly years,had been her only sexual partner,and he tested negative for the virus.
plaintiff brought this action on february,naming monterey pines its owners,horizon west,and horizon west headquarters,collectively,horizon west and a group of entities the plum defendants that had bought monterey pines in june and renamed the facility cypress ridge care center.plaintiff asserted four causes of action elder abuse and neglect,negligence in the care of plaintiff,violation of plaintiff rights under the patients bill of rights of,tit,and successor liability against the plum defendants.
all of the first three causes of action were founded on the allegation that the staff at monterey pines had failed to provide a safe environment and protect her from sexual assault.she asserted that male residents were allowed to enter female residents rooms,and call lights were either nonfunctioning or purposely disconnected by the staff.plaintiff further described a longstanding pattern of reckless neglect of the facility residents that had resulted in numerous citations and deficiencies relating to the physical abuse of residents and other incidents of substandard care.plaintiff also pointed to the failure of either horizon west or the plum defendants to investigate plaintiff allegation of rape,which meant that other residents were at risk of being sexually assaulted and infected with an incurable sexually transmitted disease.
on april,plaintiff,by then years old,moved for preference under code of civil procedure section,subdivision a both the horizon and plum defendants opposed the motion,arguing that there was no evidence or even allegation of a medical condition requiring trial preference the case was not yet at issue plaintiff had not submitted a declaration attesting to proper service on all parties and there was no competent evidence that plaintiff was over years of age.
horizon and monterey pines,joined by the plum defendants,then moved to stay the action and compel arbitration,citing code of civil procedure sections,and.the motion was based on an agreement bobbi had signed when plaintiff was admitted to monterey pines.plaintiff opposed the motion,primarily on the grounds that bobbi had no authority to bind her mother to arbitration in signing the admission papers and even if she did have such authority,the arbitration agreement was procedurally and substantively unconscionable.
after extensive briefing and oral argument,the trial court denied defendants motion to compel arbitration and granted plaintiff motion for preferential trial setting.only horizon and monterey pines hereinafter appellants filed a notice of appeal,limited to the order denying defendants motion.
discussion 
the central issue before us is whether there existed a valid agreement entitling appellants to nonjudicial arbitration of plaintiff claims.in denying defendants motion the trial court reasoned that compelling arbitration would be inconsistent with the legislature intent that litigants in plaintiff circumstances receive trial preference bobbi lacked authority,either actual or ostensible,to bind her mother to arbitration when she signed the admission papers containing the agreement and the circumstances surrounding execution of the arbitration agreement were troubling.
appellants argue that the court erred to the extent that it relied on the possibility of inconsistent decisions they also take issue with the court consideration of trial preference in its ruling.neither of these points warrants this court review.the court clearly discounted the significance of any inconsistency between trial on the nonarbitrable claim the third cause of action for violating the patients bill of rights and arbitration,as the result was dictated by the absence of bobbi authority to sign the agreement.the court belief that granting defendants motion would be inconsistent with plaintiff entitlement to a grant of trial preference under section is also of no value to this court,as we review the court ruling,not its rationale.davey southern pac.cal,a ruling or decision,itself correct in law,will not be disturbed on appeal merely because given for a wrong reason.
we therefore turn to the principal question of whether plaintiff was bound by the agreement her daughter signed on her behalf specifically,whether bobbi had the authority to represent plaintiff in agreeing to arbitration.this issue presents both factual questions,did plaintiff specifically authorize bobbi to sign the agreement for her and legal issues,did plaintiff advanced health care directive confer such authority on her daughter.only if bobbi did have that authority do we consider the next question,whether the agreement itself was unconscionable.
our review is governed by settled principles.to the extent that the lower court order is based on a finding of material fact,we adopt a substantial evidence standard.robertson health net of california,th,d.on the other hand,questions of law,including the legal effect of the undisputed contract language,is reviewed de novo.buckner tamarin th,d baker osborne development th,d.
the party seeking to compel arbitration bears the burden of proving the existence of a valid arbitration agreement.flores evergreen at san diego,llc th,d flores,citing engalla permanente medical group,cal th,d.although california has a strong policy favoring arbitration citations,our courts also recognize that the right to pursue claims in a judicial forum is a substantial right and one not lightly to be deemed waived.citations.because the parties to an arbitration clause surrender this substantial right,the general policy favoring arbitration can not replace an agreement to arbitrate.marsch williams th,d.courts therefore recognize that the right to arbitration depends on a contract.even the strong public policy in favor of arbitration does not extend to those who are not parties to an arbitration agreement or who have not authorized anyone to act for them in executing such an agreement.county of contra costa kaiser foundation health plan,th,d benasra marciano th,d.nevertheless,a person who is authorized to act as the patient agent can bind the patient to an arbitration agreement.flores,supra,th at,d.
appellants first theory regarding bobbi authority to bind plaintiff to arbitration is that she was plaintiff agent,based on a power of attorney for health care poa,which was part of plaintiff advanced health care directive.the poa provided that when plaintiff primary physician determined that she was unable to make her own health care decisions,her agent was authorized to make specified health care decisions for her.appellants concede that plaintiff physician never made this determination,but they maintain that the evidence supplied in her deposition established her complete incapacity and need for bobbi intervention.as the trial court recognized,however,such evidence does not substitute for satisfaction of the condition stated in the terms of plaintiff advanced health care directive.
probate code section makes this clear unless otherwise provided in a power of attorney for health care,the authority of an agent becomes effective only on a determination that the principal lacks capacity,and ceases to be effective on a determination that the principal has recovered capacity.on the poa form,plaintiff elected not to check the box allowing her agent to make health care decisions for her without a prior determination of incapacity by her physician.this important fact distinguishes the case before us from garrison superior court th,d,on which appellants rely.in garrison,the durable power of attorney signed by the decedent was effective immediately when she signed it.here,plaintiff expressed her clear intention not to make the poa effective until her physician deemed her unable to make her own health care decisions.
similarly,appellants admit that bobbi was not plaintiff primary health care agent under the poa.plaintiff husband,robert,assumed that role bobbi was to be the first alternate agent only if robert was not willing,able,or reasonably available to make a health care decision for plaintiff.appellants argue that plaintiff and robert deposition testimony supported the conclusion that robert was in poor health and recovering from a stroke,and therefore not able or reasonable sic available to make health care decisions for plaintiff.appellants made this assertion to the trial court,which implicitly rejected their position on this factual issue and relied instead on the document clear prerequisite to her agent assumption of responsibility it was the province of the trial court as the trier of fact to weigh all the affidavits,declarations,and other documentary evidence,as well as oral testimony received at the court discretion,to reach a final determination.engalla permanente medical group,supra,cal th at,d.accordingly,our standard of review is the same as for a judgment following oral testimony we must accept the trial court resolution of disputed facts when supported by substantial evidence we must presume the court found every fact and drew every permissible inference necessary to support its judgment,and defer to its determination of credibility of the witnesses and the weight of the evidence.citation.engineers architects community development th,d.
finally and most importantly,the poa contains no terms authorizing the patient agent to make any decisions other than health care decisions for the patient.appellants strive to avoid the legal effect of this omission,again citing garrison superior court,supra,th,d.garrison,however,is distinguishable for this reason as well.there the durable power of attorney included the power to sign a ny necessary waiver or release from liability required by a hospital,or physician.id.at,d.the reviewing court did,however,express the view that the term health care decisions made by an agent encompasses the execution of arbitration agreements on behalf of the patient.so broad an interpretation of health care decisions seems unnecessary to the result in garrison,and to the extent that the court intended such a general application,we disagree with its conclusion.
appellants further argue that even if bobbi was not plaintiff agent under the poa,plaintiff nonetheless expressly authorized her to act in that capacity.the deposition evidence she supplies for this fact,however,was properly rejected by the trial court.according to appellants,plaintiff testified that she had expressly authorized her daughter to act and make decisions on her behalf.what plaintiff actually stated,however,was that her daughter knew from conversations what her wishes were,t o receive the care that was possible at the time.the context presented to plaintiff at this time was bobbi understanding of plaintiff wishes for medical treatment when plaintiff was hospitalized immediately after the stroke.no mention was made of authorization to sign any agreements other than for medical services,either at the hospital or later,at monterey pines.likewise immaterial is plaintiff statement regarding her daughter authority to complete paperwork on her behalf when she arrived at monterey pines.when asked whether bobbi had such authority,plaintiff said only,as far as i know,she had permission to take care of details like that.this testimony is a far cry from expressly authorizing her daughter to sign an agreement forgoing her right to a jury trial.the trial court thus did not err in ruling that there was no direct evidence of plaintiff acquiescence.
weakest of all is appellants assertion,repeated in their reply brief,that plaintiff husband confirmed that their daughter was authorized to act on their behalf.the testimony they offer is robert statement that bobbi was their legal guardian.this characterization was nothing more than a legal conclusion unsupported by any facts,and it was indeed contradicted by all of the other evidence,including the terms of plaintiff advanced health care directive.
appellants next contend that plaintiff is bound by equitable estoppel.of the nine decisions they cite addressing this doctrine,none involves facts comparable to the case before us.all apply the doctrine either to compel a signatory plaintiff to arbitrate with a nonsignatory defendant,boucher alliance title company,th,d metalclad ventana environmental organizational partnership th,d herbert superior court d,or to compel arbitration by the nonsignatory family members of a signatory patient,bolanos khalatian d.child and spouse mormile sinclair th,d spouse pietrelli peacock th,d unborn child.none held an injured patient to an arbitration agreement signed on her behalf by a family member on an equitable theory that the family member was the patient agent.
nor does one isolated sentence from crowley maritime boston old colony ins.th,d help appellants.the issue there was whether liability insurers who had settled an action could be compelled to arbitrate their equitable contribution claim against the nonsettling insurers.affirming the trial judge,the reviewing court held that they could not,because equitable contribution arises not from contract but from equity.id.at,d.the court next rejected the appellant insurers argument that the respondent insurers could be compelled to arbitrate under the plaintiff agreement with the appellant insurers.the appellants had confused the doctrine of equitable contribution with equitable subrogation.the former did not compel the respondent insurers to stand in the shoes of the plaintiff,who had signed the agreement with the appellant insurers.the multiple insurers involved had individually contracted with their insureds,not with one another.thus,the respondent insurers could not be compelled to arbitrate under an agreement to which they were not a party.equitable estoppel based on a preexisting relationship was not a viable alternative,because a such a relationship did not exist and b the respondent
