introduction 
petitioner and appellant stephen meyer appeals an order of the san francisco superior court denying his petition to declare that a petition for information he proposes to bring against his father,objector and respondent herbert meyer,as the sole surviving trustee of the edie westphal herold testamentary trust trust,would not amount to a will contest.
appellant contends that the trial court erred in determining that the trust specifically the third decree of distribution regarding the ranch property is subject to the no contest clause contained in the decedent will the petition for information would trigger the no contest clause and public policy does not render the no contest clause unenforceable under the circumstances.we agree with appellant that the trial court erred in concluding that the no contest clause of the will was incorporated by reference into the third decree of distribution.therefore,we shall reverse the order denying appellant safe harbor motion.
edie westphal herold died in february,and her will and codicil were admitted to probate on february,herold westphal,george meyer,and respondent herbert meyer were appointed executors of the will.the will consists of articles governing the administration of the probate estate and the distribution of its assets.article sixth of the will provides for distribution of the residue of the probate estate to herold westphal,george meyer,and herbert meyer,in trust,however,for the uses and purposes as follows there follows approximately eight pages specifying the terms of the testamentary trust in detail.article sixth does not contain or refer to a no contest clause.
the will contains a no contest clause in article ninth,that provides as follows ninth in the event that any one or more of the legatees,devisees,or beneficiaries named in this my last will and testament,or in any codicil which i may hereafter make,or any other person should object by any action or other proceeding to any of the provisions of this my last will and testament,or of any such codicil,or should attempt to defeat the same,or should file any contest of this will,or of any such codicil,or of any provision of this will,or of any such codicil,such legatee,devisee,beneficiary or other person shall receive the sum of five dollars each and no more,and any and all other provision or provisions made herein for such legatee,devisee,beneficiary,or other person shall be annulled and revoked and such legatee,devisee,beneficiary or other person shall take nothing from my estate other than said sum of five dollars each.
the trust was established under four decrees of distribution the first decree filed november,the second decree filed june,the third decree filed october,and the fourth or final decree filed june.the trust primary asset was the herold ranch,real property located in monterey county,california.each decree ordered that certain assets of decedent estate be distributed to the trustees of the trust,to be held in accordance with the terms of the trust as specified in the decrees.each decree specifies the same trust terms,and the terms of the trust are set forth in each of the decrees in terms identical to the provisions set forth in article sixth of the will,except as modified by the codicil to the will.it is undisputed that none of the decrees of distribution contains the no contest clause contained in the will or any other no contest clause.
the first decree of november,provides that the asset distributed thereunder a certificate of membership in and lease of a community apartment is subject to distribution as part of the rest,residue and remainder of said estate to herold westphal,george meyer and herbert meyer as trustees under and pursuant to the terms of the said last will and testament of said decedent italics added.similarly,the fourth or final decree of june,provides that the rest,residue and remainder of said estate is distributable to herold westphal,george meyer and herbert meyer in trust pursuant to the terms of the last will and testament of said decedent as set forth in the petition on file herein and as hereinafter stated 
the third decree of october,distributed the ranch to the trustees for the following uses and purposes,and also mirrors the structure and language of article sixth of the will,modifying the language to accommodate changes made by the codicil.in its provision distributing the ranch and its restatement of the trust provisions,the third decree does not refer to either the will or the codicil,although recitals regarding some of the various nontrust assets or payments refer to article seventh of the will,and distribution of some income is made pursuant to the terms of said last will and testament of decedent the distributive section of the third decree provides it is further ordered,adjudged and decreed that the residue of the estate be distributed to the trustees for the following uses and purposes,to wit,and is followed by four and pages setting forth the terms of the testamentary trust.thereafter,the distributive section states that the property distributed in trust as aforesaid is as follows,followed by a description of various probate assets being distributed to the trustees,including the ranch.
all of the decrees of distribution contain the trust provision,paragraph f,regarding the trustees duty to account to remainder beneficiaries as follows 
f said trustees shall not at any time be required to prepare,sign or deliver to the remaindermen hereinafter named,or any of them,or to their personal representatives,as required by the provisions of section of the probate code of the state of california,or any other provision of law,any inventory or inventories of any property which may come into their possession under the provisions of this article sixth,or to account to said remaindermen or any of them,or to their personal representatives,for proceeds of said ranch of any kind or nature whatsoever which may accrue to said trustees come into their possession,and said trustees shall not be liable to the remaindermen or any of them,or to their personal representatives,for damages or otherwise on account of any actual or alleged waste or injury to the inheritance committed or suffered by said trustees,or on account of the failure of said trustees properly to manage said ranch or to keep the buildings and fences on said ranch in repair,and no one or more of said remaindermen shall have the right to enjoin any waste or act of injury to her inheritance actually or allegedly threatened to be committed or suffered by said trustees,or to deprive said trustees of the right to use,possess,and enjoy said ranch or the rents,issues,profits,or proceeds therefrom for and during the entire period of this trust on account of any actual or alleged waste or act of injury to the inheritance,or to require said trustees to give security for the benefit of such remaindermen or any of them.the term waste as used in this f shall mean waste of every kind or nature,including ordinary waste,voluntary waste,permissive waste and equitable waste.
statement of the case 
respondent is the only survivor of the three initial trustees of the trust.he is now in his.the trust will terminate upon his death.until then,appellant asserts that respondent and one other beneficiary are entitled to the entire net income of the trust,but no principal.upon respondent death,the trust will be distributed to the remainder beneficiaries who survive him,including appellant,one of respondent adult children.
on january,appellant filed a safe harbor petition seeking a determination that his proposed petition for information would not be a will contest.he attached an unsigned copy of the proposed petition for information.he asserts therein that the three trustees filed reports and accounts with the court for the period of december,through december,but then stopped.appellant further asserts that,for more than a decade,respondent has refused to provide any financial information about the trust to appellant,but that the trustees had employed accountants to prepare periodic financial statements for the trust at least through.appellant alleges in the proposed petition for information that,without information,he can not determine whether respondent has performed his fiduciary duties regarding the interests of the remainder beneficiaries.
appellant proposed petition for information requests an order c ompelling herbert meyer,as trustee of the edie westphal herold testamentary trust,to allow stephen meyer,and his accountants,attorneys,and other representatives,to inspect and copy all periodic financial statements that have been prepared for the trust for any period from to the present,and to provide such other information as stephen meyer may request from time to time that is reasonably necessary to enable him to enforce his rights under the trust or to prevent or redress a breach of trust.
on december,following a hearing,the probate court issued an order denying the safe harbor petition.the court determined that the terms of the no contest clause of the will were incorporated into all of the decrees of distribution by reference.therefore,the clause of the will quoted above is incorporated into the terms of the trust and operates as a clause with respect to the trust.the court also found that the proposed petition for information required the trustee to account to petitioner for proceeds of the ranch,contrary to the express provisions of the trust set forth in paragraph f of the decrees of distribution.consequently,the petition for information would constitute a contest under the no contest clause of the will as incorporated into the trust.finally,the court found that g iven the very specific language of the trust quoted above in paragraph f,any public policy there may be or may have been when the will was executed in favor of requiring a trustee to provide information to a remainderman is outweighed by the public policy of enabling a testator and settler of a trust to describe the provisions for a specific asset.
a timely notice of appeal followed 
discussion 
standard of review 
the parties agree that the standard of review as to whether the proposed petition would amount to a contest within the meaning of the no contest clause is de novo hearst ganzi,supra,th at,d,as it is with respect to each of the issues of law raised on this appeal the construction of the will and the decrees estate of norris d,i t is settled law that the interpretation of a document,including a will or a decree,is a question of law,and that it is the duty of an appellate court in such cases to interpret the document independent of the construction given to it by the trier of the fact,and to make a final determination in accordance with the applicable principles of law the construction of the no contest clause burch george cal th,d,abrogation on a different point by later legislative enactment recognized by estate of rossi th,d and whether the no contest clause violates public policy tunstall wells th,d.
ii.general principles 
contests and no contest clauses 
the purpose of no contest clauses is to discourage will contests by imposing a penalty of forfeiture against beneficiaries who challenge the will.estate of black d.an in terrorem or no contest clause in a will or trust instrument creates a condition upon gifts and dispositions provided therein.citation.in essence,a no contest clause conditions a beneficiary right to take the share provided to that beneficiary under such an instrument upon the beneficiary agreement to acquiesce to the terms of the instrument.burch george,supra,cal th,d.although no contest clauses are valid and favored by the public policies of discouraging litigation and giving effect to the testator intent,they are also disfavored by the policy against forfeitures and therefore are strictly construed and may not extend beyond what plainly was the testator intent.citations.section provides in determining the intent of the transferor,a no contest clause shall be strictly construed.nevertheless,it is the testator intentions that control,and a court must not rewrite the testator will in such a way as to immunize legal proceedings plainly intended to frustrate the testator unequivocally expressed intent from the reach of the clause.citation.burch george,at,d.estate of kaila th,d accord,colburn northern trust,supra,th,d hearst ganzi,supra,th at,d.whether there has been a contest within the meaning of a particular clause depends upon the circumstances of the particular case and the language used.citation.citation.hearst ganzi,at,d.
section safe harbor 
section is a declaratory relief provision that states in pertinent part if an instrument containing a no contest clause is or has become irrevocable,a beneficiary may apply to the court for a determination of whether a particular motion,petition,or other act by the beneficiary,would be a contest within the terms of the no contest clause,subd.a.
section provides a safe harbor for beneficiaries who seek a judicial determination whether a proposed legal challenge would be a contest,and that is the only issue to be decided when such an application is made.citation.as a general rule,the decision about whether the beneficiary proposed action would be a will contest may not involve a determination of the merits of the action itself estate of davies th,d.hearst ganzi,supra,th at,d.
iii.the third decree of distribution did not incorporate the no contest clause of the will by reference 
appellant contends that the trial court erred in incorporating the no contest clause contained in the will into the decrees of distribution regarding the trust provisions relating to the ranch.he asserts that none of the decrees contains a no contest clause that the third decree of distribution is the relevant decree that it is not ambiguous and that it does not incorporate by reference the will or the no contest clause of the will.we agree.
as our supreme court explained in estate of callnon cal d,t he administration of a decedent estate involves a series of separate proceedings,each of which is intended to be final citations.a decree of distribution is a judicial construction of the will arrived at by the court ascertaining the intent of the testator.citations.once final,the decree supersedes the will citations and becomes the conclusive determination of the validity,meaning and effect of the will,the trusts created therein and the rights of all parties thereunder.citations.
if the decree erroneously interprets the intention of the testator it must be attacked by appeal and not collaterally.citations.if not corrected by appeal an erroneous decree is as conclusive as a decree that contains no error.citations.it is well settled that where the decree of distribution is contrary to the provisions in the will,the decree controls and prevails over the terms of the will with respect to the distribution of the property.citations.only if the language of the decree is uncertain,vague or ambiguous citation may resort be had to the will to interpret but not to contradict the decree.citations.however,if the distributive portions of the decree are free from ambiguity,resort may not be had to the provisions of the will in order to create an ambiguity.estate of norris,supra,d.estate of callnon,supra,cal d at,fns.omitted see also estate of cooper d.estate of buckhantz d.
as recognized above,resort to the will may be used to resolve ambiguities in the decree.estate of cooper,supra,d at.however,there is nothing here on the face of the decrees themselves to indicate there is any ambiguity in their provisions regarding whether they include a no contest clause.they simply do not contain and do not reference such a clause.
respondent argues that whether or not the distribution decrees are ambiguous,the will may supply omitted terms to supplement the decrees where the will is incorporated by reference into the decrees.estate of cooper,supra,d at.where the decree,by its own terms,incorporates it the will may be looked to for varying purposes,such as to supply matter omitted from the decree as well as also to clarify the decree ambiguities estate of lockhart d,disapproved on other grounds in estate of platt cal d.
language similar to that appearing in the first and final decrees has been held sufficient to incorporate the will by reference into the decree of distribution and to supplement the decree with provisions omitted from the decree.estate of cooper,supra,d at.estate of lockhart,supra,d at.
estate of cooper,supra,d,arose in the context of an order fixing an inheritance tax in the probate of a widow estate under a joint and mutual will executed with her husband during his lifetime.the will appeared to give the widow a life estate.id.at.an order in the probate of the husband estate affirmed an inheritance tax compromise agreement computing the tax as if the widow had received a life estate.had the widow taken the entire fee,no tax would have been collected in the estate of the husband,because of the widow exemption.however,the decree of distribution of the husband estate appeared to distribute the property to her in fee simple absolute.the state controller sought to impose inheritance taxes upon the widow estate as if she had received a fee simple absolute.id.at.the controversy centered on the interpretation of the distribution order in the husband estate.id.at.the appellate court acknowledged the rule that the distribution decree controls over contrary provisions in the will.however,it also held that the phrase in the relevant part of the distribution order of the husband estate providing that the property was distributed in pursuance of and according to the provisions of the last will of said deceased id.at.authorized the court to look not only to the order of distribution,but also to the will of the husband to the extent that it supplies matters which it contains but the decree omits.estate of lockhart,supra,d at page.estate of cooper,at.the appellate court concluded that the orders made in the husband estate were not and that the widow thereby received a life estate.id.at.
here,the first decree of distribution,upon which the probate court apparently relied to incorporate the will by reference into the third decree,and the fourth decree each contain the phrase that the distribution therein is made to the trustees under and pursuant to the terms of the said last will and testament of said decedent.however,the first decree of distribution,distributing the certificate of membership and community apartment lease,also provides 
said certificate of membership and said lease of said community apartment are a part of the assets of the following trust.certain provisions of said trust have to do with the management and operation of the decedent ranch in monterey county.said trust,however,is completely set forth herein rather than merely portions of it which have application to said community apartment or proceeds of sale thereof.italics added.
thus,to the extent the statement in the recitals portion of the first decree might be relied upon to incorporate the will to some extent,the clear statement in the distributing clause that the trust is completely set forth herein establishes that no trust provisions have been omitted and that there is no room to supplement the trust provisions by incorporating provisions contained in the will.
respondent argues that in context,the statement that the trust is completely set forth herein does not conflict with the incorporation of the will into the trust as the statement is contained in a paragraph set off by parentheses,the purpose of which is to explain why provisions of the trust were included in the first decree,even though they had nothing to do with the asset distributed by that decree.
we read the language in its context to mean what it says,that the trust is completely set forth in the first decree.as the first decree distributed only the community apartment,the distributive order could have set forth merely portions of the trust which have application to said community apartment or proceeds of sale thereof.however,it was decided to completely set forth the terms of said trust,including provisions having to do with management and operation of decedent ranch in monterey county.italics added.in context,the phrase completely set forth refers to all the terms of the trust.
the fourth or final decree of june,does not purport to establish a trust pursuant to all the terms of the will.rather,the recital states that the rest,residue and remainder of said estate is distributable to the three trustees in trust pursuant to the terms of the last will and testament of said decedent as set forth in the petition on file herein and as hereinafter stated italics added.thus,the recital provides that only those terms of the will that are set forth in the petition and hereinafter stated,set forth in the fourth decree of distribution will govern the trust.the terms of the will set forth in the petition for settlement of the final account and for final distribution and those hereinafter stated are the same.they are the terms established by article sixth as modified to reflect the impact of the codicil and the terms set forth in each of the previous distributive orders.they do not include a no contest clause.therefore,we do not find the language of the fourth decree of distribution,that the distribution to the three trustees in trust pursuant to the terms of the last will and testament of said decedent as set forth in the petition on file herein and as hereinafter stated,suffices to incorporate the no contest clause of the will into the trust.
the third decree distributing the ranch contains no similar phrases arguably incorporating the will in provisions relating to the trust or to distribution of the ranch.in distributing the residue of the estate including the ranch in trust for the uses and purposes hereinafter set forth,the third decree does not reference the will.consequently,there is no basis for incorporating the no contest clause of the will into the terms of the trust governing the ranch 
as one of the series of steps in administration of the decedent estate,each decree was intended to be final as to the rights of all persons claiming an interest in the property distributed under it.see estate of callnon,supra,cal d at,gold et,cal.civil practice probate and trust proceedings,to.incorporation of a no contest clause into one decree by reference to the will in another decree seems doubly attenuated,and undermines the principles of res judicata and finality of decrees of distribution not challenged by direct appeal.beneficiaries or others looking to the trust distribution of the third decree would have no reason to suppose that provisions of the decedent will had been incorporated therein,much less that a no contest clause would apply.as appellant maintains,application of a no contest clause to the third decree based on a generic reference to the will in the first decree would turn the rule of strict construction on its head,for it would mean that a beneficiary could trigger the clause and be disinherited without ever knowing the trust had such a clause.
despite finding provisions of the will were incorporated into the decree of distribution at issue in that case,the court of appeal in estate of cooper,supra,d,recognized that the better,and certainly the more customary,practice is to have the order of distribution recite in haec verba those provisions of the will deemed pertinent by the probate court or to incorporate provisions into the order by more specific reference.id.at.in the instant case,as advised by estate of cooper,all of the distribution orders do recite in haec verba the trust provisions and none contains or references a no contest clause.
iv.the no contest clause in the will does not unequivocally express the intent of the testator to impose a forfeiture against beneficiaries challenging provisions of the trust 
the language of the no contest clause itself persuades us that it should not be incorporated into the trust provisions of the third decree.the no contest clause of the will does not itself refer to contests regarding the trust.rather,it refers to any contest of this will,or of any such codicil,or of any provision of this will,or of any such codicil to constitute a violation of a no contest clause,an act must come strictly within the express terms of that clause scharlin superior
