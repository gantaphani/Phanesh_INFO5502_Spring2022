ii.factual and procedural background 
on march,at gladys lensch died in a san mateo county nursing home.she was years old.she left the following holographic will i gladys lensch do hereby declare,being of sound mind,that my estate be equally divided between my daughter claudia and my son jay.claudia being married has daughters,and my son by a previous marriage has sons.they will provide for the well being of my grandchildren in the event of my death or serious incapacity due to lengthy illness.god bless the family.gladys clausen lensch may.
eleven hours after gladys died,jay,gladys son,was found dead in his home in trinity county.he had shot himself with a shotgun.the time of death on jay death certificate was recorded as the time his body was found on march.jay body was cremated without an autopsy and his remains were buried five days later.
in a handwritten will,with a addendum,jay made small cash gifts to friends,and left another friend an undeveloped parcel of land.the residue of his estate was left in equal shares to the unitarian universalist service committee and direct relief international.he left nothing in his will to his two sons,appellants jason and ean lensch.
on june,jason and ean lensch filed a petition to determine survival and to determine persons entitled to distribution.this petition was verified by petitioner attorney because petitioners reside out of this county and state.
the petition asked the court to find that it can not be determined by clear and convincing evidence who died first,gladys mildred lensch or her son,petitioner father,jay alfred lensch.because it can not be determined who died first,jay lensch should not take under gladys lensch will and his issue,petitioners,should take in his place.
the petition stated that shortly after noon on the same day gladys lensch died the body of her son,jay lensch was found.jay lensch died in his trinity county home of a gunshot wound.petitioners and their attorney spoke to the trinity county deputy coroner who investigated jay lensch death and the deputy coroner said that he could not determine the precise time of jay lensch death.to ean lensch,the deputy coroner said that jay lensch had been dead at least hours before his body was found and that death might have occurred two or more days earlier.to petitioner attorney,the deputy coroner said that jay lensch had last spoken to another person two days before his body was discovered and that death could have occurred any time between that conversation and the time of discovery.on the death certificate,the deputy coroner used the time of discovery as the time of death,as is customary in cases like this.the deputy coroner is certain that jay died earlier than the time stated on the death certificate,but explained to petitioner counsel that there is no way to tell what was the actual time of death.petitioners asked the court to find that it can not be determined by clear and convincing evidence who died fist,gladys clausen lensch or jay alfred lensch,and that the court deem gladys to have survived jay for the purpose of the transfers created by gladys will and that the court rule that the transfer made to jay in gladys will fails.
on july,jay executor,respondent darin wright,filed an opposition to jason and ean petition to determine survival.he argued that jason and ean had the burden of proving that jay did not survive gladys.he also argued that survival was not required by the terms of gladys will.relying on the death certificate of both decedents,respondent argued that because death certificates are proof of time of death,and claimant petition was based on inadmissible opinions,speculation,and hearsay,the only evidence of time of death was the death certificate.
at a brief hearing on july,the court noted that its tentative ruling was that there is no requirement for survival in the testamentary document.petitioners immediately requested an evidentiary hearing.counsel argued that jay was required to survive gladys in order to take under her will.the court rejected this argument and also ruled,in the alternative,that even if there was a survival requirement the only evidence before the court being the death certificates demonstrate that is lensch did survive his mother.counsel pointed to sworn testimony of my client who spoke to the coroner who declared that the time of death of jay lensch could not be determined.the court ruled that this statement was hearsay.at two other points in the hearing,appellants repeated their request for an evidentiary hearing.
the court denied the petition to determine survival.the court held that the evidence offered shows that decedent will did not require survival,but nevertheless,that jay lensch survived decedent gladys mildred lensch,and that no further evidentiary hearing is required.
this timely appeal followed.
iii.discussion 
survivorship 
jason and ean contend the trial court erred in denying their petition on the basis that gladys will did not require that jay survive her in order to take under her will.we exercise de novo review in interpreting the terms of gladys will estate of edwards d.and conclude that,although the trial court was correct in finding that gladys will contains no survivorship requirement,it erred in denying appellants petition on this basis,apparently because it did not understand the legal consequences of the lack of a survivorship requirement in gladys will.
gladys will does not express any intent with regard to survivorship.nor does it contain any provision for an alternate disposition in the event jay predeceased her.in this situation,we look to section and the statute,section,for guidance.section,subdivision a,provides that a transferee who fails to survive the transferor of an transfer or until any future time required by the instrument does not take under the instrument.section,subdivision a,provides that subject to subdivision b,if a transferee is dead when the instrument is executed,or fails or is treated as failing to survive the transferor or until a future time required by the instrument,the issue of the deceased transferee take in the transferee place in the manner provided in section.subdivision b provides,however,that t he issue of a deceased transferee do not take in the transferee place if the instrument expresses a contrary intention or a substitute disposition.a requirement that the initial transferee survive the transferor or survive for a specified period of time after the death of the transferor constitutes a contrary intention.a requirement that the initial transferee survive until a future time that is related to the probate of the transferor will or administration of the estate of the transferor constitutes a contrary intention.
therefore,in the absence of any requirement of survivorship,a transfer that is to occur on the transferor death lapses if the transferee dies first.burkett capovilla th,d.as the court explained in estate of mooney th,d,u nder the antilapse statute,if a bequest is made to kindred,and is not conditioned on survivorship and is not subject to an alternate disposition,and the beneficiary predeceases the transferor,the bequest passes to the predeceased beneficiary issue.
here,as the probate court found,gladys bequest was not conditioned on jay survival.nor did she make an alternate disposition.therefore,under sections and,if jay died before gladys,then gladys bequest to jay fails under section and passes to jay children,appellants,under section.put simply,the court finding that gladys will contained no survival requirement was the beginning of the story,not the end.
respondent,who seems to understand at this point in the proceedings the significance of the fact that gladys will contained neither a survival requirement nor an alternate disposition,argues that jay will,in which jay complains about his sons conduct toward him,constitutes extrinsic evidence from which the probate court could reasonably infer that gladys knew and disapproved of jason and ean conduct,and for that reason intended in her will to give jay complete discretion over his bequest whether he survived her or not.in other words,respondent contends that the trial court should have construed gladys will as containing a provision that jay was not required to survive her based on language contained in jay will,which was written well after gladys.we disagree.
the rules for construing the meaning of a will are well established.the paramount rule in the construction of wills,to which all other rules must yield,is that a will is to be construed according to the intention of the testator as expressed therein,and this intention must be given effect as far as possible.citation.the rule is imbedded in the probate code.citation.its objective is to ascertain what the testator meant by the language he used.estate of russell cal d,russell.
e xtrinsic evidence of the circumstances under which a will is made except evidence expressly excluded by statute may be considered by the court in ascertaining what the testator meant by the words used in the will.if in the light of such extrinsic evidence,the provisions of the will are reasonably susceptible of two or more meanings claimed to have been intended by the testator,an uncertainty arises upon the face of a will and extrinsic evidence relevant to prove any of such meanings is admissible see subject to the restrictions imposed by statute.if,on the other hand,in the light of such extrinsic evidence,the provisions of the will are not reasonably susceptible of two or more meanings,there is no uncertainty arising upon the face of the will citations and any proffered evidence attempting to show an intention different from that expressed by the words therein,giving them the only meaning to which they are reasonably susceptible,is inadmissible.in the latter case the provisions of the will are to be interpreted according to such meaning.russell,supra,cal d at,fns.omitted.
finally,it is solely a judicial function to interpret a written instrument unless the interpretation turns upon the credibility of extrinsic evidence.accordingly,an appellate court is not bound by a construction of a document based solely upon the terms of the written instrument without the aid of extrinsic evidence,where there is no conflict in the evidence,or a determination has been made upon incompetent evidence.citations.citations.russell,supra,cal d at.
applying these principles to the case before us,we conclude that the language in jay will expressing his disappointment in his sons does not,as respondents contend,indicate that gladys intended that,should jay predecease her,his children would not share in her estate.jay will demonstrates only that jay appears to have disapproved of his sons when he wrote his will.there is no evidence that gladys was even aware of her son difficult relationship with his children or that she agreed with her son assessment of his children behavior.to the contrary,her will explicitly mentions her desire that jay and his sister care for gladys grandchildren,which would include appellants jason and ean.if anything,gladys will indicates that it was her intent that her estate benefit her grandchildren as well as her children.
having correctly concluded that gladys will contained no requirement that jay survive her and in light of the fact that the will also contains no provision for an alternate disposition,the next step in the probate court analysis was to consider the issue of whether jay did,in fact,survive gladys.it is this issue to which we next turn.
evidentiary hearing 
appellants argue that the trial court erred in finding,based on the time of death reported in jay death certificate,that gladys predeceased jay.this conclusion led to the denial of appellants claim that,under the antilapse statute,they were entitled to a share of gladys estate.the probate court should have held an evidentiary hearing on this issue and erred in denying appellants request for one.
appellants filed a verified petition to determine order of death under section.under section,subdivisions a and b a n interested person may appear and make a response or objection in either writing or in person before or at the hearing.the court then may in its discretion either hear and determine the response or objection at the hearing,or grant a continuance for the purpose of allowing a response or objection to be made in writing,subd.b.the probate code,therefore,specifically allows for objections to be made close to or at the time of the hearing,and also gives the court discretion to continue a hearing to permit further development of an objection.
section specifies that a n affidavit or verified petition shall be received as evidence when offered in an uncontested proceeding under this code.when a petition is contested,at it was here,affidavits and verified petitions may not be considered as evidence at a contested probate hearing.evangelho presoto th,d.rather,absent a stipulation among the parties to the contrary,each allegation in a verified petition and each fact set forth in a supporting affidavit must be established by competent evidence.estate of duncan d.this rule is consistent with the rule of civil practice that a party is entitled to have received in evidence and considered by the court,before findings are made,all competent,relevant and material evidence on any material issue.meadows lee d.see also.
in estate of bennett th,d,the court held it was an abuse of discretion to deny a request for an evidentiary hearing of a contested motion.the bennett court pointed out that,because the hearing was contested,the parties could not proceed on submitted declarations and verified pleadings.instead,the bennett court held,an evidentiary hearing was required and the court erred in denying a request for one.
here,appellants verified petition alleged that,shortly after noon on the same day as gladys died,jay body was found.the petition alleged based on a conversation between counsel,petitioners and the trinity county deputy coroner,that the coroner could not determine the precise time of death.the petition alleged that the deputy coroner said that jay lensch had been dead at least hours before his body was found and that death might have occurred two or more days earlier.further,the deputy coroner used the time of discovery as the time of death,as is customary in cases like this.however,the deputy coroner is certain that jay died earlier than the time stated on the death certificate 
had the hearing appellants requested been uncontested,a n affidavit or verified petition shall be received as evidence.however,on july,respondent filed an opposition to appellants petition in his opposition,respondent objected specifically to appellants petition on the ground that it was inadmissible opinions,speculation,and hearsay,and not proper evidence.respondent attached to his opposition copies of the death certificates of jay and gladys and speculated that it was unlikely that any evidence could be produced that might overcome the presumption set out in health and safety code section respondent opposition,therefore,transformed appellants unopposed petition to a contested one.under these circumstances,the probate court should have granted the request for an evidentiary hearing that appellants made three times at the very brief hearing on their petition.
respondent does not argue that appellants were not entitled to such a hearing.rather,he contends that appellants waived their right to an evidentiary hearing because they failed to make a timely and proper request for a hearing.respondent also argues that appellants are estopped from raising this issue because their own papers asserted unequivocally that no live testimony was necessary.we reject both t
