norma jean klein appeals from an order granting safe harbor to her son,christopher gene fazzi,to file a proposed petition in probate court challenging norma status and actions as trustee of two trusts in which christopher is a beneficiary the proposed petition also challenges a trust provision directing that christopher brother,michael,serve as the successor trustee to norma.
in granting christopher safe harbor application,the trial court found neither of the two trusts contains a no contest clause and,moreover,even if the clause did apply,the proposed petition does not constitute a contest as defined in the probate code.because the trial court erred in granting the application for safe harbor,we reverse.
background facts and procedure 
on january,norma and her husband,lloyd klein,created a revocable trust entitled the klein family trust the trust or the original trust and concurrently executed wills.the trust designated the two spouses as cotrustees of the trust during their joint lifetimes.
according to the terms of the trust,upon the death of either spouse,the survivor,as trustee,was to divide the trust assets into three new trusts trust a,trust b,and trust c.the trust directed the spouse to fund trust a with his or her share of the community property and separate property,and this trust would remain revocable during that spouse lifetime.the trustee was to place into trusts b and c,according to a specified formula,the decedent spouse separate property and share of community property.christopher,his five siblings,and stepsiblings were to be the remainder beneficiaries of trusts b and c,which would become irrevocable trusts when the first spouse died.the surviving spouse was to be the income beneficiary of all three trusts until his or her death.
the trust contained a no contest clause which provided,essentially,that any person,heir,or beneficiary under the trust who contest s in any court any of the provisions of this instrument shall not be entitled to any distributions or any benefits under this trust instrument.trust,italics added.
article of the trust specified the procedure for appointment of a successor trustee.paragraph provided that the trustee may resign at any time upon giving written notice to the beneficiaries and,upon receiving notice,the beneficiaries shall designate a successor trustee,if one is not provided for hereinafter paragraph provided in the event of the death,inability or unwillingness of lloyd klein and norma jean klein,or the survivor,to act as trustee,then michael gene fazzi shall be the trustee.michael is christopher brother.
lloyd died on december,and norma became the sole trustee.nine months later,norma executed an asset allocation agreement that distributed the trust assets into the three subtrusts,a,b,and 
on april,christopher filed an application for a safe harbor determination under probate code section to determine whether his proposed petition constituted a contest under the no contest provision of the trust.in november,christopher withdrew that initial safe harbor application and filed the safe harbor application at issue in this appeal.
in this safe harbor application,christopher requested a determination that his proposed petition did not violate the no contest clause of the trust.the proposed petition sought the following removal of norma as trustee for cause a determination that paragraph of the trust,designating michael as the successor trustee to norma,applies only to the original trust and not to trusts b and c,or if michael is found to be the successor trustee to trusts b and c,then a determination that michael is unfit for that position and disqualified from serving and appointment of a professional fiduciary as successor trustee for trusts b and c,with instructions to investigate,account,and correct the actions norma took as trustee.
christopher application for a safe harbor determination advanced three contentions.first,christopher argued the no contest clause in paragraph applied only to the original trust and did not apply to trusts b and second,christopher asserted that if the no contest clause did apply to trusts b and c,the proposed petition did not violate that clause because it did not challenge the validity of the original trust,any of the subtrusts a,b,or c,or any provision thereof.third,christopher argued the no contest clause was unenforceable as a matter of public policy because it would shield trustee norma malfeasance.
norma filed a response and objections to the safe harbor application.essentially,she argued the proposed petition violated the trust no contest clause because in seeking to ignore the designation of michael as the successor trustee of trusts b and c and to appoint in his stead a professional fiduciary,the petition sought relief in contravention of paragraph.underpinning that argument was her additional contention that both the successor trustee and no contest provisions of the trust applied to trusts b and c.she further argued that the proposed petition to remove her as trustee for cause violated the no contest clause and,finally,that christopher could not prevail on his proposed petition because it would require a determination of the petition on the merits,which is precluded by section,subdivision c.
the trial court granted christopher application for a safe harbor determination.in a minute order dated august,the trial court stated its reasoning as follows the court grants safe harbor on the following grounds trusts b and c do not contain a no contest clause,nor do they refer to or incorporate the no contest clause of the original trust,which is no longer in existence.the proposed petition is not a contest as defined in the probate code see section.there simply is no challenge to the validity of trusts b or c,or to the original trust the proposed pleading does contest provisions of the trust.
this appeal followed.
discussion 
norma argues the trial court erred in granting christopher safe harbor to file the proposed petition.she asserts the trial court erred in finding that the trust no contest clause did not apply to the subtrusts and the proposed petition did not constitute a contest under the terms of that clause.norma claims have merit.
does the no contest clause apply to the subtrusts 
the rules for interpreting the scope of a no contest clause are.where,as here,t here is no conflict or question of credibility in the relevant extrinsic evidence,interpretation of the trust is a question of law for our independent review.citation.although no contest clauses are enforceable and favored by the public policies of discouraging litigation and preserving the transferor intent,they are nevertheless strictly construed and may not be extended beyond their plainly intended function.citations.johnson,supra,cal th at.the key is to determine the intent of the trustors,norma and lloyd.in construing a trust instrument,the intent of the trustor prevails and it must be ascertained from the whole of the trust instrument,not just separate parts of it.scharlin superior court th,scharlin.
christopher argument for interpreting the no contest clause as inapplicable to trusts b and c is beguilingly simple.he contends that because the trust does not explicitly state the no contest clause applies to the subtrusts,it must be strictly construed as applying only to the original trust.but such a construction not only ignores the trustors intent as revealed in the whole of the trust,it is also patently unreasonable.
the trustors intent that the no contest clause applies to the subtrusts is implicit in the terms of the trust.this document,a revocable instrument,created and funded the three subtrusts upon the first trustor death.trust,b.at operation,trusts b and c were irrevocable,and a host of provisions in the original trust immediately came into play,establishing rules for the administration of the subtrusts.for example,paragraph b directed that each of the subtrusts shall constitute and be held,administered and distributed by the trustee as a separate trust.paragraphs
