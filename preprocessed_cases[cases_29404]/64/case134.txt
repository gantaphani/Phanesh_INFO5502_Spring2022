a wife agreed to hold funds in trust for her husband elderly stepmother.after her husband death,the wife changed the form of the accounts and used the funds for her own purposes.the stepmother died and her personal representative brought this action to impose a constructive trust on the funds.at the conclusion of the personal representative,the trial court granted judgment in favor of the wife under code of civil procedure section.the trial court found the husband committed no wrongdoing in transferring the funds to the accounts,and the trust designation on the accounts was revocable,so no constructive trust could be imposed on the funds.we hold that despite the form of the bank accounts,when clear and convincing evidence shows funds were transferred to an account owner to hold in an irrevocable trust for a third party beneficiary and the trustee repudiates the trust,a constructive trust may be imposed on the funds for the beneficiary estate to prevent unjust enrichment.we reverse the judgment and remand for further proceedings.

action for constructive trust 
on september,plaintiff and appellant arthur higgins,as executor of maria estate and successor trustee of the family trust,filed the complaint in the instant action against lupe to impose a constructive trust on the funds in the accounts.the complaint alleged that clive and lupe obtained their claim to the funds by reason of fraudulent or otherwise wrongful conduct,including an agreement that the funds would be used solely for maria benefit,and lupe unduly influenced clive to transfer the funds to her to deprive maria and the trust of the funds.a bench trial began on may.
arthur first witness was ben tsugawa,vice president at royal business bank,which purchased los angeles national bank.tsugawa testified that the bank views the designation itf like a totten trust.clive and lupe were the owners of the account,while maria was the beneficiary if clive and lupe both passed away.maria had no present interest in the account and was not an owner or a signatory.the endorsement on the check depositing funds into the new account typically reflects the vesting on the new account.sandoval left the bank employment two months before the trial and it was not the bank practice to provide contact information for former employees.
psychologist robert sawicky testified that maria was dependent upon clive to make decisions for her in and was susceptible to undue influence.sanchez testified as well.he opined that maria was not capable of making decisions about properties or estate planning documents,or understanding the differences between financial accounts on march.by september,her symptoms had progressed to the stage that he could conclusively diagnose dementia.
clive sons were witnesses at trial.mark testified that he and lupe found a copy of the family trust at maria house.when lupe learned arthur was responsible for the family trust and would serve as executor when maria died,she said she would not help mark with anything.she asked mark to drive her to the bank to talk to sandoval.mark waited with the tellers while lupe conducted her business with sandoval,then he took her home.lupe also wanted maria to move out of her home.mark and his wife took maria into their home to give lupe a break while they tried to find a nursing home for maria.lupe complained about the cost of the facility they located,but mark reminded her that the money belonged to maria,so it should go to her needs,and lupe signed the checks.
michael testified that when clive returned from the hospital at the end of march,he was not in any condition to go to the bank,conduct banking transactions,or make financial decisions.
lupe testified as well.she was not aware that maria was suffering from any chronic physical pain or dementia.maria did not experience any health problems while she was living with lupe.at her deposition,lupe stated that she never had a bank account where she held funds in trust for maria or funds that belonged to maria,but she was a beneficiary of an account with funds that belonged to maria.at trial,however,she readily admitted that she signed documents to open accounts held in trust for maria and she knew the funds in the accounts were intended for maria.
lupe referred to the checking account several times during her testimony as maria account.even after she changed the ownership of the account to be in her name only and removed the in trust for designation,everything in the account was for maria.after maria death,lupe wrote checks from the account to maria grandchildren because it was maria money.the funds that she gave to the grandchildren were not a gift from lupe.
lupe believed the funds in the accounts transferred to her when maria died.she also believed she was entitled to keep money electronically deposited into the accounts for maria after her death,such as a deposit from guggenheim life insurance on september,because maria was no longer alive.clive and lupe were the owners named on the account,and clive was no longer alive,so it was logical that the funds in the account were hers.she explained that maria was not around anymore,clive was not around anymore,and the account belonged to her.
at the conclusion of arthur evidence,lupe brought a motion for judgment pursuant to code of civil procedure section.she argued that the complaint sought a constructive trust based on undue influence or fraud,but there was no evidence of undue influence or fraud by lupe with regard to maria.any cause of action based on undue influence or fraud by clive needed to be brought against him,and the statute of limitations had passed.clive had the legal right to withdraw money from the joint accounts he had with maria.
arthur responded that a constructive should be imposed on the funds in this case based on evidence of undue influence,lack of capacity,and violation of a trust.he argued that even unintentionally,the joint bank accounts between maria and clive were a product of clive undue influence.when clive opened new accounts with lupe,he did not intend to make a gift of maria money to lupe.the parties to an account can agree that the funds are owned differently as between the parties,which is what the evidence showed in this case.clive made the funds accessible to lupe with the understanding,and lupe acknowledgement,that the funds belonged to maria.lupe use of funds that she knew belonged to someone else was wrongful.
the trial court found clive was a loving and father who committed no wrongful act.he did not exercise any undue influence and sought only to assist maria.once clive was added to maria accounts as a joint account holder,he had a legal right to do as he pleased with the funds.the bank signature cards for the new accounts clearly indicated his intent to hold the funds in trust for maria.under the agreement with the bank,however,the funds only went to the beneficiary after the death of the account owners.if there was a wrongful act by clive,any action against him or his estate had to be brought within a year of his death.clive made lupe a joint tenant,and after clive passed away,as the surviving joint tenant,she had the right to do as she pleased with the funds in the accounts.the trial court stated lupe had a clear moral obligation to return the money to the family trust,but the court could not find a legal obligation.the court apologized to the higgins family for the court inability to restore the funds.the court granted judgment in favor of lupe.
judgment was entered in favor of lupe on june.arthur filed a timely notice of appeal.

general principles of constructive trust 
arthur contends undisputed evidence in this case established all of the conditions necessary to impose a constructive trust.we agree.
an action to impose a constructive trust is a suit in equity to compel a person holding property wrongfully to transfer the property interest to the person to whom it rightfully belongs.communist party valencia,th,communist party bogert et,the law of trusts and trustees ed,witkin,cal.procedure ed.pleading.
the general principles for imposition of a constructive trust are set forth in civil code sections and.martin kehl d,martin.civil code section states,one who wrongfully detains a thing is an involuntary trustee thereof,for the benefit of the owner.civil code section provides,one who gains a thing by fraud,accident,mistake,undue influence,the violation of a trust,or other wrongful act,is,unless he or she has some other and better right thereto,an involuntary trustee of the thing gained,for the benefit of the person who would otherwise have had it.

violation of promise to hold funds in trust 
a constructive trust may be imposed in this case based on lupe repudiation of an express voluntary trust in which she agreed to hold funds in trust for maria.clive transferred funds to trust accounts with lupe agreement that the funds belonged to maria and would be held in trust for maria.after clive death,lupe removed maria name from the accounts and used the funds for her own purposes,repudiating her promise to hold them in trust on maria behalf.this evidence was sufficient to impose a constructive trust on the funds to prevent unjust enrichment.
bank accounts,including joint accounts and totten trusts are governed by the probate code.prob.code.a totten trust is a tentative trust,created when a depositor opens a bank account in trust for another person,but reserves the power to withdraw funds during the depositor lifetime.estate of allen th,estate of collins d,collins estate of fisher d,fisher.if the trust is not revoked before the depositor death,any balance in the account is payable to the beneficiary.fisher,supra,at.in a real sense a tentative or totten trust is not a trust at all but is a recognized exception to the law of testamentary disposition and as such obviates the necessity for compliance with the requisite statutory elements of executing a will.collins,supra,at.
while all parties are living,an account belongs to the parties who have a present right to payment,in proportion to their contributions,unless there is clear and convincing evidence of a different intent.prob.code,subd.a,subd.a.in the case of a totten trust account,the beneficiary has no rights to the sums on deposit during the lifetime of any party,unless there is clear and convincing evidence of a different intent.if there is an irrevocable trust,the account belongs beneficially to the beneficiary.prob.code,subd.e.a finding under the clear and convincing evidence test requires evidence clear enough to leave no substantial doubt and strong enough that every reasonable person would agree.conservatorship of wendland cal th.
in this case,there was clear and convincing evidence that clive and lupe intended to create irrevocable trust accounts in which maria had a present beneficial interest in the funds on deposit,not totten trust accounts.a trust is a fiduciary relationship with respect to property in which the person holding legal title to the property the trustee has an equitable obligation to manage the property for the benefit of another the beneficiary.moeller superior court cal th,italics omitted.to be valid,a trust,whether oral or written,must contain three elements a trust res,the manifestation of a trust intent,and a proper trust purpose.prob.code.estate of gardner th.it is well settled that no particular language or terminology is necessary to create a trust nor need the word trust or trustee be used nor need all the conditions of the trust be expressed in a single paper nor need a trust in personal property be in writing.weiner mullaney d.probate code section sets forth several methods for creating a trust,including a transfer of property by the owner during the owner lifetime to another person as trustee.prob.code,subd.b presta tepper th,presta.a trust is any arrangement which exists whereby property is transferred with an intention that it be held and administered by the transferee trustee for the benefit of another citations.presta,supra,at.
clive and lupe intended the trust in this case to be irrevocable,unlike a totten trust that is revocable at will during the owner lifetime.clive transferred maria money into the accounts.maria social security income and other payments owed to maria continued to be deposited directly into the accounts.the owner of a totten trust generally deposits his or her own money and retains the right to withdraw funds for any purpose,but clive and lupe did not deposit their own funds into these accounts.although lupe did not have any conversation with clive about the reasons for opening the accounts,it is clear from her actions and testimony that she agreed to hold the funds in trust for maria and use them for maria needs.lupe signed signature cards that stated the accounts were in trust for maria.she testified that the
