john appeals from a judgment appointing a lanterman petris short lps act conservator of his person.he also appeals the imposition of special disabilities in the letters of conservatorship,denying him the privilege of possessing a driver license,the right to enter into contracts and the right to possess a firearm.he contends there is not substantial evidence supporting the finding that he can not provide for his basic needs such as food,clothing and shelter,nor is there evidence supporting the imposition of the special disabilities on his right to enter into contracts,drive and possess firearms.john further contends the trial court erred in requiring him to pay jury fees.
in the published portion of this opinion,we conclude that the trial court erred in ordering john to pay jury fees because there is no statutory authority for such fees.
in the unpublished portion of this opinion,we conclude that the finding of grave disability and the imposition of special disabilities is supported by substantial evidence.
we reverse the jury fee order.in all other respects,the judgment is affirmed.
factual and procedural background 
trial evidence 
john has a longstanding history of mental illness.he was conserved for three years in in los angeles county.john was again placed under conservatorship in,this time in shasta county.in,john had five psychiatric hospitalizations,each the result of john not taking his medication after being discharged.
john mahoney,a shasta county mental health clinical psychologist,examined and evaluated john on a number of occasions and diagnosed him with schizophrenia,paranoid subtype.as a result of his mental illness,john experiences disorganized thoughts and behaviors,hallucinations,and delusions,including delusions that he is employed as an agent for various law enforcement agencies.in the course of each hospitalization,while medicated,john would stabilize in the hospital and be released.each time,after he was discharged,he stopped taking his medication and within two to three weeks would be suffering from acute psychotic symptoms.
in august,mahoney recommended taking john off the conservatorship,because he appeared to be doing very well.although he still had delusions,it did not seem to mahoney that the delusions would interfere with john ability to live independently.furthermore,john had changed a living plan from an unrealistic plan of going to mexico to drive a truck to a more realistic plan to remain in town at a local hotel,the lorenz and let the star team assist him with his needs.
around august,manuel ramirez,a deputy public guardian for shasta county,began working with john to transition off conservatorship to independent living.john conservatorship was going to terminate at the end of october.john was consistently taking his medication,following facility rules and attending drug and alcohol abuse meetings.although he continued to talk about being involved in law enforcement,at the time the delusions appeared harmless as he was otherwise following all the facility rules.ramirez testified that in hindsight,the delusions were sufficient to maintain john on the conservatorship.in october,after john was moved into the lorenz hotel,ramirez began to receive complaints that john was breaking the facility rules.he was allowing people in his room at or and smoking in his room.ultimately,john went off conservatorship on november.
willie smith,operations manager of the christian church homes,which runs the lorenz hotel,testified that she had moved john into the lorenz on october.at the intake interview,john said he was a cia agent.he would then say he was an undercover drug enforcement agent.as time went on,john became more difficult and less willing to cooperate with the star team.on november,smith ordered john to move out of the lorenz hotel because of his violent behavior directed against the security guards.specifically,the security guards reported that on october or,they had to call the police as john was violent,drinking and threatening them and residents thereafter,smith sent john a letter on november notifying john he would be evicted as a result of his behavior and the danger to other tenants and staff.about a week after writing the letter,smith saw john and reminded him he would have to move.john got very angry,told her to f herself and called her a f ing bitch and inappropriate language.he later raised his cane at her and told her to get out of his face.shortly after john moved,he returned to the lorenz hotel to get his security deposit.when white told him he would receive it in a timely fashion,john threatened her again,this time telling her that he would get the cia after her and said,i will get you for this.smith was afraid john would assault her.she viewed him as the most frightening tenant she had had in years.
in december,john was committed pursuant to welfare and institutions code section john had been very agitated and irate and had made several threats toward the star team personnel and mahoney.he threatened to cut off the heads of all of the star team members and slit the throat of his primary service coordinator if they did not give him his money.when asked whether he had any food,john said he did not.when asked where he could obtain food,john would not answer and disengaged the star worker.
mahoney again diagnosed john with schizophrenia,paranoid subtype.he noted that although john had had auditory hallucinations in the past,at the present time his symptoms had not progressed that far.however,he continued to suffer from delusions.at their worst in,john said he was the angel gabriel and he also said he was eight and months pregnant.more recently,he claimed to simultaneously be a dea agent,an fbi agent,and an undercover police officer.he said he had an unlimited account at the déjà vu restaurant,which he first said had been set up for him by the redding police department and then said the chinese secret service had set up the account 
mahoney administered what he called the medication tray test,in which the patient is presented with four bottles of simulated medications with a set of directions on each bottle and asked to load two days of medication on the tray.john told mahoney that he had helped invent the test.he also said he was a psychiatrist who had attended harvard and stanford.john performed the test without error.however,on the complex figure test,which requires the use of a number of cognitive functions and measures the ability to plan and organize,john scored between the and percentile,suggesting that at least percent of the general population would do better.mahoney testified that people who tested in that range are normally able to perform the routine activities of daily living without too much trouble.however,when faced with something particularly complex or something they have not encountered before,they need assistance.
mahoney opined that john does not believe he has a mental disorder.this lack of insight leads john to believe he does not need treatment or medication.however,john requires medication to keep his symptoms controlled.without the medication,his psychotic symptoms reemerge.his five hospitalizations were a direct result of his failure to take his medications.mahoney also noted that john bank closed his account after he went there and loudly insisted he was an fbi agent.in addition,john payee sought to discharge him because of his behavior.thus,mahoney concluded john behavior is negatively affecting his ability to manage his money and have housing.the delusions have caused john to behave in ways that hinder his ability to manage his money and get housing or maintain housing,maintain appropriate housing.
during mahoney examination,john was largely calm and cooperative,spoke normally and coherently and was linear in his thinking.he was able to concentrate on the questions being asked.he could provide the names of his medications and adequately follow directions on the bottles.he was able to describe how to go to a grocery store,give a reasonable list of foods to purchase,describe his clothing needs and identify places to purchase clothing.however,he had a completely unrealistic plan as to housing.john said he would go to corning to live with his wife,a person the doctor did not believe existed,and take a job as an undercover officer for sintf and the dea.
john entered the representative payee program around november.elodia stalcup,of golden umbrella,a nonprofit organization that helps seniors,is the representative payee for john veteran adminstration va payments.golden umbrella received from the va for john.because his bank account was set up as a conserved account,john could not withdraw money from the bank himself.for the first two weeks golden umbrella acted as the representative payee,stalcup was paying john expenses without a budget.because john constantly called her for more money,she called the va for a budget.the va budgeted for john rent at the lorenz,for his food and for a personal allowance.john ran out of money too quickly,so to ensure he had a roof over his head,stalcup paid his rent directly and set up an account at the déjà vu restaurant to ensure john had food to eat.john became upset with the amount of money he was receiving and called stalcup about that multiple times.on one occasion,john told her i with the fbi and i know that you have of mine and i need for you to f ing give it to me.stalcup also got phone calls from two branches of the bank where john had his account.john was going into the banks and demanding more money.stalcup received a letter from the bank saying they would no longer serve john.thereafter,her executive director told her to disenroll john from the program,but at the time of the trial,golden umbrella remained the payee.
john testified.he acknowledged that he was conserved in in los angeles.he was again conserved in shasta county and released.john believed that conservatorship was unnecessary.all he needed was money.he said he was unable to provide food,clothing and shelter for himself because he was not getting his vietnam vet check from the government.he indicated that as of the day of his testimony,he had at least in the bank.
john described an extensive employment history in law enforcement,beginning with the santa cruz county sheriff department working in the jail and with a countywide narcotics enforcement team.he said when he was in los angeles,he worked with the lapd.he testified that during a sting operation involving other agencies,he was injured.i got shot in the foot and the leg and an ambulance ran into my leg and broke my leg,and i was in the hospital for three years down there,so the so the the department of justice assigned me to the sheriff department down there.
john acknowledged that he suffers from delusions,saying his imagination has victimized him several times.he said that when he is delusional he claims to work in agencies such as the fbi.he indicated that in december,he had an episode at the behavioral center which he blamed on the medication he had been administered.he sometimes gets delusional when he drinks coffee.he said he suffers from paranoid schizophrenia.he said mahoney had diagnosed him as having schizoaffective disorder with bipolar tendencies,but then changed his diagnosis.he admitted telling a security guard at the lorenz that he was an fbi agent pursuing an investigation in the county mental health system.he denied ever threatening anyone,but said he might have shouted obscenities at others at the hotel when he was in so much pain from previous injuries that he did not want to be bothered.he denied threatening smith or stalcup or yelling obscenities at smith,although he did not recall whether he had sworn at stalcup.
when asked whether he was working during the period when he was staying at the lorenz hotel,john asked the trial court whether he was under oath.after the court said he was,john testified he had worked part time for the redding police department doing reconnaissance,finding haunts where people are using drugs and reporting on that.when he found a house,he would get the people information,their names,what kind of drugs,where they come from.although the work was voluntary,he said he held the rank of captain.he was working under the cover of a schizophrenic wino.
john acknowledged that he authored a dea field report,which was admitted into evidence,in which he asked for assistance locating money to start buying drugs,including methamphetamine and heroin,as part of his undercover operation.he testified that the he had in the bank was filtered through the department of veteran administration as front money for his undercover operation.he said that it was stalcup job to filter dea money to him,but that she was not compliant,and that she had been indicted along with hundreds of others in the county based on his investigation.he also testified he was working undercover as a crooked agent who had shot his partner in los angeles and who had served time in prison for the shooting.when asked about a notation on his dea field report which read,i still working my ass off with the mental health system,john testified i suppose i should blow the cover right now.i the head agent involved in investigating the county mental health system of shasta county.i work for the fbi,united states federal bureau of investigation.i the head agent.i have agents right in this courtroom with me.he maintained it was part of his cover to be on a conservatorship and convince the mental health system he was a schizophrenic.he claimed to have been investigating mental health systems since,both in and out of the military.when asked how his investigation was going at the time of his report,he replied,it was going good.they were convinced i was a schizophrenic.he said it was part of his cover to be conserved.
although he initially acknowledged during examination by county counsel that he suffers from schizophrenia,later in his examination by his attorney,john denied that he was schizophrenic.he said,i do have schizophrenia,let see.i do know.i may have it.i do know.i rather doubt it i f i am a schizophrenia sic,i not a typical schizophrenic.i a very educated,gentlemanly sort of schizophrenic.when his counsel asked whether he agreed there had been times when he was delusional,john said,it depends on the word delusional.a child is delusional when he or she picks up a teddy bear and imagines that that his or her baby or a friend.so i ca really say that it unnatural for me to be delusional,because i never been clinically delusional.
john does not feel he needs drugs to treat his schizophrenia.he testified the haldol and congentin are placebos,according to his last contact with central command and sacramento fbi.he said there was a glitch in the system,and he did not think he was getting placebos now.he believes he gets along fine without his medication.
john denied being drunk while he was at the lorenz,although the eviction letter indicated he had been arrested for being drunk in public.he testified that after leaving the lorenz,he moved to the redding inn and stayed there until he got into an argument with the star team and they him.
a jury found john gravely disabled due to schizophrenia,paranoid subtype.thereafter,the court took additional evidence on the issues of placement,special disabilities and payment of fees.
placement and imposition of special disabilities 
as to placement,mahoney indicated a locked facility often serves as a transition from the hospital,providing a structured environment with supervised medication.mahoney also acknowledged he had previously been too optimistic in expecting john could be released into the community without more structure or assistance.the court ordered that john be placed in a locked facility.
the court received a february,report from mahoney,which it considered when imposing special disabilities.in the report,mahoney opined that john was capable of making his own decisions regarding routine medical care,but not regarding the treatment of his mental illness.mahoney also opined that john could present a danger to the community if he were allowed to possess a firearm or operate a motor vehicle,and the court issued orders prohibiting john from doing so.
order to pay jury fees 
over the public defender statutory,due process and equal protection objections,the court also ordered john to pay in jury fees.the court noted john received per month in maintenance,and per month in veteran benefits and social security.he also reported he had approximately in the bank.the court agreed with the county reasoning that as an lps case this is a civil matter and the welfare and institutions code and probate code indicated that the procedures in the code of civil procedure apply specifically,that the person demanding a jury trial pay for the jury fees.the court indicated that because john had the ability to pay,its ruling was a compromise for not requiring john to pay public defender fees 
discussion 
gravely disabled 
john contends there is not substantial evidence to support the jury finding of grave disability.
in proceedings under the lps act,the public guardian must prove beyond a reasonable doubt that the proposed conservatee is presently gravely disabled.conservatorship of roulet cal d,roulet.as relevant in this case,to establish grave disability,the evidence must support an objective finding that due to mental disorder,a person is unable to provide for his or her basic personal needs for food,clothing,or shelter,subd.h a conservatorship of carol th.we review the record as a whole in the light most favorable to the trial court judgment to determine whether it discloses substantial evidence.substantial evidence,which is evidence that is reasonable,credible,and of solid value,also includes circumstantial evidence.citation.carol,supra,at,citing conservatorship of walker d,walker.
john does not challenge the sufficiency of the evidence that he has a mental disorder.he challenges only the finding that his mental disorder renders him unable to provide for his personal needs for food,clothing and shelter.he argues there is not substantial evidence that he can not eat,dress,or take shelter.
john made it clear he does not believe he needs medication or treatment.and the evidence is clear that without medication,john becomes delusional and psychotic.as a result of not taking his medications,john was hospitalized five times in.as a consequence of john lack of insight into his mental illness and refusal to take his medication,john has exhibited delusional and violent behavior which has led to his eviction from housing,closure of his bank accounts,and denial of services from his payee.as mahoney concluded,his behavior is negatively affecting his ability to manage his money and have housing.indeed,during john testimony,it became clear he believed his conservatorship was really an undercover operation.it was also clear that he had been fixated on obtaining money to purchase drugs as part of his undercover operation,and from this evidence the jury could infer that john delusions would cause him to squander his funds and not provide for his basic personal needs for food,clothing,or shelter.
john relies on conservatorship of smith d,smith to support his claim that he is not gravely disabled as a result of his mental illness.smith is distinguishable.in smith,the treating psychiatrist testified that the proposed conservatee was gravely disabled because her mental disorder caused behavior which brought her into conflict with the community.because of a delusion that she was the only person who could interpret the bible,she had been causing disturbances at a church.id.at.however,the psychiatrist also testified that,despite her disorder,she could feed and clothe herself and provide for her own place to live.ibid.by definition,this meant smith was not gravely disabled,subd.h a.
here,unlike in smith,the mental health expert did not testify that john was capable of taking care of his personal needs for food,clothing,or shelter.in marked contrast to the evidence in smith,mahoney testified that john mental disorder rendered him unable to provide himself food,clothing,or shelter.the other evidence the jury heard supported this conclusion.thus,there is substantial evidence that as a result of his mental disorder john is unable to provide for his basic need for shelter.
ii.special disabilities 
john next contends there is not sufficient evidence to support the imposition of the special disabilities denying him the rights and privileges to possess or carry firearms,possess a driver license,and enter into contracts.
even i f a person is found gravely disabled and a conservatorship is established,the conservatee does not forfeit legal rights or suffer legal disabilities merely by virtue of the disability.walker,supra,d at.conservatorship of george th,george.every institutionalized person is entitled to individualized treatment under the least restrictive conditions feasible the institution should minimize interference with a patient individual autonomy,subds.a,b,g,subds.a,c.foy greenblott d,see id.at,fn.consistent with this goal,t he court must separately determine the duties and powers of the conservator,the disabilities imposed on the conservatee,and the level of placement appropriate for the conservatee.conservatorship of christopher th,christopher.the conservatee retains the rights and privileges covered by the special disabilities unless the court,after making separate findings of incapacity to support the imposition of the special disabilities,imposes those disabilities and confers corresponding authority on the conservator.george,supra,th at riese mary hospital medical center d.the party seeking conservatorship has the burden of producing evidence to support the disabilities sought,the placement and the powers of the conservator,and the conservatee may produce evidence in rebuttal.christopher,supra,th at.in other words,there must be evidence in the record to support each of the special disabilities imposed.see george,supra,th at.
section allows a court to impose special disabilities on a conservatee.while the trial court must separately determine the disabilities imposed on the conservatee christopher,supra,th at,a specific,statement of the reasons for each disability imposed is not required george,supra,th at.instead,we follow the usual rules on appeal and review the record as a whole in the light most favorable to the trial court judgment to determine whether it discloses substantial evidence.walker,supra,d at.the trial court is entitled to draw inferences relevant to the special disabilities from general testimony presented about the conservatee condition.if,based on testimony about the conservatee mental and emotional state,the trial court concludes that it would be appropriate to impose the special disabilities,the decision will not be reversed solely because a testifying expert did not expressly address the disabilities.see,george,supra,th at.for the reasons set forth below,we find substantial evidence to support the imposition of each disability.
right to possess a firearm 
to support a limitation on a conservatee ability to possess a firearm or deadly weapon,the court must find that possession of a firearm or any other deadly weapon by the person would present a danger to the safety of the person or to others,subd.e.john argues the court made no such finding.however,by imposing the disability,it is clear the court impliedly so found.when viewed in the light most favorable to the judgment,the implied finding is supported by substantial evidence.
john had delusions he was a law enforcement officer involved in undercover drug operations.he made threats to star team personnel,including a threat to slit the throat of his primary service coordinator.he threatened smith,the operations manager of the christian church homes,with a cane,and she stated he was the most frightening tenant she had had in years.mahoney opined that john could be a danger to himself or the community if he were allowed to possess a firearm.this was substantial evidence from which the trial court could conclude john could not safely possess a firearm.
right to possess a driver license 
the overriding concern in the issuance of a driver licenses is generally whether the person is able to operate a motor vehicle safely,subd.g,subd.d,subd.c people superior court wilson th.mental disorders may affect a person ability to exercise reasonable and ordinary control in operating a motor vehicle,subd.g,and may be the basis for refusing that person a driver license,subd.c.john delusions of being involved in undercover law enforcement work and his violent tendencies could put him and others at risk if he were permitted to operate a vehicle.mahoney opined that john could present a danger if allowed to operate a motor vehicle.this was substantial evidence supporting the conclusion john could not operate a motor vehicle safely.
right to contract 
under civil code section,persons of unsound mind are not capable of entering into contracts.there are essentially three classifications of incapacity based on an unsound mind entirely without understanding,unsound but not entirely without understanding,and susceptible to undue influence,smalley baker d.here,the evidence demonstrates john is of unsound mind,although not entirely without understanding.john suffers from various delusions,which have included believing he is the angel gabriel,he is pregnant,and more recently,simultaneously working for numerous law enforcement agencies doing undercover work investigating the mental health system and drug operations.his inability to manage his finances appropriately,his belief that the funds in his account were filtered to him for the purpose of purchasing drugs as part of his undercover operation,his insistence that he be provided that money,and his lack of understanding that he is precluded from directly withdrawing funds from his bank account are all further evidence that he lacks understanding about his financial situation.this is substantial evidence supporting the denial of his right to contract.see george,supra,th at.
iii.jury fees 
john contends that the trial court erred in requiring him to pay jury fees.the county contends,there is no reason that john should burden the taxpayers with jury fees for a trial which he demanded.this is especially the case when,as here,john has the funds to pay for the services he has requested.john,according to the county,should be required to pay the same fees as any civil litigant who requests a jury trial.on this point,we disagree with the county.
the county argument is based on its reading of welfare and institutions code section,probate code section,and code of civil procedure section.citing what the county calls the pertinent part of welfare and institutions code section,it notes that section reads in part,the procedure for establishing,administering and terminating a conservatorship under this chapter shall be the same as that provided in division commencing with section of the probate code division of the probate code is the guardianship conservatorship law and governs the appointment of conservators of the person for adults who for any reason are incapable of taking care of themselves.citation.conservatorship of john cal th,john.probate code section states,the court shall hear and determine the matter of the establishment of the conservatorship according to the law and procedure relating to the trial of civil actions,including trial by jury if demanded by the proposed conservatee.code of civil procedure former section required that a party demanding a jury trial deposit jury fees in advance of trial and provided that the failure to do so resulted in a waiver trial by jury 
there are exceptions to the general rule in welfare and institutions code section that the procedures to be used in lps proceedings shall be the same as for establishing,administering,and terminating probate conservatorships and the concomitant application of the code of civil procedure.the exception in section,subdivision d relates specifically to lps act jury trials.the pertinent part of section reads more fully,the procedure for establishing,administering,and terminating a conservatorship under this chapter shall be the same as that provided in division commencing with section of the probate code,except as follows d the person for whom conservatorship is sought shall have the right to demand a court or jury trial on the issue whether he or she is gravely disabled.demand for court or jury trial shall be made within five days following the hearing on the conservatorship petition court or jury trial shall commence within days of the date of the demand,except that the court shall continue the trial date for a period not to exceed days upon the request of counsel for the proposed conservatee.italics added.in our view,by this exception in the lps act,the legislature has provided a procedure for demanding a jury trial in lps conservatorship cases and thus,expressly excluded such cases from the provisions of code of civil procedure section.and the express exception in subdivision d of section makes no mention of any provision for the payment of jury fees nor does it make a proposed conservatee right to a jury contingent upon the payment or deposit of such fees.
that code of civil procedure former section has no application to the procedure for demanding lps conservatorship jury trials is evident when one looks at the deadline by which a party was required to post the advance fee subdivision b of code of civil procedure former section expressly required that the advance fee be deposited at least calendar days before the date initially set for trial.see fn,ante.lps conservatorships follow an entirely different timeline than general civil matters,and the requirement that the lps jury trial commence within days of the demand for jury trial is inconsistent with the calendar day deadline for posting the advance jury fee in code of civil procedure former section,subdivision b.moreover,unlike unlawful detainer actions,which also have shorter timelines than general civil matters,no exception can be found for lps conservatorship petitions in code of civil procedure former section had the legislature intended to require prospective lps conservatees to post jury fees,it would have been a simple matter for the legislature to include an exception to the general deadline rule consistent with deadlines in lps matters,but it did not and this omission is telling.we conclude that the legislature did not intend the code of civil procedure section requirements for posting jury fees to apply to persons who are the subject of an lps petition for conservatorship.
we find no other statutory basis for requiring an lps conservatee to pay jury fees before,during or after his or her trial has been completed.as with other distinctions between an lps conservatorship and a probate conservatorship,we believe there is good reason for this distinction.while lps conservatorship proceedings may be initiated only by an conservatorship investigator welf,private parties,such as the proposed conservatee himself or herself,his or her spouse or domestic partner,a relative,friend or other interested person have standing to file a petition for a probate conservatorship,subd.a john,supra,cal th at.government need not be involved in a probate conservatorship.and u nlike an lps conservatorship,a probate conservatorship does not depend on a showing of grave disability resulting from a mental disorder,and involuntary commitment is not contemplated.john,supra,cal th at.indeed,while an lps conservatorship is civil in nature,the prospect of the loss of liberty and the lasting stigma on the conservatee reputation requires some of the same powerful safeguards that are provided to criminal defendants.conservatorship of ben.cal th,ben.a proposed conservatee has a right to a jury trial the party seeking imposition of an lps conservatorship must prove the proposed conservatee grave disability beyond a reasonable doubt and the jury verdict must be unanimous.roulet,supra,cal d at.
moreover,the lps act promotes more than private interests.in addition to guarding the rights of proposed conservatees and those who are involuntarily committed and advancing the goal of providing appropriate treatment to such persons,substantial public interests are promoted by the lps act,including ending the inappropriate and indefinite commitment of the mentally ill and guaranteeing and protecting public safety.john,supra,cal th at ben,supra,cal th
