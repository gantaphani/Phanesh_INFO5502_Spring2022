although this is an appeal from an order of the probate court,it relates to three different actions the probate action,a negligence action against the administrator of the estate of the deceased,and a bad faith action against travelers property casualty insurance company for refusing to defend the administrator in the negligence action and indemnify the administrator for the judgment in the negligence action.travelers seeks to assert,as a defense in the bad faith action,that the failure of the plaintiffs in the negligence action to file a timely claim with the estate barred relief in that action and recovery against travelers in the bad faith action.the court in the bad faith action referred the question to the probate court,and the probate court held that travelers is estopped from asserting that no timely claim was filed.travelers appeals from the probate court order.
we affirm.we conclude that travelers had standing to appear in the probate action,travelers is estopped from asserting that the failure of the plaintiffs in the negligence action to file a timely probate claim bars relief against travelers in the bad faith action,and provisions of the probate code do not limit damages in the bad faith action to the insurance coverage limits.
procedural background 
as noted,this appeal relates to three different final and two still pending the probate of the estate of angela prindle,the negligence action now final by jessica harris and her daughters collectively,harris against the administrator of the estate,and the action of harris and the administrator against travelers for bad faith denial of insurance coverage.after summarizing each action,we detail the proceedings in the trial court that directly led to this appeal.
estate of angela prindle probate action 
in may,darrel prindle entered the home of angela prindle,his estranged wife.he shot and killed angela.he also shot angela sister jessica harris and jessica daughter crystal perkins.jessica other daughter christine perkins was present but was not injured.
in july,earline harris the mother of angela prindle and jessica harris filed a petition for probate of the estate of angela prindle.the probate court appointed earline harris as administrator of the estate.we refer to earline harris,hereafter,as the administrator,to avoid confusing her with her daughter jessica harris,to whom we refer as harris.in november,the estate gave notice to angela prindle creditors that claims against the estate must be filed by january.
in january,the net assets of the estate were estimated at.neither the administrator nor counsel for the estate had yet been paid.
harris prindle negligence action 
harris sued darrel prindle and the administrator on may,after the time for filing creditor claims against the estate had expired harris alleged that angela prindle was negligent in failing to warn harris that darrel prindle would return to the residence.
the administrator informed travelers of the negligence action and asked travelers to provide a defense.harris made a demand to travelers for the policy limits.travelers responded by denying coverage and refusing to defend the estate.it stated that the policy applied to accidental conduct,not intentional conduct.it also stated that coverage was excluded under the terms of the policy,which stated that the policy did not cover injury or damage which is expected or intended by any insured.underscoring in original.
the administrator answered the complaint,and a court trial was held.the court judge richard park issued a statement of decision and entered judgment.it found the estate liable to harris for negligence in the amount of about million.
the administrator assigned to harris the estate assignable rights against travelers for failure to defend and indemnify the administrator in the negligence action.in exchange for this assignment,harris agreed not to execute on the judgment against the administrator.
harris travelers bad faith action 
harris and the administrator sued travelers,alleging breach of the insurance contract,breach of the implied covenant of good faith and fair dealing bad faith,and breach of fiduciary duties.the allegation that travelers acted in bad faith could expose it to liability for the full amount of the judgment against the administrator about million,not just the policy limits,because an insurer that breaches its duty of good faith and fair dealing may be held liable for the full amount of the judgment against the insured,even beyond the policy limits.kransco american empire surplus lines ins.cal th,d.
trial court proceedings leading to this appeal 
on april,harris filed a belated creditor claim against the estate,claiming about million plus interest pursuant to the judgment in the negligence case.
in the bad faith action,travelers filed a motion for summary judgment,making two arguments.first,it asserted that the policy exclusion for intentional acts of the insured precluded coverage for the actions of darrel prindle.and second,it argued that harris failed to file a timely creditor claim against the estate and therefore the estate was never in danger of a judgment in the negligence action exceeding the limits of the insurance policy.the trial court judge shelleyanne chang denied the motion for summary judgment.concerning the former assertion,the trial court found there was sufficient evidence to overcome the summary judgment motion because there was evidence that darrel was not an insured under the policy.as to the latter issue,the court stated that the validity of the creditor claim filed by harris would have to be determined by the probate court.
on august,travelers filed,in the probate action,a petition to remove the administrator and determine that harris creditor claim was invalid.the administrator demurred to the petition,asserting that travelers did not have standing to bring it.the administrator also attempted to approve harris belated creditor claim against the estate without first petitioning the court to allow the filing of a late claim under probate code section.
the probate court judge charles kobayashi overruled the demurrer.it ruled that travelers has standing because it is an interested person,pursuant to probate code section,because of the financial impact a ruling in the probate court could have on travelers.the court ordered the administrator to file and serve an appropriate response to travelers petition.the court also ordered the administrator to file and serve a petition to allow the filing of harris late claim.
harris filed a petition to allow her to file her late claim against the estate.in addition to harris petition,the administrator filed a response to travelers petition and a petition for approval of harris late claim.in the latter document,the administrator asked the probate court to approve the of harris creditor claim or,in the alternative,determine and declare that the requirement was properly waived in this case by the administrator or,as a further alternative,that all parties are estopped to raise the requirement as a means of attacking the final judgment in the negligence action.
travelers responded to each of these filings.
the probate court judge thomas cecil denied the petition to remove the administrator and,as to the late claim,ruled as follows 
a timely claim against the estate was not filed by any of these claimants.see probate code sections.however,under the circumstances presented,it is appropriate to find the conduct of the administrator a waiver and to estop this failure from being raised as a defense to the potential liability of travelers.it would be both inequitable and unreasonable to allow travelers to assert a defense to the claim that is not available to the estate itself the late claim shall not be accepted,but the absence of the claim is no longer deemed to be relevant to the issue before the court.
discussion 
itravelers standing 
the administrator and harris contend that the probate court abused its discretion in determining that travelers had standing to petition the probate court to remove the administrator and determine that harris claim is invalid.we conclude that the court did not abuse its discretion.
probate code section allows any interested person to petition the probate court to direct the personal representative to act or not to act concerning the estate.probate code section defines interested person.subdivision a of probate code section provides a list of interested persons,such as heirs,spouses,and children.travelers does not contend that it qualifies as an interested person under that subdivision.however,subdivision b of probate code section is broader.it states the meaning of interested person as it relates to particular persons may vary from time to time and shall be determined according to the particular purposes of,and matter involved in,any proceeding.
subdivision a of section does not purport to provide an exclusive list of recognizable interests.rather,it permits the court to designate as an interested person anyone having an interest in an estate which may be affected by a probate proceeding.subdivision b allows the court to determine the sufficiency of that party interest for the purposes of each proceeding conducted.thus,a party may qualify as an interested person entitled to participate for purposes of one proceeding but not for another.estate of davis d.
examples of the flexibility given to the probate court in determining whether a party is an interested person include estate of davis,supra,d,in which the court determined that a probate administrator surety may be an interested person,and estate of maniscalco th,d,in which a prospective bidder on estate property who failed to attend a confirmation hearing,having no other preexisting relationship to the estate or to the property,was found by the court to be an interested party.
because the determination of whether a party is an interested person pursuant to probate code section is subject to the probate court discretion,we apply the deferential abuse of discretion standard in reviewing the determination.estate of maniscalco,supra,th at,d.
the probate court analyzed travelers standing as follows here the administrator is attempting to allow a creditors claim which may be invalid and time barred under the statute without obtaining court approval with respect to the filing of that late claim.if this late claim is allowed to proceed,travelers could be held liable for a judgment in excess of for harris.on the other hand,if the claim is not allowed,travelers may be liable only to the extent of the under the terms of the homeowners insurance policy.in that regard,travelers may be bound by the trial court judgment to the extent of under probate code section in the absence of fraud or collusion.citation.in either event,travelers would be financially impacted,thereby falling within the definition of an interested party.
having found that the result of the proceedings could affect travelers financially,the probate court did not abuse its discretion in determining that travelers is an interested person pursuant to probate code section,subdivision b.
acknowledging the broad reach of probate code section,the administrator and harris assert that travelers should be denied standing in the probate action because it refused to defend the administrator in the negligence action.in support,harris cites tomassi scarff th,d.in that case,an insurer denied coverage and refused to defend in a tort action.judgment was entered against the insured,and the insurer moved to vacate the judgment pursuant to code of civil procedure section,asserting that the court legal conclusions were not supported by the facts.the court,however,concluded that the insurer was not a party aggrieved,as required by code of civil procedure section.the court of appeal affirmed.tomassi scarff,supra,at,d.
tomassi scarff,applying the aggrieved party standard of code of civil procedure section,is inapplicable to this case,in which we apply the interested person standard of probate code section.code of civil procedure section requires that an aggrieved party have a direct and immediate interest in the judgment being challenged.tomassi scarff,supra,th at,d.unlike the aggrieved party standard,however,the interested person standard of probate code section confers standing on anyone having an interest in an estate which may be affected by a probate proceeding.estate of davis,supra,d at.travelers undoubtedly has an interest that may be affected.
therefore,the argument of the administrator and harris that the probate court abused its discretion in determining that travelers has standing is without merit.
travelers contends the probate court erred in determining that the administrator and travelers are estopped from asserting that the failure of the plaintiffs in the negligence action to file a timely probate claim bars relief against travelers in the bad faith action we disagree.the finding that the administrator is estopped from relying on harris failure to file a timely creditor claim was correct,and absent a showing of collusion,which must be made if at all in the bad faith action,travelers is bound by the outcome of the negligence action.
legal background 
satterfield garmire 
under some circumstances,an estate may be estopped from arguing that a creditor failed to file a timely claim.in satterfield garmire cal d,satterfield,the plaintiff injured by the negligence of the decedent filed an action against the executor of the estate before the period for filing a claim in the probate action had expired.it was conceded that the decedent caused the accident,and the only dispute concerned the amount of the claim.the executor original answer did not assert the failure to file a claim as a defense.and the decedent insurance was sufficient to cover the claim.therefore,no substantial benefit would be relinquished by the heirs.after the time for filing a claim in the probate action had passed,the executor demurred based on the failure to file a claim.the trial court sustained the demurrer without leave to amend and dismissed the action.the supreme court reversed.it held g enerally it is not within the authority of an executor or administrator to waive formal presentation of a claim.but we conclude he may do so where this congeries of circumstances exists prior to the expiration of the period for filing a claim he has knowledge of the claim and concedes its merit save only as to the specific sum the estate is protected by insurance coverage exceeding the amount of the claim and waiver results in relinquishment of no substantial benefit of or causes no detriment to the heirs or legatees.id.at.
statutes authorizing action up to insurance limit 
after satterfield was decided,the legislature enacted former probate code section providing that a probate claim was not required to maintain a civil action for an obligation of the decedent to the extent it is covered by the decedent liability insurance.stats,ch.the provisions of that section were later moved to another part of the probate code,et and,but the effect is still the same.varney superior court th,fn,d.
probate code section,subdivision a provides subject to the provisions of this chapter,an action to establish the decedent liability for which the decedent was protected by insurance may be commenced or continued against the decedent estate without the need to join as a party the decedent personal representative or successor in interest.an action under probate code section shall name as the defendant,estate of name of decedent,deceased.summons shall be served on a person designated in writing by the insurer or,if none,on the insurer.further proceedings shall be in the name of the estate,but otherwise shall be conducted in the same manner as if the action were against the personal representative,subd.a.unless the personal representative is joined as a party,a judgment in the action under probate code section does not adjudicate rights by or against the estate.furthermore,unless the personal representative is joined and the plaintiff files a creditor claim against the estate,the judgment in an action under probate code section can not exceed the limits of the insurance coverage.finally,subdivision b of probate code section states the remedy provided in this chapter i
