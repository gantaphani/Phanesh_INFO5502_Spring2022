plaintiff paul butt,contends that defendant bank of america,has breached its fiduciary duty to him as trustee of a trust created in to administer a new mexico oil and gas lease.the district court dismissed butt complaint,finding that the bank never assumed trusteeship and therefore had no fiduciary duty.we find that the trust did not survive the death of its original trustee,and thus agree with the district court conclusion that the bank does not serve,and never has served,as trustee on butt behalf.we reverse,however,the district court judgment that it need not conclusively find whether the bank acted adversely to butt interest in specific transactions.as to those specific transactions,which we outline below,we remand for consideration of butt request for an accounting and imposition of a constructive trust.
background 
a.a brief history of oil and gas lease no.
on april,the state of new mexico issued oil and gas lease no.the lease to frederick luthy for the purposes of exploring for,developing,and producing oil and gas in lands located in lea county.according to the parties,new mexico law permitted legal title for the lease to issue only in one person name,but per a prior agreement,each of three men held a interest in it luthy,paul butt,and buckley.over the years,those interests were devised,inherited,and sold such that paul butt,butt now owns his father third,three different parties own equal portions of luthy original third,and two different parties own equal portions of buckley original third.because of new mexico single policy,however,bank of america,trustee of luthy testamentary actual title to the lease,which apparently still bears luthy name the dispute we encounter is between butt and the bank over the bank role as title holder of the lease following luthy death.
on april,luthy executed a declaration of trust,which identified the lease as the corpus and named him as trustee.under the terms of the document,luthy was to have absolute control over the lease and was to periodically disburse profits to the beneficiaries.the document did not identify a successor trustee or establish any means for appointing one 
paul butt,passed on in,whereupon appellant paul butt,acquired his interest in the lease.on december,luthy,butt,and the president of defiance coal signed an affidavit setting forth historical facts relating to the acquisition and management of the lease.in the affidavit,the parties identified the entity as a syndicate and agreed that they had delegated full and complete power of disposition regarding the lease to luthy.app.vol.i,at.the law firm that represented the entity at the time treated it as a joint venture and as a partnership for tax purposes.
luthy died on january.his will named albuquerque national bank as executor of his estate and as trustee of his testamentary trust.one of the assets included in luthy estate was his interest in the lease.the bank,in its capacity as luthy testamentary trustee,pays annual rents due under the lease and generally obtains reimbursement from the other interest holders 
the evidence presented to the district court revealed a series of transactions that the parties engaged in with respect to the lease over the years.the district court order identified these transactions by reference to tract numbers,which correspond to the line numbers on the original lease.see dist.mem.app.vol.i,at for ease of reference,we adopt the same designations.
the humble oil assignment tracts,and 
on may,the bank,luthy widow,defiance coal,and butt sent a letter to humble oil refining company offering to sell mineral interests in six tracts covered by the lease.the offer letter stated that the estate of frederick luthy,now deceased,has the entire official title to said land but that the leasehold interest is actually owned by paul butt,by defiance coal company,and by the estate of frederick luthy,deceased.app.vol.ii,at.the letter also indicated that,in return for the assignment,the luthy and defiance interests would receive production payments while the butt interest reserved an overriding royalty interest.humble oil accepted the offer on may.
on june,humble oil obtained a title opinion letter from the law firm of hervey,dow hinkle.the authoring attorney advised that since luthy is now deceased his power of control and sale has now ceased and it is not vested in his heirs or devisees.id.at.instead,the interests were titles in real property and not merely contract rights to profits.id.in subsequent correspondence,the attorney further opined 
i suppose that the trust which luthy had in mind when he made his affidavit of december,and the unrecorded trust dated april,terminated when he died,and that it may be that upon the death of luthy this became a dry trust and the legal title would go over to the beneficiaries under the statutes of uses 
on october,butt,by separate instrument,conveyed his interest in the six tracts to humble oil in exchange for.
the rankin farmout tract 
a few months prior to his death,luthy executed a farmout agreement with mann rankin for a single tract covered by the lease.on november,rankin law firm sent him a letter questioning luthy authority as trustee or agent for butt and defiance and advising rankin to either have the latter two parties ratify the farmout agreement or acknowledge the power of luthy to act on their behalf with respect to the lease.id.at.as noted above,luthy perished in january,in the midst of these dealings.on october,rankin executed an assignment of overriding royalty interest,which acknowledged that he had been assigned the leasehold as to tract on october.in consideration of that assignment,rankin conveyed a ten percent overriding royalty interest and specified that the conveyance was a interest to each of butt,defiance coal,and the bank as executor of luthy estate.
the turner farmout tracts and 
in may,luthy offered to assign two tracts covered by the lease to charles turner,with drilling to commence on or before june.after luthy death,the bank,luthy,butt,and defiance coal reaffirmed the a later drilling a letter signed by each of them.turner accepted the offer.
two other transactions related to this farmout occurred over the next year,each with the individual written assent of the bank,luthy,butt,and defiance coal.in february,the parties executed a letter amending the farmout per turner request.in july,the parties executed a new offer to turner,which he accepted.
two years later,the parties engaged in further dealings with turner.in september,turner wrote a letter to a trust officer at the bank in which he reported that he had discussed a trade with paul butt,on acreage owned by the luthy group.id.at.on october,the bank,in its capacity as executor and testamentary trustee of the luthy estate,independently assigned the entire interest in tracts and to turner in return,turner assigned an overriding royalty to the bank equal to of all production.this transaction ignored the beneficial interest holders but,on may,they ratified it by signing a ratification and amendment to agreement stating,in part 
whereas,prior to the assignment to turner,the bank owned official legal record title to the lease,but the equitable or beneficial title to the lease was actually owned an sic undivided interest each by said bank,defiance,and butt,and said mapel formerly cyrene luthy as her community property owned of the beneficial interest of the bank,and said defiance,butt and mapel did not sign or ratify said assignment by the bank to turner and they now desire to correct said matter 
now,therefore,defiance,butt and mapel hereby adopt,ratify and confirm said assignment dated october,and do hereby convey all of their title in said lease as to said land to charles turner 
id.at.in addition,the document assigned to each of the beneficial owners a share of the overriding royalty interests in production occurring on the tracts.
the machris assignment tract 
on october,fred and cyrene luthy assigned to machris the interest in tract of the lease in return,machris and his wife assigned to luthy a overriding royalty interest in production on the tract.on may,cities service oil buyer from machris of gas produced from tract a division order for signature by the bank indicating that the bank was the owner of a overriding royalty interest in tract the record copy of the order does not contain a signature for the bank.similarly,on may,warren petroleum machris a division order for signature by the bank indicating that the bank was the owner of a overriding royalty interest in the tract.again,the record copy of the order does not contain a signature for the bank.
the pauley petroleum assignment tract 
in october,the bank,in its capacity as executor and testamentary trustee of luthy estate,assigned the entire interest in tract to pauley petroleum company.in return,pauley petroleum assigned a overriding royalty interest in production from the tract to the bank as executor and testamentary trustee of the luthy estate.neither assignment mentioned the other beneficial interest holders in the lease.the record does not contain any further evidence of activity with regard to tract until,when butt executed a term assignment of his interest in the tract to logro corporation,with a reservation of an overriding royalty interest.
the shell oil assignment tract 
on june,the bank wrote a letter to shell oil company regarding tract of the lease.in the letter,the bank explained that it had not executed a requested transfer order pertaining to the tract because the order assumed that the luthy estate owned a interest of the working interest of the state a lea county,new mexico lease.id.at.the bank explained that the luthy estate in reality owned only a interest in the of the working interest.luthy was an equal partner in the partnership.thus,his interest was only rather than the whole thereof.id.in march of the following year,shell executed a division order that reflected the separate interests of the beneficial interest holders in tract.each owner,including butt,signed the order.
in may,butt communicated directly with shell regarding his interest in tract and requested that the company send future checks and correspondence regarding the tract directly to him.shell agreed,and the record demonstrates that the company sent irs form reflecting royalty payments directly to butt for tax year.
other transactions by butt 
butt also approved a series of other transactions with regard to his interest in the lease.on december,he assigned his interest in tract to hng oil company.on january,butt conveyed his interest in tract to the permian basin acquisition fund.on october,butt assigned his interest in tract to logro corporation and granted an extension of that assignment on october.on january,butt assigned his interest in tract to the rio pecos corporation.
b.the lawsuit 
in late,butt sued the bank in new mexico state court.his complaint took the form of a petition for accounting and other relief,and alleged that he was a beneficial owner of the lease,which was held in trust by the bank.butt requested a full accounting of all royalty income and other profits paid to the bank,and requested that the bank remit to him any payments due,including interest.
after the bank removed the case to federal court on diversity grounds,butt filed an amended complaint in which he enunciated two distinct of contract and breach of fiduciary duty.the bank moved for summary judgment,contending that butt claims are time barred by the statute of limitations and the doctrine of laches.the bank also argued that no fiduciary relationship existed between it and butt and,even if there were such a relationship,no breach occurred.lastly,the bank argued that summary judgment was appropriate on the contract claim because no contract existed even if one did exist,it was void and if it were not void,no breach occurred.
on july,the district court granted in part and denied in part the bank motion for summary judgment.with respect to the statute of limitations argument,the court held that the clock in new mexico does not begin to tick until a claimant has discovered or should have discovered his right of action.the court found that,in this case,a genuine question of fact existed as to this issue.with respect to the laches argument,the court also found a disputed issue of material,whether and when butt had notice of the conduct giving rise to the complaint.with respect to whether a trust relationship existed between the bank and butt,the court found that a genuine dispute existed as to whether the bank undertook the role of trustee for the benefit of butt and thus denied summary judgment on this ground as well.the court granted summary judgement,however,as to the contract claim.the court found that because the basis of butt claim is an alleged oral promise made by luthy to protect and manage butt interest in the lease,the claim was barred by the new mexico statute of frauds.
the district court ordered a bifurcated trial for the remaining fiduciary duty claim a bench trial to determine whether a trust relationship existed,and,if necessary,a jury trial to determine whether a breach of duty occurred.following the bench trial,the court issued a detailed order dismissing with prejudice butt remaining claim.in the order,the court set out,as factual findings,the history of the lease recounted above.the court also found,with respect to the humble oil assignment,that butt exercised independent control over the assignment of his interests in tracts,and.with respect to the rankin farmout,the court found that butt was directly assigned of the total overriding royalty interest.with respect to the turner farmout,the court found that butt independently engaged in negotiations.with respect to the turner farmout,the machris assignment,and the pauley petroleum assignment,the court found that the bank may have acted adversely to butt interests,but that determinative findings were unnecessary given the court ultimate disposition of the case.and with respect to the shell oil assignment,the court found that butt was recognized in as legal owner of of the interest owned by the venture and that royalty payments were made directly to butt,the taxes for which he has been directly responsible moreover,the court characterized butt assignments to the hng oil company,the permian basin acquisition fund,the logro corporation,and the rio pecos corporation as independent transactions.the court also found no evidence that the bank was ever appointed to serve as trustee for the lease or butt,noting that the declaration of trust did not name a successor trustee,that the bank was never designated to serve in any fiduciary capacity for butt,and that the bank never affirmatively agreed to serve as trustee for butt.
turning to the legal questions in the case,the court applied the new mexico uniform trust code utc,stat.ann.through,a comprehensive statute enacted in and made retroactive by its own terms.the court held that,under the utc,the death of a trustee results in a vacancy that must be filled,either by a successor designated in the trust,by a replacement unanimously appointed by the trust beneficiaries,or by an appointee of the court.the district court assumed,without deciding,that luthy,while alive,served as trustee for the lease.the court further assumed that the trust did not fail upon his death and was thus absent a trustee upon that instance.finding that the trust made no provision for a successor trustee and that neither the beneficiaries nor a court ever appointed a successor trustee the district court held that the bank never served as trustee for the lease and that n o special relationship giving rise to a fiduciary duty existed at any time between the bank and paul butt dist.mem.the court thus dismissed butt action.
butt timely appealed.
ii.discussion 
it is important to distinguish between two different possible claims regarding a trust in this case.in accordance with state law requiring that legal title to an oil and gas lease issue only in one person name the title to lease no.was issued in the name of frederick luthy.so far as appears from the record,the lease still bears luthy name.app.vol.i,at.to maintain the lease,annual taxes and rentals must be paid to the state.it is undisputed that the bank has performed these functions over the years.
in addition,as a result of an express original agreement among the three owners of the lease,luthy was given complete control and final decision in all matters pertaining to the handling of said lease.id.at.this agreement was formally memorialized in a declaration of trust executed in.
we do not understand the parties to be arguing,and in any event would not conclude,that record title holder of an oil and gas lease under new mexico law is a trustee for the actual owners in the sense relevant to this case.if it were not for the original agreement and the later declaration of trust,luthy would not have had unilateral authority to engage in financial transactions and sign deals with regard to the lease,and would have had no concomitant fiduciary duties to the other interest holders.the real question in this case pertains to the express trust,and specifically whether the bank is a successor trustee to luthy.the district court held that it is not.
butt argues that the district court applied the wrong law in this case and,consequently,erred in determining that the bank does not serve as trustee of the lease property for his benefit.he maintains that under the properly applicable mexico trust law as it existed either at the time of the formation of the trust or at the time of luthy bank automatically acceded to trusteeship upon luthy death.in the alternative,butt argues that the bank acted against his interest in the lease and therefore holds profits from those actions in a constructive trust 
is the bank a trustee under new mexico law 
application of the uniform trust code 
when exercising diversity jurisdiction,we apply state law with the objective of obtaining the result that would be reached in state court.perlmutter gypsum,cir.the district court correctly turned its attention to new mexico uniform trust code,stat.ann.through,which went into effect during the pendency of this action.laws,ch.the utc applies to all trusts created before,on or after its effective date,stat.ann.a,and to judicial proceedings concerning trusts commenced before its effective date,unless the court finds that application of a particular provision of the utc would prejudice the rights of the parties,in which case the particular provision of the utc does not apply and the superseded law applies,id.a.except to the extent the utc or other new mexico statutes modify it,t he common law of trusts and principles of equity supplement the utc.id.
we assume,as did the district court,that the declaration of trust created a valid trust with luthy as the trustee and paul butt,as one of the beneficiaries.when butt the elder passed on,butt the younger inherited his beneficial interest.if we were also to assume,as the did the district court,that the trust did not fail upon luthy death,then upon that instance a vacancy in the trusteeship occur red.id.a a vacancy in a trusteeship occurs if a trustee dies.the utc provides that a vacancy in a trusteeship must be filled if the trust has no remaining trustee,id.b,in the following order of priority by a person designated in the terms of the trust to act as successor trustee by a person appointed by unanimous agreement of the qualified beneficiaries or by a person appointed by the court,id.at c.the district court found that none of these methods of appointment occurred at any time following luthy death and therefore held that the bank never assumed trusteeship and had no fiduciary duty to butt.
carrying forward the assumption that the trust survived luthy death,nothing in the record conflicts with the district court ultimate factual finding at no time were any of the proper means of appointing a successor trustee under the utc pursued by any party to this relationship.butt is surely correct,however,that if under new mexico law in when the trust was created or when luthy died the bank would have automatically acceded to trusteeship,then the district court legal conclusion was erroneous.the utc,after all,explicitly states that where its application would prejudice the parties,superceded law applies.id.a.and if prior law would have rendered the bank a fiduciary of butt,then the utc nullification of that status would certainly be prejudicial to the trust beneficiaries.but butt fails to direct to us to any law,extant at the time of the formation of the trust or luthy death,that supports his assertions.instead,he reproduces a hodgepodge of provisions from new mexico code,none of which shed even the faintest light on the questions in this case nor has our independent review of new mexico law uncovered any statutory or case law that is contrary to the provisions of the utc.indeed,it appears that the utc,rather than contracting the methods by which a successor trustee may be appointed,expanded the options available under prior law.compare restatement second of trusts providing for appointment of a new trustee by a proper court or by the person,if any,who by the terms of the trust is authorized to appoint a trustee with stat.ann.c providing for appointment of a new trustee to a vacant trusteeship by the court,by a person designated in the terms of the trust to act as successor trustee,or by a person appointed by unanimous agreement of the qualified beneficiaries.consequently,we find no merit to butt argument that trust law from years gone by renders his fiduciary duty claim any more sound that it appears under the utc.
but even accepting that the bank never acceded to trusteeship,the district court analytical stopping point is a curious one.if the trust marched on into the future but no trustee administered it,what then was the status of the trust these past years the utc provides no answer to this question,nor,it appears,does new mexico case law.a generally accepted common law principle,which supplements the utc,see stat.ann,instructs that u pon the death of a sole trustee who has devised or bequeathed the trust property,the title to the trust property passes subject to the trust to the devisee or legatee,unless it is otherwise provided by the terms of the trust.restatement second of trusts see also george gleason bogert et,bogert trusts and trustees ed collecting cases.but the devisee is not permitted to administer the trust unless by the terms of the trust he is so authorized,and if he is not so authorized,a new trustee will be appointed.restatement second of trusts cmt.perhaps the bank,as testamentary trustee of the luthy estate,obtained title to the trust property but not authority to administer the trust.this is a puzzle,like a car without a driver.we believe the simpler and more straightforward way to analyze this case is to conclude that the trust terminated at luthy death.
the trustee power was personal to luthy.
although,as a general rule,trusts do not fail upon the death of a trustee,a settlor may manifest an intention that the trust continue only for as long as a particular person serves as trustee.in this case,the rule that a court will appoint a substitute or successor trustee does not apply.restatement third of trusts cmt.b see also in re doe will,if upon such construction of the instrument it appears that a power lodged with the trustees in connection with the trust is a special confidence reposed in this particular trustee or set of trustees,or is to be exercised only upon his or their personal judgment or discretion,such power can only be exercised by the designated trustee and will not pass to a substituted trustee.internal quotation marks and citation omitted bogert et,supra,the death of a sole or surviving trustee does not terminate the trust,unless the settlor has manifested an intention that the trust shall be personal to the particular trustee emphasis added 
after trial,the district court issued a detailed set of factual findings,none of which are challenged on appeal.based on these findings,we conclude that when luthy declared the trust,the powers of trusteeship were meant to be personal to him.in the trust instrument itself,luthy stated that the three original parties to the lease operation agreed that i was to have complete control and final decision in all matters pertaining to the handling of said lease.app.vol.i,at.no provision was made for successor trustees and the emphasis throughout the instrument is on luthy personal and complete control over the handling of the lease.see dist.mem.rogers,at finding that language in a will makes the judgment and discretion of the named trustee absolutely essential to the creation of the trust,and noting that t his is when it is noted that the testatrix makes no provision whatsoever for any failure by death or otherwise of the trustee to act schloss,at finding that a settlor created a trust to secure for himself the counsel and guidance of his brother as trustee and finding nothing in the trust instrument which even tends to indicate that,in the event of the trustee death or disability,any other person was to succeed him as trustee.luthy was not charged with mere ministerial matters as trustee,but rather with exercising his particular business judgment in initiating,negotiating,and finalizing a wide array of complex oil and gas transactions under the lease.see french trust,as a general rule,where a power is discretionary,and of a kind that indicates personal confidence in the one selected to exercise it,a court of equity will not assume to exercise the discretion,and the power will not pass to a successor appointed by the court if the power is ministerial although there may be some measure of discretion involved,the court will compel the performance of the power,or execute it in the place of the trustee.
we recognize that the mere fact that a power is conferred upon the trustee by name is not sufficient in itself to indicate that the power does not devolve upon successor trustees.in re city bank farmers trust,citing in re walker.w hether the testator intended a discretionary trust power to be ex officio or to be a purely personal power limited to the original trustees is to be ascertained by construing the language of the will as a whole in the light of all the surrounding circumstances.in re warner will,at see also welch,at whether the powers are personal in character is to be ascertained from a consideration of the will as a whole,and from the nature and objects of the trust created thereby,in the light of surrounding circumstances.in re houghton estate,at practically,the question reduces itself to determining whether such powers are in point of fact personal or ex officio,and this,at least in the absence of statute,depends upon the intention of the settlor,to be gathered from the terms of the instrument creating the trust and from the surrounding circumstances.here,the surrounding circumstances and subsequent history of dealings among the parties with an interest in the lease confirms our reading of the trust instrument as conveying powers personal to luthy 
first,in an affidavit signed in,six years after the declaration of trust,each of the interest holders in the lease agreed that 
the remaining state oil and gas leases acquired by the syndicate before mentioned are still and always have been held in the name of fred luthy,with full and complete power of disposition of the same,and the beneficial owners entitled to profits from said state leases are presently fredy luthy,defiance coal company,and paul butt,and that all of the holders of the beneficial interests in said oil and gas leases and properties have always conceded and now concede that fred luthy has the full and complete power of disposition of said leases and interests thereunder,and that no purchaser or person dealing with fred luthy is required to look to the holders of the beneficial interests or the disposition of the proceeds therefrom.
app.vol.i,at see also dist.mem.as in the trust instrument,the emphasis in the affidavit is on fred luthy personal control over the lease and no provision is made for the continuance of the trust after his demise.as the trial testimony demonstrates,luthy and the original parties to the lease enjoyed a close business relationship,and the facts suggest that luthy associates placed particular faith in his abilities.
second,following luthy death,the parties relationship to each other and to the trust changed dramatically.the.luthy successor in not assert,and was not recognized as having,the unilateral authority over business dealings regarding the lease that was exercised by luthy.instead,with regard to multiple transactions,each interest holder in the lease was asked to give specific approval.for example,just four months after luthy death,each interest holder jointly signed a letter offering the humble oil refining company mineral interests in tract.if the bank were meant to continue as trustee with full authority to deal with the lease,there would have been no reason to obtain the signatures of all the interest holders.moreover,there would have been no reason to explain in the offer letter that the leasehold interest is actually owned by paul butt,by defiance coal company,and by the estate of fred luthy,deceased.dist.mem.app.vol.ii,at.indeed,in the opinion of humble oil attorney,who enjoyed a vantage point much closer than the one we find ourselves in today,upon luthy death his power of control and sale ceased and was not vested in his heirs or devisees.dist.mem.app.vol.ii,at.additionally,some nine months after luthy death,butt independently,and by separate instrument,conveyed his interest in six tracts to humble oil.dist.mem.if the trust was still extant at that point,such an action on butt part would have been unnecessary and improper.
equally convincing is the shift in practices that occurred after luthy death with respect to the rankin and turner farmouts.before his death,luthy was independently dealing,on behalf of all parties,with mann rankin about the assignment of a single tract under the lease.id.the dealings with rankin continued after luthy death,but the bank did not step into luthy shoes.instead,rankin explicitly stated that he was assigning an overriding royalty interest to each of the interest holders in the lease.id.at.if the bank served as trustee for each of these interest holders,in the same capacity as luthy served before his death,there would have been no reason to make this specification.the royalty interest would have just been assigned to the bank and,in its capacity as trustee,it would have distributed the royalties to the beneficiaries as they accrued.
similarly,before his death,luthy offered to assign two tracts to charles turner.id.after luthy death,the dealings with turner continued but,again,the bank did not step into luthy role as the sole entity making offers on behalf of the lease.instead,each interest holder reaffirmed the offer in a joint letter.id.moreover,butt independently discussed transactions with turner,id.at,a scenario that would not have occurred while luthy was alive and serving as sole trustee for the lease.most significantly,when the bank did act independently in assigning the entire interest in a tract to turner thereby ignoring the other interest holders,it felt compelled to have all the interest holders ratify the transaction.id.if the bank enjoyed the powers and rights that luthy had enjoyed as trustee during his lifetime,such a ratification would have been unnecessary and inconsistent with the terms of the trust,and the role of a trustee.
the dealings surrounding the shell oil assignment also confirm that the parties understood the trust to be at an end after luthy death.notably,the bank refused to take individual action on a requested transfer order because,as the bank explained,the oil company had erroneously assumed that the bank owned the entire interest.instead,the bank cautioned that it was merely an equal partner.id.at see also app.vol.ii,at.
in sum,throughout the all of these.butt never objected to being treated in his individual capacity as an owner of the lease.indeed,in may he requested that shell deal with him individually rather than through the bank,dist.mem,the very entity he now contends was serving as his trustee at the time.if butt believes the trust survived luthy death,it is a realization that he has come to rather late in the game.
we recognize that,aside from the humble oil assignment,the record does show that the bank ma
