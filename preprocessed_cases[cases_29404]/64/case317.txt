james devine,of the mary sigourney award trust,a charitable trust,petitioned the trial court for instructions concerning the appointment of a successor.the american psychoanalytic association apa,stephen firestein,and newell fischer replied and opposed the petition on the basis that the underlying orders which had amended mary sigourney testamentary trust and created the award trust were void because they and the attorney general had not received notice of the proceedings.the attorney general replied and indicated that he would not appear or take a position on the matter because both parties were adequately represented by counsel and there were no allegations of a diversion of charitable assets or that assets were not used for charitable purposes.the trial court granted the petition and instructed devine to appoint a in accordance with the trust terms.apa,firestein,and fischer appeal and reiterate their position.we agree with appellants and reverse the order.
background 
sigourney signed a will on october.she died on october.the will included a charitable trust for the purpose of funding an annual award in recognition of contributions to the field of psychoanalysis.the trust appointed its trustees in paragraph as follows the initial trustees shall be james devine and bernard pacella,or such other individual who is at any time treasurer of the apa if at any time the treasurer of apa is unable or unwilling to serve as,his successor shall be selected by the board of directors of that society or any successor to that society.it is my intention that there shall at all times be two trustees serving under this will.
on may,the executor of sigourney estate,victoria gibson,represented by devine,filed a verified petition to construe,amend,and conform decedent will and testamentary trust in a manner consistent with her intent and with the internal revenue code of and to qualify decedent estate for the federal estate tax charitable deduction.the petition cited probate code section et as authority gibson gave no notice to the attorney general or appellants by this time,pacella,who was apa treasurer,had decided not to run again for treasurer.firestein and david carlson were candidates for the post 
the petition stated decedent will was prepared in circumstances which left certain provisions incomplete or inartfully stated as a reflection of decedent intent.decedent signed a preliminary draft of her will on october,because it stated the substance of her wishes and she was concerned about her health.decedent intended to make certain clarifying changes to the trust provisions but died in san francisco on october,eight days after signing her will,and without the opportunity to execute a new will incorporating the needed clarifying changes.because the trust under decedent will continues as a perpetual charitable trust,and at some time will be administered by persons who were not familiar with the decedent or her wishes,it is essential to the effective operation of the trust that these clarifying changes,all of which carry out decedent intent,be incorporated into the trust under decedent will,and in the order of distribution of this court which establishes the trust and supersedes the decedent will.
the petition then requested the court to amend paragraphs,and of the trust provisions to read as proposed a page proposal.most pertinent to this appeal is paragraph,the clause.the petition requested that it be amended to read as follows 
the initial trustees shall be james devine and bernard pacella if at any time bernard pacella is unwilling or unable by reason of death or incapacity to continue to serve as,his successor shall be selected by the remaining trustee from nominees presented by the governing bodies of the apa and the american psychiatric association,or any successor to those associations any reputable psychoanalytic society or institute selected by the trustee s any psychiatric departments of american universities which have a medical school or as selected by the trustee s because it is essential that the trustees work and in the spirit of my wishes,i wish the acting to have the final decision with respect to the selection of a successor.the acting may request that additional nominees be submitted for consideration in selecting a successor.subsequent successor trustees shall be chosen in a like manner.it is my intention that there shall at all times be two trustees serving under this will,one a member of the legal profession and one a member of the apa,or any successor to that association.
on june,the court granted the petition and amended the trust provisions of the will as proposed.the order noted that no person appearing to contest said petition.
on august,the court closed the estate,created the trust,and distributed the trust estate to devine and pacella.
on june,devine and pacella filed a verified petition to construe and amend the trust that was granted on july.on august,devine and pacella filed a verified petition to reform and amend the trust that was granted on september.in general,these modifications changed the procedures for selecting award recipients.as before,the petitioners gave no notice to anyone.
on december,devine filed the instant verified petition for instructions.the petition informed that pacella had resigned effective upon the appointment of his successor,devine wanted to appoint a successor in accordance with paragraph,but the apa had questioned the use of that procedure.devine gave notice to the attorney general and the apa.
appellants responded and asked that the june order and the relevant provisions of the august order be declared void because the orders were obtained by extrinsic fraud,the orders were void on their face because probate code section required notice to successor trustees and,for purposes of the internal revenue code revisions,interested persons were required to consent,the orders were void on their face because section required notice to the attorney general and government code section declared that the court was without jurisdiction to modify the trust without the attorney general appearance,and they were entitled to notice under federal and state constitutional principles of due process.and they asked that fischer be appointed ex officio in his capacity as apa treasurer.
devine then filed a declaration generally stating that sigourney had a distrust of organizations,specifically the apa,and believed that organizations could not be counted on to carry out her wishes.he added that the apa had been a beneficiary in a previous will,but sigourney had eliminated the bequest in a later will.in particular,devine stated the following 
on october,i met with sigourney to discuss the concept of an award trust.in our conversation she made it clear to me that while she wanted to provide an award for contributions to the field of psychoanalysis,she did not want the award to be in any way subject to the control of any particular organization.sigourney had become acquainted with bernard pacella who was then the treasurer of the apa and advised me that she was very impressed by him and that she wanted pacella and me to be the initial trustees of the trust.following our meeting on october,i prepared a rough draft of her will for review by her on the following day.given the time and circumstances,not all of the provisions were artfully prepared,phrases were omitted and sentences were not complete.some of the provisions were my own attempt to fill in blanks to cover matters which we had not discussed including,among other things,the manner in which successor trustees were to be appointed.when i met with her on the following day,sigourney made it clear to me that she wanted pacella to serve as of the award trust in his individual capacity and not because he happened to be the treasurer of the apa.the reference in the draft will to the treasurer of the apa was my attempt to deal with the possibility that pacella might not be willing to act as trustee.she told me that she did not want the position of my to be determined by whomever might be serving as the treasurer of the apa nor did she want the apa or any other organization to be able to control the appointment of a successor.because she wished to separate the award from the control of any organization,including the apa,we agreed that i would redraft those provisions as well as some others which we discussed on october.nonetheless,because the draft covered the basic concepts which she desired for the award trust,sigourney insisted on signing the draft on october.sigourney told me that she would feel better if she had a will which at least contained the basic idea of an award and that we could make the needed changes later.unfortunately,sigourney left monterey for san francisco the next day and died eight days later without returning to monterey,and before i was about to redraft her will to conform it to her wishes.
devine added that he,pacella,and gibson had concurred in formulating the changes which needed to be made and in particular those which related to the identity of my and the selection of the successor to pacella.he also declared that the purpose of gibson petition was to amend and modify the provisions of the trust to conform to sigourney intent regarding the manner in which the trustees named and their successors selected.he added that it did not occur to me that there was any reason to serve the petition on the apa or anyone associated with that organization.it was an oversight that the attorney general was not served with the petition.
devine also filed points and authorities.he urged that gibson petition was justified to eliminate the ambiguity in paragraph four of the trust and with reference to the identity and capacity of devine and to eliminate the provision erroneously giving the apa the authority to appoint a successor trustee.devine explained the ambiguity as follows 
it was not clear whether doctor pacella was to be trustee in his individual capacity or only if he was the treasurer of the apa when sigourney died.the provision could have been interpreted to mean that the treasurer of the apa was to be the trustee only if doctor pacella was unable or unwilling to serve when sigourney died.alternatively,it could have been interpreted to mean that whomever was treasurer of the apa when sigourney died was to be the initial trustee.that conflict could not be resolved from the document alone.in addition,the initial draft was silent on the subject of whether doctor pacella service as the initial with devine was to end when he no longer held the position of treasurer of the apa.because doctor pacella was,at the time of sigourney death,the treasurer of the apa,there could be no question that he was to be the initial trustee with devine.
in granting the petition,the trial court construed gibson petition as an executor petition for instructions under probate code appendix section it then concluded that appellants and the attorney general were not entitled to statutory notice it added that it could have waived notice to the attorney general under probate code appendix section,subdivision c,because gibson petition did not seek to modify the charitable purpose of the trust.it alternatively held that the attorney general retroactively waived notice by filing its nonappearance in the instant proceeding.it added that appellants were not interested persons entitled to notice and could not collaterally attack the underlying orders based on the lack of notice to the attorney general because the issues did not relate to the attorney general supervisory duties over charitable trusts.and it rejected the extrinsic fraud argument on statute of limitations grounds and on the merits.it did not address appellants constitutional argument.
discussion 
appellants dispositive contention is easily summarized the trial court lacked fundamental jurisdiction to modify the trust because gibson failed to give appellants notice of the proceedings.
devine agrees with the proposition that,where notice is required to be given and is not given,the resultant order is void and may be collaterally attacked by anyone at any time.texas bank of america.cal d.the parties extensively debate,however,whether notice was required to be given to appellants.
appellants rely on government code section and argue that the section allows them to attack the underlying orders on the basis that notice was not given to the attorney general.their point is that the trial court lacked fundamental jurisdiction.but they cite no authority for the proposition that they,as distinguished from the attorney general,can raise the point.
appellants also rely on probate code appendix section.their point is that gibson filed her petition under that authority for the purpose of modifying the trust and that authority is the authority for modifying a trust.under probate code appendix section,appellants would be entitled to notice if they qualified as successor trustees,subd.a,or interested persons entitled to notice for purpose of the estate tax aspect of gibson petition,subd.b.but appellants do not argue and develop the point,though they did advance it below.and appellants do not cite any authority for the proposition that they qualified as interested persons for purposes of the estate tax aspect of the petition,an aspect in which appellants had no practical interest.
devine replies that probate code appendix section can not apply because gibson was an executor rather than a trustee or beneficiary.
appellants,however,implicitly discount this procedural irregularity.estate of connolly d,fn.claim that the trial court was without subject matter jurisdiction over an executor petition for instructions because the petition should have been one to determine heirship exalted form over substance where the proceedings were essentially equivalent.
by way of a negative argument,devine urges that appellants were not entitled to statutory notice.he adopts the trial court reasoning that gibson petition should be construed as an executor petition for instructions under probate code appendix section.if it is so construed,the relevant notice provision is probate code appendix section.under probate code appendix section,only those who have requested special notice are entitled to notice devine concludes appellants were not entitled to notice because they did not file a request for special notice.
strictly speaking,devine is correct.but an executor petition for instructions presupposes that the executor or another person commenced a probate proceeding,and gave notice to executors if applicable,heirs,devisees,creditors,the attorney general if applicable,and others,so that such persons might know about the proceeding and have the opportunity to file a request for special notice.here,the apa never received notice of the probate proceeding and,thus,never had an opportunity to file a request for special notice.in any event,appellants counter that,since probate code appendix section is the authority for modification of a trust and modification of a trust is what gibson petition sought,probate code appendix section does not apply because the section is applicable only i n all cases where no other procedure is provided by statute.
none of these statutory paths to a notice requirement leads to a answer.but constitutional due process principles do.we conclude that the apa and firestein were entitled to notice of the proceedings.
the fourteenth amendment of the united states constitution provides that a state may not deprive any person of life,liberty or property without due process of law.
