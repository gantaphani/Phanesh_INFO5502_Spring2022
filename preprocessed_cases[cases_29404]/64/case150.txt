the decedent,gilbert paul,retained attorney richard patton to draft an amendment to his revocable living trust.the decedent signed the trust amendment,which,as drafted by patton,named the decedent wife,helen,and his children,stephen paul,david paul,alan paul,and nancy dybdahl as beneficiaries.stephen and david paul also are the successor trustees of the trust.following the decedent death,they petitioned the probate court to modify the trust amendment,alleging it failed to conform to the decedent intentions by erroneously granting helen an interest in decedent brokerage accounts and personal and real property.in connection with that probate court action,patton admitted the trust amendment did not reflect the decedent intention that his brokerage accounts and personal and real property be divided among his children.stephen and david settled the probate court action with helen.
subsequently,stephen,david,alan,and nancy the pauls filed the legal malpractice action that is the subject of this appeal against patton.they alleged that patton failed to exercise reasonable care in performing legal services for the decedent by failing to draft the trust amendment in a manner consistent with the decedent intentions.the trial court sustained without leave to amend patton demurrer to the pauls first amended complaint.we shall reverse.
factual and procedural background 
because this matter comes to us following a judgment sustaining a demurrer without leave to amend,we assume the truth of the material facts properly pleaded in the pauls operative first amended complaint.blank kirwan cal d,blank.facts appearing in exhibits attached to the first amended complaint also are accepted as true and are given precedence,to the extent they contradict the allegations.dodd citizens bank of costa mesa d.the exhibits to the first amended complaint were the trust amendment a december,letter from patton regarding the decedent intent in connection with the trust amendment and a partial transcript of a deposition of patton in which he discussed the decedent intent in connection with the trust amendment in addition to the first amended complaint and its exhibits,we also may consider matters subject to judicial notice.hill roll internat.th.the pauls request that we take judicial notice of the amended petition to modify the trust amendment filed in the probate court action and its exhibits,which include the decedent original revocable living trust.we grant that request pursuant to evidence code sections and.accordingly,the following factual recitation is based on the facts properly pleaded in the first amended complaint,facts appearing in exhibits attached to the first amended complaint,and facts appearing in the amended petition to modify the trust amendment and its exhibits.
a.the trust 
the pauls are the decedent four children with his first wife,who died in.the decedent married helen in.at that time,he had substantial separate property,including real property referred to as the quick stop property,other real property,brokerage accounts,and personal property.
in,the decedent established a revocable living trust the trust under which he was both trustor and trustee.the trust provided that if helen survived the decedent,she would have the right to live in or lease the marital home for the rest of her life and to receive the net income from the quick stop property.the rest of decedent property was to be divided among his children,the pauls.upon helen death,the pauls were to receive the decedent one half community property interest in the marital home.
b.the trust amendment 
the decedent health and his relationship with helen began to decline in.in,he retained patton to amend the trust.
as drafted by patton and executed by the decedent,the trust amendment defines beneficiaries as trustor adult children stephen paul,alan paul,david paul and nancy dybdahl in equal shares,share and share alike and trustor spouse helen paul.
in a section entitled marital home,the trust amendment states i t is trustor wish that the marital home be sold after his death.it provides that,upon the sale of the home,half the net proceeds from the sale shall go to helen and the other half shall be distributed to trustor beneficiaries.
with respect to the income from the quick stop property,the trust amendment directs the successor trustees to use up to per month of that income to pay for the mortgage,insurance,taxes and maintenance of the marital home.if the marital home has been sold,the successor trustees are to pay per month from the quick stop property to helen as monthly income.
in a section entitled other assets personal property,the trust amendment provides all other assets held in the trust at the time of the trustor death,shall be distributed as soon as practicable to my beneficiaries,in equal shares,share and share alike.personal property held in the trust shall be equally divided between my children as they agree.
thus,as drafted and executed,the trust amendment entitled helen to plus of the proceeds of the sale of the martial home,limited the income helen could receive from the quick stop property to per month,and gave helen a share of the decedent other assets aside from his personal property.under the trust,she was entitled to live in or lease but not to sell the marital home and to all of the quick stop property income,but to none of the decedent other assets.
c.the petition to modify the trust amendment and resulting settlement 
the decedent died in july.in their capacities as successor trustees of the trust,stephen and david filed a petition to modify the trust amendment,arguing it did not conform to decedent intentions.in re the matter of gilbert paul revocable living trust dated april,as amended,superior court,santa cruz county,case no.pr.helen opposed the petition.
in connection with the petition to modify,patton stated in a december,letter,i am certain that decedent did not intend to give helen paul a interest in his assets.patton further wrote,i t was never decedent intention to change the distribution pattern of his real property his brokerage account but rather to clarify the language of the original trust and to limit the amount of income helen paul was to receive from the quick stop property i am prepared to make a sworn statement that decedent intention was not to grant a interest to helen in his portion of the marital home or his separate property including the quick stop real property and the brokerage accounts.any language to the contrary in the amendment is a scrivener error and does not reflect the intention of my client,gilbert paul.
patton was deposed on june,also in connection with the action seeking to modify the trust amendment.he stated that,upon reviewing the other assets personal property provision of the trust amendment after decedent death,he realized confusion is caused by the word beneficiaries,as opposed to children.and my reaction to that was that that was not what gilbert intended.according to patton,the decedent did not want helen to share in the personal property,the morgan stanley account and the quick stop property.as such,patton characterized the other assets personal property provision of the trust amendment as containing a clerical error.
stephen and david reached a settlement agreement with helen under which she received more than decedent intended.
d.the pauls professional negligence action against patton 
the pauls sued patton for professional negligence on march.the operative first amended complaint,filed on august,alleged patton failed to use reasonable skill and care in drafting the trust amendment in that patton negligently and carelessly included the term beneficiaries in the section titled other assets personal property instead of children,which directly contradicted decedent clear intent and instruction referred to beneficiaries instead of children in the trust amendment section entitled marital home,which also directly contradicted decedent clear intent and instruction.the first amended complaint also alleged that a s a direct result of defendant patton negligence,plaintiffs have been damaged,in that they were forced to litigate to have the trust amendment modified,they lost equity value of real property trust assets,and they incurred substantial litigation expenses and attorney fees in connection with the petition for modification of the trust amendment,suffering damages in excess of.
patton successful demurrer 
patton demurred to the first amended complaint,arguing he owed no duty of care to the pauls because they were not his clients.in an order filed on december,the trial court sustained the demurrer without leave to amend,stating no liability exists as a matter of law under the analysis and precedent set forth in,inter alia,chang lederman th.a judgment of dismissal was entered on december.patton served a notice of entry of judgment on january,and the pauls timely appealed on february.
ii.discussion 
the single issue raised on appeal is whether the trial court erred in sustaining patton demurrer without leave to amend.because the court order apparently was based on the conclusion that patton did not,as a matter of law,owe a duty to the pauls,t he issue on appeal contains two subquestions a whether the court properly sustained the demurrer because the complaint,as drafted,failed to state a cause of action for professional negligence and b whether the court abused its discretion by refusing the pauls leave to amend,that the court correctly concluded that there was no reasonable possibility that the pauls could amend the complaint to state a viable cause of action.osornio weingarten th,osornio.
standard of review 
a demurrer tests the sufficiency of the complaint as a matter of law.osornio,supra,th at.accordingly,it raises a question of law,to which we apply a de novo standard of review on appeal.ibid.
we treat the demurrer as admitting all material facts properly pleaded,but not contentions,deductions or conclusions of fact or law.citation.we also consider matters which may be judicially noticed.citation.further,we give the complaint a reasonable interpretation,reading it as a whole and its parts in their context.citation.when a demurrer is sustained,we determine whether the complaint states facts sufficient to constitute a cause of action.citation.and when it is sustained without leave to amend,we decide whether there is a reasonable possibility that the defect can be cured by amendment if it can be,the trial court has abused its discretion and we reverse if not,there is no abuse of discretion and we affirm.citations.the burden of proving such reasonable possibility is squarely on the plaintiff.blank,supra,cal d at.
elements of a professional negligence claim 
the elements of a claim for professional negligence are the duty of the professional to use such skill,prudence,and diligence as other members of his profession commonly possess and exercise a breach of that duty a proximate causal connection between the negligent conduct and the resulting injury and actual loss or damage resulting from the professional negligence.osornio,supra,th at.while negligence is ordinarily a question of fact,the existence of a duty is generally a question of law that may be addressed by demurrer.id.at.
attorney liability to nonclients 
generally,an attorney owes a duty of care,and is thus answerable in malpractice,only to the client with whom the attorney stands in privity of contract.osornio,supra,th at.however,courts have extended an attorney duty of care to nonclients including will and trust beneficiaries in limited circumstances.lucas hamm cal d lucas permitting malpractice suit by will beneficiaries against attorney whose negligent preparation of a will caused them to lose their testamentary rights bucquet livingston d bucquet permitting malpractice suit by trust beneficiaries who lost portion of testamentary rights because of attorney negligence.in heyer flaig cal d,disapproved on other grounds in laird blacker cal th,the supreme court explained the rationale for extending tort liability to an intended beneficiary as follows when an attorney undertakes to fulfill the testamentary instructions of his client,he realistically and in fact assumes a relationship not only with the client but also with the client intended beneficiaries.the attorney actions and omissions will affect the success of the client testamentary scheme and thus the possibility of thwarting the testator wishes immediately becomes foreseeable.equally foreseeable is the possibility of injury to an intended beneficiary.in some ways,the beneficiary interests loom greater than those of the client.after the latter death,a failure in his testamentary scheme works no practical effect except to deprive his intended beneficiaries of the intended bequests only the beneficiaries suffer the real loss.heyer flaig,supra,at.
attorney l iability to testamentary beneficiaries not in privity is not,however,automatic.bucquet,supra,d at.whether an attorney owes a duty to a nonclient beneficiary is a matter of policy and involves the balancing of various factors.lucas,supra,cal d at.those factors the biakanja lucas factors are the extent to which the transaction was intended to affect the plaintiff beneficiary,the foreseeability of harm to him,the degree of certainty that the plaintiff suffered injury,the closeness of the connection between the defendant attorney conduct and the injury,the policy of preventing future harm,and whether the recognition of liability would impose an undue burden on the profession.osornio,supra,th at.
an attorney also may be held liable for professional negligence to a successor trustee,despite the fact that the attorney was hired by the original trustee.borissoff taylor faust cal th,borissoff.such liability is not a matter of policy,but instead is rooted in the probate code,which gives successor fiduciaries,but not beneficiaries,the same rights as predecessor fiduciaries,including the power to sue for malpractice causing loss to the estate.id.at.
the pauls argue their suit against patton should have been permitted to go forward on either of two alternate theories patton owed them a duty of care as trust beneficiaries or they had standing as successor trustees.we address each theory in turn.
d.the pauls should be granted leave to allege patton owed them a duty as beneficiaries 
the first amended complaint does not allege patton owed the pauls a duty.therefore,the trial court properly sustained patton demurrer.the more difficult question is whether there was a reasonable possibility that the pauls could have amended their complaint to allege the duty element of their legal malpractice claim,such that the court should have granted leave to amend.at this early stage in the litigation,we can not say as a matter of law that patton did not owe the pauls a duty to ensure the trust amendment reflected the decedent testamentary intent.accordingly,we conclude the pauls should have been accorded the opportunity to amend their complaint.
here,there is no executed trust instrument reflecting the decedent alleged intent.according to patton,that is fatal to the pauls action because attorneys owe a duty of care only to beneficiaries of executed wills or trust instruments that expressly reflect the testator intent.the pauls contend that whether the testamentary document properly reflects the testator intent is irrelevant as long as the testator intent to benefit the plaintiff is clear,a duty exists.
it certainly is the case that the testator intent is central to the duty analysis.where a doubt exists as to whether the plaintiff was the decedent intended beneficiary,no duty exists.boranian clark th,liability to a third party will not be imposed where there is a substantial question about whether the third party was in fact the decedent intended beneficiary ventura county humane society holloway d,lawyer who drafted a will with a bequest to a nonexistent animal rights organization owed no duty to appellant animal rights organization where there was no allegation that the testator intended to leave a bequest to appellant.thus,in radovich locke paddon th radovich this court refused to extend an attorney duty to a nonclient who was a mere potential beneficiary under an unsigned draft will.osornio,supra,th at.in reaching that co
