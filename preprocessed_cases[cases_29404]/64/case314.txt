appellant louie contreras hereafter contreras has two appeals before this court regarding the same set of documents signed by the decedent.in one appeal,he claims that these documents are valid codicils to the decedent will exercising her power of appointment over assets in a trust.in the other appeal,he argues that these same documents are valid amendments to the trust permitting her to exercise her power of appointment by an instrument other than a will and exercising that power of appointment.his arguably inconsistent positions were rejected by the trial court.we affirm the trial court orders.
background 
on october,decedent florence kouba hereafter florence and her husband lumir kouba hereafter lumir established an inter vivos family trust with themselves as both trustors and trustees.section of the trust governed revocation of trust.at any time and from time to time during the joint lives of the trustors,the trustors jointly as to community property and either trustor as to his or her separate property may,by serving written notice on the trustee,revoke the trust created by this declaration in whole or in part.emphasis added.section,which immediately followed section,governed modification of trust.at any time and from time to time during the joint lives of the trustors,the trustors jointly as to community property and either trustor as to his or her separate property may,by serving written notice on the trustee,alter,modify,or amend the trusts created by this declaration in any respect.emphasis added.section,the next section of the trust,was entitled trusts irrevocable on death of first trustor.it provided that e xcept as otherwise expressly provided in this declaration,on the death of either trustor the trusts created by this declaration shall become irrevocable and not subject to amendment or modification.
article of the trust provided that,upon the death of the first trustor,the trust would divide into two trusts,trust a and trust trust a would consist of the surviving trustor interest in the property in the trust estate and as much of the other assets in the trust that qualified for the federal estate tax marital deduction as would minimize federal estate taxes.trust b would contain the remaining assets in the trust.the surviving trustor was to receive all income from both trust a and trust section granted the surviving trustor the power to make withdrawals from trust after the death of the first of the trustors to die,the surviving trustor may at any time and from time to time withdraw such amounts,up to the whole thereof,from the principal of trust estate of trust a as such surviving trustor may at the time of any such withdrawal,designate in a written notice served on the trustee.
article of the trust governed distributions on death of surviving trustor.section of article provided for the survivor power to appoint trust on the death of the last trustor to die,herein called surviving trustor,the principal of trust a and any accrued or undistributed net income from the principal of trust a shall be distributed by the trustee in such manner and to such persons as the surviving trustor shall appoint and direct by specific reference to this power of appointment in his or her last will admitted to probate by a court of competent jurisdiction.section provided that the surviving trustor failure to exercise the power of appointment would cause the principal and income in trust a to become part of trust b.the trust provided that trust b would be distributed upon the death of the surviving trustor to specific beneficiaries.article,section provided that,upon the death of the surviving trustor,the trustees of the trust would be marlyn kouba crook and katherine kress brown.the assets placed in the trust included the home in which lumir and florence resided at golden way in mountain view.
later on the same day that she and lumir established the trust,florence executed a will in this will,she expressly stated i do not intend to exercise any power of appointment which i now have or which may hereafter be conferred on me,unless that power is specifically referred to herein,or in any codicil hereto.this will provided that florence estate,including her household furnishings,would be placed in the family trust.the will named crook as executor of florence estate.florence will also contained a no contest clause.if any beneficiary under this will in any manner,directly or indirectly,contests or attacks this will or any of its provisions,any share or interest in my estate given to that contesting beneficiary under this will is revoked and shall be disposed of in the same manner provided herein as if that contesting beneficiary had predeceased me without issue.
lumir died in.on march,florence signed a document that purported to be an amendment to the trust.this document purported to amend article iv section of the trust so as to provide that florence power of appointment could be exercised not only by will but also by any type of writing indicating exercise of this power of appointment.the document also purported to amend the trust to add to section the following text b on the death of the surviving trustor the trustee is directed to use such assets in trust a as needed to purchase from trust b trustor family home known as golden way,mountain view,california.thereafter the trustee is directed to deed trustor family home to louie contreras.louie contreras has taken good care of trustor for the past few years and for that loyal service trustor wishes him to have her family home when she passes on.as indicated above,trustor hereby exercises this power of appointment.in addition,the document purported to amend section of the trust to nominate contreras as trustee of the trust after florence death.at the end of the document,florence signed this amendment as both trustor and trustee.her attorney,james dozier,affixed a notary acknowledgement to the end of the document,which he signed as a notary.
on august,florence executed another document similar to the first purported amendment to the trust,which purported to be a second amendment to the trust.again,the document purported to amend section of the trust in essentially the same respects except that it included household furnishings with the family home.again,florence signed the amendment as both trustor and trustee,and dozier signed an attached notary acknowledgement as a notary.
florence died on january.on march,dozier and usha kelkar signed their names to attestations that florence had signed the purported trust amendments with the understanding that each of these amendment s was her testamentary instrument.dozier attached these attestations to the purported amendments.on march,dozier executed a proof of subscribing witness form in which he declared,under penalty of perjury,that,when florence signed the documents,she acknowledged in the presence of the attesting witnesses that the instrument signed was decedent codicil.dozier also declared that w hen i signed the instrument,i understood that it was decedent codicil.
on march,contreras filed a petition for admission to probate of florence will and the two documents that he alleged were codicils to florence will.on april,crook filed a petition seeking a determination that her opposition to probate of the purported codicils and her challenge to the validity of the same documents as trust amendments would not be contests of florence will.crook intended to file an opposition to probate of the documents as codicils and a petition to determine the validity of these documents as trust amendments.contreras responded by asserting that her proposed opposition and petition would be contests of florence will.
on april,crook filed a petition seeking to suspend contreras powers as trustee and a petition seeking removal of contreras as trustee of the trust.the court immediately suspended contreras powers as trustee pending a hearing on the petition for removal.on june,after a hearing on the petition for removal,the court removed contreras as trustee based on its finding that florence did not have the power to change the successor trustee designated in the trust.crook and brown were appointed trustees of the trust as designated in the trust.
at the same hearing,the court determined that crook opposition to the admission of the documents as codicils and her petition to determine the validity of the documents as trust amendments would not be contests of florence will.i just do think documents executed ten years after a n initial estate plan constitute,by case law,an integrated estate plan,and,therefore,that absent a n express republication of the original document having the provision,a petition contesting the validity of the documents prepared ten years after the fact does not violate the clauses of the will.
crook then proceeded with both her opposition to probate of the documents as codicils and her petition to determine the validity of the documents as trust amendments.her opposition challenged the admission of the documents as codicils on the ground that they had not been signed by two witnesses in accordance with probate code section,and her petition disputed the validity of the documents as trust amendments because florence lacked the power under the trust to amend the trust.contreras filed a reply to her opposition in which he asserted that,i f an instrument has a testamentary intent and was signed by a competent testator in the presence of two witnesses,this instrument meets the modern test for admission into probate.contreras opposition to crook petition was based on his contention that florence had the power to modify the trust notwithstanding language in the trust to the contrary because she had a power to withdraw that was ipso facto a power to revoke that necessarily included a power to modify.
both contreras petition for admission of the will and purported codicils to probate and crook petition to determine the validity of the documents as trust amendments were heard on july.contreras argued at the hearing both that the documents were valid trust amendments and that they were codicils to florence will.the court concluded that the power to withdraw did not make the explicitly irrevocable trust revocable and therefore the documents were not valid trust amendments.the court also determined that the documents did not validly exercise the testamentary power of appointment because they were not validly executed by the witnesses at or about the time of their execution 
the court entered separate orders denying admission of the documents to probate as codicils and determining that the documents were not valid trust amendments.contreras filed a timely notice of appeal challenging both the court determination that crook opposition and petition would not be contests and the court order denying admission of the documents to probate as codicils.he filed a separate timely notice of appeal from the court determination that the documents were not valid trust amendments and the court order removing him as trustee of the trusts.he has abandoned on appeal his contention that the court erred in removing him as trustee.
discussion 
determination that crook actions were not contests 
contreras argues that the trial court erred in determining that crook petition and opposition were not contests to florence will.he also asserts that crook petition to remove him as trustee was a contest.
contreras lacks standing to appeal the trial court order determining that crook actions were not contests because he can not establish that he is aggrieved by this order.any party aggrieved may appeal code civ.one is considered aggrieved whose rights or interests are injuriously affected by the judgment.appellant interest must be immediate,pecuniary,and substantial and not nominal or a remote consequence of the judgment.county of alameda carleson cal d,citations and quotation marks omitted.and as to the question who is the party aggrieved,the test seems to be the most clear and simple that could be conceived.would the party have had the thing,if the erroneous judgment had not been given if the answer be yea,then the person is the party aggrieved.but his right to the thing must be the immediate,and not the remote consequence of the judgment,had it been differently given.adams woods cal.
here,a determination that crook actions were contests to florence will would not have benefitted contreras.crook was a beneficiary of trust b and the executor of the will.contreras was neither a beneficiary of trust b nor a devisee under the will.while the success of contreras claims would have reduced crook share of trust b,the forfeiture of her interest in trust b would not have produced any pecuniary benefit to contreras.hence,he is not aggrieved by the court order determining that crook actions were not contests,and his purported appeal from this order must be dismissed.
documents were not valid codicils to florence will 
contreras maintains that the documents that purported to be trust amendments were actually codicils to florence will that validly exercised her power of appointment over the assets in trust crook argues that these documents were not valid codicils because they were not signed by two witnesses,in accordance with probate code section.contreras responds that it was sufficient that one witness signed the alleged codicils prior to florence death so long as the other witness signed the alleged codicils thereafter.
this debate is necessary because,under the trust,florence could only exercise her power of appointment by a will.the documents purported to exercise this power of appointment.except as otherwise provided in this part,if the creating instrument specifies requirements as to the manner,time,and conditions of the exercise of a power of appointment,the power can be exercised only by complying with those requirements,subd.a.a where an appointment does not satisfy the formal requirements specified in the creating instrument as provided in subdivision a of section,the court may excuse compliance with the formal requirements and determine that exercise of the appointment was effective if both of the following requirements are satisfied the appointment approximates the manner of appointment prescribed by the donor.the failure to satisfy the formal requirements does not defeat the accomplishment of a significant purpose of the donor,subd.a.
probate code section may excuse compliance with requirements that exceed the requirements imposed by law for the appointment instrument,but section can not be used to excuse the failure to satisfy legal requirements.catch phillips th,d.a power to be exercised by will must,in fact,be exercised by a will.catch at,d.contreras does not challenge these principles,but he claims that the documents did comply with the legal requirements to qualify as a will.
will includes codicil and any testamentary instrument which merely appoints an executor or revokes or revises another will.t he true test of the character of an instrument is not the testator realization that it is a will,but his intention to create a revocable disposition of his property to accrue and take effect only upon his death and passing no present interest.estate of spitzer cal,citation and quotation marks omitted.hence,although the documents were titled as trust amendments,they could potentially qualify as codicils if they met the legal requirements for wills and demonstrated florence intent to dispose of property upon her death.
unless there is a contest of a will a the will may be proved on the evidence of one of the subscribing witnesses only,if the evidence shows that the will was executed in all particulars as prescribed by law.b evidence of execution of a will may be received by an affidavit of a subscribing witness to which there is attached a photographic copy of the will,or by an affidavit in the original will that includes or incorporates the attestation clause,emphasis added.crook did not file a contest to florence will.instead,she merely opposed contreras petition for admission of the purported codicils to probate.
the only issue here is whether the documents complied in all particulars with the legal requirements necessary to qualify as codicils.it was undisputed that,although both dozier and kelkar saw florence sign the documents,only dozier signed the documents at or about the times of their executions.two years after the first document was executed,a year and a half after the second document was executed and a month after florence death,both kelkar and dozier signed attestations that dozier attached to the documents.dozier then submitted the documents with the attestations and his own affidavits as a subscribing witness in support of contreras petition for admission of the documents to probate as codicils.
the trial court determined that the undisputed facts did not establish compliance with the legal requirements necessary to qualify the documents as codicils to florence will because these documents had not been signed by two witnesses as required by probate code section.the construction of a statute and its applicability to a given situation are matters of law to be determined by the court.estate of madison cal d.we review such matters de novo.estate of platt cal d.
a except as provided in part of division of the probate code,a will shall be in writing and satisfy the requirements of this section.b the will shall be signed by one of the following by the testator.c the will shall be witnessed by being signed by at least two persons each of whom being present at the same time,witnessed either the signing of the will or the testator acknowledgment of the signature or of the will and understand that the instrument they sign is the testator will,emphasis added.
the current version of probate code section is the product of a revision.prior to,the two subscribing witnesses were required to sign the will in the testator presence.this requirement was eliminated by the revision.contreras argues that the revision not only eliminated the requirement that the witnesses sign the will in the presence of the testator,but also eliminated any requirement that the witnesses sign the will during the testator lifetime.we are not aware of any california cases addressing the question of whether probate code section permits subscription of a will,nor have the parties directed us to any california authority on this subject.instead,they have directed our attention to cases addressing similar issues.
our review of these cases discloses no substantial support for contreras position.one vintage new york case cogently explains the reasons for disallowing subscription of a codicil or will after the death of the testator.the statute requires that a will shall have at least two witnesses,and they must,we think,become such during the lifetime of the testator.if the act of subscribing by the witnesses can be performed immediately after the death of the principal,and the instrument be valid,it may be done in a month or a year thereafter with the same effect.a will takes effect at the instant the testator dies.if the contention of the appellants should prevail,the anomaly might be presented of the disposition of an estate being suspended intermediate the death of the testator and the time the witness o r witnesses shall perform the act of subscribing their names to the instrument.the final disposition of the estate would thereby be made to depend,not solely upon the intention of the testator,but upon the will or caprice of one who had been requested to perform the very simple act of becoming a witness.the legislature never intended to give to subscribing witnesses such power.a will must be a valid,perfect instrument at the time of the death of the testator.it takes effect at the instant the testator dies.if invalid then,life can not be given to it by the act of a third party.in re cannock will,quotation marks omitted,quoting matter of fish will.
the position taken by the new york courts in these early cases has been accepted by numerous other states.in in re estate of flicker,the nebraska court rejected a subscription of a will.permitting witnesses to sign a will after the death of a testator would erode the efficacy of the witnessing requirement as a safeguard against fraud or mistake.we must bear in mind that we are dealing with an instrument allegedly signed or acknowledged by a man who is now dead.he is not present to confirm or reject it.requiring completion of formalities of execution prior to death is likely to minimize miscarriages of justice.flicker at.new jersey,michigan and oregon have taken similar positions.matter of estate of peters,matter of estate of mikeska,rogers rogers.the colorado supreme court has also held that subscription of a will did not comply with the statutory requirements then in effect,which,like california probate code section,without elaboration required two witnesses to sign the will.estate of royal.
thus,contreras thesis has never been addressed in california and has been repeatedly rejected by the courts in other jurisdictions we are unpersuaded that we should chart a new course.our independent construction of probate code section,in light of its legislative history,discloses no indication that the legislature intended by its statutory revision to permit subscription of a will.a conclusion otherwise would attribute to the legislature an intent to allow the validity of a will to depend upon the will or caprice of one who had been requested to perform the very simple act of becoming a witness by allowing such a person to wait until after the testator death to decide whether or not to subscribe his or her signature to the will.such an interpretation would invite fraud and subvert the basic intent of will authentication requirements.we conclude that the subscription of a will by two witnesses must occur prior to the testator death,and a will that has not been subscribed by two witnesses at the time of the testator death neither complies nor substantially complies with probate code section.
documents were not valid amendments of the trust 
contreras alternatively contends that the documents were valid amendments of the trust that altered the trust to allow exercise of the power of appointment by means other than a will and exercised that power of appointment.the only issue presented by this argument is whether florence had the power to amend the trust.
t he primary rule in construction of trusts is that the court must,if possible,ascertain and effectuate the intention of the trustor or settlor.ephraim metropolitan trust cal d.the intention of the transferor as expressed in the trust instrument controls the legal effect of the dispositions made in the instrument.the nature and extent of the rights retained by the trustor are to be measured by the four corners of the instrument.heifetz bank of america d.
contreras relies heavily on heifetz,but it does not support his argument.heifetz involved a trust created by a trust instrument that provided the trustor with the right and option to cancel and revoke this trust in whole or in part heifetz at.the original trust instrument did not expressly provide the trustor with the right to amend or modify the trust nor did it expressly prohibit amendments or modifications.the trustor subsequently amended the trust to change some of its terms including the identities of some of the beneficiaries.this amendment also limited the revocability of the trust so that the corpus of the trust would never be less than.the amendment ratified the unamended terms of the original instrument.heifetz at.a second amendment further limited revocation so that the corpus would not be less than,and again ratified the unamended terms of the original instrument.heifetz at.
