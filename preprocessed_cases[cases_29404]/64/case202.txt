factual and procedural background 
on september,al executed an individual grant deed transferring the property to gloria,ann,marcus luna marcus,and himself,as joint tenants.this deed was recorded on september.
there apparently was no consideration for the transfer of most of al interest in the property to his siblings.the siblings understood that the property belonged to al,but it was placed in all of their names so that if al died,the property would simply pass on to his sisters and brother 
on august,gloria and ann each executed two grant deeds.one set of grant deeds transferred plaintiffs interest in the property to al as an individual.the other set of grant deeds transferred plaintiffs interest in the property to al as the trustee of the trust.attorney valdez drafted two sets of deeds on al behalf because he was sure which type of transfer should occur at that time.there was no consideration given to plaintiffs for executing the grant deeds.
the grant deeds were executed during a meeting at the home of gloria and ann.at that meeting,gloria,ann,al,valdez paralegal david pantoja pantoja,notary public steven perez perez,and a driver employed by valdez were present.pantoja advised gloria and ann that they would be signing deeds giving the property back to.gloria and ann stated that the property was al,and that he could do what he wanted with it.
on august,al executed a quitclaim deed transferring his interest in the property as an individual to himself as trustee of the trust.
on august,al executed the declaration of trust for the trust.the declaration of trust stated that al was the trustee,and that the successor trustees were valdez,valdez law office,and erica.the beneficiaries of the trust were erik brownell,erik brownell,and erica 
on september,the grant deeds transferring plaintiffs interest in the property to al as trustee of the trust were recorded.the quitclaim deed transferring al interest in the property,as an individual to al,as trustee of the trust,was also recorded.the grant deeds transferring plaintiffs interests in the property to al as an individual were not recorded.
al died on september.less than a week later,on september,plaintiffs filed the complaint in this action.
the complaint set forth causes of action for on grounds of lack of,revocation on grounds of undue influence,revocation on grounds of fraud,negligent misrepresentations,quiet title,constructive trust for real property,personal property claims,breach of fiduciary duty,conspiracy,permanent injunction,and accounting.at trial,plaintiffs pursued the first,third,fourth,fifth and sixth causes of action,but did not pursue the remaining causes of action.
the superior court held a one day bench trial on june.on august,the court issued a ruling in defendants favor.
in its ruling,the court summarized the testimony of the witnesses at the trial,including the testimony of notary public perez.the court noted that perez testified as follows perez heard patoja explain the grant deeds to gloria luna and ms.ann brownell.he also heard patoja explain why the deeds were needed.perez heard patoja explain to luna and brownell that they were releasing any interest they might have in the property.perez believed that the women were not asserting any interest in the property.they also voiced no objection to signing the deeds.
the court found perez to be credible.by contrast,the court found the testimony of both plaintiffs unreliable and often not credible.
with respect to plaintiffs argument that the deeds were void because the trust was not formed on the date the deeds were executed,the court stated the following i n a situation where a property transfer has been made to one who has no legal existence,there is authority in some jurisdictions that provides as a matter of equity,such a deed is valid between the grantor and the grantee only but not as to third parties.citations.
after the court entered judgment for defendants,plaintiffs filed a timely appeal.
contentions 
plaintiffs make three major arguments.the first is that the grant deeds executed on august,were void under the doctrine of undue influence.the second is that the trial court erroneously failed to find certain facts that were allegedly favorable to plaintiffs.finally,plaintiffs argue that the trial court erroneously failed to find that the grant deeds and the quitclaim deed were void as a matter of law because the trust did not exist when the deeds were executed and physically given to valdez law firm.
discussion 
plaintiffs forfeited their undue influence cause of action 
in the complaint,plaintiffs asserted a cause of action for revocation on grounds of undue influence.plaintiffs alleged that there was a confidential relationship between plaintiffs and al and defendants,and that defendants took advantage of this trust and confidence and substituted their will for that of al and plaintiffs.
defendants alleged undue influence over al and plaintiffs was so great that the grant deeds executed on august,were void.
plaintiffs,however,did not pursue this cause of action at trial.at a status conference days before the trial,plaintiffs counsel stated that his clients would not be proceeding on their second cause of action.in his closing argument at trial,plaintiffs counsel did not make any arguments relating to the second cause of action.and in its written ruling on submitted matter,the trial court stated that plaintiffs elected to proceed on the following claims only lack of,fraud,negligent misrepresentation,quiet title,and constructive trust.the trial court did not discuss plaintiffs undue influence cause of action in its ruling on submitted matter because there was no trial on that cause of action.
on appeal,plaintiffs argue that they should have prevailed on their undue influence cause of action.plaintiffs,however,forfeited their argument on appeal relating to undue influence because they did not pursue the cause of action in the trial court.amato mercury casualty th,it must appear from the record that the issue argued on appeal was raised in the trial court.if not,the issue is waived.
plaintiffs contend that they argued the cause of action in their trial brief.this is simply not true.although plaintiffs made statements in their trial brief that ostensibly relate to the undue influence doctrine,plaintiffs allegedly lacked mental vigor,they did not relate such statements to a coherent assertion of an undue influence cause of action.undue influence was simply not an issue raised in the trial and thus has been forfeited on appeal.
the trial court did not erroneously fail to make factual findings in plaintiffs favor
