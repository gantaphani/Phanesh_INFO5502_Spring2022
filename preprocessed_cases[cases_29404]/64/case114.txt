finding no constitutional violation,we affirm the district court grant of summary judgment.
background 
after midnight on april,lyle larsen called threatening to kill someone or himself.officers randy murr and david brase were dispatched to larsen residence and arrived in separate vehicles.they parked on the street near the home and approached by foot from different directions.the home had a front porch and a small front yard separated from the street by a three to high retaining wall.a concrete stairway of six steps connected the yard to a sidewalk in front of larsen house,with an iron railing down the middle of the steps.some shrubbery also sat atop the retaining wall on one side of the stairs.
as the officers approached the house,larsen stood alone on the front porch.in his hands,he held a large knife with a blade over one foot long.because of its size,murr initially thought the knife was a pipe.officer brase,who at first had a better angle,described the knife as looking like a small sword.as they neared larsen,brase warned murr that larsen was armed,and both men drew their service pistols.brase told larsen in a loud voice i corporal brase,the denver police.i need you to put that knife down right now.id.
larsen appeared to bend over,as if intending to place the knife on the ground,but then straightened up with the weapon still in his hand.although the record is unclear as to the exact distance,murr believed larsen was within to feet.larsen eyes became the size of quarters.appearing agitated,he raised the knife above his shoulder with the blade pointed outward and turned towards officer murr.brase heard murr tell larsen to drop the knife,drop the knife,drop the expletive knife.a few seconds later,murr again told larsen,drop the knife or i shoot.larsen turned and took a step towards murr,who was on the sidewalk below.fearing for his life,murr fired twice,hitting larsen in the chest and killing him.officer brase held his fire during the encounter,but later stated that he too was prepared to use force at the time of the shooting and was maneuvering into position when murr fired.
no other eyewitnesses observed the shooting.
ii.discussion 
appellant claims officer murr used excessive force during the encounter in violation of the fourth amendment.it also claims the city and county of denver and the police chief failed to adequately train and supervise police officers concerning the use of deadly force.the district court granted summary judgment on all claims,finding murr use of force was not unreasonable in the circumstances.absent an unreasonable use of force,the court determined the officer was immune from suit on the basis of qualified immunity,and appellant had not shown a constitutional violation that would enable it to prevail on its other claims.
standard of review 
we review de novo a grant of summary judgment based on qualified immunity.jiron city of lakewood,cir.summary judgment is appropriate if there is no genuine issue of material fact and one party is entitled to judgment as a matter of law.c.we construe the record in the light most favorable to the nonmoving party.jiron,at.but the nonmoving party must do more than simply show that there is some metaphysical doubt as to the material facts where the record taken as a whole could not lead a rational trier of fact to find for the nonmoving party,there is no genuine issue for trial.scott harris,d citations omitted.
reviewing summary judgment in the qualified immunity context involves a inquiry.cortez mccauley,cir.first,the plaintiff must establish the defendant violated a constitutional right.if no constitutional violation is established by the plaintiff allegations or the record,our inquiry ends.but if a constitutional right was violated,we next ask if the constitutional right was clearly established.to be clearly established,either supreme court or tenth circuit precedent must be on point or the clearly established weight of authority from other courts must agree with plaintiff contention.id.at.
fourth amendment violation 
appellant claims the officer use of deadly force violated the fourth amendment.our case law involving claims against police officers for the use of excessive force provides the framework to assess the claim and the district court grant of summary judgment.
legal framework 
we treat excessive force claims as seizures subject to the reasonableness requirement of the fourth amendment.graham connor,d.to establish a constitutional violation,the plaintiff must demonstrate the force used was objectively unreasonable.thus the reasonableness of a particular use of force must be judged from the perspective of a reasonable officer on the scene,rather than with the vision of hindsight.id.at.moreover,because police officers are often forced to make circumstances that are tense,uncertain,and rapidly the amount of force that is necessary in a particular situation,the reasonableness of the officer belief as to the appropriate level of force should be judged from that perspective.saucier katz,d quoting graham,at.
we assess objective reasonableness based on whether the totality of the circumstances justified the use of force,and pay careful attention to the facts and circumstances of the particular case.sevier city of lawrence,cir internal quote and alteration marks omitted.in this case,appellant claim of excessive force centers on whether larsen posed an immediate threat to the officers or the safety of others.see jiron,at.deadly force is justified under the fourth amendment if a reasonable officer in defendants position would have had probable cause to believe that there was a threat of serious physical harm to themselves or to others.id.at quoting sevier,at emphasis supplied.indeed,even i f an officer reasonably,but mistakenly,believed that a suspect was likely to fight back the officer would be justified in using more force than in fact was needed.id.quoting saucier,at.a reasonable officer need not await the glint of steel before taking action by then,it is often too late to take safety precautions.people morales.
in assessing the degree of threat facing officers,then,we consider a number of factors.these include whether the officers ordered the suspect to drop his weapon,and the suspect compliance with police commands whether any hostile motions were made with the weapon towards the officers the distance separating the officers and the suspect and the manifest intentions of the suspect.see,walker city of orem,cir jiron,at zuchel spinharney,cir.
but in the end the inquiry is always whether,from the perspective of a reasonable officer on the scene,the totality of the circumstances justified the use of force.see sevier,at.
application 
applying these principles here,the district court did not err in granting summary judgment.
based on the totality of the circumstances facing the responding officers,a number of undisputed facts support the heightened immediacy of the threat they faced and the objective reasonableness of the use of deadly force larsen had already threatened violence against himself and others the officers responded to an emergency call late at night when the officers arrived,they encountered a man armed with a knife both officers repeatedly told larsen to put down the knife the knife was a large weapon with a blade over a foot in length rather than a mere pocket knife or razor blade larsen refused to cooperate with the officers repeated orders to drop his weapon larsen held the high ground the officers larsen raised the knife blade above his shoulder and pointed the tip towards the officers officer brase was also prepared to use force and was moving into position to be able to do so larsen turned and took a step toward officer murr the distance betwe
