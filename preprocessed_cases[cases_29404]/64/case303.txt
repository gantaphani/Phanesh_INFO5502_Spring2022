kenneth marinos marinos has seven children.six are the subject of this appeal.they range in age from to,and are from three different relationships.marinos has failed to pay child support for approximately years.following the death of his mother,he became entitled to distributions from her trust.the ventura county department of child support services dcss and one of the three mothers,stephanie solace solace,obtained judgments against marinos for arrearages and ongoing monthly support.dcss and solace seek to satisfy the child support judgments from marinos interest in the trust.the trustee,jeffrey brown appellant,has not satisfied the child support judgment,arguing that the trial court may not compel him to make trust distributions for child support.we disagree and affirm.
the mothers of marinos minor children are solace two minors,chantel bunch three minors and sheri marinos one minor.on january,solace obtained a paternity judgment by default against marinos for the support of her minor twins,alexander and nicholas marinos.the trial court ordered marinos to pay monthly support of per child and to reimburse dcss for in past due support.
helen marinos life insurance trust irrevocable 
marinos and his brother,daniel marinos,are the sons of chris and helen marinos,both deceased.on june,helen marinos a widow established the helen marinos life insurance trust irrevocable the trust.helen,as grantor,named her adopted sons,kenneth and daniel marinos,as beneficiaries.the trust gives the trustee broad powers to manage and disburse funds.it contains a spendthrift provision,designed to keep creditors from reaching trust assets 
according to its terms,the trust is to be divided equally between helen marinos two sons at her death.the shares are to remain in trust and be administered by the trustee to provide for the proper support,care,maintenance and education of said child.the trustee has discretion to distribute so much of the net income or principal,or both,of each trust to or for the use and benefit of the beneficiary,at any time and from time to time.several years later,the guardian ad litem of the minor children obtained a court order modifying the trust,removing rodney minnier as trustee and appointing appellant as successor trustee.helen,kenneth and daniel marinos consented to the modification.a conservatorship was later established for the person and estate of helen marinos.santa barbara bank and trust was named as conservator of her estate.
enforcement of child support judgments 
helen marinos died on november.one month later,solace filed a complaint for injunctive relief in probate court.she asked the court to enjoin distribution of the trust proceeds to marinos,referencing her child support judgment.several months later,dcss filed three petitions in the probate action to enforce money judgments it had recovered on behalf of marinos minor children.dcss sought support for alexander and nicholas marinos,the minor children of stephanie solace amanda bonvillian,the minor child of chantel bunch and damion,cody and melony marinos,the minor children of sheri marinos.the petitions also requested the payment of monthly ongoing child support.appellant filed opposition.
at a hearing concerning the payment of child support,the court indicated its tentative ruling was to order appellant to split the trust into equal shares for kenneth and daniel marinos pursuant to the terms of the trust.as to kenneth marinos share,the court intended to grant the petition by dcss for the payment of arrearages and to make orders regarding future support payments.counsel for appellant indicated the trust had already been equally divided.appellant stated that marinos share of the trust contained approximately in liquid assets.appellant counsel indicated that had been distributed from the trust for the payment of marinos attorney fees,by a previous court order.counsel for solace disputed this amount,claiming it was higher.
the court ruled that the proper interpretation of probate code section,subdivision c is that it the policy of the state of california that child support obligations be honored and that a trust beneficiary and trustee can not utilize spendthrift clauses in a trust agreement to avoid the requisite payment of child support in the state of california.the trial court,pending final calculations by dcss,ordered a partial payment to solace of in funds and a partial payment to chantel bunch of in funds.the trial court specified that the funds due to sheri marinos approximately were payable directly to dcss.the trial court awarded ongoing monthly support of to stephanie solace support of per month to sheri marinos and per month to chantel bunch.the monthly support payments were to commence july.
discussion 
appellant reasons that his broad discretion as trustee,combined with the spendthrift clause in the trust instrument,make probate code section inapplicable to the trust.appellant claims that the court may not override or compel the trustee discretion by forcing the trustee to pay trust funds in satisfaction of a support judgment.he acknowledges that the court is authorized to order payments from the trust.he contends,however,that the court authority is limited to those payments that the trustee has chosen to make in the exercise of his discretion.
statutory interpretation 
the trial court statutory interpretation is a question of law which we review de novo.harbor fumigation,county of san diego air pollution control dist.th,d.when presented with a question of statutory construction,our primary task is to ascertain legislative intent to effect the purpose of the statute.allen contracting cal th,d.we begin by examining the statutory language because it generally is the most reliable indicator of legislative intent.citation.we give the language its usual and ordinary meaning,and i f there is no ambiguity,then we presume the lawmakers meant what they said,and the plain meaning of the language governs.citation.ibid.if the statutory language is ambiguous,we consider the legislative history and select the construction that comports most closely with the legislative intent.we must promote,rather than defeat,the general purpose of the statute.torres parkhouse tire service,cal th,d.
spendthrift,support and discretionary trusts 
as background for our statutory interpretation,we briefly address the distinctions between spendthrift,support and discretionary trusts.a spendthrift trust is created when the trust instrument provides that the beneficiary may not assign his interest and the trust is not subject to the claims of creditors.witkin,summary of cal.law ed.trusts,rest d trusts.under a support trust,the trustee is directed to pay no more than is necessary for the education or support of the beneficiary.witkin,supra,rest d trusts,com.a.a discretionary trust directs the trustee to pay whatever amount the trustee sees fit.witkin,supra,rest d trusts.
a true discretionary trust,as it developed in england and as it is recognized in california,involves a discretion to pay over income or principal or to withhold it.it is not an abuse of discretion if there is no improper motivation for the trustee to pay nothing.fns.omitted.memorandum relating to spendthrift and related trusts by professor russell niles,consultant to cal.law revision com.appellant and solace characterize the trust as a spendthrift trust,while dcss claims it is a discretionary trust.for the purpose of our analysis,it is unnecessary to characterize the type of trust before us.it is undisputed that appellant alone has discretion to make payments from the trust.marinos has no right to compel such payments.
newly enacted probate code sections 
in,the law revision commission recommended enactment of new probate statutes to improve existing law relating to spendthrift trusts.the commission stated that california trust law is now a patchwork.the various parts are largely uncoordinated a major purpose of this recommendation is to reorganize and consolidate the scattered provisions of existing law.fn.omitted.selected trust probate legislation with official comments cal.law revision,recommendations.there were two objectives to reduce the ability of a general creditor to reach a beneficiary interest in a trust and to give greater rights to support creditors.child support creditors were elevated to the status of preferred creditors and permitted to reach a beneficiary interest in the trust,despite the existence of a spendthrift clause.memorandum relating to probate code,comments of cal.state bar to cal.law revision com.
in order to effect these changes,the legislature enacted sections,governing restrictions on transfer of trust income or principal.where a trust instrument provides that a beneficiary interest in income or principal is not subject to voluntary or involuntary transfer a spendthrift clause,the beneficiary interest may not be transferred and is not subject to enforcement of a money judgment until paid to the beneficiary,subds.a b.the same is true of a trust created for the beneficiary education or support.
there are certain exceptions to these principles,outlined in sections.a creditor may reach a beneficiary interest when the settlor is also the beneficiary there is a claim for child support or spousal support the beneficiary owes restitution to crime victims due to the beneficiary criminal conduct there is a claim for reimbursement for public support and a beneficiary income exceeds the amount necessary for education and support.here we are concerned primarily with section,governing claims for child support.
special rights of support creditors probate code section 
under section,a claimant for delinquent child or spousal support can reach a beneficiary interest in a trust.support claimants are preferred creditors and entitled to rights unavailable to a general creditor.cal.law revision com,west ann.ed.foll,subd.d witkin,summary of cal.law ed.trusts.a minor right to support may not be defeated by a spendthrift provision in a trust instrument,subd.d.although a trust is a spendthrift trust or a trust for support,the interest of the beneficiary can be reached in satisfaction of a money judgment against the beneficiary for child or spousal support.cal.law revision com,west ann.ed.foll.a spendthrift provision is not effective to exempt the trust from enforcement of a judgment for support of a minor child ibid.
legislative history underlying section 
although the legislative history behind section establishes that a support creditor may reach a beneficiary interest in a spendthrift trust,this is not our inquiry.the issue before us is whether a court may order a trustee to exercise its discretion to satisfy a support judgment from trust income or principal when the trustee has chosen not to make a payment to the beneficiary.
under section,subdivision b,when a trust instrument gives a beneficiary the right to compel the trustee to make payments to the beneficiary,the trial court may order the trustee to satisfy a support judgment from both present and future payments.subdivision b makes no reference to a trustee exercise of discretion 
by contrast,section,subdivision c contains language referring to a trustee exercise of discretion whether or not the beneficiary has the right under the trust to compel the trustee to pay income or principal or both to or for the benefit of the beneficiary,the court may,to the extent that the court determines it is equitable and reasonable under the circumstances of the particular case,order the trustee to satisfy all or part of the support judgment out of all or part of future payments that the trustee,pursuant to the exercise of the trustee discretion,determines to make to or for the benefit of the beneficiary.italics added.appellant claims that under subdivision c,the trial court must defer to the trustee exercise of discretion when fashioning a support order.
section is drawn from a wisconsin statute relating to enforcement of child support.it also reflects the public policy articulated in the restatement second of trusts,section,subdivision a,that a trust beneficiary interest may be reached to satisfy a support judgment.cal.law revision com,west ann,supra,foll.the wisconsin statute provides claims for child support.notwithstanding any provision in the creating instrument or subs.and,upon application of a person having a valid order directing a beneficiary to make payments for support of the beneficiary child,the court may b in the case of a beneficiary under a discretionary trust,order the trustee to satisfy part or all of the claim out of part or all of future payments of income or principal which are to be made pursuant to the exercise of the trustee discretion in favor of such a beneficiary,subd,italics added.
the question becomes may a court order a trustee to exercise its discretion to make a payment to the beneficiary because there are no california cases interpreting section,we turn to the single decision interpreting the wisconsin child support statute.section,subdivision b grants courts the authority to order trustees to satisfy a child support obligation directly from discretionary payments that the trustees have decided to authorize,thereby circumventing potential opposition of the beneficiary and reducing the opportunity for avoidance of support obligations.grohmann grohmann.
in grohmann,husband was both the settlor and beneficiary under a discretionary trust.wife argued that husband undistributed trust income should be used in the calculation of child support,and the trial court had authority to order payment of child support from the trust.the wisconsin court of appeal accepted wife first argument,but ruled that her second argument was premature.it stated that wife had not established that she was a judgment creditor,thus the court had no authority to order payment from the trust.grohmann grohmann,supra,at.
nothing in the statute section,subdivision b authorizes a court to relieve trustees of their discretion over when a trust shall make payments to or on behalf of a beneficiary,or to substitute its own discretion for that of the trustees.under the statute,the decision to distribute trust income remains with the trustees.grohmann grohmann,supra,at.the wisconsin supreme court affirmed the ruling of the court of appeal.it concluded that wife judgment creditor argument was premature because she had failed to show that husband had not met his support obligation.grohmann grohmann.
trustee exercise of discretion 
the facts before us are quite different than those in grohmann.here,solace and dcss are judgment creditors to whom marinos owes over in past due support and in ongoing monthly support.we acknowledge that existing law gives a trustee the discretion to determine whether payments are made and in what amount.however,in exercising its discretion to make or withhold payments,a trustee may not act in bad faith or with an improper motive.
where discretion is conferred upon the trustee with respect to the exercise of a power,its exercise is not subject to control by the court,except to prevent an abuse by the trustee of his discretion.rest d trusts,witkin,summary of cal.law,supra,trusts.the court will not interfere with a trustee exercise of discretion unless the trustee,in exercising or failing to exercise the power acts dishonestly,or with an improper even though not a dishonest motive,or fails to use his judgment,or acts beyond the bounds of reasonable judgment.rest d trusts,com.e.when a trust instrument confers absolute,sole or uncontrolled discretion,the trustee shall act in accordance with fiduciary principles and shall not act in bad faith or in disregard of the purposes of the trust,subd.a.to determine the extent of the trustee discretion,we look to the intention of the trustor,as manifested in the trust instrument,estate of marre cal d,estate of ferrall cal d.
according to the language of the trust,helen marinos wished to provide for the support,care,maintenance and education of her sons.upon the death of either son,the trust estate was to be administered for the benefit of his children to the spouse of a deceased child of the grantor.although neither son is deceased,the trust instrument reflects helen marinos intent to provide support to her grandchildren.
