our main concern in this bankruptcy appeal is whether the burdens and elements of proof were correctly applied in a bankruptcy trustee action to trace and recover assets that a debtor into a spendthrift trust of which he is the beneficiary.the bankruptcy and district courts held that,although the debtor and his business associates used the trust in a scheme to defraud his creditors,the trust could not be declared a sham because under texas law the doctrine of sham or illusory trust applies only in marital litigation.instead,those courts held that the bankruptcy trustee,in order to pursue the remedy of tracing assets from the debtor into the hands of the spendthrift trust trustee and recovering those assets for the bankruptcy estate,had the burden of proving that those assets were identical with the debtor former property,that they were products of such property,or that they had been commingled with other assets of the spendthrift trust.those courts further concluded that the bankruptcy trustee carried his burden with respect to certain assets of the debtor but failed with respect to others.accordingly,they held that only the specific assets in the hands of the spendthrift trust trustee that the bankruptcy trustee successfully traced and proved to be identical with former property of the debtor would be included in the bankruptcy estate.finally,both courts agreed that bradley should not be granted a discharge from bankruptcy because of his concealment of the assets.we affirm the judgments of the bankruptcy and district courts for the reasons hereinafter assigned.
background 
gary bradley was a major real estate developer in austin,texas who maintained a business partnership with james gressett for a number of years.bradley and gressett had a private,unrecorded agreement with respect to assets and legal entities they owned or controlled.bradley share consisted of of the real estate holdings and of the estate investments gressett share consisted of of the real estate holdings and of the estate investments.bradley consistently avoided holding real estate and other assets in his own name.as a result,his actual interests in various assets and entities were ostensibly owned by gressett and others.
in the,the fdic obtained a judgment for over million against bradley,gressett,and their large real estate development company,circle c development.gressett filed for chapter bankruptcy protection in the early and received a discharge.in,bradley and gressett decided to separate their business interests by dividing,transforming,and transferring assets representing bradley share into a trust to be formed for the purpose of protecting his assets from creditors.bradley beutel,bradley cousin and close business associate,was chosen to identify,reconfigure,and transfer assets of values equivalent to bradley share into the trust.
on may,kaye bradley hulse,bradley sister,created the lazarus exempt trust the trust,which the bankruptcy court described as a discretionary crummey trust,designating her brother,bradley,as the primary beneficiary.hulse also designated bradley son as the secondary beneficiary and beutel as the trustee.in creating the trust,hulse referred to herself as its settlor and funded it with a donation.she made no other donations to the trust,although she did loan substantial amounts of money to bradley who in turn loaned them to the trust or to entities owned by the trust.prior to trial,all claims against hulse were dismissed.
although the bankruptcy court did not find that hulse created the trust for fraudulent purposes,it found that bradley and gressett used the creation of the trust by her for their own purposes,as the timely and appropriate vehicle to accomplish the final separation of their business affairs.in fact,the bankruptcy court stated 
for those of us looking in,this is an incredibly fraudulent scheme engaged in primarily by bradley,gressett and,with the trust formation,beutel as well,to hide the assets bradley owned,to place them into the trust when formed,and to preserve them from the clutches of bradley creditors,the fdic and the irs.
furthermore,the bankruptcy court found as a fact that the trust was merely a sham illusory and that all the trust assets should be deemed assets of bradley chapter bankruptcy estate.but the court refused to declare the trust a sham as a matter of law because such cause of action,to legally declare a trust to be a sham or illusion,only exists under texas law with regard to marital relationships.nevertheless,the bankruptcy court,for purposes of appeal,in case the reviewing appellate court should determine such a cause of action to exist,also found as additional supporting facts that the trust was funded with only and the settlor made no further donations to the trust.the great majority of the assets the trust acquired in the first two million in either to have been owned by bradley or held for him by gressett and others prior to the trust creation.beutel,as trustee,never made formal distributions from the trust,but bradley obtained cash from the trust any time he needed it.bradley was employed by entities owned by the trust and was paid a salary of about per month.cash was shifted between the trust and its various entities on an as needed basis.bradley was significantly involved in the management of the trust affairs on a daily basis.gressett,bradley,and beutel conducted their business ventures out of the same office,often using a common business name,employees of the entities,and a centralized system.the trust cash was disbursed to bradley and others on an as needed basis without respect to who produced it,which is precisely how the entities operated before they were placed in the trust.finally,there was continual backdating of documents in an effort to breathe legitimacy into the transactions amongst and between the trust,bradley,and his associates.
on july,bradley filed for chapter bankruptcy.ronald ingalls was appointed to serve as bankruptcy trustee.this appeal arises out of three separate but related adversary proceedings,all of which were consolidated to address the issue of whether bradley some or all of the trust assets in an alleged effort to conceal those assets from the bankruptcy estate.a trial was held on april through april.
on october,the bankruptcy court concluded that certain trust assets were and thus,are to be turned over to ingalls as property of the bankruptcy estate,other trust assets may have been but ingalls a did not carry his burden of tracing these transfers from bradley to assets in the trust and b did not timely and diligently pursue his other available remedies with respect to those assets and bradley use of the trust to conceal the assets constituted a continuing concealment warranting denial of his discharge from bankruptcy under a a.ingalls,bradley,and beutel,as trustee of the trust,each filed a timely notice of appeal.
on august,the district court affirmed.ingalls,bradley,and thomas thompson,who replaced beutel as trustee of the trust,each filed a timely notice of appeal.
ii.standard of review 
we review the bankruptcy court decision under the same standards used by the district court conclusions of law and mixed law and fact questions are reviewed de novo,while findings of fact are reviewed for clear error.see plunk yaquinto in re plunk,cir of dallas.faulkner in re stonebridge,cir.
iii.discussion 
under of the bankruptcy code,a bankruptcy estate is created at the commencement of the bankruptcy case.the bankruptcy estate includes,with some exceptions,all legal or equitable interests of the debtor in property as of the commencement of the case.a.one exception is the spendthrift trust exception.in general,a spendthrift trust is one in which the right of the beneficiary to future payments of income or capital can not be voluntarily transferred by the beneficiary or reached by his or her creditors.in the matter of shearn moody,in re moody,cir.pursuant to c,the property of a spendthrift trust is excluded from the bankruptcy estate if those assets are protected from the beneficiary creditors under state law.shurley texas commerce,in re shurley,cir.under texas law,which is applicable to this case,a spendthrift provision in a trust protects trust property from the beneficiary creditors unless the settlor is also a beneficiary of the trust.d see also shurley,at.this rule is known as the rule.as this court has recognized,the rationale behind the rule is obvious a debtor should not be able to escape claims of his creditors by himself setting up a spendthrift trust and naming himself as beneficiary.shurley,at.
issues raised and argued by ingalls 
illusory or sham trust 
ingalls argues that the bankruptcy and district courts erred because they stopped short of declaring that the trust is a sham or illusory trust and that the trust property is totally included in the bankruptcy estate.we disagree in westerfeld huckaby,the court stated that t he doctrine of illusory trusts in its inception and in its application applies only to marital property situations.on appeal,the texas supreme court affirmed,holding that the court of civil appeals correctly held that an application of the illusory trust doctrine,as enunciated in land marshall,is limited to instances in which a spouse property is used to fund a trust.westerfeld huckaby.to date,the texas courts have not expanded the doctrine beyond the marital property context.accordingly,the bankruptcy court did not err in concluding that the illusory trust doctrine is so limited under texas law and therefore is not available in this case.
elements and burden of proof in tracing and recovering property 
ingalls argues that the bankruptcy court erred in assigning him the burden of following,tracing,and showing that property formerly owned by bradley was identical to property held in the trust,rather than placing a reverse burden on bradley or beutel,sub.nom.thompson,to demonstrate that the trust property was not.alternatively,he argues that he met his burden of proving that substantially all of the trust property was by either having traced that property to identical property held in the trust or by having traced it to property with which it had become commingled or by some other methodology.
although the elements and burden of proof issues with respect to property appear to be res nova in texas the parties suggest,and we agree,that the situation here is analogous to that in which the beneficiary of a trust is given the remedy of tracing and recovering trust assets that have been wrongfully diverted or misappropriated by the trustee.
in general,the initial burden of tracing and identifying property is upon the claimant who seeks to follow it into the hands of another.schuyler littlefield.in the case of diversion or misappropriation by a trustee,the beneficiary may follow and recover the trust corpus if any property in the hands of the trustee can be traced and identified as the original property of the beneficiary.under texas law 
before a beneficiary can claim specific property in the enforcement of a trust,however,he or she must show that it is identical with his or her or the trust property,that it is the fruit or product of such property,or that the property has been commingled with the fund against which the beneficiary asserts the trust.
jur.trusts footnotes omitted citing continental bank weems,walter heller barnes,brooks cherry,blumenthal nussbaum.
applying the foregoing principles by analogy,we conclude that the bankruptcy court correctly used them in the present case and did not commit clear error in its factual findings.after considering voluminous documentary evidence and the testimony and depositions of bradley,gressett,beutel,and many other witnesses,the bankruptcy court found that ingalls had traced and proven that a number of assets had been transferred from bradley to the spendthrift trust that were identical to assets still in the hands of the trust trustee.although we will not attempt to completely itemize those assets,the bankruptcy court found that they included the phoenix holdings,which included the spillar and pfluger tracts or ranches,the yates property,the lazarus investments assets,and certain notes receivable.on the other hand,the bankruptcy court found that,although ingalls had traced other assets from bradley to the trust,he had failed to show that those identical assets or products of those assets were still in the trust or that they had become commingled with trust assets.those assets included the streetman stock proceeds,the acreage,the proceeds from the thompson medtech transaction,and the funds received from the sale of the rasaca austin,partnership interest.
ingalls argument that he adequately traced all of the alleged assets from bradley to identical assets or products of those assets,or to commingled assets,still in the trust,is without merit.his arguments are not supported by the record and,for the most part,are based on a misunderstanding of the burden of proof he was required to satisfy.the burden of proving that assets went into the trust and remained there is upon the claimant seeking to apply the remedy of tracing.see bogert trusts and trustees,at citing schuyler,at.sims falvey,andrews estate of andrews.the remedy of tracing is not available where the claimant merely shows the receipt of trust property by the defendant and makes no case as to its subsequent history or its existence among the present assets of the defendant,nor when trust property has been disposed of in such a way as to leave no product.see bogert trusts and trustees,citing adams champion.in re united cigar stores of america,cir.it is simply not enough that the property claimed may have been the product of trust funds at one time.id.at citing bettendorf metal wheel mast,cir.
ingalls is correct that in some instances the tracing burden shifts when the trustee wrongfully commingles assets with his own.see,eaton husted,logan logan,peirce sheldon petroleum,ass of davidian seventh day adventists,ass of davidian seventh day adventists.in general,when a trustee wrongfully mixes trust funds of an indeterminable amount with his or her own private funds,the burden is on the trustee to distinguish his or her funds and the amount thereof from those of the beneficiary,and if the trustee can not do so,the whole commingled fund or the property purchased with that fund becomes subject to a trust in favor of the beneficiary.logan,at peirce,at.in the present case,however,ingalls has not demonstrated that any of bradley assets traceable to the trust were mixed,interspersed,or integrated with the trustee private assets or other assets still in the trust.the mere fact that ingalls traced specific assets to the trust is insufficient to show commingling so long as the assets traced to the trust retained their individual integrity see wichita royalty city nat.bank of wichita falls,commercial state bank algeo,farrow farrow.
ingalls further argues that the bankruptcy court erred in rejecting his use of the proportionate contribution method for calculating the portion of the trust we conclude,however,that ingalls failed to prove the facts necessary to show the value of the assets in comparison to the entire trust corpus at the time they first entered the trust,rendering the proportionate contribution method functionally impossible to calculate.as the bankruptcy court correctly recognized,the complexity of the many transactions in this case make this an exercise impossible to conduct based on the record established.after thoroughly examining the record,we agree that the bankruptcy court did not err by refusing to apply the proportionate contribution method because the evidence prevented the accurate and effective valuation of trust assets under that method.
accordingly,we agree with the bankruptcy court conclusion that ingalls carried his burden of tracing and identifying some but not all of the trust assets as having been by bradley.
constructive trust 
finally,ingalls argues that the bankruptcy court erred in failing to impose a constructive trust on virtually all of the trust assets as having been as of the petition date.we affirm the judgment of the bankruptcy court in rejecting this theory because the record is devoid of proper pleadings and proof in support of ingall claim for a constr
