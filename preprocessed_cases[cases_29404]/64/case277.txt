factual and procedural background 
facts as pled in plaintiff complaint.
stewart is the daughter of gowisea koontz gowisea,the predeceased spouse of wilmer.in early december,gowisea,who was dying of cancer,entered into an oral agreement with wilmer regarding the distribution of gowisea property upon her death.gowisea,in the presence of wilmer and several family witnesses,stated she would not execute a will disposing of her property and would not convert title to their home on street in los angeles from joint tenancy to tenancy in common,in exchange for wilmer promise to execute a will leaving percent of the street property to stewart and the remaining percent to two grandchildren.although stewart urged gowisea to put the agreement in writing,gowisea assured stewart she trusted wilmer to perform the agreement.gowisea died intestate on december.
in march,wilmer executed a will devising percent of the street property to the two grandchildren,leaving stewart with no interest in the property.wilmer died on october.
procedural history.
on july,stewart filed a creditor claim in wilmer probate proceeding,asserting she was entitled to or more from wilmer estate,pursuant to an oral contract for one half the value of the street property.
on july,the administrator rejected the creditor claim,using a mandatory judicial council form form,captioned allowance or rejection of creditor claim.on the form is the following advisement rejected claims from the date notice of rejection is given,the creditor must act on the rejected claim,file a lawsuit as follows claim due within three months after notice of rejection.claim not due within three months after the claim becomes due.the rejection form was mailed to stewart on july.
after receiving the rejection notice,stewart filed the instant action against the administrator of wilmer estate on october.the complaint alleged causes of action for breach of an oral contract,fraud,negligent misrepresentation,breach of fiduciary duty and equitable estoppel.by way of relief,stewart sought,inter alia,s pecific performance for a interest in the real property i n the alternative,damages to equal of the value of the subject property 
the administrator demurred,asserting stewart claims were barred by the statute of limitations set forth in section.the administrator stated,all of stewart causes of action are barred by the statute of limitations that relates to the time that an action can be brought against a decedent estate section states that an action arising from a promise or agreement with the decedent to make a will may only be commenced against a decedent within one year of decedent death and that all other statute of limitations periods do not apply.because wilmer died on october,and stewart did not file suit until october,the action was.
in opposition,stewart asserted she timely commenced her action on october,within three months of the date of service of notice of rejection of her creditor claim.stewart cited the advisement on the rejection form that suit could be brought within three months of the date the claim was rejected.stewart also contended that in view of this language on the notice of rejection form,the administrator was equitably estopped to assert the statute of limitations of section as a bar to the action.
the administrator argued in her reply papers that the action was governed by the specific provision of section,relating to the commencement of an action to enforce a claim that arises from a promise or agreement with a decedent to distribution from an estate the filing of a creditor claim does not toll the statute of limitations for an action on a contract to make a will and the administrator was not estopped to assert the statute of limitations because she merely used a mandatory judicial council form to give notice of rejection of creditor claim and did not make any affirmative representations to stewart concerning the statute of limitations.
on january,the matter came on for hearing.the trial court sustained the administrator demurrer without leave to amend.the trial court ruled section is controlling and the statute does not contain a tolling provision for actions involving creditor claims.
stewart filed a timely notice of appeal from the order of dismissal.
contentions 
stewart contends the trial court erred in finding the provisions of section are applicable to her claims,rather than the provisions of section,which provide the limitation period is tolled by the submission of a creditor claim the doctrines of estoppel and waiver preclude application of the limitations period set forth in section to her claims in this action and to the extent that the allegations in her complaint are uncertain or create some ambiguity with regard to the basis of her claims and the relief being sought,she should be allowed leave to amend.

here,the essential issue presented is whether the pleading shows on its face that stewart claim is,so as to preclude stewart from stating a cause of action.
stewart action arose out of an alleged breach by wilmer of his promise to gowisea to execute a will leaving percent of the street property to stewart therefore,trial court properly held stewart action is governed by the limitations period of section,one year from wilmer death,with no tolling for a creditor claim.
