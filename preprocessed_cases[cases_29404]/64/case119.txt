defendants appeal the district court dismissal of their motion to terminate a permanent plan for charitable donations from an inmate welfare fund.this fund was created following the settlement of a class action lawsuit filed on behalf of inmates in the glynn county detention center gcdc.the question here is whether the plan should be terminated pursuant to the prison litigation reform act plra.after review and oral argument,we reverse the district court order dismissing the motion to terminate.
background 
on december,john rowe,and three other individuals filed a class action suit on behalf of themselves and fellow inmates in the gcdc,alleging unconstitutional conditions of confinement following class certification,the of inmates the inmates entered a settlement agreement with defendants,which included county sheriff thomas slick jones,two gcdc administrators,and the glynn county board of commissioners glynn county defendants.the district court approved the settlement agreement and incorporated it into a consent order entered on december.
in,the inmates filed a petition for contempt seeking judicial enforcement of the consent order.on december,both parties entered a stipulation that dismissed the inmates petition for contempt and provided,inter alia,for the creation of the inmate welfare fund the fund.the stipulation stated that the fund shall be used to generally promote the welfare of the inmate population and may be used to defray the cost of items furnished to the indigent inmates using the profits from the gcdc commissary and pay telephones.attorneys for both parties and the district court judge signed the stipulation.
by,the fund had accumulated a large surplus.current glynn county sheriff wayne bennett filed a motion to donate the excess funds to charity.the district court granted the motion and authorized sheriff bennett to donate the surplus to local charities on behalf of the inmates.in april,the inmates filed a motion for a permanent plan to make annual donations from the fund to local charities.over the glynn county defendants objection,the district court granted the inmates motion.on august,the district court issued an order that established a permanent plan that created an independently administered charitable trust and ordered the sheriff to send the fund surplus on the of each month to that trust,from which annual donations would be made to local charities.the order stated that this court shall retain jurisdiction of this matter such that the trust shall remain under the supervision of this court.none of the defendants or their counsel signed the court order or the attached trust agreement,which was expressly incorporated into the court order.
in june,the glynn county defendants filed a motion to terminate the consent order,pursuant to the termination provisions of the plra.see b a iii,b.the inmates did not oppose the motion and agreed that past constitution al violations have been redressed,and no ongoing or current constitutional violations exist in the gcdc.accordingly,the district court entered a final order on september,that stated,the court finds that the discrimination addressed by this litigation has been corrected and the plra requires immediate termination of the consent order.however,the district court also noted that its order promulgated a permanent plan establishing a charitable trust and found that this charitable trust should continue,stating that its order of august,should remain in full force and effect pending further order of this court.the district court vacated all of its previous orders in this case except the order and ended all prospective relief.the district court judge signed the final order,and attorneys for both parties signed beneath the consented to notation.
in november,the glynn county defendants filed a motion to terminate the permanent plan.the district court held an evidentiary hearing on the motion in february,during which sheriff bennett testified that the funds should be spent on the gcdc itself due to the substantial administrative costs incurred in operating the commissary on march,the district court dismissed the motion to terminate the permanent plan.the district court found that the final order preserving the permanent plan was a private settlement agreement,not a consent decree subject to the plra termination provisions.specifically,the district court determined that w hile the trust was created by court order,it was continued and ratified in as a result of a private agreement to settle the case.accordingly,the district court concluded that it had no authority to terminate or modify the private settlement agreement.
the glynn county defendants timely appealed.
ii.discussion 
the glynn county defendants contend that the orders creating the charitable trust and continuing the charitable trust were prospective relief that must be terminated under the plra.we first review the relevant statutory provisions of the plra before considering the orders at issue in this case 
in,congress enacted the plra,which limits the scope of prospective relief that courts may grant in cases challenging prison conditions.see cason seckinger,cir.under the plra,prospective relief with respect to prison conditions shall extend no further than necessary to correct the violation of the federal right a a.moreover,the plra limits a court authority to continue to enforce existing prospective relief entered before the enactment of the plra.cason,at.upon motion by any party,prospective relief entered on or before the date of the plra enactment is terminated two years after the date of enactment.b a iii.a defendant or intervener is also entitled to immediate termination of prospective relief in the absence of a court finding that the relief is narrowly drawn,extends no further than necessary to correct the violation,and is the least intrusive means necessary to correct the violation id.b.these termination provisions do not apply and prospective relief remains in force,however,if the relief remains necessary to correct a current and ongoing violation of the federal right and otherwise satisfies the restrictions in a a.id.b.
the application of these termination provisions hinges on the nature of the prospective relief.the plra defines relief as all relief in any form that may be granted or approved by the court,and includes consent decrees but does not include private settlement agreements,and prospective relief includes all relief other than compensatory monetary damages.id.g,g.while consent decrees are subject to the plra restrictions on prospective relief,id.c,the plra shields private settlement agreements from these restrictions,id.c a.section c a states,n othing in this section shall preclude parties from entering into a private settlement agreement that does not comply with the limitations on relief,if the terms of that agreement are not subject to court enforcement other than the reinstatement of the civil proceeding that the agreement settled.id.
neither party disputes that the plra termination provisions are applicable to consent decrees but not to private settlement agreements.moreover,neither party disputes that no current and ongoing federal law violations exist that would justify continued enforcement of prospective relief.id.b.the sole issue is whether the orders creating the charitable trust and requiring surplus payments from the fund to that trust were consent decrees or private settlement agreements.
in order to parse the distinction between consent decrees and private settlement agreements in the plra,we turn first to the plain language of the statute.see wachovia bank,united states,cir see also fmc holliday,d noting that courts generally assume that the ordinary meaning of statutory language accurately expresses congress legislative purpose.the plra defines a private settlement agreement as an agreement entered into among the parties that is not subject to judicial enforcement other than the reinstatement of the civil proceeding that the agreement settled.id.g.a consent decree is defined as any other relief entered by the court that is based in whole or in part upon the consent or acquiescence
