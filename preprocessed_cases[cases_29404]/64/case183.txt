introduction 
in this proceeding to determine the rights of the parties under the holographic will of irving duke the trial court entered judgment in favor of robert radin and seymour radin,heirs at law of irving who were not named in the will,and against the jewish national fund jnf and the city of hope coh,two charitable organizations named in the will.the trial court concluded that the will was unambiguous,and did not make any provision for the disposition of irving property in the event his wife predeceased him by several years,as actually occurred,and therefore intestacy resulted.because we fully concur with the trial court interpretation of the will and conclude that the applicable law compels the result reached by the trial court,we affirm the judgment.
factual and procedural background 
in october,irving prepared a holographic will.the relevant provisions stated as follows i hereby give,bequeath and devise all of the property of which i may die possessed,whether real,personal or mixed,whether heretofore or hereafter acquired to my beloved wife,beatrice schecter duke second to my brother,harry duke,i leave the sum of one dollar and no more.third should my wife beatrice schecter duke and i die at the same moment,my estate is to be equally divided one half is to be donated to the city of hope in the name and loving memory of my sister,rose duke radin.one half is to be donated to the jewish national fund to plant trees in israel in the names and loving memory of my mother and father bessie and isaac duke.irving indicated he had intentionally omitted all other persons,whether heirs or otherwise,not specifically mentioned,and specifically disinherited all persons claiming to be his heirs.finally,he included a no contest clause,which provided that i f any heir,devisee or legatee,or any other person or persons,shall either directly or indirectly,seek to invalidate this will,or any part thereof,then i hereby give and bequeath to such person or persons the sum of one dollar and no more,in lieu of any other share or interest in my estate.in august,irving drafted a holographic codicil that stated we hereby agree that all of our assets are community property.
beatrice,irving wife,died in july.irving died in november,without children,predeceased children,or issue.a los angeles deputy public administrator found irving will in his safe deposit box at his bank,and the will was admitted to probate.irving estate was valued in excess of million.
respondents seymour and robert radin are irving sole surviving relatives they are his nephews,the sons of irving sister,rose duke radin.
in march,coh and jnf filed a petition for probate and for letters of administration with will annexed.they requested the appointment of matthew bernstein,an employee of jnf,as administrator.the requested letters were issued and filed in may,and bernstein was appointed as the administrator with will annexed.
in october,the radins filed a petition for determination of entitlement to estate distribution,and for removal of bernstein as administrator.they agreed the will was valid,but argued that the condition under which coh and jnf were to take if irving and beatrice died at the same moment had not been satisfied.the will did not address distribution of the estate where,as had occurred,beatrice predeceased irving by several years.the radins contended that the result was a complete intestacy,and the estate should therefore pass to themselves as irving closest living relatives.
the radins moved for summary judgment.coh filed opposition to the motion,in which jnf and bernstein joined.they asserted in opposition that the trial court should consider extrinsic evidence of irving testamentary intent.to wit,in august,irving invited a senior gift planning officer for city of hope to his home.he executed a city of hope gift annuity agreement and gave the coh representative checks totaling.on january,he did the same thing.during this second meeting,he told the coh representative that he was leaving his estate to city of hope and to jewish national fund.it was the representative impression from their conversation that irving had already prepared a will that included gifts to coh and jnf,not that he intended to do so in the future.later the same month,on january,irving once again executed a charitable gift annuity agreement,and gave the coh representative checks totaling.
the radins filed a reply,asserting that because the will was not ambiguous,the court was not permitted to consider extrinsic evidence.
the trial court initially denied the motion for summary judgment for reasons not relevant here.the radins filed a motion for reconsideration.the trial court granted the motion for reconsideration,and thereafter ordered entry of judgment in favor of the radins.
the court found that the will was not ambiguous or uncertain,and therefore the court could not resort to extrinsic evidence in order to ascertain the intent of the testator.in reaching its conclusions,the court relied on estate of barnes cal d barnes.we shall discuss barnes in some detail below because we conclude that it governs the outcome in this case.
this timely appeal followed.

under summary judgment law,any party to an action,whether plaintiff or defendant,may move the court for summary judgment in his favor on a cause of action,claim or defense code civ,subd.a a plaintiff contend ing that there is no defense to the action,a defendant contend ing that the action has no merit ibid.the court must grant the motion if all the papers submitted show that there is no triable issue as to any material fact,subd.c that is,there is no issue requiring a trial as to any fact that is necessary under the pleadings and,ultimately,the law citations and that the moving party is entitled to a judgment as a matter of law code civ,subd.c.aguilar atlantic richfield cal th,aguilar.
in moving for summary judgment,a plaintiff has met his burden of showing that there is no defense to a cause of action if he has proved each element of the cause of action entitling him to judgment on that cause of action.once the plaintiff has met that burden,the burden shifts to the defendant to show that a triable issue of one or more material facts exists as to that cause of action or a defense thereto.the defendant must set forth the specific facts showing that a triable issue of material fact exists as to that cause of action or a defense thereto.code civ,subd.o.aguilar,supra,cal th at.

ii.no ambiguity exists in the will,and a finding of intestacy is inescapable 
the will under consideration here is very similar to the one construed by the supreme court in barnes,supra,cal d.there,the testatrix prepared a will declaring she was married,had no children,and intended by the will to dispose of all of her property.the will provided that all of her property was to go to her husband,who was also named the executor.the will further provided that i n the event that the death of my husband and myself shall occur simultaneously or within two weeks of each other,or in the same common accident or calamity,or under any circumstances causing doubt as to which of us survives the other,then,and in such event,i hereby give,devise and bequeath all of my estate of whatsoever kind and character and wheresoever situated,to robert earl henderson petitioner.the will also included a no contest clause and a disinheritance clause.id.at fn.
the husband of the testatrix predeceased her by more than five years.upon the death of the testatrix,she was survived by heirs at law that included her brothers and sisters,and a nephew and nieces children of brothers and sisters who predeceased her.petitioner was not an heir at law because his mother,the testatrix sister,survived.barnes,supra,cal d at.petitioner contended that he was entitled to succeed to the entire estate.over the objection of the heirs at law,the trial court admitted evidence offered by petitioner that a special relationship existed between him and the testatrix when she executed the will about years before her death and thereafter.the trial court concluded that there was some uncertainty on the face of the will,and found in favor of petitioner.
the supreme court reversed the judgment,finding that the will ma d e no disposition whatever of the property of testatrix in the event she outlived her husband by several years,as she did.barnes,supra,cal d at.the court observed that a will is to be construed according to the intention of the testator,and so as to avoid intestacy,citing former.however,a court may not write a will which the testator did not write.to say that because a will does not dispose of all of the testator property it is ambiguous and must be construed so as to prevent intestacy,either total or partial,is to use a rule of construction as the reason for construction.but a will is never open to construction merely because it does not dispose of all of the property.courts are not permitted in order to avoid a conclusion of intestacy to adopt a construction based on conjecture as to what the testator may have intended although not expressed.citation.estate of beldon cal d.barnes,supra,at.
the court noted that the will demonstrated an awareness by testatrix that she might have no further opportunity to designate an alternate if she and her husband died simultaneously,so she named petitioner.but she did not include a provision or any indication of her intent if,as occurred,she was afforded sufficient time to review the will following her husband death.barnes,supra,cal d at.if she had considered the lack of a disposition of her property after her husband death,she might have chosen petitioner,or she might have relaxed her disinheritance of other relatives,or selected different beneficiaries.under such circumstances any selection by the courts now would be to indulge in forbidden conjecture.see estate of maxwell d.the declared intention of testatrix to dispose of all of her property does not authorize the courts under the guise of construction to supply dispositive clauses lacking from the will.citation.barnes,supra,at.
the existence of the disinheritance clause did not alter the court conclusion.it is settled that a disinheritance clause,no matter how broadly or strongly phrased,operates only to prevent a claimant from taking under the will itself,or to obviate a claim of pretermission.such a clause does not and can not operate to prevent the heirs at law from taking under the statutory rules of inheritance when the decedent has died intestate as to any or all of his property.citations.barnes,supra,cal d at.
the court further concluded that the extrinsic evidence offered by petitioner about his relationship with the testatrix d id not assist in interpreting the will.it may serve to explain why petitioner was named as alternate beneficiary in the particular situation envisaged by paragraph sixth of the will,but that situation did not arise.the extrinsic testimony sheds no light on the intention of testatrix with respect to the situation which actually had come into existence by the death of testatrix husband some five years before her own death.barnes,supra,cal d at.on the subject of extrinsic testimony,the court cited former probate code section,which provided that when an uncertainty arises upon the face of a will,as to the application of any of its provisions,the testator intention is to be ascertained from the words of the will,taking into view the circumstances under which it was made,excluding oral declarations of the testator as to his intentions.id.at,fn.
just as the court concluded in barnes,irving will is not ambiguous.the will set forth his intent only in the event he predeceased his wife,or if they died at the same moment.it simply made no disposition whatsoever of the property in the event irving outlived his wife by several years,as eventually occurred.however,this omission does not render the will ambiguous.we can not engage in conjecture as to what the testator may have intended but failed to express in order to avoid a conclusion of intestacy.barnes,supra,cal d at.furthermore,the existence in irving will of a disinheritance clause does not prevent respondents from taking under the statutory rules of inheritance where,as here,the decedent must be considered as having died intestate.id.at.
in summary,we conclude that the barnes decision is directly on point and controls our decision here.we decline,as we must,appellants invitation to look to cases from other states in which courts construed wills similar to the one now before us as implying a testamentary intent not stated on the face of the will.auto equity sales,superior court cal d.
iii.no dominant dispositive plan exists to warrant finding an implied gift 
appellants argue that the general scheme of irving will produces the unyielding conviction that irving intended to divide his estate between coh and jnf,rather than have it pass by intestacy to his estranged nephews.they rely on the case of brock hall cal d brock,which the barnes court considered but distinguished,stating that n o such dominant dispositive plan as referred to and held to warrant a gift by implication in brock is demonstrated by the provisions of the will now before us.barnes,supra,cal d at.we shall briefly discuss brock in order to demonstrate that it is readily distinguishable from the situation here.
in brock,supra,cal d,a father established an inter vivos trust for the benefit of his two daughters.the trust instrument provided that upon reaching the age of,each daughter would receive half of the net income from the trust property,until reaching the age of,when each would receive half of the trust property outright.the trust instrument contained various provisions indicating the trustor desired disposition of the property if,for example,either daughter died without having married,or if they died having married and leaving issue or were married but without issue,and so forth.before reaching age,the younger daughter died a widow,without issue.this precise scenario was not addressed in the trust instrument.the trustor contended that,since there was no provision for an express gift to the older daughter under these circumstances,the younger daughter share of the property should revert to him.
the supreme court found applicable the law governing implied gifts in wills.in that regard,the court observed the implication of gifts in wills rests upon the primary rule of construction that the duty of the court in all cases of interpretation is to ascertain the intention of the maker from the instrument read as a whole and to give effect thereto if possible,and it is well settled that,where the intention to make a gift clearly appears in a will,although perhaps imperfectly expressed,the court will raise a gift by implication.brock,supra,cal d at.however,in order to imply a gift,the inten
