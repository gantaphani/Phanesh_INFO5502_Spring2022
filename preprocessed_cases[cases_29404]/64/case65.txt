paul monea and a coconspirator were convicted of participating in a scheme to hide the proceeds of drug trafficking.the district court subsequently granted a preliminary order of forfeiture regarding several items of personal property used in the scheme,including a large diamond that purportedly belonged to monea.several parties filed petitions to amend the order of forfeiture on the basis of their alleged ownership interest in the diamond,including the monea family trust the trust,of which monea and two of his children were beneficiaries.holding that the government interest in the diamond was superior to that of all of the claimants,the district court denied the various petitions.
the trust now appeals the district court order.for the following reasons,we affirm the judgment of the district court.
background 
factual background 
the trust was established in by deborah douglas,who named as beneficiaries her children,blake and brook monea,and her,paul monea hereinafter referred to as monea.john tuggle,a business acquaintance of monea,was appointed as trustee.under the terms of the trust agreement,the trustee could be removed by monea or by a majority vote of all of the beneficiaries.monea also had the singular authority to appoint new trustees.the trust was initially funded with,but later acquired ownership of a home near warren,ohio that was previously owned by former boxer mike tyson.
in,monea completed a term of imprisonment that he had been serving for an unrelated conviction.upon his release,monea discovered that tuggle had misappropriated well in excess of of trust funds.this caused monea to remove tuggle as the trustee in november.
tuggle replacement died unexpectedly soon after being appointed.monea then asked michael miller,an acquaintance of monea who owned a car dealership,to serve as the trustee.during the subsequent months,miller introduced monea to john rizzo,a sales broker for whom miller was laundering drug money.unbeknownst to either miller or monea,rizzo was actually an undercover agent with the federal bureau of investigation fbi.
monea and rizzo first met on march,to discuss the possibility of rizzo supplying cash for some of monea business ventures.the two men met again on may,in los angeles,california.during this meeting,which rizzo recorded,monea mentioned a diamond that i own,although he did not seek rizzo assistance in selling it at the time.the diamond to which monea referred is a carat modified rectangular brilliant yellow diamond internally flawless with fancy intense grate known as the golden eye.there is no clear evidence of how monea first came to possess the diamond,but he told others involved in this case that he owned a diamond mine in africa and that he received the diamond from a friend.
prior to being imprisoned for tax evasion,monea had borrowed from a man named michael dillard,who owned a pawn shop in oklahoma.monea used the money to pay taxes that he had owed.he left the diamond in dillard possession as collateral for the loan.around the time that monea first met rizzo,he borrowed another from an acquaintance named gerald deleo to pay off the dillard loan and reacquire the diamond.deleo also gave monea an additional shortly thereafter to have the diamond readied for sale by gemologists in new york.monea led deleo to believe that the latter would receive an ownership interest in the diamond in exchange for the monies advanced.deleo had the diamond in his possession for two to three weeks sometime after it was readied for sale,during which time deleo unsuccessfully searched for a potential buyer.
in june,miller,in his capacity as trustee,appointed an acquaintance named david ramsey as an agent of the trust for the limited purpose of retrieving the diamond from a jeweler in oklahoma who was holding the diamond on behalf of dillard.this arrangement was made,according to miller,so that the paper trail showed that the trust bought the stone for.monea and rizzo spoke shortly after ramsey retrieved the diamond,but monea again did not ask rizzo for help in finding a buyer for the gemstone.
in august and september,monea and ramsey engaged in discussions with representatives from the charity fellowship of truth church,located in avon,new york,regarding the purchase of a lake house in massillon,ohio.monea had rented the house in the past and had used it to host business associates while negotiating contracts and discussing his various entrepreneurial ventures.but by august,the home was in danger of going into foreclosure.pursuant to the purchase agreement,the church would buy the lake house from its current owners for approximately million.the trust then agreed to purchase the home from the church for million within one year thereafter.
to secure the trust obligation to ultimately buy the home,the church was to receive a percent interest in the diamond,as memorialized in a separate certificate of giving signed on the same day as the purchase agreement.according to the purchase agreement,the diamond would be sold,with the proceeds from the sale to first be used to buy the lake house from the church for million.the remaining balance from the sale of the diamond would belong to the trust.
church representatives present during these discussions testified that monea and ramsey conveyed the impression that the diamond belonged to the trust and that ramsey was acting as the trust agent.they further stated that miller was present at a canton,ohio country club where both the purchase agreement and the certificate of giving were signed in september.miller acknowledged meeting the church representatives at his home earlier on the day in question.although miller never testified as to whether he was present at the country club when the documents were signed,he denied participating in any negotiations between the church and monea and maintained that he was never informed of any agreement reached by the two parties.moreover,miller said that he had not authorized ramsey to act on behalf of the trust beyond retrieving the diamond from dillard jeweler in oklahoma.ramsey,however,signed both documents on behalf of the trust,and monea signed the purchase agreement as an acting trustee for the charity fellowship of truth church.
following these negotiations,monea,ramsey,and reverend david moore from the church took the diamond to los angeles and las vegas to show to potential buyers.during part of this time,reverend moore had the diamond in his possession without either monea or ramsey being present.miller was never informed that these showings were taking place or that reverend moore at times had sole custody of the diamond.
that fall,miller and monea continued their efforts to sell the diamond,with miller hiring at least two different brokers in october to assist them in finding a buyer.miller and monea met with rizzo again on october.this time their discussion,which rizzo recorded,revolved around rizzo finding a buyer to purchase the diamond for million.during their conversation,monea maintained that he was just trying to sell on behalf of the trust an asset that the trust has.miller added that any money from the sale was going in the trust.
in early november,monea and rizzo reached an agreement in which monea agreed to sell the diamond to drug dealers who rizzo knew in exchange for million and a boat.discussions regarding commissions,the payment of earnest money,and the wiring of funds continued through.monea typically handled these negotiations,with little meaningful involvement from miller,and he met with rizzo on one occasion in las vegas without miller being present.on another occasion in november,when monea believed that he was nearing the close of a deal,he told a potential buyer that i think i got my diamond sold.
monea also gave miller a list detailing how the proceeds of the sale were to be disbursed.a majority of the payments to be made were unrelated to either the debts or investments of the trust,and several payments were to be used to discharge personal debts incurred by monea.
on december,monea,miller,and rizzo met at the office of the trust lawyer,jack morrison,to complete the sale of the diamond.morrison had pre
