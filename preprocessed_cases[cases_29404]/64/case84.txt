in this appeal,we examine some of the tax consequences arising from the sale of the chronicle publishing company and,specifically,whether the internal revenue service proposed adjustment of certain partnership tax items was time barred.although the ultimate issue is relatively straightforward,both the back story and the legal framework are somewhat complex,requiring us to delve deep in the heart of taxes.
the storied chronicle publishing company was founded in the mid in san francisco by teenage brothers charles and de young with a borrowed gold piece.their first venture,the daily dramatic chronicle,began with a small circulation,but its readership quickly tripled when it provided the only breaking news accounts of the assassination of abraham lincoln.it was rechristened as the morning chronicle and ultimately the san francisco chronicle.within a few decades,it became the largest circulation newspaper on the west coast 
after the death of charles de young in,de young assumed control of the paper,incorporated it as the chronicle publishing company chronicle publishing in,and ran the enterprise until his death in.he left the newspaper assets in an irrevocable trust that would terminate on the death of all five of his children.from de young death until the early,a family member remained at the helm of the media empire.over the course of time,chronicle publishing expanded its operations,acquiring a television station along with other properties and forming a book publishing company.
the chronicle was not the only media game in town.mining entrepreneur george hearst acquired the rival san francisco examiner in and turned its management over to his son william randolph hearst seven years later,when the elder hearst became a united states senator.over the next century,the examiner and chronicle engaged in a fierce competition for readers with both papers experiencing financial challenges in the early,the examiner and the chronicle entered into a joint operating and profit sharing agreement in.the joint operating agreement also granted hearst the right of first refusal if chronicle publishing were put up for sale.reilly hearst,d.
when de young last child died in and the irrevocable trust dissolved,chronicle publishing elected to be treated as a delaware subchapter s corporation.companies generally take such actions to avoid the double taxation attendant to c corporations,where taxes are assessed on both corporations and shareholders.the subchapter s corporate structure is often employed by small,businesses.however,to discourage misuse of the subchapter s vehicle,congress provided that subchapter s corporations would be subject to the normal double taxation if the corporation were sold within ten years of its creation.estate of litchfield comm r,cch,at citing.
in the late,amidst deteriorating family relationships and financial challenges,and after the subchapter s waiting period expired,the de young heirs decided to sell most of the assets of chronicle publishing to the rival hearst corporation and distribute the assets among the heirs according to their ownership percentages.the chronicle was to continue as a morning paper,and the examiner was sold to a third party.
in its discussions of the sale,chronicle publishing board of directors realized the possibility of future liability arising from a variety of potential issues,such as environmental problems,contractual disputes,and the risk that chronicle publishing might lose its subchapter s status.thus,the directors prepared a recontribution agreement,which provided that the shareholders would contribute on a pro rata basis if there were future chronicle publishing liabilities.each shareholder was required to execute the recontribution agreement as a condition of receiving a distribution of proceeds from the chronicle publishing sale.
our case involves one group of de young heirs,specifically conseulo martin de young granddaughter and her five children the martin heirs.the martin heirs owned of the shares of chronicle publishing,either outright or through fourteen family trusts the martin family trusts or trusts.some of the trusts had existed since the others were created just before the chronicle publishing sale.
the martin heirs sought advice on how to minimize the tax consequences of the proposed chronicle publishing sale and to protect themselves against future liabilities posed by the recontribution agreement.after consulting with several tax specialists,the martin heirs decided to implement what the irs now claims was a son of boss tax shelter although there are a number of variants,a son of boss tax scheme generally involves a series of contrived steps in a partnership interest to generate artificial tax losses designed to offset income from other transactions.nevada partners fund,ex rel.sapphire ii,ex rel,cir.assets encumbered by artificial liabilities are transferred into a partnership with the goal of increasing basis in the partnership.the net result is that the artificial loss offsets the taxable gain.
thus,acting on tax advice,the martin family trusts formed a tiered partnership structure,meaning that the trusts served as partners of an upper tier of partnerships that owned interests in a lower tier partnership,and then engaged in a short term hedging strategy using option contracts.there were three parts to the structure a the fourteen martin family trusts b an upper partnership tier,which included multiple partnerships and c a single,lower tier partnership.at the top of the structure were the fourteen martin family trusts,which were the ultimate partners of the two tiers of partnerships below.
the upper partnership tier consisted of three partnerships,the most relevant of which is first ship,llc first ship.the fourteen martin family trusts were the first ship partners and owners.after the chronicle publishing sale,the trusts contributed certain of the sale assets to first ship.the other two partnerships the minority partnerships,were fourth ship,llc fourth ship and lmga holdings,lmga.
the lower tier consisted solely of first ship a,llc a.first ship,fourth ship,and lmga were the three partners of first ship owned of a,with fourth ship and lmga owning minority partnership shares.
with the structure in place,the martin heirs commenced a series of transactions designed to create losses that would offset the taxable gain realized from the chronicle publishing sale.the trusts purchased certain assets,in addition to the stock they already owned,and transferred some assets to the partnerships.most relevant to this case,the trusts purchased million in option contracts the long options,while simultaneously selling million in option contracts the short options.the trusts paid jp morgan the difference between the two sets of options,roughly.the trusts then contributed their assets to the partnerships,mostly to first ship.first ship received over million in assets from the trusts,including the value of the purchased long options.in contrast,fourth ship only received million in assets.first ship then contributed million in assets to a,including the value of the purchased long options.fourth ship and lmga also transferred some of their more limited assets to 
throughout the transactions,the various entities did not treat the short options as a liability or subtract the amount owed on the short options from the amount purchased in long options.as a result,the martin family trusts and first ship each saw a dramatic increase in their tax bases in the partnerships below them,the martin family trusts in relation to first ship and first ship in relation to a.following the contribution,a sold off its assets,terminated the options,distributed its remaining holdings back to its partners,primarily first ship,and dissolved.
a filed its form partnership tax return on march.first ship in turn reported its share of gains and losses from the closing out of a,including a million capital loss,in a march,form return.fourth ship and lmga also filed returns and posted small losses due to the liquidation of first ship partners,the martin family trusts,timely filed their own returns before april.due to the inflated ba
