introduction 
the will of joseph clementi,was admitted to probate.he willed assets to his siblings,the drafter of his will,and to a charitable foundation or trust to be run by the will drafter.clementi nephew and niece,salvatore chimenti and adeline diambrosio appellants filed a petition to revoke probate.the petition was denied,and this appeal followed.we affirm.
probate code section generally prohibits donative transfers to the drafters of wills and their relatives.all further statutory references are to the probate code.however,section,subdivision i creates an exemption from section if t he transfer is made by an instrument executed by a nonresident of california who was not a resident at the time the instrument was executed,and that was not signed within california,subd.i.clementi was not a california resident when he signed his will in pennsylvania,but was a california resident at the time of his death.
we hold section,subdivision i does not require that the transferor be a nonresident of california at the time of death.therefore,the exemption in section,subdivision i applies in this case because clementi will was signed in pennsylvania at a time when clementi was not a resident of california.
additionally,we conclude clementi manifested a sufficient intent to create a charitable trust through his will,although his will does not identify a specific charity.his stated intent to give the balance of my assets to a charitable foundation or trust is sufficient.

standards of review 
where,as here,the probate court issues a statement of decision,and the parties fail to file any objections,we will infer that the probate court made all necessary implied factual findings to support its judgment.in re marriage of arceneaux cal d.we next inquire whether substantial evidence supports those findings.fladeboe american isuzu motors th,d.
to the extent the appeal involves interpretation of a statute,we review the matter de novo.kavanaugh west sonoma county union high school dist.cal th,d.in construing a statute,our fundamental task is to ascertain the legislature intent so as to effectuate the purpose of the statute.citation.we begin with the language of the statute,giving the words their usual and ordinary meaning.citation.the language must be construed in the context of the statute as a whole and the overall statutory scheme,and we give significance to every word,phrase,sentence,and part of an act in pursuance of the legislative purpose.citation.in other words,we do not construe statutes in isolation,but rather read every statute with reference to the entire scheme of law of which it is part so that the whole may be harmonized and retain effectiveness.citation.citation.if the statutory terms are ambiguous,we may examine extrinsic sources,including the ostensible objects to be achieved and the legislative history.citation.in such circumstances,we choose the construction that comports most closely with the legislature apparent intent,endeavoring to promote rather than defeat the statute general purpose,and avoiding a construction that would lead to absurd consequences.citation.smith superior court cal th,d.
ii.the probate court correctly determined the exception to section contained in section,subdivision i applies in this case.
analysis of the statute language 
section,subdivision a provides,in relevant part,as follows except as provided in section,no provision,or provisions,of any instrument shall be valid to make any donative transfer to any of the following the person who drafted the instrument.a person who is related by blood or marriage to,is a domestic partner of,is a cohabitant with,or is an employee of,the person who drafted the instrument.any person who has a fiduciary relationship with the transferor,including,but not limited to,a conservator or trustee,who transcribes the instrument or causes it to be transcribed.a person who is related by blood or marriage to,is a domestic partner of,is a cohabitant with,or is an employee of a person who is described in paragraph.appellants contend the bequest of to weisz and the remuneration that would result to weisz or his son from the position of running the charitable foundation or trust are donative transfers prohibited by section.
section,subdivision i creates an exemption from section if t he transfer is made by an instrument executed by a nonresident of california who was not a resident at the time the instrument was executed,and that was not signed within california,subd.i.appellants argue section,subdivision i does not apply if the decedent was a resident of california at the time of death.they argue that the use of two separate references in section,subdivision i to nonresidence means that residence must be evaluated at two separate the time the instrument is executed and at the time of death.this interpretation is bolstered by the language of section,subdivision e,which permits the probate court to determine whether an otherwise prohibited transfer was not the product of fraud,menace,duress,or undue influence if the transfer was included in a ny instrument executed by a resident of california who was not a resident at the time the instrument was executed.as our supreme court has noted,w here different words or phrases are used in the same connection in different parts of a statute,it is presumed the legislature intended a different meaning.citation.briggs eden council for hope opportunity cal th,d.if both references to nonresidence refer to nonresidence at the time the instrument is signed,appellants argue,then one of them is surplusage,and we must avoid interpretations of statutes that render their terms meaningless.people hudson cal th,d.
the attorney general argues that if the legislature had intended that section,subdivision i applies only if the decedent was not a california resident at the time of death,it would have said so expressly in the statute.this interpretation finds support in witkin treatise on california law the prohibition on transfers under section does not apply to a transfer made in an instrument executed out of state by a person who was not a california resident at the time of execution.citation.witkin,summary of cal.law ed.wills and probate.witkin cites no authority supporting this statement,except the statute itself.
