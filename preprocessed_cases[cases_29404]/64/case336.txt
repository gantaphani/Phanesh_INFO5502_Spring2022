in this putative class action,the frost national bank frost,texas commerce bank,tcb,and their respective parent corporations,defendants in the trial court,challenge that part of the court of appeals judgment reversing the trial court summary judgment rendered in their favor.the court of appeals held that a trust instrument exculpatory clause can not,as a matter of public policy,exonerate frost and tcb,as trustees of various trusts invested in each bank respective stock,from grizzle claim that the banks engaged in by merging and liquidating trust funds which caused the trusts to suffer losses the court of appeals also held that the trial court abused its discretion by striking the second through fourth amended petitions filed in the underlying action that contained purported interventions of new putative class representatives,and by rendering final judgment we disagree with the court of appeals on these points.accordingly,we reverse in part that court judgment and render judgment that grizzle take nothing against the tcb and frost defendants.the portion of the court of appeals judgment that affirmed in part the trial court summary judgment in favor of the frost defendants has not been challenged 
background 
a.the brentley grizzle trust 
on october,a dallas county district court rendered a decree designating frost as trustee for the brentley grizzle trust the grizzle trust.the grizzle trust was established under texas property code chapter to receive and administer settlement proceeds received by brentley,a minor,from a wrongful death claim asserted when her father died.the grizzle trust was created with in cash settlement proceeds.frost,as trustee,invested that money in its own common stock and taxable fixed income funds,as permitted by federal law state law and the grizzle trust 
the grizzle trust states that t he broad powers herein conferred upon the trustee shall always be exercised only in a fiduciary capacity,and nothing herein shall be construed to limit the fiduciary obligation of the trustee.the grizzle trust also contains an exculpatory clause which states 
this instrument shall always be construed in favor of the validity of any act or omission of any trustee,and a trustee shall not be liable for any act or omission except in the case of gross negligence,bad faith,or fraud 
in addition,the grizzle trust permits a successor corporate trustee through the purchase of,or merger or consolidation with,the original trustee,frost the successor trustee succeeds to all the rights,duties,and powers of the original trustee 
frost and tcb exchange banks 
on april,tcb and its parent corporation,texas commerce equity holdings,and frost and its parent corporation,the new galveston company,entered into what the parties call a merger or a bank swap.we will refer to the transaction as a merger.the merger consisted of frost transferring its dallas bank to tcb,and tcb transferring its corpus christi bank to frost.by this transfer,the two banks exchanged all assets including their trusts.tcb accordingly became trustee of the grizzle trust.
the day after the merger,richard phillips,tcb senior and trust officer,sent a letter apprizing tcb new trust customers,including grizzle,of the merger and tcb new role as trustee.the letter states,in part 
as we previously announced,texas commerce bank and bank of dallas,have merged and we are pleased to welcome you to texas commerce.
texas commerce and share the same culture,and we look forward to working together to ensure that your relationship with texas commerce is a very positive one.here is a brief summary of what you can expect 
no changes are required to administer your trust account s.you can count on receiving the same high quality service and attention from your trust manager.
it will not be necessary to make any adjustments to your trust documents or agreements defining your account 
as service enhancements or other developments are planned,you will be notified well in advance.
soon after this letter was sent,tcb liquidated the frost stock and income funds it had acquired from the merger into cash on april.frost did the same thing with the tcb stock and income funds it had acquired from the merger.tcb and frost assert that they did this because federal law and regulations prohibit banks,acting as trustees,from investing in common trust funds managed by another bank.
on may,tcb placed the liquidated funds into a investment earning interest.a few weeks later,tcb reinvested those funds in fixed income and common stock funds managed by tcb.because market forces had caused the grizzle trust funds value to decrease when the merger occurred,liquidating the frost funds resulted in the grizzle trust realizing a capital tax loss of.
linda grizzle files suit 
on april,linda grizzle,as next friend of her daughter brentley,brought suit individually and on behalf of a putative class of trust beneficiaries against the tcb and frost defendants.the suit was based on alleged damages sustained by the trusts,including the grizzle trust,as a result of the merger.grizzle asserted numerous claims including breach of fiduciary duty,deceptive trade practices,negligence,gross negligence,fraud,conspiracy,and breach of contract.
on december,the frost defendants moved for summary judgment,asserting among other grounds,that the grizzle trust exculpatory clause precluded liability.on january,the tcb defendants filed a similar motion for summary judgment.grizzle opposed the summary judgment motions and filed her own affidavit,which she subsequently amended.in her amended affidavit,she stated that her daughter loss included audit fees and other charges allegedly netted against the liquidation proceeds allocable to the grizzle trust.grizzle further stated that she was never provided the option of allowing another bank in the frost banking system to continue administering the grizzle trust.
on february,the trial court heard the summary judgment motions.on february,grizzle filed a first amended petition that sought to add,among other things,claims that the tcb and frost defendants had engaged in.three days later,grizzle filed a second amended petition that sought to add marian frances anne rucker as an additional plaintiff.
d.the trial court ruling 
on march,the trial court noted on the docket sheet that it was granting the tcb and frost defendants motions for summary judgment.the docket sheet further indicates that,on march,the trial court notified all counsel of its ruling.the trial court did not,however,sign a written order at that time.
while awaiting the trial court signing of the summary judgment order,frost attempted to depose rucker,named in the second amended petition.grizzle counsel stated,however,that i n light of rucker health problems,we have decided to drop her as a plaintiff in this matter.on the same day,march,grizzle filed a third amended petition.this time grizzle purported to add nesbit wehde as an additional plaintiff and to make other substantive changes in the petition,including dropping certain claims.neither rucker name nor her individual claims appeared in the third amended petition.
on march,the trial court signed and rendered summary judgment against grizzle based on her original and first amended petitions.the next day,the trial court received a motion for class certification that grizzle had filed.grizzle and wehde also filed a motion for leave to file the third amended petition and moved for a new trial on grizzle claims.the tcb and frost defendants opposed the filing of the third amended petition as untimely.in addition,because the trial court had sua sponte questioned whether wehde attempt to join the lawsuit in the third amended petition was a misnamed plea in intervention,the tcb and frost defendants alternatively moved to strike wehde purported intervention.
on may,the trial court signed orders denying the motion for reconsideration for new trial and striking the third amended petition or,alternatively,wehde purported intervention.the trial court did not consider the motion for class certification.
grizzle first appeal 
grizzle appealed the trial court orders.but the court of appeals,in an unpublished opinion and order,dismissed the appeal for lack of jurisdiction.although grizzle had indicated that rucker was being dropped as a party due to poor health,there was no trial court order disposing of rucker claims in the second amended petition.the court of appeals accordingly concluded that the trial court order striking the third amended petition restored the second amended petition as the live pleading.neither party sought this court review of that determination.
f.the trial court subsequent ruling 
after the court of appeals dismissed grizzle appeal,the tcb and frost defendants moved the trial court to enforce what they contend was rucker prior or,alternatively,to strike the second amended petition rucker purported intervention.the day before the hearing,grizzle responded and,for a fourth time,tried to amend her petition by adding rucker estate as a class representative.the trial court struck the second and fourth amended petitions by order dated november,and rendered final judgment on january.
grizzle second appeal 
grizzle and the other individuals who attempted to join the lawsuit appealed,asserting that the trial court erred in rendering summary judgment for the tcb and frost defendants.the court of appeals affirmed in part and reversed in part,remanding the case to the trial court for further proceedings 
citing other courts of appeals decisions,the court of appeals here concluded that the grizzle trust exculpatory clause could not,as a matter of public policy,vitiate a claim for,among other things,the court of appeals held that included misapplying or mishandling trust funds and failing to promptly reinvest substantial sums of trust monies the court of appeals held there was evidence that tcb failed to promptly reinvest liquidated funds,which was evidence of mishandling of trust funds included within the meaning of the court of appeals concluded that because a fact issue existed about whether tcb and frost had engaged in,the exculpatory clause did not support the trial court summary judgment 
the court of appeals further held that the summary judgment evidence raised a fact question about whether the frost defendants failure to disclose the consequences of the merger and liquidation amounted to a misrepresentation the court of appeals also concluded that the summary judgment could not be upheld based on the frost defendants argument that grizzle was not entitled to a separate recovery on a fraud claim because there were no damages attributed to fraud rather than contract according to the court of appeals,grizzle fraud claim arose from tcb letter notifying her of the merger and telling her that no changes were required in administering the trust,no adjustments to the trust documents were necessary,and as other developments were planned,beneficiaries would be notified in advance the court of appeals concluded that grizzle fraud claim arose from being induced to accept the change in trusteeship based on tcb assurances that no change in the trust agreements or their administration was necessary 
the court of appeals further held that the summary judgment evidence presented a fact issue about whether audit and other fees were assessed against the trusts the court of appeals noted that b now b provides that t he bank shall absorb the costs of establishing or reorganizing a collective investment fund,and that audit fees could fall within that provision thus,the court of appeals concluded that supported grizzle argument that federal banking regulations did not excuse tcb failure to mitigate any damages,such as charging expenses related to the liquidation and reinvestment of the funds after the merger 
the court of appeals also concluded that the trial court abused its discretion in striking the amended interventions of the ruckers and wehde according to the court of appeals,an intervention is proper at any time before a final decision on the merits rucker intervened before the trial court rendered its summary judgment on grizzle individual claims.and when wehde intervened,there had been no final judgment rendered on rucker claim or the class action.therefore,the court of appeals concluded that the interventions were timely,and the trial court abused its discretion by striking wehde claim without affording her an opportunity to respond to the tcb and frost defendants motions to strike 
the court of appeals resolved several other issues,but we either do not need to resolve them to decide this case or they are not before us.we accordingly do not discuss them.we granted the tcb and frost defendants petitions for review to determine,among other things,whether a trust exculpatory clause can,without violating public policy,exonerate a corporate trustee from liability for defined as the misapplication or mishandling of trust funds,including the failure to promptly reinvest trust monies.in addition to briefing from the parties,we received an amicus brief from texas bankers association,independent bankers association of texas,and texas savings community bankers association.
ii.analysis 
a.the exculpatory clause effect 
the tcb and frost defendants argue that the court of appeals erred in holding that the grizzle trust exculpatory clause did not exonerate them from liability.the tcb and frost defendants contend that the court of appeals erroneously held there was evidence that tcb failed to promptly reinvest the liquidated funds which,in turn,was evidence of mishandling trust funds,which fell within the meaning of.the tcb and frost defendants assert that the court of appeals broad exception is not authorized by the texas trust code which sets forth the only exceptions to exculpatory clauses the legislature deemed appropriate the tcb and frost defendants further assert that,even if such a exception is appropriate,the merger and subsequent liquidations of trust funds required by federal law can not constitute as a matter of law.
grizzle responds with numerous arguments,including that public policy prohibits an exculpatory clause from exonerating a trustee from liability for to further its own financial interests.additionally,grizzle asserts that the court of appeals correctly recognized that includes mishandling of trust funds and unreasonable delay in making investments.grizzle also contends that trust code section,which authorizes exculpatory clauses,does not apply to the grizzle trust because the grizzle trust was created under texas property code chapter,which is not part of the trust code.
as an initial matter,we disagree with grizzle argument that trust code section does not apply to trusts created under property code chapter.the trust code applies to express trusts created on or after january,the trust code states that it does not apply to a resulting trust,a constructive trust,a business trust,or a security instrument but the trust code does not say that it does not apply to trusts created under property code chapter.
instead,the trust code defines an express trust as 
a fiduciary relationship with respect to property which arises as a manifestation by the settlor the person who creates the trust of an intention to create the relationship and which subjects the person holding title to the property to equitable duties to deal with the property for the benefit of another person 
property code section provides that a court may render a decree creating a trust to manage funds for a minor benefit thus,we conclude that a trust created under property code chapter by the court acting as settlor is an express trust to which the trust code applies 
next,we agree with the tcb and frost defendants that a trust instrument exculpatory clause can relieve a corporate trustee of liability for defined as the misapplication or mishandling of trust funds,including the failure to promptly reinvest trust monies.we base our decision on the trust code express language.
we start with trust code section,which provides,in part,that i f the provisions of this subtitle and the terms of a trust conflict,the terms of the trust control except the settlor may not relieve a corporate trustee from the duties,restrictions,and liabilities under section or.sections and relate to certain types of.section generally prohibits a trustee from lending trust funds to itself section generally prohibits a trustee from buying trust property from itself and selling trust property to itself.grizzle does not claim that the tcb or frost defendants actions violated sections or.and neither of these statutory provisions defines as the court of appeals did here 
further,trust code chapter discusses a trustee duties in administering a trust.section provides that i n the absence of any contrary terms in the trust instrument or contrary provisions of this subtitle,in administering the trust the trustee shall perform all of the duties imposed on trustees by the common law.in addition,section provides standards that govern a trustee duties concerning trust management and investment.that section states,in part 
unless the terms of the trust instrument provide otherwise,in acquiring,investing,reinvesting,exchanging,retaining,selling,supervising,and managing trust property,a trustee shall exercise the judgment and care under the circumstances then prevailing that persons of ordinary prudence,discretion,and intelligence exercise in the management of their own affairs,not in regard to speculation but in regard to the permanent disposition of their funds,considering the probable income from as well as the probable increase in value and the safety of their capital 
trust code chapter generally discusses a trustee liability to the beneficiary for breach of trust.for example,section provides,in part 
a the trustee is accountable to a beneficiary for the trust property and for any profit made by the trustee through or arising out of the administration of the trust,even though the profit does not result from a breach of trust 
c a trustee who commits a breach of trust is chargeable with any damages resulting from such breach of trust,including but not limited to 
any loss or depreciation in value of the trust estate as a result of the breach of trust 
any profit made by the trustee through the breach of trust or 
any profit that would have accrued to the trust estate if there had been no breach of trust 
while the trust code imposes certain obligations on a all duties imposed by the common law the trust code also permits the settlor to modify those obligations in the trust instrument.indeed,trust code section broadly states that a settlor may relieve a corporate trustee from a duty,liability,or restriction imposed by this subtitle,except for those contained in sections and the trust code contains no other limitations on relieving a corporate trustee from liability for in a trust instrument.thus,we conclude that the trust code allows an exculpatory clause to relieve a corporate trustee from liability for defined as misapplying or mishandling trust funds,including failing to promptly reinvest trust monies,unless those activities violate the prohibitions in sections and.
we disagree with the court of appeals conclusion that public policy precludes such a limitation on liability.the court of appeals based its holding on other courts of appeals decisions beginning with langford shamburger langford held that i t would be contrary to the public policy of this state to permit the language of a trust instrument to authorize by a trustee.
but as we have previously acknowledged,the state public policy is reflected in its statutes and the legislature has spoken on and exculpatory clauses in the trust code.the legislature has expressly authorized the use of exculpatory clauses,stating that they can relieve a corporate trustee from liability except for certain narrow types of not at issue here.we therefore decline to hold that a trust instrument can not exonerate a trustee from liability for failing to promptly reinvest trust monies based on public policy as we stated in lawrence cdb services,
public policy,some courts have said,is a term of vague and uncertain meaning,which it pertains to the power to define,and courts are apt to encroach upon the domain of that branch of the government if they characterize a transaction as invalid because it is contrary to public policy,unless the transaction contravenes some positive statute or some rule of law 
we recognize that the trust code authorizes a settlor to exonerate a corporate trustee from almost all liability for,and that this broad authority can lead to harsh results.but we presume the legislature was aware of this when it enacted the texas trust act in the predecessor to the texas trust when it subsequently enacted the trust code effective january.when the texas trust act came into being,the restatement of trusts had been written and when the legislature enacted the trust code,the restatement second of trusts had been written.both restatements state,in part a provision in the trust instrument is not effective to relieve the trustee of liability for any profit which the trustee has derived from a breach of trust.
yet,in addressing,the legislature the trust act,in the trust code,and again in the current trust to prohibit,subject to certain exceptions,exculpatory clauses that permit a corporate trustee to loan trust money to itself,buy trust property from itself,or sell trust property to itself we therefore conclude that public policy,as expressed by the legislature in the trust code,does not preclude a settlor from relieving a corporate trustee from liability for,except for what is specified in sections and.we disapprove langford and its progeny to the extent they suggest otherwise.we further hold that the court of appeals here erred in holding that the grizzle trust exculpatory clause could not relieve the tcb and frost defendants from liability for misapplying and mishandling trust funds when there was no claim that,by doing so,the tcb and frost defendants violated sections or.
that does not end our inquiry though.the grizzle trust exonerates tcb and frost from liability as trustee for any act or omission except in the case of gross negligence,bad faith,or fraud.we therefore must decide whether the tcb and frost defendants are entitled to judgment as a matter of law because their actions did not constitute gross negligence,bad faith,or fraud.
the tcb and frost defendants argue that the facts supporting grizzle purported damages are that the tcb and frost defendants converted the grizzle trust investments into cash,causing the trust to realize a capital loss of due to a prior market decrease in the investments value delayed reinvesting the trust funds,causing the trust to lose income that otherwise would have been realized and charged audit and other fees that were applied to the grizzle trust.according to the tcb and frost defendants,those facts,even if true,constituted no more than mere failures to exercise the degree of judgment required under the circumstances.they did not amount to gross negligence,bad faith,or fraud.
the tcb and frost defendants assert that federal law required tcb to liquidate the trust investment in frost funds and it was not gross negligence or bad faith to comply with federal law.they argue that the brief delay in reinvesting the funds was not even a simple breach of trust,much less gross negligence or bad faith.and charging audit fees was not gross negligence or bad faith,particularly when the grizzle trust authorized the trustee to charge fees.
the tcb and frost defendants also argue that grizzle fraud allegations are without merit.grizzle bases her fraud claim on the letter from tcb welcoming her as a new customer.the tcb and frost defendants argue that the statements made in that letter can not support a fraud claim as a matter of law.moreover,the tcb and frost defendants assert,grizzle admitted that she did not rely on the letter.the court of appeals nevertheless determined that grizzle fraud claim arises from being induced to accept the change in trusteeship resulting from the merger on the letter assurances that no change in the trust agreements or their administration was necessary the tcb and frost defendants argue that the letter was sent after the merger and,as a matter of federal law,substituting tcb as trustee was automatic.thus,they contend that the court of appe
