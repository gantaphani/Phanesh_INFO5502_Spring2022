rosalinda gonzalez cortez,enedina gonzalez marquez,and roy gonzalez,the three of jorge gonzalez filed a petition to enforce a clause in their father will against jorge.the trial court granted the petition,which was denominated a petition to determine entitlement to estate distribution to jorge gonzalez because he violated the will forfeiture clause.jorge appeals from the trial court order granting the petition.we shall affirm.
jose inez gonzalez died on march,at the age of.he left twelve children,ranging in age from to,some living in the united states,some in mexico,some legitimate,some not.he owned real property in mexico and in san jose.in,the decedent wrote a will dividing his estate equally among the four children born of his marriage to carmen garza gonzalez,to wit enedina,rosalinda,roy and jorge.the will named jorge,the youngest of the four and a sergeant with the san jose police department,as the executor of his father estate.the will also contained a clause,providing if any beneficiary under this will in any manner,directly or indirectly,contests or attacks this will or any of its provisions,any share or interest in my estate given to that contesting beneficiary under this will is revoked and shall be disposed of in the same manner provided herein as if that contesting beneficiary had predeceased me.
in,jose gave jorge a general power of attorney.in addition,according to jorge,he was his father primary caretaker for the last six years of his father life.judge richard turrone,however,refers in his statement of decision to daughter alma as the decedent caretaker at the time of his death.alma is not a party to this lawsuit.
in early march,just three weeks before jose died,jorge delivered to jose for his signature a grant deed that transferred title of jose san jose house to jorge and a will essentially disinheriting jose other children and leaving jose entire estate,the property in mexico to jorge.the circumstances leading up to these events are set forth in greater detail in judge turrone statement of decision,which will be quoted later.
after jose died,roy filed a petition for letters of administration on june.roy was apparently unaware of either the will or the will and claimed his father died intestate.on june,jorge filed his own petition for letters of administration.each of the brothers then filed an objection to the other petition.in july,the court appointed enedina to administer the estate.
roy filed a petition for conveyance of real property claimed to belong to the decedent,seeking to void the grant deed jose signed three weeks before he died transferring the san jose property to jorge.subsequently,the court ordered jorge to take over as administrator of his father estate,noting that both the and the wills had named him as executor.jorge submitted the will for probate.
in april,enedina and rosalinda,represented by separate counsel from their brother roy,filed a petition for conveyance of personal property,funds held in joint bank accounts by jose and jorge claimed to belong to the decedent.they also filed a motion to consolidate all matters before the probate court,jorge petition to probate the will,the siblings contest of the will on the grounds of undue influence or fraud,the siblings petition seeking a decree declaring the grant deed void,and the siblings petition seeking to impose a constructive trust on funds in certain bank accounts.
in august,a court trial was held before judge turrone.with respect to the will and deed,he found first of all that jorge was in a confidential relationship with jose.he further found that jorge actively participated in procuring the grant deed and will,finding the evidence is robust that jorge actively participated in the preparation and the execution of both documents.in her deposition,alma,his caretaker at the time,testified that upon returning from the hospital the decedent would not eat,had a fever that came and went,complained of pain,and that he was unable to carry on a conversation with others.because of the sores in his mouth he would mumble,mostly nodding as a means of communication.the hospital records substantiate that he suffered from severe thrust sic and even in january of there are entries reflecting that he suffered from slurred speech.in fact,entries dating from a admission describe him as having a history of chronic slurred speech.by contrast,medical records dating back years earlier reflected he was fluent and coherent.alma further testified that at times he would confuse her with her sister,blanca,and that he had become forgetful.the hospital records have notations that in early february he had begun to refuse to eat and at times he had limited memory and was disoriented the evidence is uncontradicted that jose was wheelchair bound for several years before his death and relied solely on jorge for management of his affairs.in march of he was in poor health and bed bound,having constant headaches for months and a persistent cough.he was totally dependent on others for to bathe,eat,or perform personal hygiene without the assistance of others.he had been released from the hospital after a bout of pneumonia on february.the hospital records indicate that at varying times he was sometimes confused,alert or disoriented.he was extremely weak.on march,jorge came to the home unannounced,wrote out a statement for his father to sign,wherein jose indicated an intent to give his home and ranch to jorge without jose having an opportunity to review the document,jorge presented it to him for signature while he was in bed after which he had alma signed sic as witnesses.when alma spoke to jose following the execution of this document,to ascertain if he knew what he had signed,he merely shrugged.she describes him as half asleep at the time.on march,on his own initiative,jorge had his tax preparer draft a grant deed conveying jose family home to jorge.jorge drove to the tax preparer office in gilroy with a copy of the deed conveying the property to jose so that she would have the legal description.after picking up the deed that had been prepared,he drove to san jose,picked up a notary,which he brought to his father bedside and had him sign the deed.shortly thereafter,jorge contacted a fellow sergeant with the san jose police department,who he had known for approximately twenty years and who had recently become a lawyer.jorge prepared an inventory of his father property and gave it to the lawyer.on march,the lawyer meet sic with jorge at his father home at which time jorge provided the lawyer with a copy of an earlier will written by the decedent which had some changes marked upon it.during the consultation with the decedent and the lawyer,jorge assisted the lawyer with language problems.jorge was never asked to leave the room.after the lawyer prepared a draft of the will,the lawyer took it to jorge home so jorge could review the rough draft jorge arranged to have his best friend another police officer and a neighbor whose daughter was formerly romantically involved with jorge to act as witnesses to the will.
judge turrone also found that jorge u nduly p rofited from the w ill and d eed,and that the uncontradicted medical testimony is most compelling.the last health care professional to see the decedent on march,described him as frail,weak,incontinent,having cloudy urine,barely arouseable,disoriented,severely malnourished and severely dehydrated and,in a word,moribund.he describes him as slumped over in his wheelchair with the inability to keep his head up.he was skin and bones,possessing no muscle mass.he could not communicate.his prognosis was that he had less than a month to live.he was sent home to die.shortly after arriving at home,he was put on house care but his condition was so poor that he was immediately given hospice care.e steinke,noting that decedent was extremely dependent with limited capacity and a host of medical problems,expressed concern that the decedent,due to the lack of food and drink,which affects the thinking process,may not have understood what he was signing.the doctor,noting in addition the dehumanizing and demoralizing experiences suffered by the decedent along with all of the other medical problems,opined that the decedent was extremely susceptible to undue influence.he stated that on a scale of,with being the maximum risk of undue influence,he rated the decedent susceptibility at.
following this recitation of the evidence,judge turrone found that the purported will dated march,and the grant deed dated march,were the result of undue influence exercised by jorge gonzalez.accordingly,the court denied probate of the march,will and granted the petition voiding the grant deed of march.the court also denied the siblings petition to impose a constructive trust on the bank accounts that jorge had in joint tenancy with his father.
shortly after the conclusion of the trial,both roy and jorge filed new petitions for appointment as executor and for letters testamentary,with copies of the october,will attached.the sisters and roy each filed objections to jorge petition,and jorge filed objections to roy.on december,the court ordered enedina appointed as executor of her father will.at that point,the sisters filed a petition to determine entitlement to estate distribution to jorge gonzalez because he violated the will forfeiture clause.capitalization omitted.jorge filed objections to the petition,roy filed a reply in support of the petition,and then each party filed briefs in response.
the petition was heard by judge catherine gallagher,who reviewed the entire file,including judge turrone statement of decision,and who considered the numerous briefs and oral argument of counsel.she subsequently issued a statement of decision finding that jorge violated the will clause,thus subjecting him to forfeit any interest he had under that will.on june,she signed an order on the petition that jorge gonzalez will take nothing from the estate.it is from that order that jorge timely appealed.
discussion 
jorge contends the trial court erred in finding him in violation of the will clause.the purpose of no contest clauses is to discourage will contests by imposing a penalty of forfeiture against beneficiaries who challenge the will.citation.an in terrorem or no contest clause in a will or trust instrument creates a condition upon gifts and dispositions provided therein.citation.in essence,a no contest clause conditions a beneficiary right to take the share provided to that beneficiary under such an instrument upon the beneficiary agreement to acquiesce to the terms of the instrument.citation.although no contest clauses are valid and favored by the public policies of discouraging litigation and giving effect to the testator intent,they are also disfavored by the policy against forfeitures and therefore are strictly construed and may not extend beyond what plainly was the testator intent.citations.section provides in determining the intent of the transferor,a no contest clause shall be strictly construed.nevertheless,it is the testator intentions that control,and a court must not rewrite the testator will in such a way as to immunize legal proceedings plainly intended to frustrate the testator unequivocally expressed intent from the reach of the clause.citation.citation.section,subdivision b defines a no contest clause as a provision in an otherwise valid instrument that,if enforced,would penalize a beneficiary if the beneficiary brings a contest.section,subdivision a defines a contest as an attack in a proceeding on an instrument or on a provision in an instrument.whether there has been a contest within the meaning of a particular clause depends upon the circumstances of the particular case and the language used.citation.citations.citations.estate of kaila th,d.
jorge argues that the no contest clause in his father will should not be enforced against him because he had reasonable cause to offer the will to probate.the reasonable cause language comes from probate code section,which provides a a no contest clause is not enforceable against a beneficiary to the extent the beneficiary,with reasonable cause,brings a contest that is limited to one or more of the following grounds forgery.revocation.an action to establish the invalidity of any transfer described in section.b reasonable cause is defined for the purposes of this section to mean that the party filing the action,proceeding,contest,or objections has possession of facts that would cause a reasonable person to believe that the allegations and other factual contentions in the matter filed with the court may be proven or,if specifically so identified,are likely to be proven after a reasonable opportunity for further investigation or discovery.italics added.
here the beneficiary,jorge,by offering the will to probate,br ought a contest that is limited to revocation.that is because the will revoked all prior wills,including the will with the clause i,jose inez gonzalez,a resident of santa clara county,california,declare that this is my will.i hereby revoke all my previous wills and codicils.thus,the only issue remaining is whether jorge brought the contest with the requisite reasonable cause set forth in probate code section.the trial court determined that he did not.
jorge first argues that he should not be penalized because probate code section required that the validity of the will be determined before he could submit the will to probate.probate code section provides a at the trial,the proponents of the will have the burden of proof of due execution.the contestants of the will have the burden of proof of lack of testamentary intent or capacity,undue influence,fraud,duress,mistake,or revocation.if the will is opposed by the petition for probate of a later will revoking the former,it shall be determined first whether the later will is entitled to probate.b the court shall try and determine any contested issue of fact that affects the validity of the will.
we agree with the trial court that probate code section can not shield jorge unless he had reasonable cause to believe that the will might be valid.judge gallagher stated,jorge cites,a,a statute which requires that if a will is opposed by the petition for probate of a later will that revokes the former will,the court determines the validity of a later will first.this argument is inapposite,as the chronological consideration of the will first did not automatically subject jorge to the will clause.if jorge retained reasonable cause to believe that the will and grant deed lawfully revoked the will,probate code section a would shield his conduct.offering a clearly sham will for probate is not what was meant or excused by probate code section.
jorge next argues that he had reasonable cause to offer the will for probate.he argues that using hindsight,he now knows that the will was invalid,but that when he offered the will for probate,he believed it was valid,relying on the advice of his counsel who expressed his personal belief that jose was competent when he signed the will.in addition,he argues that the will could not have been patently invalid or his siblings would have brought motions for summary judgment or for a directed verdict,and the trial would not have lasted for seven days.
reasonable cause,according to probate code section mean s that the party filing the action,proceeding,contest,or objections has possession of facts that would cause a reasonable person to believe that the allegations and other factual contentions in the matter filed with the court may be proven or,if specifically so identified,are likely to be proven after a reasonable opportunity for further investigation or discovery.although there are no reported cases that deal with the statutory definition of reasonable cause in the context of probate code section,the concept has been discussed in other legal contexts,including under the california tort claims act and in the malicious prosecution context.as the california supreme court noted in a recent california tort claims act case,the meaning of reasonable cause has been the subject of some debate,but most courts do agree on its general interpretation.several courts have found instructive the definition of probable cause in the malicious prosecution context.citation.the terms reasonable cause and probable c
