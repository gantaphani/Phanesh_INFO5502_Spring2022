kathleen principal asset was her interest in leo hoffman chevrolet,hoffman chevrolet,an automobile dealership which had been founded by leo.following leo death,hoffman chevrolet was run by thomas,kurt,and their,gary campbell gary,who is married to their sister paula.
pursuant to the terms of leo will,leo interest in the stock of hoffman chevrolet was transferred to the hoffman trust the trust.the initial beneficiary of the trust was kathleen,who was to receive the income of the trust for life.upon kathleen death,the trust assets were to be distributed equally to the five siblings.paula,thomas and kurt are of the trust.
kathleen died in.kathleen will,which was executed in and which was admitted to probate,similarly left her interest in hoffman chevrolet to the trust.kathleen will nominated paula,thomas and kurt as her executors and they were so appointed.
kathleen will contains a no contest clause,which states i have purposely made no provision herein for any other person,whether claiming to be an heir of mine or not,and if any person shall contest this will or object to any of the provisions hereof,i give to such person so contesting or objecting the sum of one dollar and no more,in lieu of the provision which i might have made herein for such person so contesting or objecting.
the application by myra and danette pursuant to section 
on september,pursuant to section,myra and danette filed a verified application for a determination that a proposed petition by them to remove paula,thomas and kurt as executors would not violate the no contest clause in kathleen will.myra and danette contended that as trustees of the hoffman trust,paula,thomas and kurt had breached their fiduciary duties to the detriment of decedent estate,that the executors of decedent estate were obligated to institute legal action against the cotrustees of the trust,and because paula,thomas and kurt would not bring suit against themselves,they should not continue to serve as executors.
the proposed petition for removal of executors was attached to the application as an exhibit.the petition alleged,inter alia,that during the years through,while hoffman chevrolet was under the control of thomas,kurt,and as majority and controlling shareholders,and while thomas,kurt and gary served as the corporation officers and directors,federal tax returns indicated hoffman chevrolet had earnings of,or average yearly earnings of.during those years,thomas,kurt and gary,as officers and directors,paid themselves a total of in compensation,a yearly average of.
for example,hoffman chevrolet federal tax return reflected the corporation had earnings that year of.in that year,thomas,kurt and gary paid themselves a total of in compensation.however,they caused the corporation to pay taxable benefits of only to kathleen,their widowed mother and beneficiary of the trust,and did not pay any dividends to the hoffman trust.consequently,the trust had no income from hoffman chevrolet to distribute to kathleen,and she lived primarily on social security benefits and other minor income.
based thereon,the proposed petition alleged kathleen estate has various causes of action against thomas,kurt,gary and paula for breach of fiduciary duty and other torts in their various capacities as majority and controlling shareholders of hoffman chevrolet,also as officers and directors of hoffman chevrolet,and as trustees of the hoffman trust.removal of the executors was necessary because those causes of action would not be pursued by the estate if thomas,kurt,and paula were to continue serving as the decedent executors.
the proposed petition requested the court to require thomas,kurt and paula to show cause why they should not be removed as executors and their letters testamentary revoked to remove and revoke the letters testamentary of thomas,kurt and paula and to suspend their powers as executors of kathleen estate pending investigation of the charges made against them.
the executors opposition.
in opposition,thomas,kurt and paula argued the proposed petition would violate the no contest clause,and was frivolous because any action taken by the executors against the trustees would be in effect an action against themselves.further,the executors had no right to question the administration of the hoffman trust,and the executors sole obligation was to distribute the assets to the trustees of the trust.moreover,as beneficiaries of the trust,myra and danette were free to bring their own action against the trustees for any grievance with respect to the management of the trust,without involving the executors,whose primary concern was the administration of the decedent estate.
trial court ruling.
on october,the matter came on for hearing.the trial court ruled as follows the application for determination that the proposed petition to remove executors does not violate the terms of the clause in the decedents will is heard,argued and denied.the clause prevents the motion and is considered frivolous at this point.
subsequent events.
myra and danette filed a timely notice of appeal from the above order.
on january,while the appeal was pending,section took effect.the new statute specifies that certain proceedings,including a petition seeking the removal of a fiduciary shall not violate a no contest clause as a matter of public policy,subd.b.
contentions 
myra and danette contend this case is controlled by subdivision b of newly enacted section,which provides that a petition seeking removal of a fiduciary does not violate a no contest clause as a matter of public policy and the trial court erred in making a determination on the merits of the proposed petition.
discussion 
contests and no contest clauses.
a contest is defined as an attack in a proceeding on an instrument or on a provision in an instrument,subd.a.a no contest clause means a provision in an otherwise valid instrument that,if enforced,would penalize a beneficiary if the beneficiary brings a contest,subd.b.
with respect to the interpretation and enforcement of no contest clauses,there are conflicting policies.on the one hand,they are favored since they discourage litigation and give effect to the testator intent.citations.on the other hand,clauses are disfavored because they work a forfeiture.citation.resolution of these competing policies requires clauses be strictly construed and not extended beyond what was plainly the testator intent.citation.estate of watson d.
standard of appellate review.
the determination of whether the proposed petition violates the no contest clause of kathleen will does not turn on the competency or credibility of extrinsic evidence or a conflict therein.rather,the issue turns on whether the proposed petition is statutorily exempt from the definition of a contest.therefore,the appeal presents a pure question of law for our independent determination.see scharlin superior court th,d reviewing court independently determined whether proposed petition violated no contest clause.
newly enacted section specifies that certain proceedings,including a petition seeking the removal of a fiduciary,do not violate a no contest clause as a matter of public policy.
