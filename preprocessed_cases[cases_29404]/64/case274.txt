in this case,we hold that probate code section,subdivision c does not allow a court to order a trustee to invade the assets of a discretionary trust in order to pay a restitution judgment creditor if the trustee has permissibly exercised its discretion to make no payments to the beneficiary of the trust.
richard young richard appeals from a final order denying his request,pursuant to code of civil procedure section that the court direct trustee kathy jayne mccoy mccoy to release funds from a discretionary trust created for the benefit of richard brother steven young steven by their mother,lucile young lucile.richard seeks to invade the trust assets to enforce a restitution judgment against steven arising from steven attempted murder of richard.although the trust allows mccoy to make payments of interest and principal as she deems necessary for steven health,support,maintenance,and education,it also allows her to refuse to make such payments if,in her discretion,she determines that steven does not need them.in this case,according to her uncontested declaration,mccoy believes,and richard agrees,that such needs are being met by the state because steven is serving a life prison term for attempting to kill richard.as section,subdivision c only permits the court to compel a trustee to pay income or principal to the creditor of a beneficiary if the trustee has,in the exercise of her discretion,determined to make payments to the beneficiary,and as mccoy exercise of her discretion not to make such payments is not an abuse of her discretion,the court lacked the authority to compel mccoy to make any payment to richard and properly denied his request.accordingly,we affirm the trial court order.
on the morning of july,richard was visiting lucile at her home in woodland hills where steven also lived a family argument ensued and steven shot richard,who survived with injuries.steven was convicted of premeditated attempted murder and was sentenced in january to life in prison plus years.in july,richard filed a personal injury action against steven,and in august he won a default judgment against steven for.
on december,lucile amended her testamentary trust,making mccoy her successor trustee and ordering the successor trustee to hold the entire trust for the benefit of steven throughout his life,then distribute any remaining trust assets to the christian science foundation of boston,massachusetts after steven death.the amended trust specified that steven interests were primary,the charitable remainder beneficiary secondary.the trust stated,the trustee shall pay to or apply for the benefit of steven,so much of the income,and so much of the principal,of the trust estate,up to the whole thereof,as the trustee shall deem necessary for the health,support,maintenance,and education,of steven,taking into consideration all other sources available for such purposes.
on may,lucile again amended her trust.the newly amended version generally reaffirmed the original trust as previously amended,repeated the standard spendthrift clause,and reemphasized,upon the death of lucile,the primary purpose of this trust is to care for steven,and the trustee or trustees shall give due concern to his needs and comfort,taking into consideration the needs that steven will have for his support,health,maintenance,and education,for the rest of his life,and can use the income and principal,up to the whole thereof,pursuant to the terms of the trust created for his benefit the interest of the charitable remainder beneficiary is secondary to the purpose.
lucile died on march,survived only by steven and richard.on may,richard filed a petition to enforce his restitution judgment against steven from the trust assets.steven made no appearance in the trial court proceedings,but mccoy responded and also petitioned the court for instructions.she informed the court that she had made no payments to steven because steven basic needs of support and health are believed to be taken care of by the state of california while he is in prison.first church of christ,scientist,of boston,massachusetts church,as the remainder beneficiary,also objected to richard petition.the court denied richard petition on the basis that section,subdivision c unambiguously conferred no authority on the court to order mccoy to distribute any funds to richard when mccoy had reasonably exercised her discretion under the trust to make no payments to steven,because the statute allows a court to direct any payments from a trust to a restitution judgment creditor only after the trustee has first determined to make payments to the beneficiary himself.richard timely appealed.
discussion 
richard contends that the trial court erred by not ordering mccoy to pay all or part of the restitution judgment from trust funds.relying on his interpretation of legislative history and ventura county of child support services brown th,d ventura county dcss,he argues that once a restitution judgment exists,the court has authority to order the trustee to distribute funds from the trust regardless of how or why the trustee exercised her discretion.we disagree.
our decision hinges on the construction and interpretation of section.interpretation of a statute is a question of law,so our review is de novo.ventura county dcss,supra,th at,d.to interpret the statute,we must ascertain legislative intent,starting with the language of the statute.id.at,d.if the terms of the statute are unambiguous,we presume the lawmakers meant what they said,and the plain meaning of the language governs.estate of griswold cal th,d.only if the statute is ambiguous must we consult extrinsic sources such as legislative history.ibid.in reading a statute,we keep in mind the fundamental principle of statutory construction that interpretations which render any part of a statute superfluous are to be avoided.wells learning foundation cal th,d.moreover,the various parts of a statutory enactment must be harmonized by considering the particular clause or section in the context of the statutory framework as a whole.dubois workers comp.appeals bd.cal th,d,quoting moyer workmen comp.appeals bd.cal d.
as noted above,section,subdivision c permits the court to order the trustee to satisfy all or part of the restitution judgment out of all or part of future payments that the trustee,pursuant to the exercise of the trustee discretion,determines to make to or for the benefit of the beneficiary.italics added.subdivision c follows a related provision,subdivision b,which provides that in trusts pursuant to which the beneficiary can compel the trustee to make payments to or for the beneficiary,the court may order the trustee to satisfy all or part of the restitution judgment out of all or part of those payments as they become due and payable,presently or in the future.thus,subdivision b applies to those trusts that provide for nondiscretionary periodic or payments from trust assets,while subdivision c applies to payments that are subject to the trustee discretion 
crucial to our decision is the language of section,subdivision c that a court may order the trustee to satisfy all or part of the restitution judgment out of all or part of future payments that the trustee,pursuant to the exercise of the trustee discretion,determines to make to or for the benefit of the beneficiary.italics added.that language could not more clearly state that the trustee determination to not payments is discretionary.
despite this unambiguous language,richard points to legislative history and other external indications of legislative intent,contending that by enacting section,the legislature intended to make trust assets available for payment of restitution judgments regardless of trustees discretion.but before we even consider legislative history,we must first carefully interpret the statutory language of section as the best indication of legislative intent.as we have discussed,that statutory language clearly and unambiguously limits a court power to ordering a trustee to satisfy all or part of a restitution judgment only from future payments of trust funds that the trustee first determines to make,pursuant to the exercise of the trustee discretion.to interpret the statute as richard would have us do would render the clause concerning the trustee discretion mere surplusage.this we may not do.i nterpretations which render any part of a statute superfluous are to be avoided.wells learning foundation,supra,cal th,d.
in any case,we find that an interpretation of section that respects the trustee discretion fits within the overall statutory framework.see dubois workers comp.appeals,supra,cal th at,d.subdivisions b and c of section are closely parallel.under subdivision b,when the trustee is required to make nondiscretionary payments,these payments are subject to court distribution to a restitution creditor.subdivision b does not allow the court to order payments to occur beyond the terms of the trust the trust controls how much and how often money is paid out,the court does not.but when and if trust payments are made,the court,at its discretion and guided by reason and equity,has the power to ensure that the beneficiary receives not one cent until the restitution judgment is fully paid.in short,under subdivision b,the court has no power to invade trust assets prior to their scheduled release,but can make sure that a trust beneficiary receives no benefit from them.
if subdivision c,which applies to discretionary trusts,is interpreted to allow the court to force payments from the trust at any rate and volume the court sees fit,then subdivision c would be much more sweeping than subdivision b and would put at a relative disadvantage the restitution judgment creditor who is forced to seek recovery under subdivision b from a possibly small trickle of periodic payments or from a lump sum payment quite remote in time,depending on the trust terms.by this interpretation,a claimant under subdivision b is a prisoner of the trust terms who must wait for the trust to release funds a claimant under subdivision c is not.but an interpretation of subdivision c that respects the trustee discretion offers greater symmetry between the two subdivisions in each case,the design of the trust controls what payments can come out of the trust,but in each case,the court has the power partly or wholly to preclude the beneficiary from receiving any benefit until the entire restitution judgment is paid.
our interpretation also harmonizes with section,which allows general creditors of a spendthrift trust under specified circumstances to obtain no more than percent of the value of trust payments.see cal.law revision com,west ann.ed.foll.as section,subdivision a only acts upon the payments to which the beneficiary is entitled under the trust instrument or that the trustee,in the exercise of the trustee discretion,has determined or determines in the future to pay to the beneficiary,it parallels the structure of subdivisions b and c of section and similarly emphasizes the trustee discretion.
given that section,subdivision b and section,subdivision a allow a court to redirect to creditors only those funds that the trust or the trustee authorizes to be released to a beneficiary,to read section,subdivision c as allowing a court unbridled authority to invade trust to read out the clause in subdivision c that expressly preserves trustee be wholly anomalous.we will not so read that statute 
because we find the plain meaning of section,subdivision c sufficiently clear,both in isolation and in its statutory context,we need not consider legislative history or other extrinsic indications of legislative intent.we note,however,that our interpretation is consistent with expressed legislative intent.the sponsor of the bill that became section stated,i do not believe a beneficiary should be permitted to have the enjoyment of the interest under the trust while neglecting to pay restitution to the victim.assemblyman tom umberg,sponsor of assem.bill reg.sess,letter to governor pete wilson,july,see ventura county dcss,supra,th at,d,quoting cal.law revision com,west ann.ed.foll,as a general rule,the beneficiary should not be permitted to have the enjoyment of the interest under the trust while neglecting to support his or her dependents.addressing code section closely parallel to section.an interpretation of section that respects the trustee discretion thus is consistent with the legislative goal of empowering courts to deny enjoyment of trust interests to beneficiaries.and like the language of section itself and neighboring code provisions,the legislative history richard provides does not indicate a legislative intent to eliminate a trustee discretion 
a trustee discretion is not unlimited,however.if a trustee abuses her discretion,a court may order that trustee to do things differently.but whether a trustee exercises her discretion appropriately or abusively is measured by how this exercise conforms to the trustor intent.t he basic inquiry,whenever the exercise of a trustee discretion,absolute or otherwise,is challenged,is always whether the trustee acted in the state of mind contemplated by the trustor.estate of greenleaf d,see also estate of lackmann d,estate of canfield d.as such,a trustee determination not to make future payments can not be an abuse of discretion if it is clearly in keeping with the trustor intent.moreover,the actions of a trustee are presumed to be in good faith estate of ferrall cal d,and the burden is on the party challenging the action to show otherwise.see estate of crisler d.richard has not shown or even attempted to show that the trustee acted in bad faith 
lucile intent,as expressed in her first and second amended declarations of trust,was that mccoy use as much of the trust income and principal as mccoy shall deem necessary for the health,support,maintenance,and education,of steven,taking into consideration all other sources available for such purposes,and that mccoy give due concern to his needs and comfort,taking into consideration the needs that steven will have for his support,health,maintenance,and education,for the rest of his life.in short,mccoy was given broad discretion to fulfill the trust purpose of providing for steven needs to the extent that all other sources available for such purposes were not doing so.thus,lucile trust may be characterized as a discretionary support trust,in which the trust purpose is to provide for a beneficiary needs but the trustee has discretion in determining those needs.see witkin,summary of cal.law ed,support and discretionary trusts,a trust for support is one under which the trustee is to pay or apply no more than is necessary to educate or support the beneficiary.we find in mccoy exercise of discretion no evidence of the bad faith or unreasonable conduct that is required to find that a trustee has abused her discretion.see estate of traung d.estate of canfield,supra,d at.
richard,however,contends that ventura county dcss,in which division six of our district,under a closely parallel code provision,allowed a child support creditor to obtain payment from a discretionary trust,is precedent for his interpretation of section we disagree.
in ventura county dcss,a discretionary trust owed back child support payments and ongoing monthly payments,but the trustee refused to make any payments to the beneficiary without,apparently,giving any reason other than that he had unfettered discretion,and argued that the trial court could not force him to make such payments.the appellate court disagreed.ventura county dcss,supra,th at,d.
in ventura county dcss,the only apparent reason for nonpayment was to avoid paying child support.indeed,the court in ventura county dcss found that the trustee had abused his discretion by frustrating the trustor intent to provide support for her grandchildren.th at,d.here,by contrast,mccoy explained why she did not deem any payments toward steven support to be necessary given her obligation under the trust to consider alternate sources of support,she saw that the state of california was providing for steven needs.this explanation is reasonable and in keeping with lucile stated intent.
because few if any other jurisdictions have a statutory provision similar to section,other states authorities do not much illuminate the question be
