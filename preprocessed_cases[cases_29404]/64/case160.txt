hlc properties,limited hlc and kathryn crosby kathryn appeal the trial court order granting the estate of wilma wyatt crosby wilma estate petition and holding that wilma crosby wilma possessed a community property interest in her former husband right of publicity.hlc and kathryn argue that the wilma wyatt crosby trust wilma trust prior settlement of wilma community property claims bars this petition,and the right of publicity is not community property.we agree with the first point asserted by hlc and kathryn argument and therefore,reverse.
factual and procedural background 
harris lillis crosby,professionally known as bing crosby bing,was a popular century entertainer.he married wilma on september,and they had four sons together wilma died on november,and her will provided that her community property be distributed in trust to her sons.
bing remarried,and remained married to his second wife,kathryn,until he died on october.his will did not provide for wilma and left the residue of his estate to a marital trust for the benefit of kathryn.after bing death,appellant hlc was formed for the purpose of managing bing interests,including his right of publicity 
on september,wilma trust sued hlc and kathryn for declaratory relief as to the trust entitlement to interest,dividends,royalties and other income derived from the community property of bing and wilma in,the parties settled for approximately million.the settlement agreement provided,in part,that it was in complete and final settlement of all claims from any source whatsoever of royalties,income or monies due wilma trust and all beneficiaries of the trust,arising from property interests acquired by wilma,as a result of her marriage to bing crosby,through the date of this agreement.
the settlement agreement specified each source of income due wilma trust and provided that there are no other due or payable to the trust with respect to bing crosby in any medium.however,the agreement also provided that,s hould other income derived from works or performances of bing crosby during the marriage with wilma be discovered in the future,t he trust is entitled to its share the agreement did not specifically address bing right of publicity.
in addition,the agreement contained a release of all claims which provided that the settling parties,hereby compromise,release,acquit and forever discharge one another from all manner of actions,suits,liens,indebtedness,damages,claims,judgments,obligations and demands of every nature,kind or description whatsoever,whether known or unknown and whether suspected or unsuspected,which wilma trust has or hereinafter,can,shall or may have against hlc and kathryn directly or indirectly based upon or arising out of any act,duty,agreement,omission,transaction,event,occurrence,or any other matter whatsoever,whether now known or unknown,which occurred prior to the date of this agreement.each party is aware of and expressly waives,to the full extent permitted by the law,the benefits of california civil code,which provides as follows a general release does not extend to claims which the creditor does not known or suspect to exist in his favor at the time of executing the release,which if known by him must have materially affected his settlement with the debtor.wilma trust thereafter dismissed the action with prejudice.
on june,the trustee for wilma trust wrote counsel for hlc stating that a ll revenue resulting from the right to publicity of bing crosby should be shared with the beneficiaries of the trust because the right is the community property of bing and wilma.on january,the legislature amended civil code section section,subdivision p,the statute which provides that a deceased celebrity right of publicity is descendible,to state that t he rights recognized by this section are expressly made retroactive,including to those deceased personalities who died before january.on june,wilma estate filed the present petition for an order stating that wilma possessed a community property interest in bing right to publicity,and that wilma share of this interest passed to her heirs pursuant to the terms of her will.hlc and kathryn opposed the petition on the grounds that the settlement agreement barred it,and the right of publicity is not community property.
the trial court granted the petition and entered an order holding that wilma estate had a community property interest in bing right of publicity that wilma acquired during their marriage and that this community property interest passed by her testamentary dispositions to her heirs on the grounds that the settlement agreement did not bar the petition because the amendment to section,created a right that did not exist before by including deceased personalities who died before january,among those entitled to exercise the right of publicity res judicata did not apply because the petition presented here d id not come close to raising the same claims or issues described in the complaint which sought monetary damages for monies wrongfully withheld by hlc and section makes no mention of the community property aspects of the right of publicity,much less any mention that the right of publicity is separate property,or purports to be an exception to the general rule of family code section that there is a community interest unless otherwise specified.hlc and kathryn timely appealed.
contentions 
hlc and kathryn argue that the settlement agreement released wilma estate claims to bing right of publicity,the amendment to section did not create a new right of publicity in bing estate,and the right of publicity is not community property.

the release of claims in the settlement agreement 
hlc and kathryn contend that wilma estate petition was barred by res judicata on the grounds that the lawsuit determined what forms of community property to which wilma was entitled.wilma estate argues that its petition is a claim for equitable relief as distinguished from the complaint which was based on hlc alleged mishandling of wilma share of income,royalties and similar returns from the works and performances of bing.
res judicata precludes relitigation of issues in a case when the same issue has already been litigated and finally decided in a prior case involving the same parties.citation.pacific coast medical enterprises department of benefit payments d.the aspect of res judicata known as claim preclusion precludes parties or their privies from litigating the same cause of action that has been finally determined by a court.alpha mechanical,heating air conditioning,travelers casualty surety of america th,d.two proceedings are on the same cause of action if they are based on the same primary right.citation.the plaintiff primary right is the right to be free from a particular injury,regardless of the legal theory on which liability for the injury is based.citation.an injury is defined in part by reference to the set of facts,or transaction,from which the injury arose.federation of hillside canyon assns.city of los angeles th,d.
here,the lawsuit sought a declaration that wilma trust was entitled to income derived from bing and wilma community property in an attempt to hold hlc and kathryn liable for wilma share of all forms of community property owned by her and bing.wilma estate does not dispute that it is in privity with wilma trust.the present action also sought a declaration that wilma estate was entitled to income derived from bing and wilma community property but specifically as to bing right to publicity.accordingly,the current petition again sought to hold hlc and kathryn liable for wilma share of community property,and the primary right involved in both proceedings is the same the asserted right to wilma share of the community property owned by her and bing.on these grounds,res judicata principles preclude wilma estate from its claims to wilma share of community property.
furthermore,wilma estate expressly released its claims to any additional sources of community property,known or unknown,at the time of wilma trust settlement the settlement agreement purported to be a complete and final settlement of all claims,release d hlc and kathryn from all manner of actions whether known or unknown which wilma estate has or hereinafter,can,shall,or may have against hlc and kathryn directly or indirectly based upon any other matter whatsoever which occurred prior to the date of this agreement,and expressly waive d the benefits of california civil code.
wilma estate argues that the settlement agreement created an exception to its general release of all claims should other income derived from works or performances of bing crosby during the marriage with wilma be discovered in the future,and that this exception authorizes wilma estate to now claim a share of bing right of publicity because it only discovered this income after the settlement.however,the right of publicity involves the right of a person to profit derived from the use of his name,voice,signature,photograph,or likeness,as distinguished from income derived from a work or performance.civil code,subd.a.
moreover,this exception must be read narrowly in light of the agreement broad release of all conceivable claims.the exception only includes income discovered in the future,and,thus,necessarily only applies to income that the parties were not aware of at the time the contract was signed.however,the right of publicity was not such an undiscovered asset generating income unbeknownst to the parties nor does it constitute undiscovered income that existed at the time of the settlement agreement.wilma estate urged that its interpretation of the exception would allow the parties to bring future claims for any additional source of income that they belatedly discovered.to interpret the exception to apply to assets that,due to the parties oversight,were not included in the contract,would vitiate the express provisions of the release.brandwein butler th,d when interpreting a contract,we strive to interpret the parties agreement to give effect to all of a contract terms,and to avoid interpretations that render any portion superfluous,void or inexplicable.
wilma estate also argues that res judicata and its prior release of claims do not impact its current petition because,at the time of the action,there was no right of publicity in bing estate.see allied fire protection diede construction,th,d where it can not be said that plaintiff knew or should have known of the claim when the first action was filed,res judicata should not bar the second action.such a right,according to wilma estate,was only created when the amendment to section was signed into law.this argument,as we now explain,has no merit.
civil code section 
section addresses a celebrity right to transfer his right of publicity,including by testamentary instrument.hlc and kathryn contend that,as originally enacted in,section applied to bing estate,and that therefore,wilma estate released its claim to this right by not asserting it in the lawsuit and by not excepting it from the release in the settlement of that action.wilma estate argues that the trial court correctly concluded that the statute did not apply retroactively to bing estate until the amendment was passed.accordingly,wilma estate argues that it did not release its claim to bing right of publicity in the settlement because the claim did not exist at that time.in response,hlc and kathryn argue that the amendment merely clarified that the statute applied to celebrities who had died prior to its enactment,and did not create any new rights.
prior to its amendment,section protected a deceased personality right to control the commercial usage of his name,voice,signature,photograph,or likeness,and defined a deceased personality as any such natural person who has died within years prior to january.the statute further provided that the right of publicity was freely transferable by means of trust or testamentary documents,and could also pass by intestacy 
in may,federal district courts in california and new york,both addressing the commercial usage of the image of marilyn monroe,held that section did not authorize celebrities who died before the statute enactment to transfer their right of publicity by will.see the summary judgment orders entered in the milton greene archives,cmg worldwide,united states district court,central district of california,case no.cv mmm mcx,filed may,milton greene and in shaw family archives cmg worldwide,united states district court,southern district of new york,case civ.cm,dated may,cmg worldwide.these courts reasoned that a celebrity could not devise a subsequently created right of publicity by will because the individual did not own that right at the time of death.ibid.
these courts further concluded that,as to those celebrities who died before section enactment,the statute vests the posthumous right of publicity in their designated heirs.milton greene at the court concludes that the statute vests the posthumous right of publicity that it created directly in the statutorily designated heirs rather than in the residuary beneficiaries under a predeceased personality will cmg worldwide at any rights bestowed by on a personality already deceased at the time of its enactment could not be transferred by will it would vest instead in the persons provided for by statute.
the following month,california state senator sheila kuehl introduced a bill sb to abrogate both district courts rulings and clarify the meaning of section.see cal.stat.ch.sb,it is the intent of the legislature to abrogate the summary judgment orders entered in the milton greene archives,cmg worldwide,united states district court,central district of california,case no.cv mmm mcx,filed may,and in shaw family archives cmg worldwide,united states district court,southern district of new york,case civ.cm,dated may.senate judiciary summary at the author states this bill is necessary to clarify the legislature intent,when it enacted civil code 
sb was signed by governor arnold schwarzenegger less than five months later.the bill revised the statute provision regarding the transfer of the right of publicity by contract or testamentary instrument,explicitly providing that this provision applied to instruments executed before or after january,and that such rights shall be deemed to have existed at the time of death of any deceased personality who died prior to january.see cal.stat.ch.sb emphasis added.the bill further provided that t he rights recognized by this section are expressly made retroactive,including to those deceased personalities who died before january.ibid.
section,as originally enacted,applied to celebrities who died prior to january,
the parties dispute whether the amendment modified the law,thereby creating a new right,or merely clarified it to emphasize the legislature original intent.the trial court concluded that,prior to the amendment,section did not allow celebrities who died before its enactment to exercise the right of publicity.the trial court reached this conclusion based solely on the amendment provision that it was retroactive and without analyzing the pre version of the statute.in fact,prior to the amendment,section provided that it applied to any such natural person who has died within years prior to january.even the california and new york federal district courts,which held that the legislature could not have intended to authorize celebrities who died before the enactment of the statute to transfer a subsequently created right,concluded that,as to those celebrities,the right still vested in their heirs.by contrast,here,the trial court appears to have ignored the statute application to any such person who died within years prior to january.
