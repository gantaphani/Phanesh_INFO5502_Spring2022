the demurrer

plaintiff opposed,contending the action was not for two reasons.first,plaintiff contended defendants wrongful conduct continued past the issuance of the fraudulent mortgages in and.she asserted the palermo property was sold in,which was when the trust lost all right to that trust property and was thus financially damaged as a result of the breach of trust.and she asserted defendants still refuse to transfer loan on the cherokee property to the trust or allow the trust to pay for the mortgage in the ordinary manner.second,plaintiff contended defendants identities were fraudulently concealed,despite her reasonably diligent discovery efforts.plaintiff asserted she specifically demand ed the names of all persons with knowledge of the facts during discovery,but husband and perjured themselves.she further asserted she had requested both orally and via subpoena all relevant documents and information from defendants relating to the fraudulent loans,but defendants failed to identify their own role in the fraud.
the court sustained the demurrer to all causes of action without leave to amend.it found plaintiff certainly knew of the fraud when she filed the second suit in,the one the plaintiff calls the fraud suit.but three years before july,which is when today case was filed only gets plaintiff back to.this complaint does not allege any act of defendants in that year period of time,which would constitute the aiding and abetting of a fraud in that period.the court applied a similar analysis to find the other causes of action were it entered judgment accordingly.

the statute of limitations usually commences when a cause of action accrues,and it is generally said that an action accrues on the date of injury.citation.alternatively,it is often stated that the statute commences upon the occurrence of the last element essential to the cause of action.bernson browning ferris industries cal th,bernson.these general principles have been significantly modified by the common law discovery rule,which provides that the accrual date may be delayed until the plaintiff is aware of her injury and its negligent cause.ibid.now,under the discovery rule,the statute of limitations begins to run when the plaintiff suspects or should suspect that her injury was caused by wrongdoing,that someone has done something wrong to her.id.at.
yet ignorance of the identity of the defendant is not essential to a claim and therefore will not toll the statute.bernson,supra,cal
