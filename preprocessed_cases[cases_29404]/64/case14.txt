many people think that securing a favorable judgment from a court of competent jurisdiction marks the end of a plaintiff journey.in some instances,however,that is only a step along the road to meaningful relief.this is a case in point.
in,federal refinance,federal obtained a deficiency judgment for over against frank romano.it spent the next five years trying to satisfy the judgment by levying upon romano principal asset his shares of stock in a closely held corporation.when the stock proved elusive,federal asked the district court to set aside a series of allegedly fraudulent transfers.the court ensuing rulings did not entirely please either federal or romano.both appeal.
we affirm the district court bench decision i setting aside romano transfer of the shares to a family trust and ii upholding the creation and funding of certain limited partnerships.we are less sanguine,however,about the court subsequent invalidation of yet a third transfer.see fed.refin.klock,d.finding a procedural error,we vacate that order and remand for further proceedings.
background 
the background facts are largely undisputed.in,wickford realty trust obtained a mortgage loan from second national bank.romano unconditionally guaranteed repayment of the loan,which eventually went into default.federal acquired the defaulted loan and conducted a foreclosure proceeding.left with a deficiency,federal looked to the guaranty and brought a diversity action against romano in the united states district court for the district of massachusetts.on march,the court awarded federal a judgment for.
romano was thought to be a principal of a closely held corporation,essex group,essex,a holding company whose six subsidiaries each operated a nursing home.before any of the transfers here at issue,essex shares were held by romano,by his mother mary,and by the doyle family trust.
when federal attempted to satisfy the judgment by garnishing romano stock,it learned that the stock had flown the coop.in,romano had transferred shares the whole of his equity interest,without pecuniary consideration,to a newly formed trust the b t trust of which he was the trustee and his children were the beneficiaries.
federal frustration grew even more pronounced when it discovered that,between and,essex had created three limited partnerships.each had an essex subsidiary as its general partner with a share of the profits and romano wife,deborah klock,as its sole limited partner with an share of the profits.moreover,the general partners had divested themselves of their real estate,each having spun off title to its nursing home into its limited partnership.these transactions arguably diluted the value of essex shares.
since romano did not appear to have other significant assets,federal sued to get the shares back into his hands and to collapse the limited partnerships.
ii.the bench decision 
all of these claims were tried to the court.the trial ended in a bench decision handed down on april.as we explain below,each side got half a loaf.
the first count of federal complaint asked the court to invalidate the stock transfer as a fraudulent conveyance under section of the uniform fraudulent conveyance act ufca the ufca constructive fraud provision,in force in,read 
every conveyance made and every obligation incurred by a person who is or will be thereby rendered insolvent is fraudulent as to creditors without regard to his actual intent if the conveyance is made or the obligation is incurred without fair consideration.
laws ch,repealed.the district court determined that romano conveyance violated this section.it set aside the transfer to the trust and decreed that the shares of stock were deemed to be in the unencumbered possession of romano.
counts ii through iv of federal complaint alleged that the purpose and effect of the creation and funding of the partnerships was to dilute the value of romano stock.on this basis,federal sought to collapse the limited partnerships.in mounting this attack,it relied upon both ufca,quoted supra,and ufca.the latter provision is an actual fraud provision.throughout the relevant time frame,it read 
every conveyance made and every obligation incurred with actual intent,as distinguished from intent presumed in law,to hinder,delay or defraud either present or future creditors,is fraudulent as to both present and future creditors.
laws ch,repealed.
the district court ruled against federal on these counts.it rejected federal constructive fraud claim,finding that the corporations were the actual transferors and that they were not insolvent at the times of the transfers.the court likewise rejected the claim of actual fraud,crediting evidence that there was a legitimate business purpose behind the creation and funding of the limited partnerships,namely,that the restructuring was a prerequisite to obtaining needed financing from the united states department of housing and urban development hud.
iii.the proceedings 
having won a partial victory,federal filed a motion in aid of judgment on may.see.a.in that motion,federal asked the district court to reach and apply the shares of essex stock.much to federal dismay,it learned that the shares had slipped away again.the tale follows.
at some point the exact time is immaterial for present purposes,essex had purchased from another of romano creditors a debt.see fdic elder care,cir describing the origin of the debt.in late april of whether before or after the date of the district court bench decision is not entirely clear,romano transferred his shares to essex,ostensibly in exchange for an credit and a forbearance agreement on that indebtedness.
faced with a tantalean predicament,federal promptly moved to reconsider the denial of its motion for the appointment of a receiver,see supra note,and to annul this most recent conveyance.federal averred that the transaction should be rescinded as preferential.because this latest transfer took place after the effective date of the uniform fraudulent transfer act ufta,that updated version of chapter governed the claim asserted.the ufta provides in pertinent part 
a transfer made by a debtor is fraudulent as to a creditor whose claim arose before the transfer was made if the transfer was made to an insider for an antecedent debt,the debtor was insolvent at that time,and the insider had reasonable cause to believe that the debtor was insolvent.
the district court saw no need to take evidence,but,rather,summarily voided the transfer as preferential.fed,d at.the court also ensured that the elusive shares would stay put,enjoining romano from transferring or encumbering them in any way that might interfere with federal efforts to reach and apply.finally,as a sanction for romano misconduct during discovery,the court granted federal renewed motion for the appointment of a receiver to hold the shares for the time being.see id.at.
iv.the appeals 
the parties have.with respect to the district court bench decision,romano challenges the order voiding the transfer to the b t trust whereas federal challenges the order upholding the creation and funding of the limited partnerships.with respect to the district court subsequent written decision,romano and has the order invalidating the arrangement.in the pages that follow,we address these disputes sequentially.
v.the transfer to the b t trust 
ufca sets out two basic conditions for setting aside a transfer on the ground of constructive fraud the transferor must have i been insolvent at the time of the conveyance or rendered insolvent by it,and ii made the conveyance without fair consideration.boston trading group burnazos,cir.a person is insolvent for these purposes when the readily realizable market value of his assets is less than the amount required to pay his existing debts as they become due.first fed.sav.loan ass napoleon.fair consideration is given in exchange for transferred property when,as a fair equivalent therefor,and in good faith,other property is conveyed or an antecedent debt is satisfied.boston trading group,at quoting former.laws ch,repealed.
on appeal,romano mounts a rather anemic attack on the district court initial insolvency determination.he argues,in substance,that the court could not reach a decision as to his solvency without some evidence as to the value of the essex stock.this argument is jejune.his own testimony established that the shares of essex stock were his only significant asset at the relevant time and that he was then personally obligated to repay over in loans that were about to go into default.if the stock had little value,romano was insolvent.conversely,if the stock value exceeded romano massive liabilities,then the transfer would have rendered him insolvent.either way,romano attack misfires.
his challenge to the court conclusion that the transfer lacked fair consideration is hopeless.he admitted that he received no money or property in return for the shares.and although his brief includes a perfunctory assertion that the transfer was in fact adequately supported by the love and affection of his children,he points us to no case law that suggests that,for purposes of the ufca,such intangibles may supplant money,property,or satisfaction of an antecedent debt as fair consideration.
romano only colorable argument implicates the district court ruling in response to a motion in limine.in the pretrial proceedings,romano identified an expert witness whose testimony was intended to show that,at the time of the conveyance to the b t trust,the shares were worthless.federal moved in limine to exclude the testimony.romano objected,exhorting the court to allow his expert to testify on the theory that a fraudulent conveyance action will not lie if the asset conveyed is worthless at the time of transfer the court granted the motion in limine,holding that the value of the stock was legally irrelevant.romano asks us to overturn this ruling,vacate the order setting aside the transfer,and remand for further proceedings.
as framed,this assignment of error presents an abstract legal question regarding the proper interpretation of a state statute.such questions engender de novo review.see salve regina coll.russell,d protective life ins.dignity viatical sett.partners,cir.
our starting point is,of course,the statutory text.ufca authorizes the setting aside of certain conveyances.it defines a conveyance as every payment of money,assignment,release,transfer,lease,mortgage or pledge of tangible or intangible property,and also the creation of any lien or incumbrance.nothing in the statute qualifies the term property or in any way indicates a legislative intent to limit the statute reach to conveyances involving property having a positive market value.
finding no comfort in the language of the ufca,romano falls back upon the decision in richman leiser.that decision can not carry the weight that romano loads upon it 
in richman,an unsecured creditor attempted to set aside a conveyance of property encumbered by liens exceeding its market value.despite a showing of fraudulent intent,the court refused to invalidate the transfer.the court began with the proposition that a conveyance is not established as a fraudulent conveyance upon showing of a fraudulent intention alone there must also be a resulting diminution in the assets of the debtor available to creditors.id.at.it found no such diminution,reasoning that the complaining unsecured creditor could not have reached the property before the conveyance,and so the conveyance itself could not have been fraudulent as to him.id.at quoting stauffer stauffer.
romano reads this language to signify that a fraudulent conveyance claim will not lie unless a debtor has equity in the transferred property.richman,however,does not sweep so broadly.the linchpin of the richman decision is the principle that a transfer of fully encumbered property,property that is mortgaged for more than it is worth and,thus,has no residual value puts no otherwise available assets beyond the grasp of an unsecured creditor.that principle makes good sense whether or not the debtor effects a transfer,the accumulated security interests will prevent an unsecured creditor from reaching and applying the overencumbered property.stauffer,at refusing to set aside a conveyance of property held by the entireties because the husband creditor could not have reached the asset.
the case at hand is cut from a different cloth.the shares of essex stock were free and clear at the time that romano signed them over to the b t trust.absent the transfer,federal could have reached the its an effort to satisfy the judgment.thus,the transfer put property that would otherwise have been available out of the complaining creditor reach.for that reason,richman is inapposite.
this result comports with the policies underlying the ufca.the purpose of the ufca is to preserve a debtor assets so that creditors may look to them in the event that the debtor ceases payments first fed.sav.loan,at citations omitted.a debtor may not give his assets away and thereby put them beyond the reach of creditors.id.at.given the district court factual findings,romano conduct falls into the heartland of the prohibition against fraudulent conveyances.allowing an exception on the ground that the shares were worthless would be at odds with the rationale underlying that prohibition.we conclude,therefore,that the district court did not err in granting the motion in limine.
romano makes a related claim of error implicating the district court denial of his motion for judgment as a matter of law.see.c.in the course of arguing that motion,he vouchsafed that federal could not make the required prima facie showing of romano insolvency at the time of the transfer without some evidence as to the value of the shares.he now assigns error to the court denial of this motion.this is an old whine in a new bottle.the argument essentially repeats a claim already made and rejected.see supra.as said,the evidence established that romano was deeply in debt at the time of the transfer and that the transferred stock had been his only substantial asset.hence,federal made out a prima facie case of insolvency.since romano did not rebut this,he made no discernible effort to do lower court did not err in denying the motion for judgment as a matter of law.
before leaving this transfer,we address one related item.at the tail end of its brief,federal makes a perfunctory argument to the effect that the district court erred in denying its request for attorneys fees.
we need not tarry.federal offhand pitch is unaccompanied by any developed argumentation.under our precedents,therefore,it merits summary rejection.see,blake pellegrino,cir ryan royal ins,cir united states zannino,cir.in all events,neither the ufca nor the guaranty contains a provision,and federal offers us no reason to exempt this case from the usual rule that,absent a specific statutory or contractual provision,a prevailing party can not recover attorneys fees as of right from the losing party.see chambers nasco,d alyeska pipeline serv.wilderness soc y,d.
vi.the creation and funding of the limited partnerships 
federal from the district court determination that the creation of the limited partnerships and the subsequent transfers to them of the nursing home properties did not constitute fraudulent conveyances under the ufca.in federal estimation,these transactions were both constructively and actually fraudulent.before analyzing federal contentions,we pause to clarify the standard of review.
standard of review.
a party who challenges a district court findings of fact,arrived at after a bench trial,faces a steep uphill climb.when a district court finds the facts without the intervention of a jury,the court of appeals is not at liberty to start afresh.see cumpiano banco santander,cir keyes sec y of navy,cir see also.a.the trial judge sees and hears the witnesses at first hand and comes to appreciate the nuances of the litigation in a way that appellate courts can not hope to replicate.cumpiano,at.consequently,i f the district court account of the evidence is plausible the court of appeals may not reverse it even though convinced that had it been sitting as the trier of fact,it would have weighed the evidence differently.anderson city of bessemer city,d.in the last analysis,factual findings or conclusions drawn therefrom may only be set aside if,after a searching review of the entire record,the court of appeals form s a strong,unyielding belief that a mistake has been made.cumpiano,at.
federal strives to free itself from this inhospitable standard of review by arguing that the trial court merely determined the legal effect of uncontroverted facts.thus,federal thesis runs,the court decision should be reviewed de novo.we reject this thesis for two reasons.
in the first place,federal characterization of the material facts as uncontroverted is wishful thinking.factual disputes sprout throughout the record like weeds in an untended garden.although federal classifies such things as the protagonists motives in restructuring the nursing home operations and the rationale for naming klock,rather than romano,as the limited partner,as questions of law,that taxonomy is unrealistic.we consistently have refused to permit parties to advantage themselves by couching questions of fact as questions of law,see,reliance steel prods.fire ins,cir,and we see no reason to abandon that salutary practice today.the clearly erroneous standard of review can not be evaded by the simple expedient of creative relabeling.id.
in the second place,even if the facts were uncontroverted,that circumstance alone would not alter the standard of review.when the trier findings depend upon its choice of competing inferences drawn from undisputed facts,the clearly erroneous standard continues to apply.see jackson united states,cir dedham water cumberland farms dairy,cir.to the extent that the raw facts are undisputed,this is such a case.
we also reject federal intimation that mixed questions of fact and law invariably demand de novo review.the scope of review for mixed questions varies.the more the inquiry,the more likely we are to apply clear error review the more the inquiry,the more likely we are to undertake de novo review.sierra fria evans,cir united states howard in re extrad.of howard,cir.probing the existence of a fraudulent conveyance customarily is a factbound inquiry,subjecting the court findings to clear error review.see,beal bank pittorino,cir barrett cont l.bank trust,cir.this result commends itself with particular force where,as here,a claim turns on elusive issues of motive or intent.see crellin,equipmentlease,cir see also cumpiano,at counseling that f indings concerning an actor intent fit neatly within the integument of the clearly erroneous rule.we are satisfied,therefore,that the standard of review applicable to the lower court disposition of counts ii through iv is clear error.
constructive fraud.
we turn now to the trial court findings.setting aside a conveyance for constructive fraud under ufca requires both a finding that the transferor was insolvent at the time of the transfer or was rendered insolvent thereby and a finding that the conveyance was made without fair consideration.implicit in this analytic framework is the assumption that the factfinder first must identify the relevant transferor.see boston trading group,at.here,the district court concluded that the corporations were the relevant transferors 
t aking all the evidence and the reasonable inferences therefrom,the court is not persuaded that at the time of that restructuring the corporations,who were actually the ones who were making the conveyance of their stock,were thereby rendered insolvent.emphasis supplied.
federal mounts two attacks on the district court finding.first,it pounces on a mistake embedded in the court articulation and labors to persuade us that this bevue discredits the court conclusion.second,it posits that the finding is clearly erroneous.neither attack succeeds.
to be sure,the district court misspoke at one point in its bench decision there was no conveyance of stock involved in the creation and funding of the limited partnerships.rather,the shareholders of the parent company essex voted to create the limited partnerships,and each subsidiary corporation then transferred its real estate to its newly formed limited partnership.
from all indications,the court passing mention of a stock transfer amounts to a slip of the tongue,substituting stock for real estate.the record as a whole makes it crystal clear that the court squarely decided the identity question.at the start of the trial,the court put its finger on the problem,asking federal counsel,w ho caused the limited partnerships to be set up counsel response framed the two possible answers to this i essex and the subsidiary corporations as the donors of the real estate,or ii romano whom federal endeavored to depict as the actual transferor.trial of the limited partnership claims focused on which of these proposed answers was correct,who should be deemed the transferor.the court proceeded to resolve this question.
we have held before that a reasoned decision should not be vacated merely because a lapsus linguae occurred.see,lenn portland sch,cir clauson smith,cir.so it is here taken in context,the district court infelicitous choice of words does not undermine the cogency of its determination.
moving to the next plateau,we perceive no clear error in the court conclusion that the corporations,not the individual defendants,were the relevant transferors.it is undisputed that essex and its subsidiaries formed the limited partnerships and deeded the real estate to them.although romano apparently voted his shares or,more precisely,the shares standing in the name of the b t trust in favor of the restructuring,there is no direct evidence to support a finding that he was the driving force behind the decision.romano was not the majority shareholder,and he testified that he was not in a position to either block or approve what took place.while we may regard romano assertion as suspect,weighing the evidence and assessing the witnesses credibility is uniquely the province of the district court.here,there were two permissible views of the evidence.in such a circumstance,the factfinder choice between those competing views can not be clearly erroneous.anderson,at.keyes,at.
that ends this phase of our inquiry.given the court supportable finding as to the identity of the transferors,federal claim of constructive fraud must fail.viewing the corporations as the transferors,there is no evidence that they were insolvent either at the time of the transfers or immediately thereafter.
actual fraud.
this leaves federal claim under ufca.our analysis of this claim is straightforward.setting aside a conveyance for actual fraud requires,at a bare minimum,a finding of actual intent to hinder,delay or defraud either present or future creditors.palmer murphy,construing ufca.the court below found as a matter of fact that the limited partnerships were created and funded for a legitimate business purpose rather than to hinder,delay,or defraud creditors.this finding is not clearly erroneous.
klock testified that the reason for the restructuring was to obtain hud financing to rehabilitate the nursing homes.according to klock,hud required,as a condition of each loan,that the real estate be separated from the operating entity.the limited partnerships provided the vehicles for that separation.despite countervailing evidence suggesting that the purpose behind the restructuring was to dilute the value of romano stock,the trial court was free to choose between the two versions of the truth and draw appropriate inferences.see anderson,at.keyes,at.consequently,we uphold the court rejection of the actual fraud claim.
vii.the transfer to essex 
we come now to the order setting aside the transfer of romano shares to essex in response to federal motion to annul that transfer,the district court held a status conference on june.although the court set the matter down for hearing eight days hence,it was vague as to how that hearing would proceed.when the appointed date arrived,the court declined to take testimony,instead inviting oral argument and telling the parties that it was treating the hearing functionally as a motion for summary judgment.
after listening to the lawyers arguments,the court reserved decision.it subsequently filed a written rescript in which it ruled,as a matter of law,th
