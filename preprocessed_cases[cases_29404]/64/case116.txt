this case,like several before it as well as a few books and an academy award winning film concerns the estate of the late billionaire howard hughes.plaintiff melvin dummar has long maintained that he is entitled to a portion of the hughes fortune,having been named an heir in a handwritten document the holographic will purporting to be hughes will.a nevada jury found the holographic will invalid in.but dummar filed a new suit in the united states district court for the district of utah in,alleging that defendants william rice lummis and frank william gay deprived him of his inheritance by conspiring to cause the jury to reject the holographic will.his amended complaint the complaint asserts four claims against defendants fraud,violation of the federal racketeer influenced and corrupt organization rico statute,violation of nevada rico statute,and unjust enrichment.he contends that absent defendants wrongdoing,the jury would have found the will valid,and he would have inherited million.for relief he requests million,with interest dating back to,treble damages,punitive damages,costs,and attorney fees.the district court,ruling that dummar claims were barred by issue preclusion based on the judgment,dismissed the complaint.exercising jurisdiction under,we affirm the dismissal.as we will explain,the fraud and federal rico claims are each,the nevada rico claim fails to state a claim,and the claim is barred by issue preclusion.
background 
a.the complaint 
the complaint alleges the following facts 
late in the evening,sometime during the last week of december,dummar was driving through rural nevada.when he pulled off the road for a rest stop,he saw a bloodied and disheveled man lying in the road.dummar woke the semiconscious man and offered to take him to a hospital.the man instead requested to be driven to the sands hotel in las vegas,nevada.dummar complied,and during the ride to las vegas the man identified himself as howard hughes.after leaving the man at the sands hotel,dummar had no contact with him.
hughes died in.shortly after hughes death,a stranger delivered an envelope to dummar at the gas station in utah where he worked.the envelope was addressed to the president of the church of jesus christ of latter day saints the lds church.steaming open the envelope,dummar found inside a,handwritten document purporting to be hughes last will and testament.the document listed him as a beneficiary of hughes estate.dummar delivered the envelope to the lds church,leaving it on a secretary desk.
in april the lds church delivered the holographic will to the clark county district court in las vegas,nevada,for probate.a trial ensued to determine the will validity.dummar was an proponent of the will several relatives of hughes,including defendant lummis,opposed it.although the holographic will named lummis a beneficiary,he stood to gain more from intestate succession.defendant gay,who was the chief operating officer of the hughes entities for the period surrounding hughes death,worked together with the opponents of the holographic will.at compl.at.at trial dummar testified about giving hughes a ride the opponents of the will,however,introduced testimony that for a period of years,including december,hughes never left his hotel.each side presented testimony from a handwriting expert.on june,the jury rejected the holographic will.
nearly years later dummar obtained information regarding misconduct related to the trial.he learned from a pilot that on various occasions before december,hughes had flown to locations in southern nevada to investigate sites for a terminal for supersonic jets and to visit brothels.the flights were arranged by howard eckersley,a close aide of hughes and employee of gay.during late december eckersley had the pilot take hughes to visit a prostitute at the cottontail ranch at lida junction in rural nevada.while waiting for hughes at the brothel,the pilot fell asleep when he awoke,he was told that hughes had left alone.the pilot then returned to las vegas without hughes.some months after this incident,he accepted an executive position with a company owned by a friend of hughes.before the pilot left,eckersley ordered him to turn over his flight logs and company records so that all references to hughes as his passenger could be removed.the pilot then signed a nondisclosure agreement,which he honored until recently.
in addition to the information from the former pilot,dummar has learned or perhaps only complaint often omits when the information was received and who the source was the following after the holographic will was delivered for probate,there was a meeting of aides close to hughes in which it was decided that all would testify that hughes never left the desert inn hotel,where he lived,for years at a time gay and lummis bribed and threatened the aides to testify falsely top aides,including eckersley,did testify falsely that hughes never left his hotel during the period in question gay himself testified that there was a possibility that hughes left the desert inn,but he denied any actual knowledge of such a departure high doses of codeine contributed to hughes death,and defendants were involved in the destruction of boxes of empty codeine vials a member of the jury successfully campaigned to be elected foreperson by using typewritten notes that he claimed to have prepared at home from his handwritten trial notes,thus irrevocably taint ing the verdict,id.at compl.at after the trial a reporter was threatened and warned not to interview this juror or investigate the reasons for the probate verdict there was a pattern of threats,including of bodily harm,against witnesses who were to testify for dummar the opponents of the holographic will paid more than for expert testimony on handwriting and it is understood that the jury foreperson had his debts at hughes casinos forgiven,id.at compl.at.
district court proceedings 
gay and lummis each filed a motion under.b to dismiss dummar complaint.they raised several grounds for dismissal,including issue preclusion arising from the probate judgment,time bar,and failure to state claims entitling dummar to relief.dummar responded to both motions.after a hearing the district court granted the motions on the ground of issue preclusion.dummar motion for reconsideration was denied.he now appeals.defendants argue that the district court was correct to dismiss the claims on grounds but argue alternatively that the dismissal can be affirmed on the other grounds that they raised in district court.
ii.discussion 
we review the district court grant of a rule b motion de novo,accepting all allegations as true and viewing them in the light most favorable to the plaintiff.lane simon,cir.we may affirm a district court decision on any grounds for which there is a record sufficient to permit conclusions of law,even grounds not relied upon by the district court.weitzel div.of occupational prof l licensing of dep t of commerce of utah,cir internal quotation marks omitted.we address each of dummar claims in turn fraud,federal civil rico,nevada civil rico,and unjust enrichment.our choice of the ground on which to affirm says nothing about the merits of other possible grounds.
defendants argue that dummar claim for fraud is.neither party has suggested whether utah or nevada law should apply to the fraud claim,but we need not decide between them.the laws of the two states are similar in all relevant respects,so the choice of law would not influence the outcome.
f raud must be proven by clear and convincing evidence as to each of the following elements a false representation made by the defendant defendant knowledge or belief that the representation is false or insufficient basis for making the representation defendant intention to induce the plaintiff to act or to refrain from acting in reliance upon the misrepresentation plaintiff justifiable reliance upon the misrepresentation and damage to the plaintiff resulting from such reliance.
albert wohlers bartgis,utah elements,though phrased differently,are in substance the same.see gold standard,getty oil,utah.in particular,each state requires a false representation,which,under federal rule of civil procedure b,must be state ed with particularity.the only false representations alleged by the complaint to have been made by either defendant or,rather,caused to have been made by defendants are the statements by hughes aides in depositions and at trial that hughes never left his las vegas hotel during late december.
a limitations period applies to fraud claims in both nevada and utah.see.d utah code ann.in both states the cause of action accrues upon the discovery by the aggrieved party of the facts constituting the fraud.stat d utah code ann.the question then is when dummar discovered the facts constituting the fraud.if the answer is apparent on the face of the complaint,this issue may be resolved on a motion to dismiss.see aldrich mcculloch properties,cir jablon dean witter,cir.
defendants argue that dummar discovered the facts constituting the fraud in,when he heard the deposition and trial testimony.dummar,in contrast,contends that discovery did not occur until he learned of the existence of the pilot,less than three years before filing the complaint.before then,he asserts,it was not clear that defendants had committed fraud at the probate trial.aplt.reply br.at.dummar does not explain why the fraud became clear only when he learned of the pilot,but we will address the two possibilities that come to mind.
first,dummar may be suggesting,as he did before the district court,that he did not know that the man in the desert was hughes until the pilot provided him with confirmation of the man identity.but even the pilot account was not uncontrovertible believe the pilot but not the man in the desert discovery in this context can not mean possessing greater certainty than one ordinarily needs to take important action,such as initiating litigation.before learning of the pilot,dummar not only had the word of the man in the desert but also the appearance of the holographic will eight years later.if the man in the desert was not hughes,then dummar account of hughes agent showing up at dummar gas station several weeks after hughes death with a handwritten will bequeathing him millions of dollars would make not the slightest sense.so certain was dummar that the man was hughes that he was an proponent of the holographic will during a lengthy probate trial.accepting the complaint allegations as true,it is apparent that by dummar had discovered the falsity of any statement that hughes had never left his las vegas hotel during late december.
second,dummar may be suggesting that he did not discover the facts constituting the fraud until he learned from the pilot that hughes aide eckersley had arranged hughes flight to the cottontail ranch,because it was only then that dummar knew that someone specifically,eckersley had knowingly made false statements.but,as explained above,dummar had discovered that those statements were false by the time of the probate trial also,he knew that eckersley was testifying about something that eckersley claimed to have personal knowledge of.if more conclusive evidence of fraudulent intent were required before the statute began to run,then many a fraud claim would be subject to no time limitation at all.as the alaska supreme court has recognized,
evidence of scienter is usually circumstantial,and a defrauded victim will normally have only indicia of scienter before suing.notice of the scienter element could not require knowledge of conclusive evidence,because conclusive evidence of scienter is rarely available,even through exercise of discovery.if that level of notice were required,the limitations period for fraud would never begin running.
city of fairbanks amoco chem,alaska.that dummar did not have additional proof of eckersley intent does not mean that he still needed to discover it.the facts alleged in the complaint demonstrate that in dummar had all the knowledge necessary to start the limitations period running against him.dismissal of his fraud claim was appropriate.
federal civil rico 
defendants argue that we should affirm the dismissal of dummar federal civil rico claim because,among other reasons,it fails to state a claim and is.dummar has not responded on appeal to their argument that he has not pleaded essential elements of a rico claim.perhaps we could affirm based on this failure to respond.utah ex rel.div.of foresty,fire state lands united states,cir failure to challenge alternative holding of district court constitutes waiver.but we choose instead to dispose of the claim because it is argument that dummar did,at least nominally,address.
to bring a civil rico claim,a plaintiff must allege that he was injured in his business or property by the rico violation.sedima,imrex,d.a rico violation requires conduct of an enterprise through a pattern of racketeering activity.id.footnote omitted.a pattern of racketeering activity requires at least two acts of racketeering activity.see.the rico statute lists a number of crimes that constitute racketeering activity.see id.
the supreme court has held that a civil federal rico action is subject to a limitations period.see agency holding,d.although the court 
has not settled upon a definitive rule for when the limitations clock starts running,it has announced two possibilities either when the plaintiff knew or should have known of his injury the rule or when the plaintiff was injured,whether he was aware of the injury or not the rule.
cory aztec steel,cir.in either case the plaintiff need not be aware of the pattern of racketeering activity.see rotella wood,d id.at.even if a discovery accrual rule applies,discovery of the injury,not discovery of the other elements of a claim,is what starts the clock.it is unnecessary for us to choose between the two rules today,because it can not be disputed that dummar injury and his discovery of that injury occurred simultaneously,when the jury returned its verdict that the holographic will was invalid.the limitations period therefore began running against him in.
dummar asserts,however,that o n federal causes of action,fraudulent concealment is read into every statute of limitations.aplt.reply br.at.from this we gather that he means to argue,as he did before the district court,that the limitations period should be tolled because of fraudulent concealment of the alleged rico activity.the supreme court has recognized that equitable tolling may be available under rico,see rotella,at,and we have stated that a rico cause of action can be tolled by fraudulent concealment when the plaintiff establishes 
the use of fraudulent means by the party who raises the ban of the statute successful concealment from the injured party and that the party claiming fraudulent concealment did not know or by the exercise of due diligence could not have known that he might have a cause of action.
ballen prudential bache,cir internal quotation marks omitted.allegations of fraudulent concealment,like other types of fraud,must be pleaded with particularity.see great plains trust union pac,cir.
dummar has made no attempt on appeal to show that he pleaded the elements of fraudulent concealment.at any rate,such an attempt would be futile.to begin with,he has not adequately alleged successful concealment from dummar of an element of his cause of action.the complaint lists three acts alleged to support equitable tolling the actual perjury and misleading testimony of hughes aides,the destruction of evidence in the flight logs of the specific flights taken by hughes and the pilot in december,and the ongoing understanding of the employees of the hughes entities of the enforceability of the agreements.at compl.at.none of these is a sufficient allegation of fraudulent concealment.first,as explained in the above discussion of the fraud claim,dummar had enough information concerning the perjury to begin the limitations period at the time of the probate trial the perjury may have misled the jury,but not him.we might add that tampering with witnesses in a proceeding is not racketeering activity under the federal rico statute.see deck engineered laminates,cir.second,the alteration of the flight logs alleged to have occurred nearly ten years before the pro
