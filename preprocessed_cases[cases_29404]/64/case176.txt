introduction

in may,the reinosos acquired a unit apartment complex on west avenue j in lancaster the j apartments in their names as husband and wife,as community property.they testified that they worked together in connection with the management of the property.in late september or early october,the city of lancaster issued a notice of code enforcement corrections with respect to certain units at the j apartments.among the issues raised in the notice were general dilapidation infestation of insects,vermin,and rodents inadequate garbage storage lack of proper water and heat and dampness of residences.

the reinosos tendered the defense of the tenant action to their insurer,plaintiff and respondent axis surplus insurance company axis.the reinosos and proud american had become insured under two policies providing commercial general liability policies issued by axis with respect to the j apartments.axis agreed to represent the reinosos and proud american in the tenant action under a reservation of rights.the action settled for just over,with axis contributing axis then brought this action against the reinosos seeking to recover its defense costs and its settlement contribution together about in the tenant action.
at the trial of the action brought by axis to recover its defense costs and settlement contribution,michael king,an attorney,testified that axis retained him to represent edgar,linda,and proud american in the tenant action.king referred to a report he prepared for axis concerning the tenant action.the trial court found that the report provided substantial factual support for the serious habitability claims in the tenant action and the reasonableness of the ultimate settlement of that action.king testified that he did not believe that edgar,linda,and proud american could prevail in the tenant action.
in a report king prepared concerning efforts to settle the tenant action,he stated that the reinosos entered a agreement with steve donell of jalmar properties to manage the j apartments.donell retention,the report stated,would show the reinosos good faith efforts to correct any remaining slum conditions at the j apartments.edgar onsite property managers told king that before jalmar properties began managing the j apartments,tenants routinely complained about the condition of their apartments.the complaints received little or no response and the problems escalated.a july,county of los angeles inspection report described serious habitability issues with respect to several units at the j apartments.

david hart,a senior vice president of claims for axis,testified that linda was not a factor in his settlement considerations.hart testified that he absolutely did not consider linda reinoso culpability in reaching the decision to settle the tenant action and did not allocate any part of the settlement proceeds toward settling the case against her.hart testimony reflected that at this point in axis action to recover its costs,axis minimized linda involvement,apparently in the event it was determined that linda was covered by the insurance.linda and edgar argued against axis position,suggesting that any liability to axis should be joint and several also probably because of the possibility that linda was covered by the insurance 
linda testified that she and edgar had worked together with the property management and purchasing properties since.linda and edgar married in.linda testified that she played a somewhat limited role in the management and oversight of the j apartments and that she paid bills and maintained some records for the j apartments.the trial court found linda testimony about her limited role at the j apartments to be credible.the trial court found less credible linda testimony that she was not aware of the criminal proceedings involving edgar that arose out of the ownership of rental properties.edgar testified that linda played a very limited role in the management of the j apartments and that her primary responsibility was to pay certain bills.the trial court found this testimony not credible,and linda,based on her testimony,to be more than a ministerial bill payer.
edgar testified that he had been involved in real estate ownership and the management of rental properties for about years.he claimed to have little insight into the type of maintenance that rental properties needed and little knowledge or understanding of mold,pest control,or needed repairs.he asserted that he hired a site manager for each of his projects and had that person make management decisions without his input.he said that the site managers reported to a general manager in his organization,implying that he played a limited role in maintenance and improvement decisions.the trial court found edgar to be an unbelievable witness and rejected his effort to persuade it that he was an uninformed and innocent absentee owner.instead,the trial court found that the evidence established that edgar was an involved and informed owner who insisted on managing his property in a manner that led to poor living conditions for his tenants.
donell testified that he worked with edgar and linda for three months at the beginning of.he believed that the j apartments were in a terrible,unsafe,and unsanitary condition at that time.he also believed that edgar was not a good owner and that edgar decisions were guided only by costs and not by proper management principles.donnell considered edgar approach to property management to be inappropriate.according to donell,edgar wanted things done cheaply even if that meant substandard living conditions.edgar told donell that he wanted donell to use the reinosos business model.donell said that edgar told him that edgar business model was to get new,illegal immigrants from central america as tenants because they were not aware of their rights and could be threatened with deportation if they complained about conditions.
donell testified that he spoke with linda about management issues between and times.those conversation concerned daily management issues such as maintenance,repairs,and rent rolls.linda assisted in the creation of a rent roll.donell found linda to be informed and engaged.linda told donell that the reinosos had limited funds to spend on repairs.after the tenant action settled,donell left his position with the reinosos because edgar would not permit him to perform needed maintenance and make needed repairs.
at trial,edgar and linda argued that axis had failed to allocate defense and settlement expenses between claims and as between each insured defendant.there is no evidence that the insurer had made any such allocation.the trial court,in its statement of decision,did not refer explicitly to any such allocation.

the reinosos and proud american appealed from the judgment.the appeals by edgar and proud american have been dismissed.in her appeal,linda contends that the trial court erred when it found that she was not an innocent insured entitled to benefits under the insurance policies.linda also contends that the trial court erred when,for purposes of reimbursement,it failed to apportion the settlement axis paid among its three insureds linda,edgar,and proud american based on the actual settlement costs for each insured and instead,in effect,ordered the insureds to pay the entire sum jointly and severally.
discussion 
substantial evidence supports the trial court finding that linda wasnot insured for her acts 
linda contends that the trial court erred in finding that she was not an innocent insured entitled to benefits under the insurance policies because the trial court wrongly applied an objective rather than a subjective standard in determining that she knew of the conditions at the j apartments,and because substantial evidence does not support the trial court determination that linda intended or expected the tenants injuries.the trial court did not err.
