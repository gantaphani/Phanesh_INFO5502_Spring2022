introduction 
this case involves a dispute over the ownership of property formerly owned by decedent kenneth liebler.liebler daughter,appellant melanie carne,as putative successor trustee to the kenneth liebler irrevocable trust dated december,the trust,filed a second amended petition the petition to confirm the validity of the trust,carne status as successor trustee of the trust,and the assets of the trust.in her petition,carne sought to confirm that certain real property previously owned by liebler,located on via regla the via regla property,had been properly transferred to the trust.the trust states,i transfer to my trustee the property listed in schedule a,attached to this agreement,and lists the via regla property in schedule a.the trust is signed by liebler as grantor and by defendant and respondent,nancy worthington,and craig castle as cotrustees 
liebler grandson,defendant and respondent dillon hasting,filed an opposition to the petition.hasting was a beneficiary of the liebler revocable declaration of trust dated february,the trust.in his opposition,hasting contended that the trust was not a valid trust because liebler had not properly transferred title to the only asset allegedly in the trust,the via regla property.specifically,hasting argued that liebler had not effectively transferred the via regla property into the trust because liebler had failed to execute a deed transferring the property to the trust.hasting also argued that liebler had not properly transferred the via regla property to the trust because liebler was not the legal owner of the property at the time of the purported transfer to the trust.in support of this contention,hasting noted that liebler held legal title to the via regla property as trustee of the trust,and the trust contained no language indicating that liebler was acting as the trustee of the trust at the time of the purported transfer to the trust.the trial court entered an order denying carne petition for the two reasons set out in hasting opposition.
on appeal,carne contends that the trial court erred in denying her petition.we conclude that the language in the trust quoted above is sufficient to convey the via regla property to the trust and that liebler was not required to execute a separate deed in order to effectuate such conveyance.we further conclude that,because at the time the trust was created,the trust was a revocable inter vivos trust,and liebler was the sole trustee who owned no interest in the via regla property as an individual,liebler signature on the trust was sufficient to to convey good title to the via regla property from the trust to the trust.galdjie darwish th,galdjie.accordingly,we reverse the order and remand for further proceedings 
factual and procedural backgrounda.the trust 
liebler executed the trust on february.the trust provides that liebler is the trustor and the trustee and states that,during his lifetime,the trust is revocable in whole or in part.the trust appoints donald ballman and dee ballman or their survivor as successor trustees.in may,john neim and christine neim transferred the via regla property to the trust by way of recorded deed.
liebler amended the trust in.among other changes,the amendment revised provisions of the trust related to the distribution of the trust estate upon liebler death by removing carne as a beneficiary and listing several of liebler grandchildren,including hasting,as beneficiaries.in addition,the amendment provided that,upon the death of liebler,the trustor last legal residence,which is part of the trust estate,shall be reserved for the use of worthington,under certain circumstances.
in,liebler amended the trust for a second and final time.among other changes,this amendment removed one of liebler grandchildren,mark curtis hasting,as a beneficiary.
b.the trust 
in,liebler executed the trust.as noted in part,ante,among other provisions,the trust expressly transfers the property listed in schedule a to the trust,and lists the via regla property in schedule a.the trust also provides that,upon liebler death,my trustee shall distribute the remaining trust property to my descendants,per stirpes outright,free of trust.the trust is signed by liebler as grantor and worthington and castle as cotrustees.in addition,the trust provides that if worthington and castle cease to serve as trustees,i name melanie carne to serve as successor trustee.
liebler death and the naming of successor trustees to the trust and the trust 
liebler died on october,
shortly after liebler death,dee ballman executed a document accepting the position of successor trustee to the trust.dee ballman then executed a document resigning as successor trustee to the trust and appointing worthington as successor trustee to the trust 
with respect to the trust,shortly after liebler death,castle executed a document refusing to serve as trustee to the trust.worthington resigned as trustee to the trust in april.shortly thereafter,carne executed a document indicating her acceptance of the position of successor trustee to the trust.
d.the second amended petition 
in september,carne filed a second amended petition to confirm the validity of the trust,carne status as successor trustee of the trust,and the assets of the trust.in the petition,carne described the trust and the trust as summarized above.
carne contended that liebler had intended to transfer legal ownership and title to the via regla property to the trustee of the trust and that he had only failed to execute a deed of transfer through ignorance,oversight or negligence.carne supported this contention by stating that,shortly after executing the trust,liebler moved to an assisted living facility where he remained until his death.in addition,carne contended that deposition testimony from both worthington and the attorney liebler hired to prepare the trust,richard stewart,supported a finding that liebler intended to transfer the via regla property into the trust in order to avoid medical liens being placed on the property after his death.
carne filed a brief in support of her petition in which she argued that liebler during his life,as trustee of the trust created the trust,included the via regla property as the sole asset on schedule a and therefore transferred possession of the via regla property to the trust 
e.the objections 
hasting filed an objection to the petition.in his objection,hasting contended that the trust was not a valid trust because there was never a transfer of property during the owner lifetime to another person as trustee.in support of this contention,hasting argued 
no deed whatsoever was signed by liebler which would have irrevocably transferred the via regla property to the third party trustees of his trust.without the deed,there is no trust created over the real property in question and the trust fails in its entirety because there is no other res in the trust.
hasting also argued that liebler had not effectively transferred the via regla property to the trust because liebler did not own the via regla property at the time the t rust was formed.hasting contended that the owner of the via regla property is the trustee of the t rust,and argued that liebler had no ability,as an individual,to transfer trust property he did not own from himself to third party trustees,as the language of the t rust purports to do.
hasting also maintained that liebler had not intended for carne to inherit the via regla property,and supported this contention with various factual allegations pertaining to the circumstances surrounding the execution of the trust hasting supported his objection with his own declaration as well as stewart deposition testimony and documents from stewart file related to the trust,among other documents.
worthington also filed an objection to the petition and joined in hasting objection along with her objection,worthington filed a declaration in which she described liebler relationship with carne in a manner that suggested that liebler had not intended for carne to gain ownership of the via regla property.
f.the trial court ruling 
after further briefing and a hearing,the trial court entered an order on january,denying carne petition on two grounds.first,the court ruled that liebler had not properly transferred any property into the trust.the court reasoned in part 
in the present case,the via regla property was not transferred to the trust by a deed,will,or inter vivos transfer.instead,liebler only created the t rust and attempted to transfer the property into the t rust by a unilateral declaration,which was ineffective because liebler was not the trustee.
second,the court ruled that liebler could not have transferred the via regla property to the trust because at the time of the execution of the trust,liebler did not own the via regla property as an individual,and there was no evidence that he had transferred the via regla property in his capacity as trustee of the trust.the court reasoned in part 
carne argues liebler transferred the via regla property to the trust by creating the trust,listing the via regla property as a trust asset and stating the property was transferred to the trust.citation.even if these actions constituted an inter vivos transfer of the property,liebler can not transfer property he does not own.citation.liebler did not personally own the via regla property.rather,he owned the property as the trustee of the t rust.there is no evidence liebler created the t rust as the trustee of the t rust or was acting as the trustee of the t rust when he attempted to transfer the property to the trust.
carne appeal 
carne timely appeals the trial court january order denying her petition.the order is appealable.see,subdivision k.
discussiona.the trial court erred in concluding that liebler was required to execute a separate deed in order to transfer the via regla property to the trust 
carne claims that the trial court erred in concluding that liebler was required to execute a separate deed in order to transfer the via regla property to the trust.carne claim raises a question of law,which we review de novo.see ukkestad rbs asset finance,th,applying de novo standard of review in determining whether certain real property had been properly transferred to a trust under undisputed facts.
governing law 
applicable statutory provisionsi.probate code provisions 
probate code section defines the methods by which a trust may be created and provides in relevant part 
subject to other provisions of this chapter,a trust may be created by any of the following methods 
b a transfer of property by the owner during the owner lifetime to another person as trustee.
where a trust contains real property,section,the applicable statute of frauds,requires a writing demonstrating that the real property is held in trust.section provides in relevant part,a trust in relation to real property is not valid unless evidenced by one of the following methods b by a written instrument conveying the trust property signed by the settlor 
ii.evidence code section 
according to the form of title presumption,the description in a deed as to how title is held is presumed to reflect the actual ownership interests in the property.in re marriage of brooks robinson th.evidence code section codifies this presumption and provides,the owner of the legal title to property is presumed to be the owner of the full beneficial title.this presumption may be rebutted only by clear and convincing proof.
b.the restatement third of trusts 
california trust law is essentially derived from the restatement second of trusts.over a number of years,the restatement second of trusts has been superseded by the restatement third of trusts.citation.as a result,we may look to the restatement third of trusts for guidance.lonely maiden productions,llc goldentree asset management,lp th.
comment b to section of the restatement third of trusts is entitled,intended inter vivos transfer to another as trustee effective or ineffective the comment discusses the circumstances under which property is effectively transferred from a trustor to a third party trustee by way of the trust agreement itself,without the execution of a separate deed 
good practice certainly calls for the use of additional formalities and the taking of appropriate further steps,such as changes of registration,or the execution and recordation of deeds to land.nevertheless,a writing signed by the settlor,or a trust agreement signed by the settlor and trustee,manifesting the settlor s present intention thereby to transfer specified property such as all property listed on an attached schedule is sufficient to create a trust.see illustration.ibid.
illustration of section of the restatement third of trusts provides an example of such a transfer.
the owner of certain property executes and signs a writing stating that he thereby transfers that property to t in trust for b for life,with remainder thereafter to b issue,and delivers the writing to t.in the absence of applicable statutory provisions requiring additional formalities,a trust is created.
application 
it is undisputed that record title to the via regla property is held by the trustee to the trust.thus,we must consider whether carne satisfied her burden to demonstrate by clear and convincing evidence that carne is the actual owner of the via regla property as trustee to the trust see,in re marriage of brooks robinson,supra,th at description in a deed as to how title is held is presumed to reflect the actual ownership interests in the property.
the trust is signed by liebler as grantor and worthington and castle as trustees.the trust states,i transfer to my trustee the property listed in schedule a,attached to this agreement.schedule a lists the via regla property by its legal address thus,the trust is a trust agreement signed by the settlor and trustee,manifesting the settlor present intention thereby to transfer specified property,and as such is sufficient to transfer the via regla property to the trust.rest d trusts,com.respondents do not cite,and our own research has not uncovered,any statutory provisions requiring additional formalities in order to convey real property in california 
while hasting asserts that because liebler did not sign a deed over to the third party trustees,there was no trust created in the via regla p roperty,he fails to identify any element of a deed that is missing in the trust,or any provision of california law requiring that a conveyance of real property occur only by way of a formal deed.see,an estate in real property can be transferred only by operation of law,or by an instrument in writing,subscribed by the party disposing of the same,or by his agent thereunto authorized by writing miller starr,supra,there is no required form of deed that must be used to effectuate a conveyance.we therefore conclude that the creation of the trust itself constituted a valid conveyance of the via regla property to the trust 
estate of heggstad th heggstad,which carne and hasting discuss at length in their briefing,is legally inapposite.heggstad noted that two methods for creating a trust are codified in probate code section a a declaration by the owner of property that the owner holds the property as trustee,and b a transfer of property by the owner during the owner lifetime to another person as trustee.id.at.relying on subdivision a of section,and related provisions of the restatement second of trusts and a treatise,the heggstad court concluded that a written declaration of trust by the owner of real property,in which he names himself trustee,is sufficient to create a trust in that property,and that the law does not require a separate deed transferring the property to the trust.heggstad,supra,at.the heggstad court rejected the respondent argument that in order to uphold the trust,we must view the trust document as a valid conveyance of the property to the trust.ibid.the heggstad court reasoned,this argument misses the point that a declaration of trust is sufficient to create a trust,without the need of a conveyance of title to the settlor as trustee.id.at.
in this case,section,subdivision a,upon which heggstad is based,has no applicability.liebler did not execute a declaration stating that he held the via regla property as trustee in the trust.thus,we reject carne argument that the facts of the heggstad ruling are directly applicable.however,because,for the reasons discussed above,we do view the trust document as a valid conveyance of the property to the trust heggstad,supra,th at,italics added,we conclude that there was a transfer of property that complied with section,subdivision b thus,heggstadis analogous only in that,as in this case,no separate deed was required in order for real property to become subject to a trust 
we are not persuaded by hasting arguments in support of his claim that the language in the trust failed to effectuate a conveyance hasting argues that recognizing the legality of the transfer in this case where no deed conveying the property exists,would sanction creditor fraud.formatting omitted.in that regard,hasting argues 
to allow the heggstad rule to be extended to an irrevocable trust with third parties as trustees would turn the concept of trust law on its head and otherwise create a method to defraud creditors.a main reason for establishing an irrevocable trust with separate third party trustees is creditor protection for the settlor.in order to gain creditor protection,one must irrevocably relinquish ownership of the asset by delivering ownership of the asset to the third party trustees.if all that is needed is an irrevocable trust with a declaration of intent to transfer without actual delivery,then a settlor can create an irrevocable trust document and pull the wool over creditors eyes by producing the irrevocable trust only as necessary,yet secretly maintain the ability to dispose of the property,encumber the property,or do whatever the settlor wants with the property while keeping creditors at bay,if there is no actual irrevocable transfer to a third party trustee.
to begin with,we are not extending the heggstad rule,and this case does not involve a declaration of intent to transfer.italics added.as discussed above,while heggstad involved a declaration of trust heggstad,supra,th at under section,subdivision a,this case involves a transfer of property under section,subdivision b.more fundamentally,we emphasize that this opinion says nothing about the validity of liebler transfer of the property to the trust vis.a vis.third parties.thus,nothing in this opinion will sanction creditor fraud,since we do not conclude that the transfer in this case was effective as to liebler creditors.we conclude only that liebler was not required to execute a separate deed in order for there to be a valid transfer between liebler as transferor and the trustees of the trust as transferees as the restatement third of trusts,section notes,formalities prescribed for the creation of a recordable document,or otherwise for protection of or from third parties,need not be satisfied in order to make a valid donative transfer,that is,one that is effective as between the transferor and the transferee s.heggstad,supra,at and fn stating that written declaration is sufficient to create a trust in property but warning,we hasten to note,however,that to be effective as to strangers,the declaration of trust must be recorded.
neither of the two cases from other jurisdictions on which hasting relies in his brief is contrary to the reasoning of this opinion.in dahlgren first nat.bank,the only issue before the nevada supreme court was whether a certain handwritten note constituted a holographic will such that the decedent property could pass pursuant to the provisions in the note.see id.at the sole issue confronting us is whether the trial court erred in finding the instrument to be a holographic will.in the course of its opinion,the dahlgren court did note that,during her lifetime,the decedent had entered into a trust agreement with a bank that provided that upon the death of trustor,her condominium together with a cash sum was to be distributed to mamie gilson.id.at.the dahlgren court also stated,t he record is clear,and the trial court so found,that at no time was the condominium ever deeded to respondent,and it therefore did not become a part of the trust estate.id.at.however,unlike in this case,there is nothing in dahlgren that suggests that the trust agreement at issue in that case contained a provision expressly transferring the real property from the trustor to the trustees thus,the nevada court dicta in dahlgren is not contrary to the reasoning in this opinion.
hasting reliance on tyson henry.tyson is unpersuasive for the same reason.in tyson,the trust agreement recited that five dollars had been provided to the trustee and further provided that other properties described therein may later be delivered to the trust.id.at.the tyson court concluded that a trust had not been created,for the following reasons 
t he instant instrument can not qualify as an inter vivos trust because the decedent never transferred his property interest to the designated trustee,taylor.citation.in his unverified answer,taylor admitted that he never received any cash or property from tyson.therefore,tyson never disposed of his property to the trustee,taylor.as a result,taylor was never given full legal title or equitable ownership of tyson real property.based on the aforementioned evidence,we are compelled to hold that an inter vivos trust was not created.id.at.
unlike in tyson in which the trust agreement provided that other properties may later be delivered to the trust tyson,supra.at,in this case,liebler expressly transferred the via regla property to the trustee in the trust.
finally,we acknowledge that in cate schweyen cate,cate the supreme court of montana concluded that the trust document at issue in that case was insufficient to serve as an instrument of conveyance even though,according to the cate court,the property was clearly identified in the handwritten trust document ibid.the court reasoned,w e concluded under the similar circumstances described in mccormick brevig mccormick that in order for a trust document to serve as an instrument of conveyance,the person executing the trust document must subsequently redeliver,confirm,ratify,or adopt the transfer.cate,supra,at.
in mccormick,an exhibit that contained a list of the trust assets was not attached to the document at the time the trust was executed.mccormick,supra,at.the mccormick court stated,because there was no proper description of the property within the document itself,or attached as exhibit a,the trust failed to convey the property at its execution,italics added.the mccormick court further concluded that even assuming that appellant could present evidence that the trustor had attached exhibit a to the trust agreement sometime after he executed the trust id.at,italics added,the attachment of such an exhibit could have validated the trust document as an instrument of conveyance of the real property only if the person executing the trust document were to have redelivered,confirmed,ratified,or adopted the transfer.id.at.
in this case,unlike in mccormick,it is undisputed that the trust contains a proper description of the property mccormick,supra,at,within an attached schedule a and that liebler expressly stated in the trust,i transfer to my trustee the property listed in schedule a,attached to this agreement.thus,there is no reason to consider whether liebler could have effectuated a conveyance and validated the trust document ibid,by attaching an exhibit to the trust after the trust execution listing the via regla property.however,to the extent cate may be read to stand for the proposition that,even where the conveyance is clearly stated in the trust document,the trustor must redeliver,confirm,ratify,or adopt the transfer cate,supra,mont at,we decline to follow such reasoning.we are aware of no california authority that would support such a proposition,and we decline to adopt a requirement that would,in effect,mandate that a trustor convey real property twice where the conveyance is in a trust document in order for it to constitute a valid transfer.
accordingly,we conclude that the trial court erred in determining that liebler was required to execute a separate deed in order to transfer the via regla property to the trust.
b.the trial court erred in concluding that
