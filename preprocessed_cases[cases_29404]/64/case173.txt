background 
danny was years old in when he attended the burning man festival in nevada he was asleep in his tent when a drunken driver drove through the tent and caused him permanent brain damage and orthopedic injury.the probate department of the santa clara county superior court probate court appointed his mother,jolaine allen,as his conservator in.jolaine filed a personal injury suit on danny behalf for the burning man accident.in,danny was again injured by a car this time in a accident and jolaine filed another personal injury suit on danny behalf.jolaine settled the burning man suit for in.within the conservatorship proceeding,the probate court established a special needs trust for danny and ordered the net settlement proceeds conveyed to the trust.the trust appointed jolaine as special trustee and trustee 
the trust provides as follows trustee shall be entitled to receive reasonable compensation for services in the administration of this trust.a special trustee and any successor trustee shall not be entitled to receive reasonable compensation for services in the administration of this trust.
jolaine settled the suit in for,and the probate court ordered the net settlement proceeds conveyed to the trust.
jolaine did not take any compensation for her services as trustee.she lived with danny and danny two sisters in a townhouse she had purchased for the trust with and a mortgage.she and the sisters paid part of the mortgage obligation,and danny paid part via his government disability income.
in,jolaine was overseeing approximately in cash deposited for the trust in a washington mutual bank account when the country financial crisis occurred.she became concerned about washington mutual stability.she therefore obtained a probate court order permitting her to withdraw the money and redeposit it in seven different banks so that each account would be below the threshold for fdic insurance.
in,a probate court investigator discovered that his office had never given danny trust a required biannual review.he telephoned jolaine to no avail.he went to the townhouse but no one ever answered the door.he reviewed the court order for withdrawal and redeposit of the money but could not determine the whereabouts of the money.the probate court therefore issued an order to show cause on its own motion directing jolaine to appear and show cause why she should not be removed as conservator.at the hearing on march,the probate court removed jolaine as conservator and trustee and appointed the public guardian as temporary conservator and temporary trustee.it appointed the public defender to represent conservatee danny,authorized the public defender to review the trust,and provided that the estate of the conservatee will bear the costs of representation.it set a status review hearing for the conservatorship matter and trust matter for may 
at the hearing on may,county counsel,the public guardian attorney,informed the probate court that jolaine had been unable to deposit all seven washington mutual cashier checks and possessed two for about each.he added that one check had been mistakenly deposited in danny name,which placed danny government benefits at risk.he opined i think she got a little overwhelmed.part of the reason is she does have an identification card.so the banks were unwilling to accept her status as the trustee of the trust.there there a house in the special needs trust as well,and so to sum everything up,the finances right now are a mess.we think this case is probably best suited for a private fiduciary given the amount of liquid assets,approximately plus a house.i would ask the court consider appointing a private fiduciary for the conservatorship and the trust.and then allen can have an opportunity to get her counsel to perhaps explain all the decisions that she made with respect to the special needs trust.
the public defender asked that the matter simply be continued without the public guardian office acting as the trustee.because my client may want to challenge the need for the trust the conservatorship and may also want to have a family member appointed as conservator,perhaps other than his mother.
jolaine agreed and detailed what we requesting today is a continuance.and i would like to danny reed has a desire and intention to present a petition to the court for the dissolution of the conservatorship as he no longer needs the conservatorship of his person or of his estate.i would like to meet with the public guardian and bring the paperwork,the financial paperwork i should have.i have acted in good faith.i have never done anything inappropriate with the funds or the assets in the trust.and we would like to have a continuance so i can meet with my lawyer or another special needs attorney before an action like this is taken.so i would ask that you postpone any request that the public guardian attorney is making right now for a fiduciary and let it be family member as when we able to find out if this is going to be dissolved,the conservatorship.danny should be able to choose somebody.and i can show where whatever monies have gone.i have never personally taken any monies out of his trust.so i think this is excessive.i do believe it needed at this time.but we requesting a continuance so we can get everything straightened out and i agreeable to having an accounting in days and showing where everything is.
county counsel objected the issue before the court is not whether the temporary trustee of the trust should be appointed.it whether it should be the public guardian over a private fiduciary,because the issue before the court is then allen can correct me if i wrong she placed in the name of daniel reed in his own name which resulted under the special needs rules as income and so now his ssi is at risk.she acted in good faith but the problem is she did have an identification so banks were willing to work with her as they would a regular private fiduciary with an identification.i do think we can wait for a temporary trustee to be appointed when reed ssi benefits are at serious risk.
jolaine added your honor,i have a paper which we drafted and i understand as trustee of the special needs trust states that i would have the powers of choosing a successor trustee.and i had wanted to choose my daughter,my year old daughter,tristan,to be a,successor trustee,in that she has picture id,and she could go to the bank and they would accept her picture id and allow the paperwork to proceed.i have the paperwork,but i have submitted it to the court yet.she would assist me in handling the basic paperwork with the bank.
the probate court stated that i do have anything like that before me.it then extended the public guardian temporary conservatorship until july,and ordered jolaine to produce an accounting at that time.it indicated that i also going to appoint a temporary fiduciary with regard to the trust subject to further review on july.at this point,a probate court investigator initiated the following colloquy.
probate court investigator your honor,one more on the fiduciary.somebody from the court panel for private fiduciary.i do know if we have a panel 
supervising court investigator we have a binder.
the court from the binder.
supervising court investigator is the court making a selection or is the public guardian making the selection 
the court any suggestions 
county counsel well,usually we defer to the attorney for the conservatee or the court investigator.normally we want to avoid selecting a particular.
the court i did know whether anything was discussed.
county counsel so we would defer to the court investigator.
supervising court investigator okay.
the probate court then adjourned the may,hearing.
on may,the probate court appointed plaintiff as temporary trustee in an ex parte proceeding.the order reads in its entirety the court on its own motion appoints thomas thorpe of dragomir fiduciary services,as temporary trustee of the danny reed trust.
at the hearing on july,the parties agreed that the trust money was not missing and a formal accounting was unnecessary.the public defender then offered the following with respect to the conservatorship in general,however,danny is very concerned about the cost that would be incurred in having the public guardian office act as his conservator and he does want the conservatorship terminated.he feels he able to take care of his own affairs.i have calendared a petition for september to terminate the conservatorship and at that time,i think we also going to be asking that a family member be appointed to control the special needs trust as well because he concerned about accruing expenses having a private fiduciary in charge.
on july,plaintiff,via his probate attorney,diane brown,filed a petition to appoint himself permanent trustee and remove jolaine as trustee.in the petition,he sought modification of the trust because there are several conflicting provisions that make it difficult to administer,any successor trustee is not entitled to compensation,and drafting errors may cause unanticipated outcomes.as to the compensation issue,he detailed the trust provides under article viii that the trustee is entitled to receive reasonable compensation.this provision refers to jolaine allen.and the next sentence is a special trustee and any successor trustee shall not be entitled to receive reasonable compensation for services in the administration of this trust.emphasis added.he requested that the last sentence of article viii be stricken.he attached his fee schedule to the petition as well as a complete amendment and restatement of the trust.he obtained a hearing for august.
on july,plaintiff wrote the following to brown about the july hearing danny made it pretty clear yesterday that he does not want a professional fiduciary around,and that they want a family member as trustee.because the fee issue is so consuming to the family,they will be pushing to replace me with that family member rather than sit back and just allow me to be appointed permanently.
on july,the probate court appointed the public defender to represent danny in the trust proceeding.
on july,plaintiff filed an ex parte petition to release the trust money to him for the payment of on going sic expenses of the trust and the beneficiary.at a hearing on july,the public defender asked for a continuance because danny had not been notified of the hearing and objected to plaintiff withdrawing any money.brown indicated that plaintiff needs to go in and inspect the house to see the electrical problems indicated he needs at least enough money to pay inspectors to go into that house to see if it even got adequate plumbing,if it got adequate lighting.and he needs to be able to insure this house to protect it.the probate court continued the matter until august.
at the hearing on august,the public defender again objected to plaintiff request and,your honor,we opposed to any actions being taken on behalf of reed at this time and we ask that it be deferred until the september hearing wherein we have filed a petition to terminate the conservatorship.i will also shortly be filing a petition to have his special needs trust turned over to family members to become the trustees of that trust.and we do not want to have any fees generated.we do not want to have anything that would be financially detrimental to the trust or his assets done in between now and then.we ask for the court to order they cease and desist in any actions that they intend to engage in.he has insurance on his property that is current.he is keeping the house payments current.and so there is no impending danger of his assets being placed in jeopardy.also,he very fearful that his assets will be squandered by way of needless generation of fees by these fiduciaries that have been appointed,whereas he has family members who are sophisticated in financial matters.they been employed in the banking industry in the past,namely two sisters,who could take over for him with respect to the administration of the special needs trust.
plaintiff probate attorney sheri sudweeks appearing for brown argued that the instant hearing was not the proper proceeding of this petition today to decide who should be the trustee.she urged that plaintiff needed the tools he needs to carry out his duties.she claimed that the bank accounts were earning below two percent,which was against the interests of the trust,and informed that plaintiff had not yet entered the home for an inspection of deferred maintenance.the probate court commented that plaintiff had been placed in charge but has no assets to do anything.when it declined a continuance,danny offered the following your honor,in i was victimized by a drunk driver.now,in,i feel as though i being victimized again by thomas thorpe and his unnecessary practices,predatory practices.he taking advantage of me while i say predatory because he taking advantage of me while i ca legally defend myself.in may,thomas thorpe was forced upon me,against my will,as temporary i emphasize at the time as temporary trustee.i did not i did not need nor want his services then.i do not need nor want his services now.i would move to have thomas thorpe removed immediately as temporary trustee and replaced by a member of my family.judge cain,please protect me and my please protect my assets.i hope you will restore my full rights in my upcoming capacity hearing.
the probate court granted plaintiff petition to release the trust funds.
on august,danny filed an objection to plaintiff petition for appointment as permanent trustee.he also filed a petition to remove plaintiff as temporary trustee and appoint audelith as permanent trustee,which the probate court set for hearing on october.at the august hearing on plaintiff petition,the public defender asked to continue the matter until october.and he reiterated reed does not want someone outside his family to be the trustee of his trust.he does not want to incur the increased expenses that that would result in.brown disagreed your honor,it seems reasonable to me to grant the petition in its entirety,appoint thorpe as trustee,have the hearing on october and let the parties each present why thorpe should be or why the proposed person should be trustee.the probate court remarked that the issue was not jolaine removal but who would replace her and with regard to the concern about the fees and everything else,if genevieve sic becomes the successor on october,the fees issue will be of limited duration.it indicated that i going to go ahead and grant the petition to appoint plaintiff as permanent trustee as requested.
on september,the probate court terminated danny conservatorship.it also held a hearing on the trust matter during which brown asked the probate court to sign a formal order concerning the indicated order of august.the public defender objected because he had filed a motion to reconsider that order.he explained the following i have subsequently had the opportunity to look into the specifics of the requirements of a special needs trust,which plaintiff probate attorney pleading was rather ambiguously premised on the fact that the original trust was somehow defective in accomplishing the needs of a special needs trust,and it had,quote,conflicting language which would defeat the administration of the trust.my subsequent examination of the document and the special needs trust requirements indicate that just is a fallacy,it untrue,and so i filed a motion for reconsideration,which i filed this afternoon,scheduled for october,pointing out why brown assertion of this trust needed to be redrafted are incorrect,essentially needless.so i asking that the court reconsider its ruling in that regard,and i filed tho
