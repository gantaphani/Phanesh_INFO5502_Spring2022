edwin davies provided for the distribution of the bulk of his estate in equal shares to three of his stepchildren and his nephew douglas davies,with douglas right to inherit conditioned on his survival for at least days after edwin death.it appears that edwin died at five minutes past midnight on the day before douglas died,although it is possible edwin may have died five or ten minutes earlier.this sad sequence of events is relevant because edwin testamentary documents also included clauses,which caused douglas widow to file a safe harbor petition in which she sought a determination that her claim that douglas in fact survived his uncle by days,thus satisfying the survivorship condition is not a contest.the probate court allowed the widow to proceed on this ground,as well as on other grounds discussed below.edwin stepchildren appeal,challenging the probate court order in its entirety.we agree that douglas widow can proceed,but only to the extent she may be able to establish that douglas satisfied the survivorship requirement.
edwin davies lived from to.he was married to patricia cameron davies and was stepfather to her three children,judith ann pickett,jennifer bitran,and timothy cameron.at some point,the first davies either died or there was a divorce,and edwin married elizabeth davies and became stepfather to her sons,michael mackenzie and thomas mackenzie.edwin had no children of his own from either marriage,but he had a nephew,douglas davies,who was married to patricia davies.douglas died or days after edwin died depending on the ultimate outcome of this case.
in january,edwin created the edwin davies trust in which he provided that if elizabeth survived him,she would receive their residence and percent of the remaining assets,with the balance distributed percent to judith,percent to douglas,percent to jennifer,and percent to edwin housekeeper,bessie jordan with nothing for timothy.if elizabeth failed to survive edwin by days,the entire estate was to be distributed percent to judith,percent to douglas,percent to jennifer,and percent to bessie jordan.if any beneficiary failed to survive for a period of days beyond edwin death,that gift lapsed.
edwin restated his trust in,at which time he provided for the division of his estate into two shares if elizabeth survived him,the marital deduction share to be held in trust and the nonmarital share to be distributed percent each to judith,jennifer,timothy,and douglas,percent to bessie jordan,and percent to thomas mackenzie one of edwin stepsons by elizabeth.this time,the trust provided that in the event an individual failed to survive edwin by days,that gift would be distributed to his or her issue.the restated trust included a clause.
beginning in march,edwin then became the subject of a series of temporary conservatorships,the last of which expired on july.on august,edwin became the subject of a permanent conservator of his estate then valued at about million and person that lasted until his death in july at the age of.two trust amendments were executed during this time.
on july,while the subject of a temporary conservatorship,edwin executed the first amendment to his restated trust.among other things,the first amendment provided that if,prior to his death,edwin had filed a petition for the dissolution of his marriage or for a legal separation,all bequests to elizabeth would lapse.in addition,edwin deleted the gift to thomas mackenzie,divided that portion of his estate equally among judith,jennifer,timothy,and douglas,and amended the survivorship clause by providing that in the event douglas predeceased edwin,douglas share would be divided equally among judith,jennifer,and timothy edwin designated wells fargo bank as trustee instead of elizabeth,as provided in the restated trust.the first amendment included a clause.
on august,after the temporary conservatorship expired and before the permanent conservator was appointed,edwin executed a second amendment to his restated trust.in a preamble,he wrote i set forth my reasons because i anticipate a challenge to the amendment.i have been involved in a legal dispute with my second wife elizabeth davies since january.the dispute arose when my wife placed me in brittany house,a locked alzheimer unit,and would not allow me to return to my home.she believes she is acting in my best interest i believe she is not.i do not believe my wife is making health care decisions that are in my best interest.i do not trust the doctors she has selected for me.in addition,my wife took control of my trust property,and refused to return control of my stock and cash to me.at the recommendation of my attorney and because i did not trust my wife judgment,i appointed sherrie ellman of ellman and gladstone to be my conservator and decided that wells fargo bank should serve as my successor trustee in place of my wife.my wife refuses to honor my request to turn my property over to wells fargo bank and to honor my nomination of sherrie ellman to serve as my conservator 
edwin also stated that he had been evaluated for legal capacity by three doctors,each of whom opined that he had the capacity to decide who should manage his money and assist him in making medical care decisions that he had decided to dissolve his marriage for several reasons,including the fact that he no longer trusted her that elizabeth had substantial wealth of her own and he thus felt no need or desire to give her or her children any part of his property.he went on i intend that my entire trust estate pass to my family who are my nephew douglas davies and my,judith pickett,jennifer bitran and timothy cameron.i have also made a bequest to bessie jordan and have instructed my attorney to file for dissolution of marriage 
sherrie ellman and meryl gladstone were appointed temporary conservators at my request.letters of temporary conservatorship expired on july.i am under no legal disability and my doctors confirm that i have the capacity to understand the nature of this action i am taking.i am executing this second amendment as trustor of the trust.my eyesight is poor so my attorney has read the trust amendments to me.
the second amendment changes the trust by deleting all bequests to elizabeth so that no part of edwin estate passed to her distributing his estate percent each to judith,jennifer,timothy,and douglas,and percent to bessie jordan and expressly providing that,in the event douglas predeceased edwin or died within days of edwin death,then his share was to be divided equally among judith,jennifer,and timothy this provision is the source of the present dispute.the second amendment added this provision 
the trustee is authorized to take any actions necessary to effectuate the trust amendments and any action or proceeding taken by a beneficiary named in the davies trust or elizabeth davies,or any of her children or grandchildren,to challenge any amendment herein,to assert a community property interest in the trust estate,or to contest the capacity of trustor to amend the trust,whether directly or indirectly,individually or in conjunction with any other beneficiary or any other person,shall constitute a contest and shall be deemed a revocation of any bequest to that beneficiary and such individual shall be treated as if they had predeceased trustor for all respects 
edwin filed for divorce in august.
in october,edwin and his conservators filed a petition to confirm the first and second amendments to edwin trust,alleging that edwin,then,was in poor health,under tremendous stress as a result of the pending divorce proceedings,and that confirmation of the amendments was necessary so as not to frustrate his testamentary intent.his conservators alleged that they had consulted edwin doctors and were confident that edwin fully understood the amendments at the time they were executed,and that he had the legal capacity to execute the amendments.the petition lists the changed bequests but does not mention the added provision that douglas had to survive his uncle death by days.edwin and his conservator asked the court to find that both the first and second amendments were valid notice was given to the beneficiaries,
