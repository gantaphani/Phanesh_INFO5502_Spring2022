background 
a.the f trust 
the admission act granted to the state of hawaii title to most of the federal government public land within the state.id.b e,stat.at.section f of the admission act requires the state to hold much of that land and profits from it in public trust the f trust for five enumerated purposes.id.f,stat.at.one such purpose is for the betterment of the conditions of native hawaiians,as defined in the hawaiian homes commission act.id.the other public schools,development of farm and home ownership,public improvements and the provision of land for public not limited to native hawaiians.id.after setting forth these purposes,f further specifies that the trust shall be managed and disposed of for one or more of the foregoing purposes in such manner as the constitution and laws of said state may provide,and their use for any other object shall constitute a breach of trust.id.hawaii has provided that a portion of the f trust proceeds shall be administered by oha.
oha portion of the f trust 
oha is a hawaii state agency that administers a portion of the f trust proceeds as well as some other funds.see generally.ch.in particular,state law entitles oha to receive t wenty per cent of all funds derived from the f trust,and requires this portion of the f trust proceeds to be held and used by oha solely as a public trust for the betterment of the conditions of native hawaiians.id.state law thus appears to limit oha uses of f trust proceeds to only one of the five purposes enumerated in the federal statute.see day apoliona,cir day i oha receives a portion of the f trust monies,which it is to devote to the betterment of the conditions of n ative hawaiians.quoting.
c.the challenged expenditures 
plaintiffs challenge four projects on which the oha trustees have spent parts of its share of the f trust proceeds.
the akaka bill.oha used f trust money to lobby for and support the proposed native hawaiian government reorganization act of,commonly referred to as the akaka bill after senator daniel akaka of hawaii,one of its chief proponents.the akaka bill would create a process through which the united states could recognize a governing entity for hawaii indigenous people.see native hawaiian government reorganization act of,cong.the governing entity would have the power to establish its own criteria for citizenship.id.c b iii i aa.initially,however,it would be governed by an interim governing council,id.c a,to be elected by adult members of the native hawaiian community who elect to participate in the reorganization of the native hawaiian governing entity and are certified to be native hawaiian,id.c a.for the purposes of the akaka bill,the term native hawaiian includes essentially any direct descendant of the indigenous people of hawaii.id.this definition is broader than the class of native hawaiians like plaintiffs comprised only of individuals with not less than part indigenous hawaiian lineage.see hhca a.
the akaka bill would expressly empower both the united states government and the state of hawaii to negotiate and enter agreements with the native hawaiian governing entity regarding the transfer of lands,natural resources,and other assets,and the protection of existing rights related to such lands or resources and the exercise of governmental authority over any transferred lands,natural resources,and other assets,including land use.akaka bill b a b.
native hawaiian legal corporation nhlc.nhlc identifies itself as a corporation that specializes in hawaiian land and hawaiian rights issues.oha used f trust money to fund a contract with nhlc,under which nhlc agrees to render a range of legal services including a ssertion and defense of quiet title actions,protection of water rights,p reservation of native hawaiian land trust entitlements and preservation of traditional practices and culturally significant places.the contract does not restrict nhlc to providing legal services to native hawaiians.its recitals explain that oha has established a program whereby all hawaiians can receive certain legal services and that the program is intended to better the conditions of all hawaiians.in addition,the contract defines hawaiian to include not only native hawaiians under the hhca like plaintiffs but also any descendant of the aboriginal peoples inhabiting the hawaiian islands in,without regard to proportional ancestry.
na pua education program na pua.na pua identifies itself as a hawaiian education resource center within the university of hawaii that provides educational enrichment program activities to hawaiian children and their families.oha used f trust money to fund a contract with na pua.na pua does not appear to restrict the services it provides under the contract to native hawaiians either generally or under the oha contract.
alu like.alu like is a nonprofit service organization that strives to help hawaiians achieve social and economic by providing early childhood education,services to the elderly,employment preparation and training,library and genealogy services,specialized services for youth and information and referral services.oha used f trust money to fund a contract with alu like.alu like does not appear to restrict its services to native hawaiians either generally or under the oha contract.
procedural history 
plaintiffs originally challenged these four oha expenditures as a violation of admission act f,enforceable under the equal protection clause of the fourteenth amendment and a state law duty of fidelity,see.c.see day i,at.the district court dismissed the complaint.id.plaintiffs did not contest the dismissal of the equal protection claims or the discretionary dismissal of the state law claims,but appealed the court ruling that they failed to allege any admission act f violation enforceable under.see id.on appeal we reversed and remanded,holding that each native hawaiian plaintiff,as a beneficiary of the trust created by f,has an individual right to have the trust terms complied with,and therefore can sue under for violation of that right.id.at.we left it to the district court to determine in the first instance not only whether plaintiffs allegations are true,but also whether the described expenditures in fact violate f.id.
on remand,the district court entered summary judgment in defendants favor on the claim.it held that each of the challenged expenditures was consistent with at least one of the five trust purposes enumerated in f.the district court implicitly concluded that the oha trustees may,as a matter of federal law,spend f money for any of the five enumerated purposes,rejecting plaintiffs argument that federal law requires the oha trustees to spend the portion of the f trust they administer only for one particular f purpose,namely the betterment of the conditions of native hawaiians.the district court further found that the oha trustees were simultaneously and redundantly entitled to qualified immunity because plaintiffs failed to establish any violation of federal law,let alone a clearly established one.
the state of hawaii participated as amicus curiae in the district court proceedings from an early stage and successfully moved for intervenor status during the first appeal.hawaii filed an answering brief in this appeal proposing an alternative basis for affirming summary judgment

iii.discussion 
plaintiffs allege that the oha trustees have violated plaintiffs federal rights under f and by spending trust proceeds for impermissible purposes.in particular,plaintiffs contend they have a federal right,enforceable under,to require that the trust funds be managed in such manner as the laws of hawaii may provide,that the laws of hawaii require the oha trustees to spend the portion of the f funds they manage only for the betterment of the conditions of native hawaiians and not for any of the other purposes enumerated in f and that the oha trustees have violated that requirement by spending f funds on the four challenged expenditures.in the alternative,plaintiffs argue that,even if there is no violation of federal law so long as oha trustees spend f trust proceeds for any of the five purposes enumerated in f,these expenditures still demonstrate a breach of trust under federal law.neither argument has merit.
federal law does not oblige the oha trustees to use trust proceeds only for native hawaiians 
the district court implicitly rejected plaintiffs first the oha trustees,as a matter of federal law,must spend the portion of the f trust they manage only for the betterment of the conditions of native hawaiians.we agree with the district court.alleged violations of state laws regarding the management and disposition of f funds are not necessarily breaches,under federal law,of the f trust itself.
plaintiffs contrary argument is based on the following text in the statute 
the f trust shall be held by hawaii as a public trust for the support of the public schools and other public educational institutions,for the betterment of the conditions of native hawaiians,for the development of farm and home ownership on as widespread a basis as possible,for the making of public improvements,and for the provision of lands for public use.such lands,proceeds,and income shall be managed and disposed of for one or more of the foregoing purposes in such manner as the constitution and laws of said state may provide,and their use for any other object shall constitute a breach of trust 
admission act f the admission act ceded certain property owned by the united states in the former territory of hawaii to the new state of hawaii to be held in public trust.see admission act b e.the natural and logical reading of the quoted passage is that congress,in transferring valuable assets from the united states to hawaii,wanted to assure that those assets would be used for public benefits as spelled out in the five enumerated purposes.use for any other purpose would be a breach of trust,a violation of federal dimension.so long as trust funds are used for one or more of the enumerated purposes,however,congress intended to leave the manner in which the trust is managed in hawaii sovereign control.
plaintiffs read the statute not simply as permitting hawaii to decide,through state law,the manner in which the trust shall be managed,but investing any such discretionary,rules or restrictions with the status of federal law.according to plaintiffs,to the extent hawaii law restricts the oha trustees spending authority over their portion of f trust funds to uses benefitting only native hawaiians,failure to comply with those restrictions violates not just state law but also f itself.this construction of the statute does not withstand analysis.
first,the only breach of trust f refers to is use of funds for any other object,referring to the enumerated spending purposes.id.emphasis added.it does not encompass any other restrictions under state law.second,we find it implausible that congress gave hawaii discretion to choose how to manage the trust yet provided for federal intervention to enforce those choices,whatever they might be.
our reading is consistent with several of our cases assuming or suggesting that,as a matter of federal law,the only restriction that the statute places on f trustees,including the oha trustees with respect to the portion of the f trust they administer,is that they use trust funds for enumerated purposes.in price akaka,cir akaka i,we assumed that f did not require compliance with state law restrictions on the oha trustees when we explained that t he fact that the oha trustees may,consistently with f,spend the income for purposes other than to benefit native hawaiians does not deprive native hawaiian beneficiaries of standing to sue under for enforcement of the trust conditions.similarly in price akaka,cir akaka ii,we treated the question w hether the trustees breached their fiduciary duties under chapter of the hawaii revised statutes as a matter of state law which we do not reach.and when we considered this case in a previous appeal we noted that neither our prior case law nor our discussion today suggests that as a matter of federal law f funds must be used by oha trustees for the benefit of n ative hawaiians or hawaiians,at the expense of other beneficiaries.day i,at emphasis added.
accordingly,we affirm the district court dismissal of plaintiffs claims to the extent they contend that the oha trustees violated federal law by spending for enumerated purposes other than for the betterment of the conditions of native hawaiians.so long as oha trustees spend f funds on any of the five enumerated purposes,they have not breached their federal trust obligations.
b.the oha trustees had discretion to contribute f trust funds to the challenged projects 
plaintiffs contend in the alternative that,even if oha trustees may spend for any of the f trust purposes,they breached the trust under federal law because each of the challenged projects was not restricted to one or more of the enumerated purposes.this argument is unpersuasive.although the trustees are obliged to spend only for trust purposes,they have broad discretion to decide how to serve those purposes.the district court properly found that each of the challenged expenditures is sufficiently directed to one or more trust purposes to fall within the range of permissible spending.
legal standard 
we begin with the text of the statute.section f of the admission act establishes a public trust and the purposes for which it may be used and then provides an express and narrow enforcement mechanism,specifying that use for any other object shall constitute a breach of trust.admission act f.to establish a breach of trust under that section,therefore,plaintiffs must prove that trust funds were used for a purpose not enumerated in f 
the parties dispute what showing is necessary to establish that an expenditure is a use for any other nontrust object.id.to resolve this dispute,we look to the common law of trusts.see day i,at akaka i,at price hawaii,cir.
generally,a trustee power is discretionary except to the extent its exercise is directed by the terms of the trust or compelled by the trustee fiduciary duties.restatement third of trusts cmt.because f establishes broad purposes and does not direct specific expenditures,f trustees ha ve discretion,are to use fiduciary judgment to determine whether a particular use of trust funds serves one or more of the trust purposes.id.plaintiffs themselves have conceded that the trustees have broad discretion in determining what qualifies as use for a trust purpose.
when a trustee has discretion with respect to the exercise of a power,its exercise is subject to supervision by a court only to prevent abuse of discretion.id.in the context of the narrow federal inquiry into whether an expenditure is a use for a trust purpose,an abuse of discretion occurs when a trustee has acted is,beyond the bounds of a reasonable judgment.id.cmt.c.we therefore examine the challenged expenditures to determine whether any of them is beyond the bounds of a trustee reasonable judgment that the project in question would serve f trust purposes.
plaintiffs urge that an expenditure is outside the bounds of a reasonable judgment unless it is in the sole interest of beneficiaries provided that such expenditures may provide a collateral benefit to,but only so long as the primary benefits are enjoyed by beneficiaries,and the collateral benefits do not detract from nor reduce the benefits
