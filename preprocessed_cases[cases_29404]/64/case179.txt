in,chandler flickinger became the executor of the estate of roger preston kampen and the estate of james lawrence ellington.two bonds were issued and filed with the court by the great american insurance company the bonding company.both kampen and ellington left the assets in their estates to the san francisco opera association the opera association as the contingent beneficiary.in,the opera association knew it was the sole beneficiary of both estates.
in,flickinger obtained a final order for distribution in the ellington estate.flickinger did not take any further action for many years.in january,the opera association filed separate petitions with regard to both estates to,among other things,surcharge flickinger.
the probate court conducted a trial on the petitions in both estates.at the end of the trial,the court found that flickinger breached his fiduciary duty.the court surcharged flickinger for the loss of value to the estates caused by his unreasonable delay and also surcharged him the compensation he had received in related to the ellington estate.the court,however,found that flickinger had not used the funds or mingled them with his own funds and it,therefore,rejected many of the opera association claims for damages and found that flickinger affirmative defense of laches barred any claims for damages not based on a statute.evidence at trial established that bank accounts had previously been included in the ellington estate that were actually part of the kampen estate.the court amended the earlier final distribution order in the ellington estate to reflect this reduction in the total cash.
the opera association appeals from three orders and claims that it was entitled to interest on the assets in both of the estates for the period of time that flickinger failed to distribute the assets.the opera association also objects to the lower court refusal to use alternative measurements of damages that the opera association proposed.additionally,it challenges the lower court application of flickinger defense of laches.finally,the opera association asserts that the lower court did not have the authority to amend the original order of distribution in ellington estate.we are not persuaded by the opera association arguments,and affirm the lower court orders.
background 
on may,both kampen and ellington separately executed wills with similar provisions.flickinger drafted both wills.both wills had provisions that left the estate to the other if the other survived the testator by at least days.both men left their entire estate to the opera association if the other man did not survive the testator by days.each man designated the other as executor and nominated flickinger as the alternate executor.
sixteen days after executing his will,on may,kampen died.less than days later,on june,ellington died.flickinger,represented by his then law partner,hollis elliott,filed petitions for probate for the kampen and ellington estates in june and july,respectively flickinger became the executor for both.the wills were admitted into probate and flickinger was appointed executor of the estates.two bonds were issued and filed with the court by the bonding company.notices of both petitions were mailed to the opera association.
on june,caroline mason the associate director of planned gifts for the opera association,wrote a memorandum stating that flickinger indicated that the opera association could expect between and combined from the kampen and ellington estates.the memorandum stated that flickinger opined that the opera association would receive all the money within one year.mason wrote that t hese bequests combined would be ideal for a production for.
on december,flickinger filed an inventory and appraisement reflecting that kampen estate had.on january,he filed an inventory and appraisement indicating that ellington estate had.
on may,allison groves,the successor to mason,wrote an email to another employee of the opera association regarding the ellington and kampen estates she stated she had contacted flickinger and he indicated that he had one sizable problem with each estate and as a result ha d no idea when everything would be settled.
on december,flickinger filed a first and final account and report for ellington estate and a petition for its settlement.a copy of the notice of the hearing on the petition was mailed to the opera association on december.
on january,the probate court issued an order for judgment settling first and final account and report of executor allowing compensation for ordinary services and for final distribution the order the order authorized flickinger to pay elliott,his attorney.it authorized flickinger to pay himself as statutory compensation for services rendered in administering the estate and as the percent of gross sales price of items sold by him in the estate as instructed in decedent will.it further provided the estate in the possession of the administrator remaining for distribution shall be distributed to the beneficiary of the estate as follows the residue of cash in the estate accounts to the san francisco opera association,being cash of approximately total.the court identified this money as being in accounts in washington mutual bank,in individual retirement accounts iras with great western bank,and in certificate of deposit cd accounts in california federal bank and bay view federal bank.
on february,flickinger paid elliott his statutory fees and paid himself his statutory fees and commissions in the amounts set forth in the order.in,flickinger cashed out two of ellington cd accounts and deposited the proceeds into checking accounts belonging to ellington estate.
between the order and his retirement in,when he moved to san diego,flickinger did not contact the opera association regarding either ellington or kampen estate.the opera association believed one of its employees or agents contacted the attorney for flickinger in to inquire about ellington estate.it also believed that it received a copy of the order in.
in,as part of a periodic review of open estate files,stacy cullison,the senior director of planned giving at the opera association,and another person at the opera association,identified the ellington file.at first cullison supposed that the opera association had received the bequest but the sum had not been entered into the electronic database or the receipt had not been sent to development.in august,the opera association hired sam leask,a planned giving manager.in,the opera association investigated whether it had received the funds from flickinger and determined that it had not received the money.the opera association then retained counsel.
counsel for the opera association located flickinger and contacted him in late october.on january,flickinger sent a check to the opera association from the ellington estate for the amount of.he stated in the letter that this amount was at least a start and that he would be away for the rest of the month but would contact counsel for the opera association when he returned.
the petitions filed by the opera association and the accounts filed by flickinger 
on january,the opera association filed two petitions in the superior court regarding the ellington estate and the kampen estate.the opera association served the bonding company with both petitions.
with regard to the ellington estate,the opera association asserted that flickinger failed to comply with the order and had provided no explanation for his delay.in its prayer,the opera association requested that the court order flickinger to distribute the remaining assets of the estate as set forth in the order,order flickinger to provide an accounting,order a surcharge of flickinger for the full value of all undistributed assets of the estate plus interest from the date of the order through the date of distribution of all assets,order flickinger to reimburse the estate for all compensation previously received from the estate plus interest on those sums,and order exemplary damages against flickinger under probate code section.
similarly,in the opera association petition related to the estate of kampen,the opera association sought an accounting and to surcharge flickinger for his delay in administering the estate.the opera association requested exemplary damages against flickinger under probate code section.the opera association also sought flickinger removal.
on march,the court held a hearing on both petitions.counsel appeared for the opera association and the attorney for great american insurance company appeared.flickinger appeared in propria persona.with regard to ellington estate,flickinger acknowledged that he still owed about and explained the rest of it is in two iras,and we trying to locate those accounts now they may have escheated to the state.that what happens because it was inactive for so long.but they would make up the balance of the money due 
the court asked flickinger the reason for the delay from until january.flickinger replied well,at the time,i do i am forgetting exactly when i retired from the practice,and this is the one case i guess that was not closed up.and i moved down to san diego county.and then i had all sorts of personal problems,health wise,and so forth,and i just did attend to it.and when i got the lawsuit,of course,it brought everything to my attention again.i mean,i knew i had to do it.but i just kept doing other things instead.so i do know how long it going to take me to get the money out of the state,if it has escheated to the state.but that what happened.i just had many other things on my plate at the time and they seemed to take priority.
on april,the court filed its order and instructed flickinger to file a supplemental account of his acts from september.it also ordered him to file a status report on the iras in ellington estate.with regard to kampen estate,the court ordered an accounting.
on april,flickinger filed a supplemental account in ellington estate.he filed a status report regarding the iras on may.he reported that had had incorrectly inventoried the iras as part of the ellington estate.he stated that these accounts were actually part of kampen estate.he submitted an amended accounting.
flickinger filed a supplemental account in the kampen estate on july.this accounting added the iras.
in october,flickinger retained counsel.subsequently,he filed amended accounts.pursuant to a stipulation by the parties,the court ordered a preliminary distribution of from kampen estate to the opera association.
the trial on the petitions to surcharge 
the opera association filed its trial brief on may.the opera association maintained that it was entitled to a surcharge against flickinger because of his delay in complying with his fiduciary responsibilities.with regard to ellington,the opera association urged the court to award it the rate of interest of percent under code of civil procedure section,subdivision a,on the unsatisfied portion of the judgment.the opera association asserted that this statute applied under probate code section.the opera association maintained that the court should impose a surcharge at a rate of percent per year on the amounts undistributed from the kampen estate under probate code section,subdivision a,or civil code section,subdivision a.additionally,the opera association requested two alternative measurement of damages based on amounts it claimed it lost by not being able to invest the money in a timely fashion or based on the costs it incurred because it had to borrow funds.
the probate court held an evidentiary hearing on the opera association surcharge petitions in both the kampen and ellington estates.flickinger testified that he did not distribute the money because he could not balance the accounting in the ellington estate and was preoccupied with medical issues.the judgment of distribution ordered him to distribute approximately in the ellington estate,and flickinger testified that he did not do this because the checking account contained about less than that amount.since he could not balance the account,he did not give the opera association the money.
the court orders 
on july,the court filed separate findings and orders in the estates of ellington and kampen.with regard to the petition for surcharge in the estate of ellington,the court noted that flickinger had a duty to distribute promptly the money due to the opera association under the order.the court found that the statutes cited by the opera association in support of its claim of percent interest on a money judgment did not apply because a judgment or order of final distribution by a court sitting in probate jurisdiction is not a money judgment.instead,it is an order that distributes a decedent estate.thus,it concluded that the opera association was not entitled to interest.
the court stated that although an order for final distribution was not a money judgment,the opera association had the right to bring an action against flickinger for failing to distribute the estate.the court also considered flickinger affirmative defense of laches and found the evidence showed that the opera association knew ellington estate had not been distributed,but failed to take any formal action until january.the court explained that the opera association could have brought an action against flickinger at any time before january,but failed to do so and slept on its rights despite having knowledge of the amount owing.the court ruled that laches barred the opera association request to recover interest at the legal rate from the date of distribution.
the court also rejected the opera association two alternative calculations of interest based on flickinger delay.it concluded that nothing in the probate code authorized an award of interest based on either of these calculations.additionally,the court found both of these methods speculative and without support.
the court then proceeded to address a surcharge based on flickinger breaching his fiduciary duty under probate code section.the court found that flickinger breached his fiduciary duty by failing to distribute the ellington estate in a timely fashion.the court found that flickinger did not profit by the delay and that the estate did not lose a profit as a result of the breach of duty.
the court,however,found that flickinger breach of fiduciary duty did result in a loss of value to ellington estate under probate code section,subdivision a,because the estate had to pay ongoing bond premiums.the court therefore surcharged for the bond premiums for a total of and found flickinger liable for interest at the rate of percent.
the court also noted that it had authority under probate code section to reduce a personal representative compensation for failure to administer an estate in a timely fashion.the court found that the time flickinger took for administration of the estate exceed ed the time required by the probate code the time taken was within the control of the personal representative whose compensation was being reduced and the delay was not in the best interest of the estate or interested persons.the court surcharged flickinger the statutory compensation for services rendered in administering the estate in the amount of and for services related to the sale of estate property in the amount of.the court stated that the probate code did not provide for interest on this amount and these sums did not fall within the definition of probate code section,subdivision a.
the court order regarding the kampen estate pointed out that flickinger failed to administer the estate in a timely fashion but there was no order for final distribution.the court found that the opera association was not entitled to interest under civil code section and,even if it could seek interest under a different theory,laches barred any claim for interest because the opera association failed to assert its rights in a timely fashion.the court surcharged flickinger for bond premiums for a total of and ruled that the opera association was entitled to interest at the rate of percent.the court stated that at the time of final distribution flickinger would not be allowed any fees for administration of the estate.
the opera association had requested a surcharge on a number of payments made by flickinger regarding the kampen estate and the court denied them except for the payment of in taxes.the court found that flickinger did not submit evidence explaining this payment and surcharged him plus interest at the legal rate from the date of payment.
with regard to both estates,the probate court denied the opera association request for double damages under probate code section.the court ordered the preparation of a revised order on amended first and final report of executor and for final distribution.
orders for final distribution and appeals 
on september,the court filed its order for final distribution under the will in the kampen estate.it noted that had been issued to the opera association on may,and the assets remaining in the kampen estate as of august,was.the court denied flickinger the statutory compensation for administering the estate of kampen.the court ordered flickinger,in his personal capacity,to pay,the surcharged amount,to the opera association.the money remaining in the estate,minus,which was to be paid to flickinger counsel,was to be paid to the opera association.
on this same date,september,the court filed its amended order for final distribution in the ellington estate.the court amended the order to reflect the correction in the assets in ellington estate,as supported by the accountings submitted by flickinger.the order included two iras that flickinger later determined were part of kampen estate,not ellington estate.the amended order stated that flickinger distribution of cash totaling to the opera association on january,said amount having been reduced by the ira which instead should have been paid to the estate of roger kampen represents the total sum to be distributed to the opera association by the executor from this estate.the court also ruled that flickinger shall personally pay the opera association,the total of all surcharged amounts pertaining to this estate.
on september,the opera association filed a notice of appeal in the kampen estate from the order on its petition to surcharge and remove flickinger and a notice of appeal in the ellington estate from the order on its petition and the amended order.on october,the opera association filed its notice of appeal for the order for final distribution in the kampen estate.on february,we granted the stipulated motion to consolidate the three appeals of the opera association.the opera association and flickinger filed briefs in this court,and the bonding company filed a brief stating that it adopts all of the respondent brief filed in these consolidated appeals by respondent chandler flickinger.
discussion 
i.the integrity of the probate system 
the opera association maintains that flickinger failed to carry out his fundamental duty as the personal representative of a probate case by not distributing the assets of the estates of ellington or kampen and therefore the lower court erred in refusing to impose statutory interest or to otherwise surcharge flickinger for his delay.the opera association asserts that it is immaterial that flickinger did not steal or borrow the funds.it argues,if the decision of the court below is not reversed,there will be no consequence to the executor for failing to meet his basic fiduciary responsibilities.it maintains that the integrity of the probate system mandates reversal.
to support this argument,the opera association sets forth the basic principle that the object of the probate and administration proceedings is to secure distribution to the persons entitled to share in the estate.superior court cal d.it will not be questioned that justice and sound policy require that the estates of decedents be distributed to persons rightfully entitled thereto and that every concern and endeavor of a probate court should be to the accomplishment of that purpose.edlund superior court cal.
here,the probate court did carry out its role of making sure that flickinger distributed the assets in the estates of kampen and ellington once the opera association sought relief from the court.contrary to the opera association claim that reversal is required under a global perspective and that we need not consider the particulars,the integrity of the probate system requires the probate court to follow the law.thus,the integrity of the probate system would be undermined if we reversed the lower court even though it correctly interpreted and applied particular statutes.
we also disagree with the opera association argument that unless we reverse,administrators will be free to ignore their responsibilities unless the beneficiary takes some action.the probate court required flickinger to disgorge the compensation he had received pursuant to the order.it also required him to pay the cost of the bond premiums plus interest.the court surcharged flickinger a total of in the kampen estate,and a total of in the ellington estate,for a combined total of.given that flickinger had to pay the loss in value to the estates caused by his negligence and that he received no compensation for his work,we disagree that an administrator will have no incentive to meet his or her fiduciary duties when administering an estate.
furthermore,as the lower court pointed out,the opera association was not without any power to do anything.despite knowing that it was the beneficiary and entitled to the assets in both of these estates,the opera association waited many years before demanding the money from flickinger and filing petitions in the superior court.thus,this is not a situation where the opera association is entirely without some responsibility for the delay.
ii.the rulings on the requested statutory damages 
standard of review 
the opera association challenges the probate court interpretation and application of various statutes.we review the interpretation and application of a statute to undisputed facts de novo.groth.oldsmobile,gallagher th,d.the rules of statutory interpretation provide that the court first task in construing a statute is to ascertain the intent of the legislature so as to effectuate the purpose of the law.in determining such intent,a court must look first to the words of the statute themselves,giving to the language its usual,ordinary import and according significance,if possible to every word,phrase and sentence in pursuance of the legislative purpose.a construction making some words surplusage is to be avoided.the words of the statute must be construed in context,keeping in mind the statutory purpose,and statutes or statutory sections relating to the same subject must be harmonized,both internally and with each other,to the extent possible.citations.where uncertainty exists consideration should be given to the consequences that will flow from a particular interpretation.steinfeld foote goldman proctologic medical group,th,d.
code of civil procedure section does not apply to the order 
the probate court rejected the argument that pursuant to code of civil procedure section interest attached to the money in the ellington estate was not timely distributed to the opera association under the order.the opera association contends that the order was a money judgment under code of civil procedure section,and the court should have imposed interest at the rate of percent under code of civil procedure section,subdivision a.see,an order may be enforced as provided in title commencing with section of part of the code of civil procedure.for the reasons discussed below,we agree with the lower court that code of civil procedure section does not apply.
the lower court rejected the opera association request for interest under code of civil procedure section,because it ruled that the order was not a money judgment.money judgment is statutorily defined in the code of civil procedure as that part of a judgment that requires the payment of money.code civ.a money judgment must be stated with certainty and should specify the amount.kittle lang d.
here,the order provided the estate in the possession of the administrator remaining for distribution shall be distributed to the beneficiary of the estate as follows the residue of cash in the estate accounts to the san francisco opera association,being cash of approximately total.thus,the order mandated the distribution of an inexact amount of cash.since the sum in the order was not a fixed and ascertainable amount,it was not a money judgment order.
furthermore,even if the order had set forth a specific sum to be distributed,it still would not have been a money judgment.the final distribution order of the probate court may be construed as a final judgment.bacon bacon cal,under predecessor statutes the decree of distribution should have the same force and effect as other final judgments.however,i t is a final judgment settling the administrator final account,approving the administrator report,and distributing the assets in the estate.mason department of real estate th,d.it is not a judgment that requires the payment of money.see code civ.rather,it is a judgment distributing assets.
a final order of distribution operates in rem to settle the testate and intestate rights to distribution of all those who either did or could have participated as claimants.see,subd.b.this principle acts to preserve the finality and conclusiveness of such decrees and to guarantee the integrity and stability of the titles to the property embraced in the decrees.parsons tickner th,d.the ellington estate only had cash,but other estates may have real property or tangible personal property.the distribution order settles all claims involving all the assets in the estate,and is clearly not a money judgment in favor of one particular party.
in its opening brief in this court,the opera association does not cite to any authority to support its interpretation of the statutes and simply asserts that the lower court erred in setting forth a technical distinction between a money judgment order and final distribution order.it argues that it is immaterial that a distribution order may sometimes involve the distribution of real property because code of civil procedure section recognizes that another part of the same judgment might require the transfer of other types of property.
in its reply brief,the opera association refers to in re marriage of farner d.and in re marriage of wilcox th,d to argue that the order required payment of a sum of money and was therefore a money judgment.in re marriage of farner,at.court rejected husband claim that an earlier judgment granting the wife a percentage interest in her husband pension benefits was not a money judgment in re marriage of wilcox,at,d court rejected husband argument that a judgment directing him to pay money to his was a form of property under the family code and not a money judgment.neither of these cases is a probate case the orders in these family law cases did not involve distribution orders.furthermore,in both of these cases,the former wife had a claim against the husband for funds.here,the opera association has no claim for funds against flickinger,personally.rather,it has a claim that he breached his fiduciary duty for failing to distribute the cash in ellington estate as mandated by the order.
a proceeding for the distribution of an estate in probate is in the nature of a proceeding in rem.the distinction between a claim for money damages and a claim that the person is entitled to distribution of the decedent estate,is not a technical distinction.the assets of the estate are distributed or given to beneficiaries.the court does not make any determination regarding a claim of injury and does not set forth an exact amount of damages owed,which is a requirement for a money judgment.furthermore,as already noted,the beneficiary does not have a claim for damages against the administrator.rather,the beneficiary has a claim that the administrator breached his or her duty by failing to distribute the assets in the estate as mandated by the final distribution order.accordingly,the lower court correctly ruled that the order of final distribution is not a money judgment.
damages under probate code sections and 
the probate court did assess damages under probate code section,subdivision a.it found that flickinger breach of his fiduciary duty caused some loss of value to the estate and it surcharged flickinger for the depreciation in the estate plus interest that was caused by his unreasonable delay.the opera association claims that it was entitled to interest on the full value of the assets in the estates under probate code section,subdivision a.it argues that e ach year that flickinger sat on the funds,those funds were lost to the estate and its beneficiary.
probate code section provides the following a if a personal representative breaches a fiduciary duty,the personal representative is chargeable with any of the following that is appropriate under the circumstances any loss or depreciation in value of the decedent estate resulting from the breach of duty,with interest.any profit made by the personal representative through the breach of duty,with interest.any profit that would have accrued to the decedent estate if the loss of profit is the result of the breach of duty.b if the personal representative has acted reasonably and in good faith under the circumstances as known to the personal representative,the court,in its discretion,may excuse the personal representative in whole or in part from liability under subdivision a if it would be equitable to do so.probate code section establishes the amount of interest to be charged if the executor breaches his or her duty under probate code section,subdivision a or subdivision a.
here,the undisputed evidence established that flickinger did not profit from the delay.there also was no evidence that the estate lost any profit as a result of flickinger breach.the opera association is not entitled to interest it could have earned on the cash in the estates.an executor is similar to a trustee in many respects but,unlike a strict trustee,an executor has no statutory duty to invest money belonging to the estate.estate of mcsweeney d.the court in estate of mcsweeney concluded that the executors should not be compelled to pay simple interest on estate funds that had been maintained in a bearing account for six years.ibid.the executor primary duty is to preserve and protect the assets until distribution.ibid.
since flickinger did not have a duty to place the cash in the estate in some type of account,the opera association can not claim that the estate lost value based on the investment in a low interest or bearing account.it also can not claim that it is entitled to interest because it did not have use of the money.not having use of the money is not a reduction in the value of an asset with the passage of time,and it is the latter that is required by probate code section,subdivision a.
as the lower court explained,the opera association had various remedies available to it to address flickinger delay.it could have petitioned the court for his removal or filed a petition under probate code section to address his failure to administer the estates in a timely manner.the opera association did not avail itself of these remedies.nothing in the probate code requires the lower court to impose interest on the full value of the estate based on the unreasonable delay in receiving the assets in the estate.see nickel bank of america nat.trust sav.ass,nickel interpreted probate code section,subdivision a,which states that a trustee is chargeable for a ny loss of depreciation in value of the trust estate resulting from the breach of trust,with interest as not allowing an award of compound interest.
probate code section,subdivision a clearly states that the unreasonable delay in distribution must result in depreciation or reduction in the value of the estate.here,the lower court correctly imposed interest on the bond premiums because they resulted in a loss of value to the estates.the probate court properly rejected the opera association request for interest on the total value of the assets when the evidence showed that flickinger delay did not lower the value of the accounts in the estates other than by the amounts spent for the bonds.
civil code section does not apply to the kampen estate 
the lower court found that civil code section does not apply to probate cases where it is alleged that the personal representative administrator failed to administer an estate in a timely fashion.the opera association claims that this ruling was error and,with regard to the kampen estate,it was entitled to prejudgment interest.
civil code section provides the following a every person who is entitled to recover damages certain,or capable of being made certain by calculation,and the right to recover which is vested in him upon a particular day,is entitled also to recover interest thereon from that day,except during such time as the debtor is prevented by law,or by the act of the creditor from paying the debt.this section is applicable to recovery of damages and interest from any such debtor,including the state or any county,city,city and county,municipal corporation,public district,public agency,or any political subdivision of the state.b every person who is entitled under any judgment to receive damages based upon a cause of action in contract where the claim was unliquidated,may also recover interest thereon from a date prior to the entry of judgment as the court may,in its discretion,fix,but in no event earlier than the date the action was filed.
as the lower court found,the opera association is a residuary beneficiary,not a recipient of damages.the term damages refers to monetary compensation recoverable by a person who has suffered detriment from the unlawful act or omission of another.although this statute generally applies to contract cases,it also may apply to a judgment if the judgment is the act by which damages become certain or capable of being made certain.see pinecrest productions,rko teleradio pictures,d.
here,there was no money judgment or contract,and the opera association,as the residuary beneficiary,did not have a claim of damages.furthermore,the opera association did not have a right to distribution of the assets in kampen estate that vested on a particular day.thus,under the plain language of civil code section,subdivision a,the opera association is not entitled to interest under this statute.
the opera association maintains that there is no meaningful distinction between a standard judgment in a civil case that awards money damages to a plaintiff and a judgment or order of final distribution of a probate estate that orders distribution of cash to the beneficiary.it then repeats its argument that an order of distribution is a money judgment.as already discussed,we reject this argument that an order of distribution is a money judgment.under the plain language of civil code section,subdivision a,this provision does not apply to an order of distribution.
subdivision b of section of the civil code,which authorizes interest in cases involving unliquidated contract claims,also plainly does not apply.the opera association did not have a contract with flickinger or kampen that entitled it to damages.
the opera association argument that subdivision b of civil code section applies is flawed and not supported with authority.the opera association contrived argument is that once flickinger was appointed an executor by the court and accepted these duties,he agreed to carry out kampen wishes as set forth in the will.it maintains that when flickinger failed to fulfill his responsibilities he breached his contractual relationship with kampen under the will that named him the executor and breached his contract with the court that appointed him executor.it then asserts that the opera association was a third party beneficiary of both of these contracts.
this foregoing argument merits little discussion.it is elementary that a contract requires an offer and acceptance,which were clearly missing in either of the alleged contracts.flickinger duties derived from statutes,not a contract.the opera association assertion that the court appointment of an executor constitutes some type of contract is a novel,but absurd,argument.
iii.the rulings on the requested non statutory damages 
a.the opera association alternative measurements of damages 
the opera association contends that even if the lower court correctly ruled on its requests for statutory damages,the court erred as a matter of law by refusing to consider any other measure of delay damages.
specifically,the opera association complains that the lower court rejected its two alternative measurements of damages.the opera association had requested interest based on the performance of its endowment fund.it proposed that interest could be calculated as the amounts the opera association allegedly lost by not being able to invest the money from the estates.the second method proposed was that interest could be calculated based upon the increased interest costs the opera association had to incur by having to borrow funds to replace the amounts it had not timely received.
the lower court did explain that the probate code did not authorize the award of damages based on the two alternative measurements proposed by the opera association.however,it provided an independent basis for rejecting these requests it also ruled that any amount so calculated was speculative and without support.the opera association ignores this second,independent,basis for denying its request.
the court ruling that the opera association requests for damages were speculative and not supported by the evidence is not reviewed de novo.i t is fundamental that damages which are speculative,remote,imaginary,contingent,or merely possible can not serve as a legal basis for recovery.piscitelli friedenberg th,d.only the determination of whether the opera association is entitled to a particular measure of damages is a question of law subject to de novo review.wilson los angeles county metropolitan transportation authority cal th,d.the court independent basis for rejecting the opera association claims for damages based on the damages being speculative and not supported by the evidence will be affirmed if the ruling is supported by substantial evidence.westphal wal mart stores,th,d.
under the substantial evidence standard of review,we must consider all of the evidence in the light most favorable to the prevailing party,giving it the benefit of every reasonable inference,and resolving conflicts in support of the findings.citations.it is not our task to weigh conflicts and disputes in the evidence that is the province of the trier of fact.our authority begins and ends with a determination as to whether,on the entire record,there is any substantial evidence,contradicted or uncontradicted,in support of the judgment.asp properties group,fard,th,d.all presumptions favor the trial court ruling,which is entitled to great deference westphal wal mart stores,supra,th at,d.
on appeal,the opera association fails to cite to any evidence in the record that supported its requests for damages.accordingly,we must conclude that the lower court findings that the requested damages were not supported by the evidence and were speculative were correct.see in re marriage of arceneaux cal d.
additionally,we also agree with the lower court finding that the probate code did not authorize the measurement of damages urged by the opera association.the only statute the opera association cites in support of its argument that it was entitled to these measurements of damages is probate code section.this statute simply provides that sections and of the probate code for liability of a personal representative for breach of a fiduciary duty do not prevent resort to any other remedy available against the personal representative under the statutory or common law.the law revision commission comment to probate code section provides the section merely retains remedies that existed before the enactment of sections and it does not create any new remedies against a personal representative.cal.law revision.com,west ann.foll,italics added see also nickel,supra.at when considering the language in probate code section,which has essentially the same language as that in probate code section,but applies to trustees,the federal district court stated that it is highly unlikely that the l egislature would have defined specific remedies elsewhere in the probate code,only to have them trumped by other common law remedies or by such a general section as probate code section.
as already discussed,the lower court awarded the opera association the damages available under the statutory law,and no statute authorized damages based on the two alternative methods urged by the opera association.probate code section did not authorize the damages requested by the opera association but permits a court to use a remedy created by the case law prior to the enactment of probate code sections and.as we discuss below,the case law did not require the lower court to impose any additional surcharge on flickinger.
case law does not require the imposition of damages 
the opera association contends that the lower court failed to follow case precedent when it acknowledged that flickinger delay in distributing the assets from the estates was unreasonable and unjustified,but then refused to award the opera association interest on the money in the estates of ellington and kampen.in support of this argument,they rely on cases over years old.see estate of holbert cal,in re hilliard cal,mary hospital perry cal,estate of piercy cal.
the trial court found that these four cases were distinguishable from the present case because the personal representative in the cited cases had committed an intentional wrong and had not simply delayed unreasonably the distribution of the estate a brief summary of these cases supports the lower court conclusion that each case involved some intentional wrongdoing by the personal representative.
the oldest case cited by the opera association,estate of holbert,supra,cal,involved an express trust to loan money on good security and,instead of complying with the direction of the will,the executor used the money himself.id.at.the court stated that i t was a misappropriation of the funds of the estate in his hands,to have mingled them with his own affairs,and employed them in the prosecution of his private business.id.at.the court held that the measure of damages,at the option of the beneficiary,is either the legal interest rate or the measure of profit realized by the executor.ibid.
in in re hilliard,supra cal,the appellate court concluded that the executors unreasonably delayed settling and distributing an estate.id.at.they did not profit from the use of the estate funds,but did use the money of the estate and mingled the estate assets with the executors own funds.id.at.the appellate court determined that it was immaterial that the executors did not derive any benefit by using the money because it was enough that they kept it for their own use,and used it whenever they had use for it.the law requires executors and guardians to account not only for all profits they realize from the use of the money entrusted to them,but also for both principal and interest,in case of loss by their unauthorized use of such money.id.at.the court ordered the lower court to charge the executors with interest,to be compounded annually.ibid.
the appellate court in mary hospital perry,supra,cal,was concerned with the damages awarded after the lower court had granted a judgment on the pleadings.id.at.the defendant executor failed to pay the money to the hospital after the decedent had left a cash bequest to the hospital for purposes of endowing a bed for the poor in memory of her late husband.id.at.the defendant executor refused to pay the money because the hospital refused to provide and maintain such a bed permanently after it was informed that the bequest was insufficient for a permanent bed.id.at.the court stated that the d efendant executrix ha d no supervisory power and was called upon by the decree simply to deliver the property distributed.she ha d no right to require from the distributee any agreement as to the performance of the trust as a condition precedent to delivery id.at.the court concluded that allowance of interest i n cases of this character from the time the executor or administrator should have paid the money to the distributee was proper and chargeable against the individual executor.ibid.
the opera association stresses that the personal representative did not misappropriate the funds in mary hospital perry,supra,cal.the executor,however,did engage in misconduct when she refused to distribute the money as required because she unilaterally decided that the beneficiary could not receive its bequest unless it contributed its own funds to make the endowment permanent.furthermore,the court stated,in cases of this character the allowance of interest from the time the executor or administrator should have paid the money to the distributee is proper.id.at.thus,the court did not state that interest was required.rather,it simply held that it was proper for the lower court to order interest from the point in time the executor wrongfully forced a condition on the beneficiary before agreeing to distribute the assets.
finally,in estate of piercy,supra,cal,the court reversed the portion of the lower court order that refused to charge the administrator with compound interest on the rental value of the land of the estate.id.at.the appellate court concluded,where,as here,the settlement of the estate has been long delayed and the administrator has himself used funds belonging to the estate,the heirs will not be fully compensated unless they receive compound interest upon the property of the estate thus withheld.id.at.the court elaborated the only reason for the long delay was that the administrator asserted a claim to the lands against the estate.this claim was adjudged to be based upon his own fraud and undue influence.the fact that he set it up and litigated it can not entitle him to any special consideration.it is equally clear that the administrator violated his trust by using the property of the estate for his own benefit in conjunction with property belonging to him.there may be cases in which the trial court may,in the exercise of a sound discretion,grant or deny compound interest.here,however,the misconduct of the administrator was so clearly shown that there was no room for the play of discretion.id.at.
as the lower court in the present case found,the personal representative in the foregoing cases engaged in some misconduct.the personal representative used or mingled the funds from the estate or engaged in some type of misconduct,which caused the delay.the opera association maintains that the lower court focus on this factor was incorrect because these cases imposed a penalty such as compound interest for the misconduct,and simple interest should be imposed for unreasonable delay.further,it asserts without citing to any supportive authority that negligent delay is so uncommon that no court has had to address the particular facts as presented in this case.
firstly,we do not accept the opera association unsupported premise that negligent delay by a personal representative is uncommon.indeed,the legislature anticipated that an administrator may delay distributing an estate and provided a remedy under probate code section.probate code section provides the following a the court may,on petition of any interested person or on its own motion,for good cause shown on the record,cite the personal representative to appear before the court and show the condition of the estate and the reasons why the estate can not be distributed and closed.b on the hearing of the citation,the court may either order the administration of the estate to continue or order the personal representative to petition for final distribution 
secondly,implicit to the opera association argument is that flickinger must be punished for his delay but courts have made clear that punishment is not the basis for requiring a personal representative to pay interest.the rule which makes an executor or other trustee chargeable with compound interest upon trust funds used by him in his own business,is not adopted for the purpose of punishing him for any intentional wrongdoing in the use of such fund,but rather to carry into effect the principle enforced by courts of equity,that the trustee shall not be permitted to make any profit from the unauthorized use of such funds.miller lux cal,superseded by statute on another issue.thus,integral to the rule of imposing interest is the principle of preventing the personal representative from making any profit from the unauthorized use of such funds.if the personal representative does not make any unauthorized use of such funds and does not engage in any wrongdoing,we agree with the lower court that imposing interest is not required.
thirdly,some courts have indicated that simple interest is appropriate when the misconduct is negligent and compound interest is proper when the misconduct is willful.the court in estate of mcsweeney,supra,d,explained that an executor,even when also a devisee,can not use funds of the estate available to him in his official capacity for his individual needs.id.at.if the executor uses the money,the executor is liable for the moneys used and for interest thereon.ibid.the court proceeded to distinguish negligent expenditures from willful expenditures.it noted that compound interest should be charged if the expenditure was willful,but simple interest should be charged if the expenditure was negligent.ibid.similarly,in estate of guglielmi,supra,a case upon which the opera association relies,the court did not impose compound interest,but imposed simple interest when the executor wrongly took extraordinary fees without a court order.id.at.here,as already stressed,there was no misconduct either willful or negligent and interest was not required.
accordingly,we reject the opera association argument that the case law required the lower court to impose interest based on flickinger unreasonable delay in distributing the cash in the estates of ellington and kampen.
c.the doctrine of laches 
the lower court findings 
the probate court ruled that the opera association had the right to bring an action against flickinger for failing to distribute ellington estate.see.the court,however,determined that the opera association failed to act and enforce its rights in a timely manner,which precluded any recovery other than the statutory damages ordered.the court refused to require flickinger to pay interest under common law see,mary hospital perry,supra,cal,as it concluded that flickinger affirmative defense of laches barred the opera association claim for interest.similarly,with regard to the kampen estate where there was no final distribution,the court found that even if there was some theory permitting the opera association to seek interest,laches barred any claim for interest because the opera association failed to assert its rights in a timely fashion.
flickinger failed to administer the kampen estate in a timely fashion but there was no order for final distribution.the opera association can not claim it is entitled to interest on money not yet distributed from kampen estate based on any of the case decisions it cites.accordingly,we do not need to consider the affirmative defense of laches as it relates to the kampen estate.however,for the same reasons discussed below regarding the ellington estate,we conclude that laches would bar any claim for damages not based on a statute with regard to flickinger administration of the kampen estate.
principles of laches 
laches is an equitable defense.rouse underwood d.the defense of laches requires unreasonable delay plus either acquiescence in the act about which plaintiff complains or prejudice to the defendant resulting from the delay.johnson city of loma linda cal th,d,conti board of civil service commissioners cal d,conti.
generally speaking,the existence of laches is a question of fact to be determined by the trial court in light of all the applicable circumstances city of coachella riverside county airport land use com.d.however,the issue may be addressed as one of law if the facts are undisputed.san bernardino valley audubon society city of moreno valley th,d,overruled on another issue in san bernardino valley audubon society metropolitan water dist.th,d.
the availability of the defense of laches 
the opera association asserts that laches can not be an affirmative defense to an enforcement of a judgment.see,united states capital nickelberry d,pratali gates th,d.it is well settled that the equitable defense of laches does not apply in an action based on a judgment,which is an action at law.barkley city of blue lake th,d laches not a defense to the plaintiff action to enforce a judgment that awarded the plaintiff damages for breach of contract.
laches does not apply in an action of law barkley city of blue lake,supra,th at,d,but the present action was not an action at law.the opera association was not seeking legal remedies in its petition involving the ellington estate.the opera association,in its role as a beneficiary,filed a petition to surcharge flickinger,the administrator of the estate of ellington,for breach of his fiduciary duty.the court held a trial on the petitions to surcharge and acted as the trier of fact,sitting in the exercise of the probate jurisdiction of the superior court.
a probate court is a court of general jurisdiction,it has no general equity jurisdiction,since its general jurisdiction is confined to the settlement of the estates of deceased persons.security first nat.bk.superior court cal d.it has the power to apply principles of equity in aid of its functions as a probate court.ibid.laches is an equitable defense.consequently,the lower court had the authority to consider and apply the laches defense.
the affirmative defense of laches against a claim for unreasonable delay 
the opera association claims that flickinger can not assert the defense of laches because the wrong committed by flickinger was an unreasonable delay in carrying out his fiduciary duties.the opera association asserts,without citing to any authority,that laches was not intended to apply to such a situation.
laches is an unreasonable delay in asserting an equitable right,causing prejudice to an adverse party such as to render the granting of relief to the other party inequitable.in re marriage of plescia th,d.there is nothing inequitable about permitting the defense of laches against a claim that is based on delay.
contrary to the opera association argument,courts have applied a laches defense against a plaintiff claim that the defendant delay was unreasonable.for example,in schellinger brothers city of sebastopol th,d,we considered a developer petition that the city delay beyond one year in certifying an environment impact report eir should result in the city having to certify the eir,even though the city alleged the eir was insufficient.id.at,d.we held that the plaintiff developer acted with unreasonable delay and acquiesced in the city taking more than a year to certify an eir and therefore laches barred the claim.id.at,d.
we conclude that the lower court properly considered the defense of laches in this case.
evidence in support of the finding of laches 
as already noted,in order to establish laches,the defendant must show that the plaintiff unreasonably delayed pursuing the claim plus either acquiescence in the act about which plaintiff complains or prejudice to the defendant resulting from the delay.johnson city of loma linda,supra,cal th at,d.on appeal,the opera association does not mount any challenge to the lower court finding that it unreasonably delayed pursuing any action against flickinger.moreover,the evidence amply supported such a finding.the evidence shows that on june,mason,who was then the associate director of planned gifts for the opera association,wrote a memorandum stating that flickinger indicated that the opera could expect between and combined from the kampen and ellington estates.although the opera association knew of this bequest in,it did not file its petitions for surcharge until january.this delay of more than years was clearly unreasonable.
the opera association does,however,maintain that the record contained no evidence that the delay caused any prejudice to flickinger.prejudice is never presumed rather it must be affirmatively demonstrated by the defendant in order to sustain his burdens of proof and the production of evidence on the issue.miller eisenhower medical center cal d.the opera association asserts that the only evidence of any prejudic
