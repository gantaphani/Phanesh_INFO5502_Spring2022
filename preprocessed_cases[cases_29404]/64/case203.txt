this appeal follows the successful demurrer of carlyn munn briggs carlyn and michael briggs michael to the petition of carlyn brother james munn james for relief from interference with an inheritance expectancy,a tort that has never been recognized in california.james alleges his sister and interfered with his expected inheritance by unduly influencing their mother janell munn janell to sign a codicil to her will that gave each to jana munn briggs jana and jack munn briggs jack,janell grandchildren and the children of carlyn and michael.janell,however,did not make any gift of her estate to james children.
james did not challenge the validity of the will and codicil admitted to probate because the codicil contained a clause.that clause specified that if james unsuccessfully contested the validity of the codicil,everything left in the survivor trust created by janell after the death of her husband henry lusk munn henry would pass to carlyn.
james instead filed a petition in the probate court against carlyn and michael alleging they tortiously interfered with his inheritance expectancy petition for tortious interference with inheritance when they procured the execution of the codicil by exerting undue influence on janell.the probate court sustained without leave to amend the demurrer of carlyn and michael to the interference petition.
as we explain,we conclude james had an adequate remedy in probate to assert his influence claim against carlyn and michael.as such,under the present circumstances we decline to recognize a cause of action in tort for interference with an expected inheritance.judgment affirmed.
facts and procedural background 
the relevant facts are not in dispute.in,henry and janell created the munn family trust the trust.henry and janell had two children,james and carlyn.henry died in december.
on henry death,the trust created three separate trusts,including a survivor trust for the benefit of janell.as the surviving spouse,the trust provided janell with a testamentary power of appointment over the property in the survivor trust.
janell also executed a will in.after allocating personal items,jewelry,clothing,furniture and automobiles and making provision for the payment of taxes,the will gave the residue of janell estate to the trust.janell also nominated henry as her executor.if henry was unable to act as executor,the will designated james,carlyn and michael her,or the survivor of them,as executor.
at the heart of the instant dispute between james and carlyn is a codicil that janell executed on december.article ii of the codicil provides under my power of appointment in the trust,i give one million dollars to my granddaughter jana munn briggs and one million dollars to my grandson jack munn briggs.the funds shall be given in trust as provided in article seventh c of the trust to jana or jack if she or he,respectively,is under the age of years at the time of my death.
article iii of the codicil states i janell choose not to make a gift to my other grandchildren under my power of appointment because they have been much closer to their maternal grandparents,who have or can make gifts to them if they choose.
article iv is the no contest clause.it provides if my son james or any of his issue,singly or in conjunction with any other person or persons,contests in any court the validity of this codicil or my will or of any trust receiving property under this codicil,or shall seek to obtain an adjudication in any proceeding in any court that this codicil or any of its dispositive provisions are void,or otherwise seeks to void,nullify,or set aside any of the provisions of this codicil,then under my power of appointment in the trust,i give all remaining funds in the trust to my daughter,carlyn or her children if she predecease me.
the codicil was witnessed by lynne thompson and sylvia so,who declared under penalty of perjury janell signed the codicil in their presence,janell was of sound mind and janell was under no constraint or undue influence when she executed the codicil.janell passed away on january.
on february,michael filed a petition in the san diego county superior court seeking admission of the will and codicil to probate the probate petition.as noted ante,james did not object to the validity of the will or codicil,or challenge the million gifts to jana and jack.james instead filed his petition for tortious interference with inheritance against carlyn and michael 
in that petition,james alleged that beginning in janell and henry lived in an assisted living facility,they both suffered from physical and mental difficulties and their conditions worsened over time.he further alleged in janell memory ranged from fair to poor,she could not walk without assistance and after henry died in december,her mental alertness and memory became progressively worse and deteriorated at an rate 
james alleged janell was almost entirely reliant on carlyn and michael in connection with her personal and mental affairs,was allowed to exercise virtually no discretion in such matters,and carlyn engaged in behavior that was manipulative and mentally and emotionally abusive towards janell.specifically,he alleged carlyn kept janell grandchildren from visiting janell when carlyn was upset with janell,and carlyn told janell that if she did not behave better,carlyn would not scatter her ashes alongside those of her husband henry.
james also alleged michael prepared the codicil with the no contest clause a month before janell passed away and carlyn and michael misled janell to believe that james children had a closer relationship with their maternal grandparents who have or can make gifts to them if they choose,a statement that is completely unfounded and untrue.
as a result of such wrongful conduct,james alleged carlyn and michael intentionally interfered with his inheritance expectancy.before the codicil,james had an expectancy to share equally with his sister carlyn in the balance of the survivor trust,each having a interest.however,after the codicil,the balance of the survivor trust was reduced by million,causing james expected inheritance to decrease by million.because the codicil included a no contest clause,james alleged he was prevented from receiving from janell a substantial inheritance he otherwise would have received but for the interference of carlyn and michael.james sought in his interference petition compensatory and punitive damages against carlyn and michael.
carlyn and michael demurred.the probate court sustained the demurrer without leave to amend.in so doing,the court ruled no california case has ever expressly held that the cause of action of intentional interference with an inheritance expectancy is recognized in california and the determination of whether california law should recognize such a cause of action is not one that should be made by the trial court,especially given the policy of judicial economy,as well as the impact on the parties in funding litigation over a claim that may ultimately not be recognized as viable under california law.judgment sustaining the demurrer to the interference petition was entered in september.

tortious interference with inheritance expectancy 
background of the tort 
the parties agree,and our own research confirms,that california has yet to recognize the tort of intentional interference with an inheritance expectancy as defined in restatement second of torts restatement section.
section of the restatement was first published in.rest d torts,see also klein,the disappointed heir revenge,southern style tortious interference with expectation of inheritance a survey with analysis of state approaches in the fifth and eleventh circuits baylor,hereinafter survey with analysis in the fifth and eleventh circuits.section provides one who by fraud,duress or other tortious means intentionally prevents another from receiving from a third person an inheritance or gift that he would otherwise have received is subject to liability to the other for loss of the inheritance or gift.
the restatement notes section is an extension to a type of noncontractual relation of the principle found in the liability for intentional interference with prospective contracts rest d torts,com.the restatement further notes liability under section is limited to cases in which the actor has interfered with the inheritance or gift by means that are independently tortious in character,including when a third person has been induced to make or not make a bequest or gift by fraud,duress,defamation or tortious abuse of fiduciary duty,or when a will or document making a gift has been forged,altered or suppressed.rest d torts,com.
tortious interference with expectation of inheritance is a comparatively new tort that has found acceptable in half of the united states.see klein,river deep,mountain high,heir disappointed tortious interference with expectation of survey with analysis of state approaches in the mountain states idaho,hereafter survey with analysis in the mountain states see also johnson,tortious interference with expectancy of inheritance or for resort to the tort.tol,hereafter suggestions for resort to the tort while not all jurisdictions recognize a cause of action for tortious interference with expectancy of inheritance or gift,about half of all jurisdictions permit actions based on the tort.
under american law,testators have a right to completely disinherit nearly anyone,and there is no right to inherit.of course,tortious conduct relating to wills,such as the use of undue influence,threats,or coercion to procure a particular disposition,or destruction of a will,has long been understood as a legal wrong,but only against the testator whose right of free testation is infringed upon,not the beneficiary.a purported injury to an intended recipient is not cognizable because there is no right to inherit instead,the probate system through the will contest proceeding aims to offer all interested parties a forum in which to litigate the testator true intentions.survey with analysis in the fifth and eleventh circuits,supra,baylor.at,fns.omitted.
unlike probate proceedings,which seek to carry out the intent of the testator with respect to the distribution of the testator estate,a tort action for interference with an expected inheritance endeavors to restore the plaintiff with the benefit arguably lost because of defendant tortious conduct.suggestions for resort to the tort,supra.tol.at,fn.omitted see also survey with analysis in the fifth and eleventh circuits,supra,baylor.at noting that although an injury to testator is a natural concomitant to the tort for example,undue influence may be exerted on him to execute or revoke a will,the tort is not a remedy,and noting that the tort represents a fundamental and significant shift of focus away from the testator and onto the wronged beneficiary.
a successful tort action results in a judgment against the defendant for money damages,not a determination of the validity of a particular will or other testamentary result.suggestions for resort to the tort,supra.tol.at,fn.omitted.the legal differences between a will contest and the tort are.the tort,an action at law,allows compensatory and punitive damages.survey with analysis in the fifth and eleventh circuits,supra,baylor.at,fn.omitted.
i n addition to the differing focus of the proceedings and the testator intent versus the plaintiff injury,i n a tort action the plaintiff files an in personam action against the alleged tortfeasor.in probate,even in a will contest involving proponents and opponents of a particular testamentary plan,the proceeding to determine the proper distribution of the testator probate property is in rem.a tort action can result in a judgment against the defendant,as the alleged tortfeasor,to be paid from his personal assets.a probate proceeding determines what will happen to the assets in the testator probate estate.suggestions for resort to the tort,supra,of tol.at,fns.omitted see also stevens torregano d,probate decrees are in rem,binding on all interested persons.
availability of the tort and adequacy of a remedy in probate 
in terms of availability of the tort,the cases seem to fall into three categories.first,there are those cases in which probate provides an adequate remedy and the party claiming injury has no need for the tort.any action would proceed in the probate court.second,there are those cases in which probate would provide an inadequate remedy or no remedy.such cases should proceed in tort without resort to probate.third,there are those cases in which a probate proceeding is held,and the result does not provide complete relief or any relief to the person alleging deprivation of an expectancy by tortious interference in this third category of cases,the issue often becomes whether a tort action would be barred as a collateral attack on the probate court determination.the collateral attack doctrine could potentially bar the action because the person claiming tortious interference did not seek appropriate remedy in probate.suggestions for resort to the tort,supra,of tol.at,fn.omitted.
our independent research also confirms that when a party has an adequate remedy in probate,the party generally will be precluded from recovering in tort for interference with an expectancy.see wilson fritschy,wilson analyzed post minton sackett,noting i n determining whether to adopt the approach of section of the restatement,we must balance the competing goals of providing a remedy to injured parties and honoring the strictures of our probate code,which provides that a will contest is the exclusive means of challenging the validity of a will,and further noting a majority of the states which have adopted the tort of interference with an inheritance have achieved such a balance by prohibiting a tort action to be brought where the remedy of a will contest is available and would provide the injured party with adequate relief.
the rule precluding a party from moving in tort when probate provides an adequate remedy applies even in those states that have recognized the tort.see survey with analysis in the mountain states,supra,idaho.at,citing wilson,supra,at see also survey with analysis in the fifth and eleventh circuits,supra,baylor.at most states that recognize the tort see it as a secondary or remedy,only to be used when,for whatever reason,the probate court remedy would be inadequate fried,the disappointed heir going beyond the probate process to remedy wrongdoing or rectify mistake real prop.prob.tr.j,fn.omitted a court faced with a lawsuit brought by a disappointed heir for damages or for imposition of a constructive trust should determine initially whether the matter is one within the province of a probate court,and i f the claimed wrongdoing relates to the execution or revocation of a will,and the claimant has standing in the probate proceeding,the court should not entertain an independent action even if the jurisdiction recognizes the tort of interference with an inheritance.
the development of the tort of interference with an expected inheritance by the courts of appeals in new mexico assists our discussion and analysis here.in doughty morris,doughty,the court for the first time recognized a cause of action in new mexico against those who intentionally and tortuously interfere with an expected inheritance.
briefly,the daughter in doughty alleged her brother had tortiously interfered with daughter inheritance by coercing their severely ill mother to make certain inter vivos transfers of property that depleted mother estate so that there was nothing left to divide as specified in mother will.doughty,supra,at.relying on restatement section,the court in doughty ruled that for daughter to recover for tortious interference with an expected inheritance,she needed to prove the existence of an expectancy a reasonable certainty that the expectancy would have been realized,but for the interference intentional interference with that expectancy tortious conduct involved with interference,such as fraud,duress,or undue influence and damages.id.at.the court affirmed there was sufficient evidence in the record to support the trial court finding that son intentionally interfered with daughter expected inheritance as to mother three certificates of deposits and a joint savings account.id.at.
the tort was next discussed by the new mexico court of appeals in wilson,supra,at page.there,testator niece and nephew alleged testator accountants unduly influenced testator to execute a new testamentary plan that provided niece and nephew with only a life estate.testator new testamentary plan had the practical effect of disinheriting niece and nephew.ibid.
although niece and nephew retained legal counsel and notified the trustee and personal representative of testator estate they intended to file formal testacy proceedings within the statutory prescribed period,they never did so.wilson,supra,at.niece and nephew instead sued accountants in tort for interference with an expected inheritancy because accountants had recommended testator make charitable contributions to reduce the estate potential tax liability and because one such accountant,who served as the auditor of the nursing home where testator lived,suggested to testator that the nursing home would be an appropriate charitable beneficiary.ibid.
the wilson court noted that in doughty it had no reason to consider whether the tort of interference with an expected inheritance should also be recognized when the interference with inheritance takes place in the context of a will or other testamentary device that can be challenged in probate.wilson,supra,at.relying on rienhardt kelly cir rienhardt,which interpreted doughty and applied new mexico law,the court in wilson ruled the tenth circuit court of appeal got it right in rienhardt when that court made the pivotal distinction that in doughty,n o challenge to this behavior could be brought in probate proceedings,because the will remained valid and executable according to its language.thus,to remedy this seemingly situation,the new mexico court in dougthy recognized the tort.wilson,supra,at,quoting rienhardt,supra,at.
the wilson court further noted the tenth circuit opinion in rienhardt appears to be in line with the weight of the case law emerging from state appellate courts.of those states that have considered the tort of intentional interference with inheritance,most have held that claims in tort may only be brought when there is no adequate remedy in probate.wilson,supra,at citing among authorities robinson first state bank illinois supreme court rejected a claim by disgruntled heirs james fassold,tortious interference with expectancy of inheritance new tort,new traps.attorney,stating that,in most states where the tort is recognized,a deprived legatee must seek relief through probate or show that probate is impossible before bringing such a claim.
noting that inheritance laws are purely a creature of statute as is true in california see in re darling cal,the court in wilson refused to allow niece and nephew to circumvent the probate code by calling a will contest an action in tort.wilson,supra,at,quoting dragan miller cir,posner.wilson explained we feel compelled to protect the jurisdictional space carved out by our legislature when it enacted the probate code and created remedies,such as a will contest,designed exclusively for probate.we note that a will contest in probate requires a greater burden of persuasion than an independent action in tort.citation.a presumption of due execution normally attaches to a testamentary instrument administered in probate,but not necessarily in tort.citations.if we were to permit,much less encourage,dual litigation tracks for disgruntled heirs,we would risk destabilizing the law of probate and creating uncertainty and inconsistency in its place.we would risk undermining the legislative intent inherent in creating the probate code as the preferable,if not exclusive,remedy for disputes over testamentary documents.citations.ibid.
referring to the rule requiring the validity of a testamentary instrument to be addressed in probate and not in a separate tort action as the emerging majority rule wilson,supra,at,the court in wilson noted that niece and nephew could have addressed their undue influence claims against accountants in probate.if they had been successful in setting aside testator new testamentary plan,they would have received their entire expectancy under the original trust.ibid.
the niece and nephew nonetheless argued in wilson that absent recognition of an independent tort,tortfeasors such as accountants could evade responsibility even if niece and nephew had successfully set aside in probate the testator new testamentary plan and realized their full expectancy.wilson,supra,at.the court in wilson recognized the validity of this argument,and noted accountants may well escape financial accountability for their alleged wrongs.however,we simply may have to tolerate that consequence as a cost of protecting the integrity of the probate process.the tort of intentional interference with inheritance did not arise out of a perceived need to punish alleged wrongdoers.the tort developed to protect valid testamentary expectancies and to provide a remedy when the probate process is inadequate.citations.the proper focus of the tort is on the just distribution of estate assets when that can be achieved in probate,the need for the tort disappears.wilson,supra,at italics added see also dewitt duce so d,florida supreme court noted that c ases which allow the action for tortious interference with a testamentary expectancy are predicated on the inadequacy of probate remedies.
the adequacy of a party remedy in probate is also one of the justifications given by courts in those states that have declined to recognize the tort of interference with an expected inheritance.see survey with analysis in the mountain states,supra,idaho.at noting the montana supreme court in hauck seright,decided not to recognize for the first time the tort of interference with an expected inheritance because the heir had an adequate remedy in probate through the heir successful will contest see also jackson kelly,noting the issue of whether arkansas acknowledges the tort of interference with an expected inheritance is one of first impression,but declining to recognize the tort in the case before it because the appellant remedy in probate court was adequate.
here,the record shows named executor under janell the probate petition on february.james did not object to the probate petition at or before the first hearing of the probate court on june.on july,the court admitted to probate janell will and the codicil that is the subject of this appeal.as a result,under probate code section,subdivision a,james had days to petition the court to revoke the probate of the will.
the record also shows james did not seek to revoke the probate of the will and codicil.instead,in may he filed a safe harbor petition under former probate code section,subdivision a,seeking a determination that his proposed petition for tortious interference with expected inheritance would not constitute a contest within the meaning of ja
