factual and procedural histories 
on january,appellant adria underwood filed a petition for an order determining ownership of property under probate code section or alternatively for an order to determine the existence of an oral trust under section.in the petition,she alleged that she is the mother of the decedent,who died intestate on october.she listed those persons with possible interests in decedent estate as herself,valda pollard decedent sister,carmia eldridge decedent sister,danielle ricchiuti decedent minor daughter,mari ann ricchiuti decedent and legal guardian of his daughter,james gardner,iii decedent minor son,and valerie pearce decedent and legal guardian of his son.
appellant alleged that decedent received approximately million as a settlement for a personal injury lawsuit.he deposited about percent of these settlement proceeds in two brokerage accounts.on june,he opened an account with atlas funds and deposited the sum of into the atlas account.on june,he opened an account at wells fargo investments,llc,and deposited the sum of into the wells fargo account.
appellant further alleged that decedent completed and executed the necessary documentation for the atlas account to be registered as a payable on death pod account,with appellant and decedent sister,carmia eldridge,as equal beneficiaries of the account in the event of his death.decedent told his wells fargo advisor,richard roush,that he wished to set up the same type of account for the wells fargo account.however,decedent subsequently was informed that one of his former spouses was a wells fargo employee.appellant alleged that decedent became concerned when he found this out and elected to withdraw the entirety of the funds on july,and transfer them to wachovia securities.in september,decedent signed paperwork to electronically transfer funds in the atlas account to wachovia.appellant alleged that she is informed,believes and thereon alleges the terms or,alternatively,the totten trust terms were maintained as part of the transfer to wachovia.
appellant alleged that decedent expressed an intent that the funds be held for the benefit of his mother and sister,and that,in response to decedent directions,wachovia staff subsequently prepared an application for registration of account in beneficiary form transfer on death direction,which confirmed that appellant and eldridge were equal beneficiaries of the wachovia funds.appellant,however,died before he could sign the application.nevertheless,appellant contended that she and eldridge were the rightful owners of the funds deposited by decedent with wachovia,either because decedent maintained created a totten trust or pod account upon depositing the settlement proceeds at wachovia securities,or because decedent created an express oral trust upon depositing the settlement proceeds at wachovia securities 
on february,mari ann ricchiuti,on behalf of danielle ricchiuti,filed an opposition to appellant petition.in her opposition,she contended that,because decedent never completed executed the wachovia paperwork,any intent to create pod accounts for the wachovia accounts was never realized and the pod terms were not maintained as part of the transfer of the funds from the atlas account.moreover,decedent never established pod terms for the wells fargo account initially,so there was nothing to maintain or transfer when the monies in that account were transferred to wachovia.she also contends that there was no clear and convincing evidence that decedent intended to create an express oral trust.
on february,valerie pearce,on behalf of james gardner,iii,filed a demurrer to appellant petition.in the demurrer,pearce contended that appellant failed to plead with certainty whether appellant claim of the existence of a totten trust or pod account is based upon the terms of a written contract carried over from decedent atlas account,an oral contract based upon decedent conversations with wachovia employees,or a contract implied by conduct when wachovia drafted an application for registration of account in beneficiary form transfer on death direction that was never executed by decedent.pearce also asserted that appellant failed to state facts sufficient to establish that decedent intended to create an express oral trust.
on march,appellant filed her opposition to the demurrer.she contended that she had sufficiently pleaded the existence of a totten trust or pod account and the creation of an oral trust.she asserted that any factual disputes should be resolved by trial or summary judgment.
on april,the probate court issued an order sustaining ricchiuti opposition to and sustaining pearce demurrer to appellant petition without leave to amend.the trial court first observed that,because the wachovia account is a security account,the proper analysis should probably be under the uniform security registration act,section et,although the result would be the same as its analysis of the case under the california accounts law campal,section et.the court rejected the argument that the wachovia account should be deemed a pod account because decedent intended to complete the pod paperwork for the wachovia account but failed to do so before he died.according to the court,as a matter of law,the failure to sign the form resulted in the failure to create a pod account.
the probate court also rejected the alternate theory that the money in the atlas account kept the pod terms when the money was electronically transferred to the wachovia accounts.the court concluded that the assertion the pod designation of the atlas account governed the terms of the wachovia account was a legal assertion and not a factual assertion.the probate court found that section,subdivision c,precluded this legal assertion because that subdivision provides that the withdrawal of funds from a pod account eliminates the rights of survivorship with respect to those funds.
finally,the probate court concluded that appellant did not sufficiently plead the creation of an oral trust because she relied on the same facts alleged in support of the creation of a pod account to support the creation of an oral trust.according to the court,the intent to create one thing a pod account can not be used to support the intent to create another thing an express oral trust.the court also found that the allegations did not put wachovia on notice that it would be the trustee of the funds.

appellant contends that the trial court erred in sustaining the demurrer without leave to amend because she pleaded facts sufficient to survive a general demurrer.
