introduction 
in january,nadya suleman gave birth to octuplets.paul petersen filed a petition seeking appointment of a guardian of the octuplets estates,who would replace suleman as the person making financial decisions for the children.probate code section,subdivision a permits a petition for appointment of a guardian to be filed by a relative or other person on behalf of the minor.all further statutory references are to the probate code,unless otherwise specified.this writ proceeding was brought by suleman to challenge the probate court denial of her motion to dismiss petersen petition and the court appointment of the orange county social services agency ssa to conduct an investigation of the family finances.
the probate court erred by denying suleman motion to dismiss the petition.the petition should have been dismissed because petersen has neither pleaded ultimate facts demonstrating suleman has engaged in any financial misconduct,nor alleged any other information warranting court intervention in the suleman family finances.for these reasons,petersen has no standing under section,subdivision a and,even if he did,his petition is insufficient to survive a motion to dismiss.
this is an unprecedented,meritless effort by a stranger to a family to seek appointment of a guardian of the estates of the minor children.the petition allegations are insufficient to infringe on a parent civil rights or to rebut the presumption under california law that a parent is competent to manage the finances of his or her children.there is nothing in the petition that shows that the best interests of the children in the management of their finances are not being served by suleman.
we therefore grant suleman petition for writ relief and direct the probate court to grant suleman motion to dismiss petersen petition.for the reasons we explain post,we also vacate the probate court order for an investigation of the family finances.
statement of allegations and procedural history 
on january,suleman gave birth to eight children.
in may,petersen filed a petition seeking the appointment of a guardian for the estates of those children.petersen is the president of a minor consideration,a nonprofit corporation he describes as having been formed to give guidance and support to young performers,past,present and future.an important part of our mission is that we are dedicated to helping to preserve the money these children generate,so that they receive the appropriate share of their earnings and are not deprived of their legal share by their parents or others who may have a conflict with them may not be careful to protect the children financial interests.
petersen filed an amended petition in june.in an amended petition,petersen stated the appointment of a guardian was necessary or convenient because i am informed and believe that the minor children,all of whom have been the subject of intense public interest since their birth on january,are in need of a guardian of the estate in order to protect their potential business opportunities,possible lucrative endorsement s that may arise as a result of their unique status.the appointment of a guardian of the estate s will provide assurance that the children are not exploited.further,the guardian of the estate will be able to insure that each child is independently represented by an agent in connection with negotiating contracts for the ir services.i am informed and believe that their mother,nadya suleman,has already entered into contracts with to take and to sell video and with poleris photos to sell still photographs of the children.it is critically important that the prospective earnings of the children are adequately protected in accordance with california law.it is unknown whether the childrens mother has taken the appropriate steps to insure that the earnings of the minor children are placed into blocked accounts so that they may have access to said funds upon their reaching majority.i have recently discovered articles on the internet announcing that the mother,nadya suleman,has entered into an arrangement with a production company,eyeworks,for a documentary series filming the children lives.italics added.attached to the amended petition were printouts from three web sites reporting the agreement with eyeworks.
attached to the original petition were printouts containing photos and video links from the web site,dated between february and april.the petition identified these as p hotographs of the minor children.
in the original petition,petersen proposed linda rogers,a licensed private fiduciary,to be the guardian of the estates of the children.in the amended petition,petersen proposed terry hammond,an attorney licensed as a national certified guardian and the executive director of the national guardianship association,as the guardian of the children estates.petersen never proposed himself as guardian for the children estates.the identity and qualifications of a guardian are not issues before us in this proceeding.
suleman filed a motion to dismiss the amended petition,arguing petersen lacked standing,and asserting that the petition failed to allege sufficient facts suleman also filed an objection and opposition to the amended petition.petersen submitted copies of the following additional documents with his opposition to the motion to dismiss an from an executive of eyeworks usa,advising petersen counsel that it has come to my attention through an acquaintance that a production company,pilgrim films and television,has licensed all of the radar online footage of nadya suleman for use in a television program,and accusing pilgrim films and television apparently a competitor of eyeworks of potentially exploiting the octuplets and a check from american media operations,for,payable to suleman mother.the relevance of the latter document is a matter of complete speculation and its purported significance has never been explained.petersen opposition referred to an investigation by the california division of labor standards enforcement no evidence of such an investigation appears anywhere in the record.
suleman filed evidentiary objections to petersen opposition to the motion to dismiss and the documents offered by petersen.at the hearing on suleman motion to dismiss,the probate court failed to rule on those objections.after the hearing,the court took the motion to dismiss under submission.
on august,the probate court issued an order reading,in relevant part,as follows motion to dismiss first amended petition is denied.probate court section,subdivision a permits a relative or other person on behalf of the minor to file a petition for appointment of guardian.there is no statutory requirement such a petitioner must be an interested person or enjoy any type of relationship with the minor or minors named in the petition.as the paramount concern in guardianships is the best interests of children,the legislature has not restricted the class of individuals who may petition seeking to protect those interests.in issuing this ruling the court does not evaluate the underlying merits of the petition.any determination will occur as part of the orderly procedural process accorded all guardianship petitions.as provided by probate code section,subdivision a the court now invites ssa to conduct an investigation and file with the court a report and recommendation concerning the proposed guardianship of the estates of the named minors.original italics.
on august,suleman filed a petition for writ of,asking this court to issue a peremptory writ of mandate directing the probate court to vacate its august,order and to dismiss the amended petition.this court temporarily stayed the portion of the august order regarding the section report,and later issued an order to show cause why the requested writ should not issue.in the order to show cause,we directed the parties to respond to specific questions.after full briefing by the parties,we heard oral argument on december.
discussion 
of issues and holdings under section,subdivision a 
section,subdivision a permits a relative or other person on behalf of the minor to petition the court for appointment of a guardian of the minor estate.we consider in this opinion whether petersen is an other person on behalf of the minor s,and whether petersen amended petition pleaded sufficient ultimate facts regarding financial misconduct by suleman or other information warranting court intervention in the suleman family finances.as to both of those questions,the answer is no.we conclude petersen does not have standing under section,subdivision a and,even if he did,the allegations of his petition are insufficient.
standing and sufficiency of the test applies 
what showing of standing under section,subdivision a is necessary before a court may interfere with a parent financial decisionmaking regarding his or her children even if a person has standing under section,subdivision a whether he or she is a relative or other person on behalf of the allegations need to be pleaded in a petition to survive a motion to dismiss we conclude the answers to both questions depend on the same the petition states ultimate facts showing financial mismanagement or other allegations warranting court intervention in the family finances.
we analyze the law of guardianships,the state concern for the best interests of the children,a parent civil rights and liberty interest in the care and custody of his or her children,and the presumption that a parent is competent to care for his or her children.based on this analysis,we conclude a nonrelative must establish standing under section,subdivision a by showing ultimate facts warranting court intervention.these same concerns,rights,and responsibilities support a pleading requirement that a petition allege the same type of ultimate facts to support court intervention into the management of a family finances.
california law relevant to guardianship 
the welfare and institutions code creates a statutory scheme that grants broad powers for the exercise of a court jurisdiction to intervene in familial relationships,in order to protect the safety and of children.this case does not arise under the welfare and institutions code,however.as our supreme court has recently explained after the passage of the juvenile dependency statutes,probate guardianships have continued to provide an alternative placement for children who can not safely remain with their parents.citation.the differences between probate guardianships and dependency proceedings are significant.citation.probate guardianships are not initiated by the state,but by private parties,typically family members.they do not entail proof of specific statutory grounds demonstrating substantial risk of harm to the child,as is required in dependency proceedings.citations.unlike dependency cases,they are not regularly supervised by the court and a social services agency.no governmental entity is a party to the proceedings.it is the family members and the guardians who determine,with court approval,whether a guardianship is established,and thereafter whether parent and child will be reunited,or the guardianship continued,or an adoption sought under section.guardianship of ann cal th.
the probate code contains a statutory scheme by which guardians may be appointed to oversee the persons or estates of minors.under these statutes,certain persons may ask the court to appoint a guardian.in deciding whether a guardian of the estate should be appointed,the court is to be guided by what appears to be in the best interest of the proposed ward,taking into account the proposed guardian ability to manage and to preserve the estate as well as the proposed guardian concern for and interest in the welfare of the proposed ward,subd.e.for almost years,the california supreme court has made it perfectly clear that the primary consideration for the guidance of the court in appointing a guardian is the best interest of the child with respect to its temporal and its mental and moral welfare citation matter of allen cal,interpreting former civil code section.the best interests of the children remain of paramount importance to the court when only a guardian of the estate,not a guardian of the person,is sought.estate of rosin d.
in considering an application for appointment of a guardian,however,a court must also consider the right of a parent to the care and custody of his or her children.in re campbell cal.california law presumes a parent is competent to care for his or her own children.for almost a century,our state law has provided in accordance with the general presumption in favor of competency,a parent is presumed to be competent to discharge the duties of guardianship in the absence of an affirmative showing to the contrary.citations.i t is the settled rule of law in this state that the care,custody,and control of a minor child under the age of fourteen years must be committed to its parents,rather than to strangers,unless it be shown and found that the parent is unfit to perform the duties imposed by the relation or has,by abandonment of the child,forfeited the natural right to its custody.in short,in a contest for guardianship,as here,between a parent of a child and a stranger to the child,the paramount question is the competency of the parent to act as guardian,and,in the absence of a justifiable finding of the parent incompetency,the court must appoint the parent as guardian despite the fact that the material welfare of the child may perchance be enhanced by committing its care and custody to another person.citations.estate of akers cal.
the right to raise one own children as one sees fit is a matter of federal due process.it is cardinal with us that the custody,care and nurture of the child reside first in the parents,whose primary function and freedom include preparation for obligations the state can neither supply nor hinder.citation.and it is in recognition of this that these decisions have respected the private realm of family life which the state can not enter.prince massachusetts,italics added.
the concept of personal liberties and fundamental human rights entitled to protection against overbroad intrusion or regulation by government is not limited to those expressly mentioned in either the bill of rights or elsewhere in the constitution,but instead extends to basic values implicit in the concept of ordered liberty citation and to the basic civil rights of man.citation.among such basic liberties and rights not explicitly listed in the constitution are the right to marry,establish a home and bring up children citation the right to educate one children as one chooses citation and the right to privacy and to be let alone by the government in the private realm of family life.citations.city of young cal d,italics added.
other person on behalf of the minor 
the specific statute relied on by petersen identifies persons who may petition for appointment of a guardian of a minor as a relative or other person on behalf of the minor,subd.a.the statute does not use the terms any person or interested person,both of which have been defined and used in the california codes the phrase other person on behalf of the minor must have a definition that is different from either of these terms see in re crocker cal,acquaintance with proposed ward and familiarity with her financial affairs gave business manager of ward deceased husband standing to apply for appointment of guardianship of estate as a friend of ward.
what did the legislature mean when it used the phrase other person on behalf of the minor in section,subdivision a the probate code does not define the phrase,and there is no legislative history to assist us 
no published case has interpreted the phrase other person on behalf of the minor.in guardianship of olivia th,the court held that status as a nonparent did not preclude the appellant from filing a petition for appointment of a guardian of the person of a minor.we agree with this conclusion,but that case is not directly on point,because the appellant was the former domestic partner of the minor mother,had lived with the minor from her birth until she was two years old,and loved and supported the minor as her own daughter.id.at.the appellant in that case was a former member of the household and unquestionably a person closer to the minor than petersen is to the octuplets here.
therefore,in order to determine whether petersen has standing in this case,we must consider the statute words and purpose,and the principle of limiting court intervention in a parent civil rights unless an affirmative showing has been made to warrant such intervention.we also recognize the importance of the child best interest,which is emphasized throughout the california codes.t he courts of this state have adopted the common sense rule that the purpose of guardianship proceedings is to protect and promote the best interest of the child,and will not permit that purpose to be frustrated by the raising of technical jurisdictional objections the only real jurisdictional question is does the best interests of the child require that a guardian be appointed guardianship of smith d.
for standing,an other person on behalf of the minor seeking appointment of a guardian of the estate of a minor must provide the court with information showing financial mismanagement or other information sufficient to warrant court intervention.
with these principles in mind,in connection with a petition for appointment of a guardian of the estate of a minor,we hold an other person on behalf of the minor is a person who pleads ultimate facts demonstrating financial misconduct or alleges other information sufficient to warrant court intervention in the management of the minor money or other property.this test for standing is similar to the test requested by both petersen and amicus curiae,the american federation of television and radio artists,on petersen behalf.in his answer to suleman petition for a writ of,petersen stated his proposed test thus w hen some other person in the language of section,subdivision a acquires information indicating a parent abuse of child property or funds,it is crucial for the apparent abuse to be brought before the court for investigation even if the petitioner other person does not have personal knowledge of the facts.amicus curiae stated its suggested test as follows the ability of an informed,but unrelated third party advocate to petition for a guardianship is a critical safeguard in insuring that such exploited minors will be given the opportunity to be heard by the courts and that their own best interests will be distinguished from those of their parents.
at oral argument before this court,petersen counsel suggested the petition met his proposed test because the petition brought to the probate court attention the potential of suleman mismanagement of the children finances.petersen principally relies on suleman declaration in opposition to the petition for guardianship,in which suleman states,in relevant part i will ensure all applicable laws will be strictly adhered to on behalf of my children.i will ensure that any and all earnings s of all of my children are protected in accordance with the laws of the state of california.any mandatory financial accounts will be accurately maintained and managed in an appropriate manner i will comply with all california laws and regulations for all my children i will take all necessary steps to protect my children finances as well as prohibit any exploitation of my children by gloria allred,paul petersen or any other third parties.
petersen counsel also contended at oral argument that because suleman declared only that she will do everything properly in the future,not that she had done everything properly to this point,the probate court could presume that financial mismanagement may have occurred.petersen counsel argument completely misses the point a petition must contain ultimate facts,not speculation as to what circumstances might exist.it is the burden of the petitioner to plead those facts.petersen probate petition stands or falls on its own merits,and it is manifestly inadequate.
the test for standing under section,subdivision a which we employ here is consistent with and supported by discussions of related points in cases interpreting prior versions of section and other analogous statutes.guardianship of lee d,if enough is stated to inform the court that it should interfere,the petition for appointment of a guardian of the estate or the person is sufficient,and the duty then devolves upon the court to inform itself,and take such action as may seem proper considering former section in re lukasik d,the welfare of the children is the essential subject matter of the action and strangers are little more than informants to the court when they initiate the proceeding,presuming person requesting appointment of guardian has some information to provide to the court guardianship sought under provisions of former section et in re tilton,if there is sufficient information stated to inform the court that it should interfere for the protection of persons dependent upon it for protection,it is sufficient,and the duty is then devolved upon the court to inform itself,and take such action as may seem to be necessary and proper guardian appointed for incompetent adult pursuant to former code of civil procedure section.
suleman arguments for a narrower test are not persuasive.
suleman argues the test for standing should be narrower a person to qualify as an other person on behalf of the minor must,at a minimum,have a relationship,nexus or some personal knowledge regarding the necessity of a guardianship and the best interests of the minor.suleman offers no authority to support this proposed test,and fails to explain how this can be the correct test,in light of the purposes behind the guardianship statutes.the cases to which she cites requiring proof of a strong relationship between the proposed guardian and the minor arise in the context of deciding whether a particular person can be appointed as a guardian,not whether the person filing the petition for appointment of a guardian has standing to do so.see guardianship of olivia,supra,th guardianship of zachary th guardianship of phillip d.nothing in the law or experience establishes a person lacking a close personal relationship with the minor can not provide sufficient information to the court in a petition for appointment of a guardian of the estate of a minor.
suleman also argues that permitting a completely unconnected third party,such as petersen,to file a petition for appointment of a guardian will cause unwarranted harm to celebrities and public figures.she contends if this court allows random third parties the right to file petitions for guardianship,celebrities,entertainers,public figures and other parents will be forced to defend frivolous guardianships such as this case.any member of the general public,just by the mere filing of a guardianship petition,will have the right to confidential family information such as financial history,medical history,dental history and other confidential information regarding the minor and the minor family.parents and their children will be subject to unwarranted investigations by social services,court investigators,and discovery just because a third party has the ability to file a petition in probate court.the test we apply today adequately addresses these concerns.the mere filing of a petition is not enough to subject any or not a court intervention.but if the or not he or she has a close,personal relationship with the family in shown sufficient information to warrant the appointment of a guardian of the estate or the person of a minor,then the petition can survive a motion to dismiss.
suleman next argues petersen is not an interested party pursuant to section.contrary to suleman arguments,petersen does not have to be aggrieved or to have a direct interest in the outcome of the litigation.code of civil procedure section provides every action must be prosecuted in the name of the real party in interest,except as otherwise provided by statute.section,subdivision a states that an action for appointment of a guardian of the estate or the person of a minor does not need to be prosecuted in the name of the real party in interest,thus qualifying as an exception to code of civil procedure section.
