background 
mooney died on january.her will,which was executed in,devised certain specific items of real and personal property to her nieces and nephews,and devised the residue of her estate as follows i hereby give,devise and bequeath all of the rest,residue and remainder of my property,of whatever kind or nature and wheresoever situate,to my father,edward mooney,provided,however,if he should predecease me,or die as a result of the same sickness,accident or calamity that may befall me,then and in that event,i hereby give,devise and bequeath such rest,residue and remainder of my property in equal shares to my two sisters,lucile may scully and doris murphy.decedent father and both of her sisters predeceased her.
under the will,the provision for mooney sisters was not conditioned on their surviving her,and no alternate disposition was provided for in the event they did not survive her.under section,the antilapse statute,if a bequest is made to kindred,and is not conditioned on survivorship and is not subject to an alternate disposition,and the beneficiary predeceases the transferor,the bequest passes to the predeceased beneficiary issue.the only issue before us is how to divide mooney residual estate among the children of her two sisters.
decedent sister,doris murphy,is survived by four adult children thomas murphy,daniel murphy,edward murphy,and nancy danish.decedent sister,lucile may scully,is survived by three adult children anne scully,charles scully ii,and jean bordon.neither doris murphy nor lucile may scully left any issue of deceased children.jean bordon has disclaimed her interest in the estate in favor of her adult son,bryan jean bordon has no other children or issue of deceased children.
on november,anne scully and nancy danish,as administrators with will annexed,filed their petition for final distribution.the petition proposed that of the residue of the estate be distributed equally among doris four children each and of the estate be divided equally among lucile three children each.in an accompanying points and authorities,counsel for the administrators argued that the proper application of sections and required this distribution.
based on its independent reading of the antilapse statute,the court directed the administrators to file an amended proposed distribution providing that the residue be distributed equally among doris and lucile children each.an unopposed motion by anne scully,charles scully ii,and bryan bordon to set aside the court order was denied.
this timely appeal followed.
ii.discussion 
section,subdivision a provides in relevant part as follows i f a transferee fails or is treated as failing to survive the transferor the issue of the deceased transferee take in the transferee place in the manner provided in section.for purposes of section,transferee is limited to a person who is kindred of the transferor or kindred of a surviving,deceased,or former spouse of the transferor,subd.c.subdivision a does not apply if the instrument expresses a contrary intention or makes a substitute disposition,subd.b.
all of the conditions for the application of section are present here the testator attempted to devise the residue of her estate to her kin,the intended devisees predeceased the testator,and the will fails to evidence the testator intent in that event.in those circumstances,section replaces the decedent attempted devise to her sisters with a substitute disposition to her sisters descendants.the section applies to residuary beneficiaries,as well as other types of beneficiaries.estate of walker cal,construing predecessor statute.section is known as an antilapse statute because the attempted devises protected by it would otherwise lapse and the property would pass instead by intestacy antilapse statutes serve an extremely important function in the law,for they give effect to strong human impulses in some cases and,in others,to what are perceived as highly probable intentions.they prevent unintended disinheritance of one or more lines of descent,by presumptively creating an alternative or substitute gift in favor of the descendants of certain of the decedent predeceased relatives.halbach waggoner,the upc new survivorship and antilapse provisions albany.
this case focuses on the meaning of the statutory directive that the issue of the deceased transferee take in the transferee place in the manner provided in section.section provides as follows if a statute calls for property to be distributed or taken in the manner provided in this section,the property shall be divided into as many equal shares as there are living members of the nearest generation of issue then living and deceased members of that generation who leave issue then living,each living member of the nearest generation of issue then living receiving one share and the share of each deceased member of that generation who leaves issue then living being divided in the same manner among his or her then living issue.
the trial court construed sections and as requiring that each of the children of doris and lucile receive an equal share of the residual estate,whereas counsel for the administrators had argued for a distribution by representation in which the four children of doris would divide doris share and the three children of lucile would divide lucile interest.in support of its holding,the court cited a portion of estate of begley d.begley,in which the appellate court determined that the probate court had erred in distributing the interest devised to the heirs of viola davis by right of representation when,in fact,each of viola living by one child of viola,who predeceased begley,and one each by viola two other children,both of whom also predeceased entitled to an equal share since the grandchildren were the nearest generation of living issue to begley.id.at.
in our view,the probate court misconstrued this portion of the begley opinion.the testator in begley had three living siblings when the will was executed in,lulu,and john.begley,supra,d at.a fourth sibling,viola,was deceased when the will was executed.ibid.the will specified that begley estate was to be divided in four equal shares between the three siblings who were alive in and the heirs of viola.ibid.by the time of the testator death in,lena,lulu,and john had all died.lena had nine living children at that time,as well as four living issue of one deceased child and two living issue of a second deceased child.ibid.lulu and john had no issue.ibid.all three of viola children had predeceased begley,but four issue of these children survived,including two from one child,and one each from the other two deceased children.ibid.
the probate court in begley had divided the property as follows the two children born to one of viola three children were to split of viola interest in the estate,while each of her other two grandchildren were to receive of her interest.begley,supra,d at.the interest devised to lena was to be divided among lena children and grandchildren in accordance with former section now.begley,at.consistent with section,the distribution of lena interest among her children and grandchildren,as the issue of a predeceased devisee,was to be per stirpes,in eleven equal shares,with the share of one deceased child being divided among four living issue and the share of the other deceased child being divided among two living issue.begley,at.finally,the combined interest devised to lulu and john would also be distributed u
