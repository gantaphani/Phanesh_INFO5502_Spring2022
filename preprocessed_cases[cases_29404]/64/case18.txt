this case addresses the rules that should be applied in determining when a fiduciary of a trust is in defalcation while acting in a fiduciary capacity,and so may not be discharged from those debts in bankruptcy under a.the issue is one of first impression for this court.
we describe the facts as they are set forth in the decision of the massachusetts supreme judicial court sjc,as supplemented by the state probate court findings,in the underlying state litigation which gives rise to the judgment debt against carl baylis,the bankrupt debtor.
in,antonia quevillon,the settlor of the antonia quevillon trust,consulted baylis,an attorney,regarding the disposition of the apartment buildings she owned and operated.at that time,she was seventy years old and in poor health.she had no prior relationship with baylis.baylis drafted the trust into which she transferred her property.the property consisted of eight apartment buildings in massachusetts six in southbridge and two in worcester.baylis also drafted an exculpatory clause into the trust which stated that e ach trustee shall be liable only for his own willful misconduct or omissions in bad faith.
quevillon died on may.after her death,the trust was to provide income to her children for a period of twenty years at which point it would terminate,and the trust property was to be divided equally among the children of marcel quevillon,a son of the settlor.it did so terminate on may.
baylis and estelle ballard,daughter of the settlor and one of the income beneficiaries,were appointed they served from may to may.ballard agreed to manage the property for per week,and was paid from december through may,for a total of.not only did ballard derive her income from managing the buildings,but she also lived in one unit,and the trust paid her utilities and provided items such as cable television and a washing machine.baylis did not discuss any management fees with the settlor.by his own admission,he almost entirely abdicated his responsibilities as trustee to ballard,who alone actively managed the property.
the property appreciated substantially in value from in to million in,but paid the income beneficiaries only between and.the trustees had discretion to sell the trust property,and the trust did pay taxes and other expenses from the estate out of income derived from profits and the sale of a building in.the trust sold another building in.
the income beneficiaries were taxed on the capital gains but did not receive any actual distribution of money.concerned,the income beneficiaries met in with the to discuss the lack of income from the trust property.the trustees acknowledged that each of the income beneficiaries was owed.this represented the amount,with interest,of the difference between the actual distributions received and the amount on which each of the beneficiaries had been taxed since may.baylis told the beneficiaries that the trust was broke.at that meeting,it was decided that the property would be sold and the proceeds invested in government bonds.ballard did not object to selling the properties.
in late,the trustees began accepting offers on the remaining six buildings.by january,they had received an offer of from and young for two of the southbridge properties.the ramshorn realty trust,in the business of purchasing and selling apartment buildings since,made another offer,subject to the availability of financing,of million for the other four properties.ramshorn had recently sold substantial assets and had cash on hand to make a down payment.both purchasers paid deposits of.the six properties were later appraised for only million,significantly below the offers received of million.
ballard,however,desired to own the properties herself.she also intended that the properties not be sold out of the family.baylis,knowing this,presented the offers to her by letter dated february,and gave her an opportunity to match them,but it was soon evident that she could not finance the purchase.baylis tried to cajole her into agreeing to sell to the offerors.she then refused to sell the property and later testified that she had not considered the interests of either the income beneficiaries or the remaindermen in making that decision.
even though ballard had refused to sell the property,baylis forwarded purchase and sale agreements to the prospective buyers on may.the buyers signed the agreements by june,and put down additional deposits.baylis hoped to close on december,thinking that date would be advantageous for capital gains treatment.baylis signed the agreement ballard refused to sign.baylis did not go to probate court for instructions.
baylis instead responded to ballard on july,by proposing that ballard would receive the two properties for which had been offered,and would allow the other sale,to ramshorn,to proceed.he did this although the youngs had signed a purchase and sale agreement that he himself had prepared.ballard agreed to this proposal,subject to conditions.baylis did not inform the youngs of this development.he had appraisals done in anticipation of a license to sell the properties.the youngs learned of this proposed sale to ballard and sued the trust,the trustees,and baylis in his individual capacity.the lawsuit sought specific performance of the purchase and sale agreement,and it alleged that baylis had committed fraud.
the trustees were served with the suit on december,after being served,ballard then decided that she would not sell at all.as she put it,a sale would have left her out in the cold with nothing.the trust settled the case with the youngs and paid the legal expenses associated with the suit.the youngs case continued against baylis individually for fraud.the trust paid for defense of the case against baylis and to settle it.
baylis had prepared and filed a petition in probate and family court for a license to sell the property in december.the sjc later found,however,that baylis did not disclose to the court ballard refusal to consent to the sale 
baylis complaint,however,did not challenge ballard refusal at all.instead the complaint he presented to the court stated that ballard had submitted her resignation to baylis and that he had accepted it.the judge,not knowing that ballard was wrongfully refusing to consent,deferred judgment subject to obtaining ballard signature.baylis never followed up by informing ballard that she might be in breach of her fiduciary duty by not signing nor did he ask the judge to compel ballard to agree to the sale.because baylis did not file a petition explaining to the judge that the sale would be in the best interests of the beneficiaries and that ballard was improperly blocking the sale,he did not take the steps reasonably necessary to prevent ballard from breaching her duty.

the income beneficiaries filed suit in probate court against the trustees on may.the trust terminated on may,and the property was transferred to the remaindermen,who intervened in the suit.at that time,the estimated value of the property was million.the probate court found that the youngs and ramshorn were ready,willing and able to purchase the trust properties,and ballard and baylis breached their fiduciary duties by failing to sell the properties in.it also found that baylis knowingly allow ed ballard to breach her fiduciary duties without taking any action.
baylis claimed that the exculpatory clause he had drafted protected him.the probate court found that these breaches of fiduciary duty were in bad faith and therefore beyond the protection of the clause,and that even if the breaches were not in bad faith,the exculpatory clause was not enforceable because baylis,a,drafted the language,and the settlor was of ill health and had not been advised to seek the advice of outside counsel.
the probate court awarded judgments of to the beneficiaries and to the remaindermen on findings that the had violated their fiduciary duties the damages included both the net proceeds from the sales and the profits resulting from the planned investment in treasury bills.rutanen ballard,slip op.at,rutanen ballard,slip op.at,supplemental judgment.
on appeal,the massachusetts supreme judicial court affirmed the probate court decision,but solely on the ground that baylis acted negligently and was not shielded by the exculpatory clause.rutanen,at.as to the probate court finding of bad faith,the sjc found that the evidence is more questionable and declined to rely on it in affirming the decision.id.at.
faced with the judgments against him,baylis filed for bankruptcy.the trust income beneficiaries,as creditors,took the position that their judgment against baylis was because the debt resulted from baylis defalcation while acting in a fiduciary capacity under a.in addition,they asserted the debts resulted from willful and malicious injury by the debtor to the property of another.id.a.the parties stipulated that the state probate court findings of fact were binding,except for the finding that baylis acted in bad faith.
both sides moved for summary judgment.although styled as summary judgment,it is evident they expected the court to resolve the case on the stipulated record.the bankruptcy court held that the probate court finding that baylis had acted in bad faith had no preclusive effect because it was not essential to the judgment and had not been ruled on by the supreme judicial court.rutanen baylis.it also found baylis conduct did not amount to defalcation.id.at.the district court disagreed,holding that baylis was bound by the probate court bad faith finding,and as such had committed defalcation.rutanen baylis,slip op.at.this court found that the bad faith finding did not have a preclusive effect because the sjc had refused to affirm on that ground,and remanded the case to the district court.rutanen baylis in re baylis,cir.on remand,on for summary judgment,the district court found that baylis conduct amounted to defalcation under a,and that a was inapplicable.rutanen baylis.baylis appeals the a determination against him the plaintiffs the a finding.
because this case was decided on for summary judgment,our review of the bankruptcy court decision is de novo.see piccicuto dwyer,cir.the standard by which to measure defalcation of a fiduciary duty for purposes of a is a legal question,in any event,to which we give de novo review.the parties have agreed that they are bound by the probate court findings of fact.
meaning of defalcation of a fiduciary duty,a 
section of the bankruptcy code contains a number of exceptions to discharge of debt.section a provides that 
a a discharge does not discharge an individual debtor from any debt 
for fraud or defalcation while acting in a fiduciary capacity,embezzlement,or larceny.
emphasis added.this provision has been part of the bankruptcy act since.see an act to establish a uniform system of bankruptcy through the united states,ch.clxxvi,stat,repealed an act to establish a uniform system of bankruptcy throughout the united states,ch.ix,stat,repealed excepting only debts arising from defalcation as a public officer.an exception to discharge should be strictly construed.gleason thaw.exceptions to discharge are narrowly construed in furtherance of the bankruptcy code fresh start policy century balfour real estate menna in re menna,cir see grogan garner,d endorsing the fresh start policy.
within this context,certain rules are clear about the availability of the exception 
the burden of proof to establish defalcation is on the creditor,given the fresh start policy.in re menna,at a claimant must prove that his claim comes squarely within an exception enumerated in bankruptcy code a see also palmacci umpierrez,cir 
the creditor must show defalcation by a preponderance of the evidence.grogan,at.
the exception to discharge applies to fiduciaries only while they are acting in a fiduciary capacity 
inherent in defalcation is the requirement that there be a breach of fiduciary duty if there is no breach,there is no defalcation.
in order to avoid redundancy,defalcation must mean something other than fraud and different from willful and malicious injury,a.
defalcation is to be measured objectively.cent.hanover bank trust herbst,cir.
that then leaves the question of the standard to measure when a fiduciary breach is a defalcation.the dictionary definitions of defalcation are of limited assistance.black law dictionary ed defines defalcation as,loosely,the failure to meet an obligation a nonfraudulent default.id.at.the oxford english dictionary ed defines defalcation as,a monetary deficiency through breach of trust by one who has the management or charge of funds a fraudulent deficiency in money matters.id.at.the oxford dictionary of english etymology onuns,tells us that the word derives from the earlier defalk which survives in legal use.is diminution,reduction,curtailment,defective,failure fraudulent monetary deficiency.id.at.the etymology of the word thus shows the term historically has covered both fraudulent and acts our view is that not every breach of a fiduciary duty amounts to defalcation.
the case law in this area is far from a seamless whole.more than sixty years ago,judge learned hand carefully equivocal opinion in herbst held that there could be defalcation even in the absence of deliberate wrongdoing.recognizing the ambiguities in the term,he noted 
all we decide is that when a fiduciary takes money upon a conditional authority which may be revoked and knows at the time that it may,he is guilty of a defalcation though it may not be a fraud,or an embezzlement,or perhaps not even a misappropriation.
roughly,three interpretive camps have been established as to the standard for measuring defalcation.the first is that an innocent mistake can constitute defalcation.see republic of rwanda uwimana in re uwimana,cir tudor oaks.cochrane in re cochrane,cir same lewis scott in re lewis,cir failure to account fully for money received.the second is that negligence by the fiduciary is required but no more.see antlers builders supply storie in re storie,failure to account.the third is that at least recklessness by the fiduciary is required.see schwager fallas in re schwager,cir breach of duty to manage meyer rigdon,cir same carlisle cashway,johnson in re johnson,cir failure to account herbst,at for a failure to account,defalcation must be due to a known breach of the duty,and not to mere negligence or mistake.the different camps not only exist between the different circuits,but sometimes within the bankruptcy courts of the same circuit,including this one.compare sullivan sullivan in re sullivan,recklessness required,considering breach of duty to manage,with hoff carroll in re carroll,negligence or ignorance enough for failure to account.the types of duty which the fiduciary has violated appear to influence the choice of standard regardless of the broad language sometimes used.
the present range of interpretations of defalcation among the circuits,from innocent mistake to a civil recklessness standard,does not,in our view,adequately capture congress intended meaning of the term in a.instead,we find that a defalcation requires some degree of fault,closer to fraud,without the necessity of meeting a strict specific intent requirement.our view is based on both the structure of a and the fresh start policy.
a reading of as a whole indicates that most of the exceptions to discharge in bankruptcy are in place for one of two basic reasons.first,bankruptcy may not be used to avoid the payment of certain types of debts,the repayment of which are important for policy reasons.exceptions to discharge falling in this category include debts for taxes or customs duties,id.a,or debts incurred to pay tax,id.a alimony and child support payments,id.a fines,penalties or forfeitures to the government,id.a educational loans made or insured by the government or a nonprofit institution,id.a orders of restitution,id.a court fees,id.a and support owed under state law and enforceable under the social security act,id.a.the level of fault of the debtor has no bearing on these exceptions the exception turns on the type of debt.
it is arguable that defalcation by a fiduciary fits into this type of debt is,that congress intended to reinforce the high standard of care owed by fiduciaries by making debts for defalcation.that reading is,we think,an un
