factual and procedural background 
gina and janice are the children of theodore and josephine citta,now deceased in,theodore and josephine established the revocable trust agreement of theodore citta and josephine citta living trust,which they amended in,and.upon the death of both theodore and josephine,or in the event neither was willing or able to serve as trustee,janice and gina were to serve as.theodore died on december,and in accordance with the terms of the living trust,the trust estate was divided into two separate trusts the irrevocable theodore citta and josephine citta family trust family trust and the revocable josephine citta trust survivor trust.the survivor trust was established for josephine sole benefit,and consisted of her separate property and her interest in her and theodore community estate.the balance of the trust estate was allocated to the family trust.upon josephine death,all remaining assets of the survivor trust were to be distributed to the beneficiaries of the family trust as follows to janice and to gina.
in,josephine executed a fourth amendment to the survivor trust fourth amendment,eliminating gina as a beneficiary and naming janice as the sole successor trustee.in,josephine executed a fifth amendment to the survivor trust fifth amendment,designating janice as her acting and sole successor trustee.
in june,gina filed a petition asking the court to confirm her appointment as an acting of the living trust,as amended in,and,based on josephine alleged inability to care for herself or act as trustee,and janice alleged undue influence over her.according to gina,following theodore death,janice began to progressively isolate josephine to the point that gina no longer had contact with her mother,had complete control over josephine including her finances,and was acting as the sole trustee of the trust.
josephine objected to the petition.while she admitted that janice assisted her,she denied janice had isolated her from gina or that janice had complete control over her or her finances.she also denied that she was unable to care for herself or act as trustee,or that janice was acting as the sole trustee.in addition,she alleged that the survivor trust had been amended in fourth amendment and fifth amendment and,as amended,made no provision for gina to serve as trustee,alternate trustee or successor trustee copies of the fourth and fifth amendments were attached as exhibits to josephine objections,which were served on gina counsel.
gina did not challenge the fourth or fifth amendments.rather,she entered into a settlement agreement,which was adopted as an order of the court in august.in the settlement agreement,josephine represented that she was the sole acting trustee of the family trust,and in her capacity as such and on behalf of all successor trustees,agreed not to sell,encumber,lease,rent,transfer,or otherwise take any action affecting any real property of the family trust without prior notice to gina and janice,as provided herein.
josephine died on october.
on november,janice provided gina with two notification s by trustee as required under section one for the family trust and one for the survivor trust.
on march,gina filed the underlying verified petition,seeking to invalidate the fourth and fifth amendments to the survivor trust based on lack of capacity and undue influence,a declaration that defendants be deemed to have predeceased josephine pursuant to section,subdivision a,imposition of a constructive trust,and damages.the petition alleged the following causes of action lack of capacity first,undue influence second,breach of fiduciary duty third,fraud fourth,financial abuse of an elder fifth,declaratory relief sixth,imposition of a constructive trust seventh,and mistake eighth.
the first cause of action alleged josephine lacked the requisite mental capacity at the time she executed the fourth amendment.the second cause of action alleged the fourth and fifth amendments were the product of defendants undue influence over josephine.the third cause of action alleged defendants breached their fiduciary duties to josephine by inducing her to execute the fourth and fifth amendments.the fourth cause of action alleged defendants falsely,and with the intent to deceive,represented to josephine that they would hold and administer her property for her and misrepresented the nature and terms of the fourth and fifth amendments.the fifth cause of action alleged that defendants used their influence to induce josephine to execute the fourth and fifth amendments and took or assisted in taking josephine property.the sixth cause of action sought a declaration that defendants predeceased josephine pursuant to section,subdivision a,based on the alleged acts that are the basis of the first through fourth causes of action.the seventh cause of action sought imposition of a constructive trust.the eighth cause of action alleged josephine was mistaken as to the nature and extent of her assets at the time she executed the fourth and fifth amendments.
in their verified answer to the petition,defendants denied the material allegations of wrongdoing and asserted various affirmative defenses,including that each of the causes of action alleged in the petition were barred by the applicable statutes of limitation,principles of res judicata,and the doctrine of laches.
defendants moved for summary judgment on the grounds the causes of action were barred by the applicable statutes of limitation,principles of res judicata,and the doctrine of laches.gina responded by filing a verified objection to defendants memorandum of points and authorities in support of their motion.she did not file any separate statement in opposition to the motion,dispute any of the undisputed material facts,or present any of her own additional disputed facts.the trial court granted defendants motion for summary judgment,finding the first and second causes of action for lack of capacity and undue influence were barred by principles of collateral estoppel,and the remaining causes of action were barred by the applicable statutes of limitations.it did not reach the issue of laches.in considering the motion,the trial court appears to have treated the factual allegations set forth in gina verified objection as a declaration in opposition to the motion for summary judgment.
