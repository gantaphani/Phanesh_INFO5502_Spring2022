statement of the case 
petitioner and respondent santa clara county public guardian robert cecil,conservator for kathryn mcdowell,filed a petition for,et requesting authority to revoke mcdowell existing will and execute a trust and a new will with a different beneficiary.the court granted the petition.objector and appellant poonsri ann netcharu,who was a beneficiary under the existing will,appeals from the order.
we reverse the order and remand for reconsideration.
background 
petitioner was appointed temporary conservator for mcdowell on august,and permanent conservator on january.he filed the petition on march.in seeking permission to execute a new will and trust,petitioner alleged that mcdowell existing will,executed on september,was invalid because mcdowell lacked testamentary capacity at the time and because the will was the product of undue influence that the two named beneficiaries exerted over mcdowell.he sought to name guide dogs for the blind as the sole beneficiary under the new documents.
in support of the petition,petitioner alleged that in,mcdowell,an elderly retired woman,allowed reza fatipoor and parvis talsocaiman to live with her in her house,and in exchange,they agreed to take care of her.in june,mcdowell was hospitalized for a hip fracture,and upon her release,hospital staff notified adult protective services aps due to concerns about her care.thereafter,mcdowell mental faculties started to decline.aps also became concerned about her care and suspected financial abuse by fatipoor and talsocaiman.as a result,it requested that the public guardian establish a conservatorship.in august,the public guardian was appointed temporary conservator.
the petition further alleged that in september,fatipoor and his friend objector took mcdowell to three different bouman,james arnold,and meyer the purpose of drafting various legal documents.bouman declined to prepare a power of attorney due to concerns about mcdowell mental capacity.attorney arnold,who had done legal work for mcdowell in the past,declined to prepare estate planning documents.however,attorney sher prepared the september will,which named fatipoor and objector as executors and sole beneficiaries.
last,the petition alleged that in october,mcdowell went to the emergency room because of pain.on november,paul heidenrich from the public guardian office visited mcdowell home and found her.she was admitted to the hospital in an unresponsive physical state and the next day transferred to a skilled nursing facility.in january,doctor gary steinke,submitted a report,in which he opined that mcdowell was suffering from advanced dementia.
objector objected to the petition.she denied that mcdowell lacked testamentary capacity and also denied that she induced mcdowell to name her a beneficiary by means of fraud,duress,menace,or undue influence.she asserted that they were friends,and she cared for and assisted mcdowell 
at a bench trial,petitioner presented evidence to show that mcdowell was incompetent to make a will in september.petitioner also presented evidence to show that fatipoor and objector harbored an evil intent and conspired to take advantage of mcdowell,obtain control of her assets,and induce her to name them as beneficiaries.then,after mcdowell executed the will,fatipoor and objector mistreated and neglected mcdowell,whose condition deteriorated significantly.prior to and at trial,petitioner further argued that under section,fatipoor and objector were statutorily disqualified from receiving under the september will because they were mcdowell care custodian s and are presumed to have exerted undue influence 
after trial,the court overruled objector objection and entered an order granting the petition.the court rejected petitioner claim that mcdowell lacked the testamentary capacity in september.the court found no evidence that objector was evil or that she used duress,menace,or fraud to induce mcdowell to execute the will.however,the court found that objector was a care custodian and had failed to rebut the presumption of undue influence.accordingly,the court found that mcdowell will was ineffective as to objector.the court then turned to the question of who should be the beneficiaries under a new will and trust.the court was not convinced that mcdowell would want to leave her entire estate to guide dogs for the blind.based on her expressions of interest in that organization and her acts of generosity toward the homeless throughout her life,the court authorized petitioner to distribute mcdowell estate in equal shares to guide dogs for the blind,inn vision,and the emergency housing consortium.the court considered but declined to reinclude objector as a beneficiary.although the court accepted evidence and a stipulation that as of january,mcdowell lacked capacity to make a will,it accepted the testimony of mcdowell former attorney,peter stern,who related conversations he had had with mcdowell in spring,in which she indicated that she did not want to leave her estate to the people named in her will.
objector contentions on appeal 
objector claims that the order granting the petition must be reversed because the petition failed to allege that she was a care custodian and as such a disqualified beneficiary.on the merits,objector claims the court erred in finding that she was a care custodian and that she failed to rebut the presumption of undue influence.she claims the record establishes a lack of undue influence as a matte of law.last,objector claims the court erred in excluding her as a beneficiary under the new will and trust 
the defective petition 
objector contends that because the petition failed to allege that she was disqualified as a care custodian under section or even mention the applicable statutes,the petition failed to provide adequate notice that disqualification was an issue and failed to properly place that issue before the court.thus,she claims the court could not properly rely on that theory,and its order must be reversed.
the petition is silent concerning the disqualification theory under section.however,we note that petitioner raised and devoted most of his trial brief to the issue.there,petitioner reiterated his accusation that fatipoor and objector had mistreated and taken advantage of mcdowell.he further noted that in ruling on the petition,the court must consider all relevant circumstances,and a beneficiary disqualification as a care custodian is a relevant consideration.in particular,petitioner asserted generally that r evocation of the previous will is in the conservatee best interest,given her lack of legal capacity at the time that the will was executed and the likelihood that the will was procured by undue influence and as a result of elder financial abuse.petitioner more specifically argued that a new estate plan was appropriate because fatipoor and objector were disqualified under section and could not rebut the presumption of undue influence.in other words,a new will was necessary because the existing will would fail for lack of qualified beneficiaries.
before trial,objector moved to exclude evidence on the care custodian disqualification issue.in opposition,petitioner reiterated that under the statute,the court should consider all relevant circumstances,including whether the beneficiaries under the existing will are disqualified.in denying objector motion,the court stated,i looking at the original petition,and although it not crystal clear exactly what theories the petitioner is going to proceed on,i think it broad enough to cover this area because they are asking for revocation of the prior will based on particular code sections on the grounds of abuse and undue influence.i think that would cover it.
notwithstanding the failure to allege disqualification in the petition,we find that objector had sufficient notice that petitioner intended to rely on that theory.we observe that after objector motion was denied,she did not request that the petition be amended or seek a continuance to prepare evidence and a defense against the disqualification claim.rather,she filed a supplemental trial brief,disputing the claim and offering evidence and argument to show that she was not a care custodian.under the circumstances,we decline to reverse the order based solely on the allegedly defective petition.simply put,we do not find that petitioner failure to include allegations in the petition was prejudicial.this is especially so because,as we discuss below,the care custodian issue involves application of the law to essentially undisputed facts.
we now turn to objector main substantive challenge to the court order.
applicable principles and standard of review 
under sections through,a superior court may,upon the petition of any interested person and after consideration of all relevant circumstances,exercise its discretion to authorize or require a conservator to take a variety of different actions affecting the conservatee estate in essence the statute permits the court to substitute its judgment for that of a conservatee.conservatorship of hart d.hart see estate of christiansen d.discussing the common law doctrine of substituted judgment,later codified in et.t he question in proceedings is not what the conservatee would do but rather what a reasonably prudent person in the conservatee position would do.hart,supra,d at.we review the trial court order granting substituted judgment for abuse of discretion.id.at.
the court finding that objector was disqualified as a care custodian 
objector contends the court erred in finding that she was a care custodian and thus presumptively disqualified as a beneficiary under mcdowell existing will.
petitioner claims that the care custodian issue is not cognizable in this appeal because objector did not appeal from the right order.he notes that she appealed from the order granting the petition filed on july.according to petitioner,however,the care custodian issue was resolved in a separate judgment entered on march.thus,because objector did not appeal from that judgment,she,in effect,waived her claim.
on july,the court filed an order granting the petition and authorizing petitioner to revoke the existing will and execute a new will and trust with three beneficiaries.on july,objector filed a request for a statement of decision.on september,objector filed a notice of appeal.later,on december,the court issued its statement of decision among other things,the court explained the factual basis for finding that objector was a care custodian.under the circumstances,we conclude that objector claim concerning the court finding is cognizable in this appeal because that finding is encompassed in the order filed on july.
conversely,we do not find that the court resolved the care custodian issue in a separate order filed on march.that document,which was prepared by petitioner,is denominated judgment after bench trial.it does not refer to the court previous order granting the petition or to objector currently pending appeal.it grants petitioner petition vacates and sets aside the purported will of the conservatee dated january,and awards costs to petitioner.
simply put,we do not know quite what to make of this document.it purports to grant a petition that had already been granted in an order that petitioner concedes was appealable and that was already the subject of a pending appeal.ordinarily,a notice of appeal divests the trial court of jurisdiction,at least insofar as the subject and merits of the order are concerned.see takahashi fish game com.cal d,revd.on other grounds in torao takahashi fish and game commission.an appeal removes the jurisdiction of the trial court over the subject matter of the judgment or order appealed from,including all issues going to the validity or correctness of such judgment or order see also witkin,cal.procedure ed.appeal,and cases cited there.second,this judgment erroneously dates mcdowell existing will,then vacates and sets it aside,even though petitioner argued below that the proceedings were not a will contest and,more importantly,the original order authorized petitioner to revoke that will.nevertheless,insofar as this judgment represents an order awarding costs,it was separately appealable.norman krug real estate investments,praszker d.
even if we assume for purposes of argument that objector should have appealed from the judgment,rather than,or in addition to,the july,order,the procedural confusion from two separate orders granting the same petition would lead us to exercise our discretion and,in the interest of justice,deem objector notice of appeal to have been from both the initial order and this subsequent judgment.molien kaiser foundation hospitals cal d,exercising discretion in similar fashion.
ii.the factual basis for the court finding 
in its oral pronouncement and statement of decision,the court found that objector and mcdowell became friends around february,after fatipoor introduced them.objector visited mcdowell and sometimes brought her coffee and food.in june,mcdowell was hospitalized for a broken hip.objector did not visit her there,but after mcdowell release,she visited mcdowell often and regularly brought meals.in this regard,the court made special note of the fact that after mcdowell was hospitalized in november,objector submitted a bill for the meals she had provided 
the court further found that over time,objector also started taking care of mcdowell personal needs,bathing,hygiene.the testimony on exactly what was done and when it was accomplished is not crystal clear.there is some variance in the deposition and trial testimony of netcharu.at certain times,the extensive care of mcdowell personal care appears to have begun during the summer months.at other times,netcharu testified that the changing of diapers and bathing only commenced after the september will was executed.the court finds that netcharu began taking care of the personal needs of mcdowell during the summer of.
the court found that when objector and fatipoor brought mcdowell to the attorney who drafted the will,a doctor friend of the attorney happened to be there.at the attorney request,the doctor privately interviewed mcdowell for to minutes to gauge her testamentary capacity.she told him she was dependent upon her two helpers for medical care,home maintenance,food and clothing.she said she was leaving her money to them because they were assisting her.
the court further found that d uring the period of time after the will was written netcharu was bathing,dressing and changing diapers of mcdowell.mcdowell physical condition was deteriorating rapidly and netcharu was attempting to get medical aid for mcdowell.she also called the public guardian to alert them to her deteriorating condition but did not immediately hear from them.netcharu on her own took mcdowell to the doctor.netcharu with the minor aid from fathipour,was the principal individual concerned with mcdowell condition.
given these findings,the court concluded that when mcdowell executed the september will,she was a dependent adult,and objector was a care custodian within the meaning of section the court observed,netcharu was well meaning and did form a friendship with mcdowell between february and august,even though she was unable to visit her during her hospitalization in june.in essence,netcharu knew mcdowell for or months before she arrange d an appointment with the first attorney.the evidence demonstrated that during the summer months,ms.netcharu became mc dowell care custodian albeit unsalaried by providing food and personal services.
iii.the definition of care custodian 
to evaluate the court conclusion,we first discuss who qualifies as care custodian.section,subdivision a adopts the definition of care custodian in welfare and institutions code section.that statute provides,in relevant part,care custodian means an administrator or an employee of any of the following public or private facilities or agencies,or persons providing care or services for elders or dependent adults,including members of the support staff and maintenance staff y any other protective,public,sectarian,mental health,or private assistance or advocacy agency or person providing health services or social services to elders or dependent adults.welf.inst.code.
two cases have dealt with the meaning of care custodian and the validity of a donative transfer to a person who provided care for a dependent adult.
in shinkle,supra,th,d,a volunteer ombudsman named thompson met shinkle,an elderly woman,in the care facility where he worked.over a period,he helped her with her personal financial matters and learned about her assets.during this time,she told him a few times that she wanted to leave her estate to him.he replied that she would have to do something to make it happen.ultimately,thompson was transferred to a different facility and stopped being shinkle ombudsman.however,shinkle asked him to visit,and he started doing so,even though it was inappropriate for an ombudsman to maintain contact with a former client.some time later,shinkle returned home.thompson continued to see her there and help with financial matters.during this period,he told her it was okay to leave her estate to him because he was no longer her ombudsman.he arranged for a nonattorney estate planner to visit,and all three met together to discuss an estate plan.thereafter,shinkle signed trust documents that made thompson the successor trustee,thompson wife an alternate successor trustee,and thompson children the trust beneficiaries if thompson died before shinkle.id at,d.after shinkle died,the public administrator and a relative of shinkle challenged the trust,claiming that thompson was a care custodian and thus a disqualified beneficiary.the trial court agreed and voided the trust.id.at,d.
on appeal this court affirmed.we concluded that thompson came within the statutory definition of care custodian,which covers administrators,employees,and support and maintenance staff of public and private facilities and agencies,including t he office of the care ombudsman.shinkle,supra,th at,d,quoting welf,subd.s.we rejected thompson claim that he lost that status when he ceased being shinkle ombudsman and began to see her and help her simply as a friend.shinkle,supra,th at,d.we observed that but for the ombudsman program and thompson position as shinkle ombudsman,he would not have met her or learned about her personal and financial circumstances or gained her trust.we further noted that their relationship of trust continued until shinkle death,and during that time thompson remained a certified ombudsman.id.at,d.under the circumstances,we held that although thompson may have stopped being shinkle assigned ombudsman,his status as a care custodian continued until she died.id.at,d.we reasoned that if his status were allowed to change,then an ombudsman could inherit from a former resident after that person was discharged from the facility,thereby circumventing the purpose of section.id.at,d.indeed,individuals like thompson could avoid the prohibitions of section merely by changing their assignments,changing jobs,or ceasing to provide volunteer services in order to benefit from a donative transfer from someone with whom they previously had a fiduciary relationship.such a construction would be contrary to the purpose of section,which is to prevent care custodians from taking advantage of their elderly charges and obtaining gifts through undue influence.ibid.moreover,we observed that there was no limiting language in the pertinent statutes that distinguished between activity undertaken by an ombudsmen in their role as ombudsmen and activities undertaken by ombudsmen,the population they serve,on their own time or outside their role as ombudsmen.if we were to permit different rules to apply,depending upon whether an ombudsman was acting within or outside of his or her role as ombudsman,we would invite just the kind of abuse that occurred in this case.id.at,d.in this regard,we noted that b oth the program director and another volunteer ombudsman testified that thompson conduct in befriending shinkle,paying her bills and doing her banking was inappropriate for an ombudsman.these were the very activities that allowed thompson to gain shinkle trust and information about her financial affairs.ibid.
in conservatorship of davidson th,d davidson,dolores davidson executed a will in.it revoked her prior will,which left her estate to her cousin morken,and instead left it to a man named gungl,whom she and her husband had befriended in.after davidson husband died,her relationship to gungl and gungl partner holtz strengthened,and gungl became her primary provider of transportation.in,davidson was hospitalized,and after she returned home,her physical and mental condition deteriorated.consequently,gungl and holtz assumed greater responsibility for her care,shopping and cooking for her and taking her wherever she needed to go.in,davidson executed a power of attorney for gungl,and he assumed responsibility for her mail,bills,and banking.in,gungl had an estate planner talk to davidson,and she said she wanted to leave everything to gungl.the planner prepared various documents,and in,davidson executed a trust and new will.they named gungl as successor trustee and sole beneficiary and made several specific gifts,including one to morken.after davidson died,morken husband challenged the trust,claiming,among other things,that davidson lacked testamentary capacity in,the trust was the product of gungl undue influence,and gungl was a care custodian and thus a disqualified beneficiary.the trial court rejected all three claims.id.at,d.
on appeal,morken husband claimed that gungl care and services rendered him a care custodian under the general provision of section,which refers to persons providing care or services for elders or dependent adults,and under the more specific catchall category for a ny other private person providing health services or social services to elders or dependent adults,subd.y,italics added davidson,supra,th.at,d.
the appellate court rejected this claim.the court opined that that interpretation of the statutory language was overbroad because it would disqualify virtually any nonrelated individual who provides care to a dependent adult,no matter how intimately and personally connected they might be.the court further pointed out that the interpretation would cover not just the provision of health care or social services,but such acts as simply cooking for an elderly person,driving a individual to the bank or doctor,or going shopping for them.davidson,supra,th at,d.according to the court,this view does violence not only to traditional principles of private charity and contemporary societal structures and relationships,but to the explicit language of the relevant statutes.ibid.noting the extensive list of public agencies and private professional organizations and individuals enumerated in welfare and institutions code section,the court observed that the statute focused on the occupational provision of health and social services and concluded that the assistance gungl and holtz,errands,chores,and household tasks such as cooking,gardening,driving,shopping,banking can not be equated with the provision of health services and social services specified by the subject statutes as constituting custodial care.id.at,d.moreover,the court opined that t he kind of personal,nonprofessional care provided by gungl to davidson may be brought within the scope of the subject statutes only by severely editing the statutory language.id.at,d.
in addition,the court found that morken husband expansive interpretation was inconsistent with the legislative history of section,which reflected a legislative intent to place limitations on the ability of professional care custodians to receive donative transfers from elderly testators.davidson,supra,th at,d,italics in original.the court found that t his intent is not advanced by imposing burdensome technical and procedural barriers on the ability of elderly individuals to recognize and reward services performed for them in their declining years by close personal friends,intimates and companions.it would be both tragic and ironic if the statute were interpreted so broadly as to result in effectively punishing such individuals for the acts of care and companionship they provided to the aging.ibid.
the court also discussed shinkle,supra,th,d,and found it to be both distinguishable and instructive.davidson,supra,th at,d.it was distinguishable because unlike thompson relationship with shinkle,gungl relationship with davidson did not arise from a preexisting professional and fiduciary relationship,such as being her ombudsman,a category expressly included in the statutory definition of care custodians.given shinkle,the court held that the statute bars donative transfers to individuals who have assumed the role of care custodian to a dependent adult incidental to the professional or occupational provision of health or social services to that dependent adult,rather than in connection with a personal or familial relationship and whose personal relationship,if any,with the dependent adult is entirely incidental,secondary to,and derived from the preexisting professional or occupational connection.by the same token,we hold that when an individual becomes what is in effect a care custodian of a dependent adult as a direct result of a preexisting genuinely personal relationship rather than any professional or occupational connection with the provision of health or social services,that individual should not be barred by section from the benefit of donative transfers unless it can otherwise be shown that the subject transfer was the result of undue influence,fraud or duress.id.at,d,italics in original.
the court explained that t he controlling question is whether the relationship between the caregiver and the dependent adult arose out of the provision of health or social services,or whether instead the provision of care developed naturally from a preexisting genuinely personal relationship.in making this determination,several factors are relevant and must be considered.these include the length of time the individuals had a personal relationship before assuming the roles of caregiver and recipient the closeness and authenticity of the personal relationship and whether any money was paid for the provision of care.each of these factors must be weighed in analyzing whether an individual is a care custodian for purposes of section,even if none by itself is ultimately controlling in making that determination.davidson,supra,th at,d,italics added.
last,the court rejected morken husband claim that gungl became a professional or occupational caregiver because he received some compensation for his services davidson,supra,th at,d.however,the trial court found that the money paid to gungl was for the direct benefit of davidson herself and covered gungl own expenses for her care.the appellate court found substantial evidence to support that finding.id.at,d.moreover,the court observed that there was no evidence gungle had ever provided health or social services to anyone.rather,he was a professional musician and an individual helping out a very old and dear friend in her time of need.id.at,d.
given davidson and shinkle,we conclude that the evidence here does not support the court finding that objector was a care custodian.objector was not a professional or occupational caregiver,and there is no evidence she generally offered care services to the elderly and dependent adult population as a paid or volunteer provider.nor is there evidence that objector relationship with mcdowell grew out of a preexisting professional or occupational connection or that objector and mcdowell had a quid pro quo arrangement,under which mcdowell reasonably expected objector to provide care,and objector reasonably expected something in return.rather,the court found that objector was a friend.the record reveals only that objector and mcdowell met and became friends,objector visited mcdowell and brought her food and coffee,and as mcdowell physical condition deteriorated,objector visited more regularly,brought meals,took her to the hospital,called the public guardian on her behalf,and provided more intimate personal care,like bathing her,washing her hair,and changing her diapers.in short,we can find no material basis to distinguish this case from davidson.
petitioner makes the same claim raised by morken husband in davidson objector comes within the general definition of care custodian in section,individuals providing care or services for elders or dependent adults and the catchall,any other protective,public,sectarian,mental health,or private assistance or advocacy agency or person providing health services or social services to elders or dependent adults,subd.y.the davidson court rejected the identical claim,and so do we.
petitioner acknowledges davidson but urges us not to follow it.first,he distinguishes davidson on the ground that objector relationship with mcdowell was short compared with that of gungl and,months versus decades.the distinction is undeniable,but,in our view,it does not make a difference in determining whether objector was a care custodian.although the davidson court emphasized the length of gungl relationship with davidson,it did not invest it with controlling importance or set a minimum duration for a friendship.rather,the court noted the closeness and authenticity of the relationship and focused on whether the giving of care was incidental to a personal relationship or an outgrowth of some preexisting professional or occupational connection.as noted,mcdowell did not invite or engage objector to provide any care.nor did they have some preexisting arrangement or understanding,whereby mcdowell expected objector to provide care.rather,the relationship began as a friendship,and objector provided some companionship,care,and assistance arising from that friendship.certainly,evidence that objector and mcdowell were old friends might make the circumstances here as compelling as those in davidson.however,the relative brevity of the relationship does not,in our view,render davidson inapposite.
petitioner also distinguishes davidson on grounds that mcdowell was under a temporary conservatorship when she made objector a beneficiary,the public guardian questioned the authenticity of objector relationship,and objector submitted a bill for the meals she provided mcdowell.petitioner does not explain,and we fail to grasp,the relevance of mcdowell temporary conservatorship in determining whether objector was a care custodian.and although the public guardian argued,in essence,that objector pursued a devious plan to gain mcdowell assets,the court found no evidence of evil motivation,characterizing objector as simply a friend.finally,the bill objector submitted is irrelevant.as noted,there is no evidence that objector and mcdowell had a financial agreement concerning meals,mcdowell attorney told her to submit bills for any expenses,and the food bill was not paid.see ante,fn.moreover,davidson makes clear that the reimbursement for expenses incurred in caring for a dependent adult does not necessarily or automatically transform a friend into a care custodian.
next petitioner claims davidson analysis is flawed because the court failed to consider amendments to section,which,according to petitioner,deliberately expanded the category of care custodians beyond paid professionals to include any person that provides health or social services to elders,including objector.a careful review of the legislative background rebuts petitioner position.
when first enacted,section,provided,care custodian means an administrator or an employee of any of the following public or private facilities or agencies,or persons providing care or services for elders or dependent adults,except persons who do not work directly with elders or dependent adults as part of their official duties,including members of the support staff and maintenance staff,former,added by stats,ch,italics added.the statute also enumerated several categories of public or private facilities or agencies or persons and included a category for any other protective,public,or private assistance agency or person providing health services or social services to elders or dependent adults,former,subd.u,added by stats,ch.
in,the legislature amended several statutes related to elder abuse,including section.see stats,ch.among other things,the legislature deleted the language italicized above.it added one new category designated area agencies on aging.welf.inst.co
