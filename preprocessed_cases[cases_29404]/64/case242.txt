introduction 
a no contest clause is statutorily defined as a provision in an otherwise valid instrument that,if enforced,would penalize a beneficiary if the beneficiary files a contest with the court,subd.d.pursuant to section,subdivision a,a challenge to the validity of an instrument other than the instrument containing the no contest clause,does not constitute a contest unless expressly identified in the no contest clause as a violation of the clause,subd.a.
in re estate of rossi th,d rossi,the court of appeal concluded that pursuant to section,subdivision a,a no contest clause contained in a trust that,by its terms,applied to any action that sought to void,nullify or set aside this trust or any of its provisions,would not be triggered by an action that sought to invalidate an amendment to the trust.in perrin lee th,d perrin,the court of appeal extended rossi in concluding that a similarly worded no contest clause contained in a trust would not apply to amendments to the trust even where the amendments expressly confirmed and ratified the provisions of the trust.in this appeal,we follow rossi and perrin and hold the trial court erred in concluding that a beneficiary proposed challenge to an amendment to a trust would violate the trust no contest clause.
factual and procedural backgrounda.the relevant documents and parties 
in september,james townsend james and his wife,patricia townsend patricia,jointly as trustors,executed a document entitled eighth amendment to declaration of trust a complete restatement the trust.the trust states that james and patricia have three children,cynthia townsend cynthia,mark townsend,and james townsend ii james ii.
the trust provides generally that,upon the death of either trustor,the trustee shall allocate the assets of the trust estate into two subtrusts,a survivor trust and an exempt trust.the trust also provides that the surviving trustor may amend or revoke the survivor trust and may appoint the assets of the exempt trust among the trustor descendents.the trust further provides that upon the surviving trustor death,the trustee is to divide the assets of the exempt trust and survivor trust into as many equal shares as may be necessary to allocate one such equal share to each child of the trustors who survives the surviving trustor and one such equal share to each group composed of the descendants of a deceased child of the trustors who survive the surviving trustor.the trust identifies james ii as the successor trustee of the trust.
article of the trust is entitled trust administration.section f of article is a no contest clause that provides 
no contest in the event any person shall,singly or in conjunction with any other person or person,contest in any court the validity of the will of either trustor or the trusts established under this instrument or shall seek to obtain an adjudication in any proceeding in any court that this trust or any of its provisions,or that such will or any of its provisions,is void,or seek in any manner to void,nullify,or set aside this trust or any of its provisions,then the right of that person to serve as trustee or to take any interest given to him or her or any descendant of his or hers by this trust shall be determined as it would have been determined had the person failed to survive either trustor and left no living descendants.the trustee is hereby authorized to defend,at the expense of the trust estate,any contest or other attack of any nature on any of its provisions.prior to making any distribution of trust property to or for the benefit of the beneficiary of any trust under this instrument,the trustee may obtain from such beneficiary a written release,in a form satisfactory to the trustee,of any action set forth in the preceding provision of this section.
patricia died on november,making james the surviving trustor.
on december,james,as surviving trustor,executed a document entitled first amendment to the survivor trust under the james townsend trust first amendment.the first amendment provides that upon the death of the surviving trustor,the trustee is to distribute to cynthia in five annual installments,and is to divide the balance of the survivor trust into as many equal shares as may be necessary to allocate one such equal share to each son of the trustors,namely,mark towsend and james townsend ii,who survives the surviving trustor,and one such equal share to each group composed of the descendants of a deceased son of the trustors who survive the surviving trustor.the first amendment also provides,in all other respects,the surviving trustor hereby ratifies all of the terms and conditions of the survivor trust.
that same day,james,as surviving trustor,executed a document entitled exercise of special power of appointment by james townsend under the exempt trust of the james townsend trust power of appointment.through the power of appointment,james provided that upon his death,the trustee was to divide the balance of the exempt trust into as many equal shares as may be necessary to allocate one such equal share to each son of the trustors,namely,mark towsend and james townsend ii,who survives the surviving trustor,and one such equal share to each group composed of the descendants of a deceased son of the trustors who survive the surviving trustor.
james died three days later,on december.
cynthia section,subdivision a petition 
in june,cynthia filed a petition pursuant to section,subdivision a to determine whether a proposed petition that she intended to file would violate the trust no contest clause.in her section,subdivision a petition,cynthia stated that the proposed petition would raise challenges to the validity of the first amendment and to the power of appointment,among other claims 
the p roposed p etition,if filed,would seek an order of this court a determining that the first amendment and the power of appointment are invalid rescinded due to james incapacity,the undue influence and fraud of james ii and mark,and james mistake b determining that by reason of their undue influence and fraud james ii and mark have violated the trust no contest clause and have forfeited their rights to serve as trustee of the trust and their rights and rights of their descendants to take any beneficial interest under the trust c determining that james ii holds title to all trust assets,as well as all income therefrom,as constructive trustee for the benefit of cynthia d awarding cynthia punitive damages for the conduct of james ii and mark,who have been guilty of oppression,fraud and malice and e granting cynthia attorney fees and costs.
cynthia claimed that the first amendment and the power of appointment substantially reduced her share of the trust estate.cynthia attached copies of her proposed petition,the trust,the first amendment,and the power of appointment as exhibits to her section,subdivision a petition.
in her section,subdivision a petition,cynthia argued that a no contest clause may not be interpreted beyond what was plainly the testator intent.citing.cynthia also argued that section,subdivision a applied to the no contest clause in the trust because james and patricia executed the trust after january.cynthia noted that section,subdivision a provides in relevant part 
a for instruments executed on or after january,the following actions do not constitute a contest unless expressly identified in the no contest clause as a violation of the clause 
a challenge to the validity of an instrument,contract,agreement,beneficiary designation,or other document,other than the instrument containing the no contest clause.
cynthia claimed that pursuant to section,subdivision a and rossi,supra,th,d,her proposed challenges to the first amendment and to the power of appointment did not violate the trust no contest clause,arguing 
the application of the no contest clause does not extend to other instruments or documents affecting disposition of the trust estate.more specifically,the no contest clause makes no reference to any amendment to the trust,or to the exercise of a power of appointment over the trust estate.therefore,a challenge to the first amendment and the power of appointment is not an action that violates the no contest clause of the trust.
james ii,as trustee of the trust,filed a response to cynthia section,subdivision a petition.in his response,james ii argued that there was no question as to the trustor intent in adding the no contest clause to the trust,and cynthia does not allege any uncertainty the trustor intended that a contest by any one of the beneficiaries of either the survivor trust or the exempt trust would trigger forfeiture of the testamentary gifts to each of them.james ii claimed that cynthia challenge to the validity of either the first amendment or the power of appointment would violate the trust no contest clause.james ii also argued that cynthia proposed petition would violate the no contest clause of the trust to the extent that the petition sought to eliminate the right of james ii or mark to receive any portion of the trust assets on the ground that they had contested the validity of the trust.
james ii also cited section,subdivision a,which defines a trust as including,an express trust,private or charitable,with additions thereto,wherever and however created.italics added.james ii argued that pursuant to the italicized phrase in section,subdivision a,the statute includes amendments to the trust document as part of the trust.
in addressing cynthia claim that pursuant to section,subdivision a and rossi,supra,th,d,the no contest clause in the trust did not apply to her proposed challenges to the first amendment and to the power of appointment,james ii noted that section,subdivision c provides,subdivision a does not apply to a codicil or amendment to an instrument that was executed on or after january,unless the codicil or amendment adds a no contest clause or amends a no contest clause contained in an instrument executed before january.james ii claimed that pursuant to section,subdivision c,neither the first amendment nor the power of appointment were subject to section,subdivision a.in addition,with respect to the first amendment,james ii claimed that rossi,supra,th,d was distinguishable.james ii argued that,unlike in rossi,the first amendment incorporate d by reference the terms and conditions of the trust,and thereby incorporated the no contest clause of the trust into the first amendment.
cynthia filed a reply in which she argued that the rossi court had rejected an identical argument regarding the applicability of section,subdivision c to a trust that had been executed after january.cynthia also argued that james ii attempt to distinguish rossi on the ground that the first amendment incorporated the no contest clause of the trust was unavailing because the first amendment merely ratified the trust provisions,and did not in fact incorporate the trust provisions.
the trial court issued a tentative ruling granting cynthia section,subdivision a petition in part,and denying it in part.the court ruled,t he proposed petition is denied safe harbor to the extent it challenges the first amendment to the trust.it is granted safe harbor to the extent it contests the validity of the power of appointment.the trial court rejected james ii argument that section,subdivision c rendered section,subdivision a inapplicable to cynthia petition.further,the trial court reasoned that the holding in rossi applied to cynthia proposed petition to the extent that the petition sought to invalidate the power of appointment.however,the trial court ruled that rossi was distinguishable with respect to cynthia proposed challenge to the first amendment to the trust,reasoning that,unlike in rossi,the amendment at issue in this case specifically ratified the terms of the trust,including the trust no contest clause 
cynthia subsequently filed a supplemental brief in which she argued that the trial court erred in failing to apply rossi to her proposed challenge to the first amendment.thereafter,the trial court held a hearing at which it heard argument from cynthia counsel 
on december,the court affirmed its tentative ruling and issued a final order that is identical in all material respects to its tentative ruling.
on january,cynthia timely filed a partial appeal from the trial court december order.in her notice of appeal,cynthia stated that she appealed from the court order to the extent it denies safe harbor with regard to her proposed challenge to the first amendment to the trust.
discussiona.james ii failure to file an appeal from the trial court order granting safe harbor to cynthia proposed petition to the extent that the petition contests the validity of the james ii exercise of the power of appointment,precludes appellate review of this issue 
as an initial matter,we address the scope of the issues that we may address in this appeal.in his respondent brief,james ii claims that the trial court erred in granting cynthia petition in part,in concluding that cynthia proposed challenge to the validity of james ii exercise of the power of appointment would not violate the trust no contest clause.
the trial court granting of cynthia petition in this regard was an appealable order.code civ.proc,subd.a.however,james ii did not file an appeal from the trial court order.therefore,james ii has forfeited his right to seek reversal of this portion of the trial court order.see estate of powell th,d respondent who has not filed appeal can not seek affirmative relief,and may not raise claim of error other than to seek affirmance of trial court ruling.accordingly,we restrict our analysis to the issue that cynthia presents in her appeal,namely,whether the trial court erred in concluding that cynthia proposed petition would violate the no contest clause insofar as the petition seeks to invalidate the first amendment.
cynthia proposed petition does not violate the no contest clause insofar as it seeks to invalidate the first amendment 
cynthia claims that the trial court erred in concluding that her proposed petition would violate the no contest clause insofar as the petition seeks to invalidate the first amendment.cynthia claim raises a pure question of law,which we review de novo.in re estate of herold th,d the standard of review as to whether the proposed petition would amount to a contest within the meaning of the no contest clause is de novo.
governing law 
relevant provisions of the probate 
division,part,chapter of the probate code contains several provisions related to the enforceability and interpretation of no contest clauses.section provides a list of definitions that apply to the provisions of the probate code addressing no contest clauses 
as used in this part 
a contest means any action identified in a no contest clause as a violation of the clause.the term includes both direct and indirect contests.
b direct contest in an instrument or in this chapter means a pleading in a proceeding in any court alleging the invalidity of an instrument or one or more of its terms based on one or more of the following grounds 
revocation.
lack of capacity.
misrepresentation.
undue influence.
lack of due execution.
c indirect contest means a pleading in a proceeding in any court that indirectly challenges the validity of an instrument or one or more of its terms based on any other ground not contained in subdivision b,and that does not contain any of those grounds.
d no contest clause means a provision in an otherwise valid instrument that,if enforced,would penalize a beneficiary if the beneficiary files a contest with the court.
sections and describe the applicability of the probate code to no contest clauses.this part is not intended as a complete codification of the law governing enforcement of a no contest clause.the common law governs enforcement of a no contest clause to the extent this part does not apply this part applies notwithstanding a contrary provision in the instrument.section provides for the general enforceability of no contest clauses and states,except to the extent otherwise provided in this part,a no contest clause is enforceable against a beneficiary who brings a contest within the terms of the no contest clause.however,section provides,in determining the intent of the transferor,a no contest clause shall be strictly construed.
section outlines actions that do not constitute a contest under various circumstances.that section provides in relevant part 
a for instruments executed on or after january,the following actions do not constitute a contest unless expressly identified in the no contest clause as a violation of the clause 
the filing of a creditor claim or prosecution of an action based upon it.
an action or proceeding to determine the character,title,or ownership of property.
a challenge to the validity of an instrument,contract,agreement,beneficiary designation,or other document,other than the instrument containing the no contest clause.
c subdivision a does not apply to a codicil or amendment to an instrument that was executed on or after january,unless the codicil or amendment adds a no contest clause or amends a no contest clause contained in an instrument executed before january.
relevant case law 
in rossi,the beneficiary of a trust filed a safe harbor application seeking to challenge a trust amendment on the ground of undue influence.rossi,supra,th at,d.both the trust instrument and the amendment in question were executed after.id.at,d.the trust contained a no contest clause that applied by its terms to any action that sought to void,nullify or set aside this trust or any of its provisions id.at,d.however,the no contest clause in the trust did not specifically refer to amendments to the trust,and the trust amendment did not contain a no contest clause.ibid.
the successor trustee toinette claimed that because the trust amendment in question did not add or amend a no contest clause,section,subdivision c rendered section,subdivision a inapplicable.the rossi court rejected this interpretation of section,subdivision c 
we reject toinette reading of subdivision c.toinette interpretation suggests subdivision a is inapplicable so long as an amendment makes no change in the no contest clause of the original trust instrument or declaration,regardless of whether the decedent executed the original instrument before or after january,the effective date of section.such an interpretation renders superfluous the last phrase of subdivision c,contained in an instrument executed before january.
moreover,the plain language of the first clause of subdivision c provides that subdivision a does not apply to a codicil or amendment to an instrument executed on or after january.this is so because the instrument itself,executed on or after that date is already subject to subdivision a.subdivision c merely clarifies that a testator or settlor with a will or trust that already contains a no contest clause that meets subdivision a specificity requirements need not repeat the no contest clause in a codicil or amendment in order to have the no contest clause apply to the will or trust.
this interpretation harmonizes subdivision c with subdivision a.rossi,supra,th at,d.
toinette also claimed that section,subdivision a applied only to instruments.the rossi court rejected this argument as well.rossi,supra,th at,d stating there is nothing in the language of subdivision a that suggests the legislature intended to restrict the application of subdivision a in such a manner.the rossi court applied section,subdivision a,and rejected toinette argument that the amendment to the trust was subject to the trust no contest clause 
the language in subdivision a clearly recognizes instruments or other documents separate from the instrument containing the no contest clause,and that those separate instruments or documents may be the subject of a safe harbor challenge.here,the second amendment is such a document.it is separate from the instrument containing the no contest clause since it does not contain a no contest clause.and it is subject to challenge without violating the no contest clause of the instrument,because the instrument no contest clause language failed to expressly identify the action as a violation.rossi,supra,th at,d.
in perrin,supra,th at pages,d,the guardian ad litem of two beneficiaries of a trust,who were minors,filed a safe harbor application seeking to challenge two trust amendments on the grounds of undue influence and that the trustor was not of sound mind at the time she amended the trust.the trust contained a no contest clause that provided as follows 
the beneficial provisions of this agreement and of the grantor last will and testament,which make reference to this agreement,are intended to be in lieu of any other right,claims or interests of whatsoever nature,whether statutory or otherwise,which any beneficiary hereunder may have against or in the estate of the grantor or the properties in trust hereunder.accordingly,if any beneficiary hereunder asserts any claim whatsoever,statutory election,or other right or interest against or in a grantor estate,grantor will,any properties of this trust,other than pursuant to the express terms hereof or of said will,or directly or indirectly contests,disputes,or calls into question,before any tribunal,the validity of this agreement or of said will or the validity of any provisions of this agreement or of said will,then all costs related to any such assertion by such beneficiary shall be directly charged to and borne by such beneficiary interests hereunder,and a such beneficiary shall thereby absolutely forfeit any and all beneficial interests of whatsoever kind and nature which such beneficiary might otherwise have under this agreement and b all of the provisions of this agreement,to the extent that they confer any benefits,powers,or rights whatsoever upon such claiming,electing,or contesting beneficiary,shall thereupon become absolutely void and revoked perrin,supra,th at,d.
although,as in rossi,neither of the trust amendments in question in perrin contained a no contest clause,each amendment contained a provision that stated,in all other respects,grantor and trustee hereby confirm and ratify said trust agreement as originally executed and as heretofore amended.perrin,supra,th at,d.
the trial court in perrin concluded that the proposed challenge to the amendments would violate the trust no contest clause,explaining that the no contest clause in the trust was incorporated into the amendments,by virtue of the amendments confirmation and ratification provisions.perrin,supra,th at,d.on appeal,the guardian ad litem contended that the trial court had failed to follow rossi.id.at,d.the trustee contended that rossi was distinguishable in light of the confirmation and ratification provisions.id.at,d.
the perrin court reiterated rossi holding that for trusts executed on or after january,a trust no contest clause may not be applied to an amendment of the trust unless there is a specific reference to amendments to the trust in the trust no contest clause 
in the case before us,we see that the trust,executed in,did not explicitly state that a contest to an amendment would violate the no contest clause of the trust,such that the guardian challenge to the second and third amendments would cause the disinheritance of the trustor minor children.inasmuch as the trust omitted,despite the existence of section,subdivision a,to specifically state that a challenge to an amendment would constitute a contest to which the no contest clause of the trust would apply,we can not construe the no contest clause as so applying.perrin,supra,th at,d.
the perrin court further concluded that the confirmation and ratification provisions contained in the amendments were not sufficient to incorporate the trust no contest clause into the amendments 
w e do not mean to say that a trust amendment could never be drafted in such a manner as to clearly incorporate a no contest clause contained in the original trust instrument into the amendment itself,thereby making the no contest clause applicable to a challenge to the amendment.however,in the case before us,the language of the amendments is not so drafted.
incorporation by reference occurs when one writing,which is a complete testamentary instrument in itself,must refer to another document in such a manner as to incorporate it.citations.citation.t here is incorporation by reference when one of the writing
