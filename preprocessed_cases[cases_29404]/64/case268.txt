david william betts appeals from a ruling on his application under probate code section to determine whether a proposed probate court petition would constitute a contest to a testamentary trust under which he is a beneficiary.on our independent review of the record,we conclude that the probate court erred in ruling that betts proposed petition would constitute a contest against city national bank and wells fargo bank na,and accordingly we reverse that portion of the probate court ruling.
factual and procedural background 
in,joan hazard betts the trustor created a revocable living trust the trust.throughout the years before her death in,she made several amendments to the trust,two of which are relevant here.in,the seventh amendment to the trust the seventh amendment completely restated the trust.in,the ninth amendment to the trust the ninth amendment removed wells fargo bank wells fargo as trustee and appointed city national bank city national.
the ninth amendment expressly affirmed language appearing in the seventh amendment,which limits the liability of successor trustees 
a successor trustee shall not be held responsible for the willful or negligent defaults of any prior trustee nor shall it be the duty of the successor trustee to audit or obtain auditing of the trust estate or to demand an accounting by any prior trustee nor shall it be the duty of the successor trustee to initiate or conduct any proceeding to redress a breach of trust committed by a prior trustee,unless so requested in writing by an adult having a present or future beneficial interest under a trust hereunder but any successor trustee shall be liable only for its own willful misconduct or breach of good faith.no bond shall be required of any trustee or successor trustee.italics added.
betts,who is the trustor son,is identified in the seventh amendment as a beneficiary of the trust,along with his sister susan betts hill hill.in,the trustor executed a statutory power of attorney in favor of hill.
the seventh amendment contained the following no contest clause 
if any beneficiary under this trust shall,singly or in conjunction with any other person or persons,contest in any court the validity of this trust or of the settlor last will or shall seek to obtain an adjudication in any proceeding in any court that this trust or any of its provisions or that such will or any of its provisions is void,or seek otherwise to void,nullify,or set aside this trust or any of its provisions,then the right of that person and his issue to take,which is given to him by this trust,shall be determined as it would have been determined had the person predeceased execution of this declaration of trust without surviving issue.
after the trustor death,betts proposed to file a petition against hill and city national under section,subdivision a b for return of funds to the trust,and welfare and institutions code section,subdivision d for elder abuse the first proposed petition.the first proposed petition alleged that hill used her authority under a power of attorney and her status as a joint tenant on certain bank accounts to improperly take money from the trustor for her own financial gain,and that city national,acting as trustee of the trust,breached its fiduciary duty by allowing hill to misappropriate the funds,knowing that the trustor was under hill influence and incapable of managing her own financial affairs.
to determine if,by requesting such relief,he would be in violation of the no contest clause of the trust,betts filed an application under section to obtain a declaration as to whether the first proposed petition would be a contest to the trust in violation of its no contest clause the first section application.
city national objected.it argued,among other things,that filing the first proposed petition would violate the no contest clause because of the provision in the seventh and ninth amendments stating that any successor trustee shall be liable only for its own willful misconduct or breach of good faith the exculpation provision.it argued that the first proposed petition made no allegation that city national,acting as trustee,committed willful misconduct or acted in bad faith,and thus the proposed petition violates and nullifies the trust exculpation provision.
the probate court agreed,ruling,because the first proposed petition sets forth no allegations that trustee willfully breached its fiduciary duties or failed to act in good faith,the first proposed petition constitutes an actual contest under the trust clause.with respect to the allegations made against hill in the first proposed petition,the probate court ruled that those claims would not constitute a contest under the terms of the trust.
betts then proposed to file a different petition under section to recover against hill and city national,and also against wells fargo,which acted as trustee prior to city national the second proposed petition the second proposed petition greatly expanded on the allegations against city national,adding specific details from several documents that were attached as exhibits to the proposed complaint,based on which betts alleged that city national knowingly and willfully breached its fiduciary duty.it alleged that city national bank committed willful misconduct and a breach of good faith,and wrongfully breached the fiduciary duty owed to its client and trust beneficiary joan hazard betts,by continuing to make substantial transfer of trust funds to an account that city national knew was controlled by hill and in which the funds were being used for the benefit of hill.it also alleged that city national transferred substantial sums of money into a joint bank account allegedly controlled by hill,knowing that hill was using her power of attorney to divert funds from this account for her own use.the second proposed petition sought,among other things,an order that the deposit by city national of said funds in said joint account controlled by hill was wrongful and in bad faith,to the extent that hill appropriated said funds for her own personal benefit,and an order requiring either city national or hill to return to the trust an amount equal to twice the amount of funds allegedly misappropriated by hill 
to obtain a declaration that filing the second proposed petition would not constitute a contest under the trust no contest clause,betts filed another application under section the second application.
city national filed an objection it argued among other things,that because the first proposed petition did not allege willful misconduct or bad faith,t he new proposed p etition attempts to make an allegation that contradicts his prior allegation and it should be barred.further,city national argued that because the second proposed petition makes the allegation that city national has liability that is depend e nt upon the conduct of hill,betts was attempting to assert that liability arises for city national that is not its own willful misconduct but rather,derived from that of another,in violation of the trust exculpation provision.
city national also argued that the second proposed petition was an attempt to nullify the trust provision that d uring the lifetime of the settlor,the trustee shall account only to the trustor.according to city national,the second proposed petition claimed that the trustor was not the only person entitled to an accounting,but rather,there should be some other retrospective accounting imposed.
the probate court ruled that the claims against city national and wells fargo in the second proposed petition would constitute a contest based on the provision limiting the liability of a successor trustee to willful misconduct or bad faith.it stated that betts second proposed petition attempts to bypass the court decision on his first section application by alleging that the actions of the proposed defendant trustee w ere wrongful and in bad faith,to the extent that hill misappropriated said funds for her own personal benefit.it stated that t he legal part of this allegation that the acts were wrongful and in bad faith is,however,conclusory,unsupported or limited by the latter,factual allegation,to the extent respecting hill conduct.this allegation must also be read in the context of the other factual allegations in the proposed petition,which show that betts claim against the proposed defendant banks is,at best,for negligence for depositing the alleged trust funds into the joint tenancy account s.the probate court also ruled that betts alleged in the first proposed petition that the banks committed no more than negligence,and now,betts is bound to this allegation given there are no new factual allegations in the proposed petition under the doctrine of conclusiveness of pleadings.as for the claims against hill,the probate court again ruled that those claims would not offend the no contest clause.a notice of the probate court ruling was served on betts on november.
betts then filed a petition that sought relief only from hill for the funds that she allegedly misappropriated from the trust.the petition was in the form of the second proposed petition,but all of the allegations against city national and wells fargo were deleted and replaced by brackets indicating that they were stricken pursuant to court order.on december,while proceeding against hill,betts filed a notice of appeal of the portion of the probate court ruling concerning city national and wells fargo.
discussiona.city national challenges to the appeal 
before examining the merits of betts appeal,we pause to consider city national argument that this appeal is improper on two separate grounds that the appeal is untimely,and that betts has waived his right to appeal by proceeding against hill.
the appeal is timely 
city national argues that this appeal is untimely because betts days to appeal the probate court ruling ran from the date that betts received notice of the probate court ruling on the first section application,not from the date that he received notice of the ruling on the second section application.city national argues that the filing of the second section application is nothing more than a of the first section application,with only superficial changes,and thus the timeliness of the filing of an appeal should be based on the date of the original order of the probate court on the first section application,which was march.it argues that a party should not be able to create a timely appeal simply by a pleading to get a new order from which to start the clock ticking.
we reject this argument because its factual premise is flawed.the second section application differed materially from the first section application because it sought a ruling concerning a materially different proposed petition.among other things,the second proposed petition greatly expands factual recitals concerning city national,quoting from numerous attached documents that were not attached to the first proposed petition contains many allegations against city national that did not appear in the first proposed petition,such as the allegation that city national committed willful misconduct and a breach of good faith and adds wells fargo as a party from whom it seeks relief.it is evident from our review of the second proposed petition that betts proposed to file it to address the trial court ruling on the first section application that the first proposed petition did not plead that city national engaged in willful misconduct or acted in bad faith,and that the second proposed petition was thus drafted to contain distinctly different allegations from the first proposed petition.
because the second proposed petition differed materially from the first proposed petition,the second section application necessarily differed materially from the first section application,and betts could not have appealed from the issues decided in the probate court ruling on the second section application by filing an appeal from the probate court ruling on the first section application.
betts did not waive the right to appeal by proceeding with a petition to recover against hill 
under section,subdivision d,a party may appeal from an order d etermining whether an action constitutes a contest city national contends that betts waived the right to appeal when,based on the probate court ruling on the second section application,he filed a petition against hill that simply deleted all of the allegations against city national and wells fargo.city national argues that betts admittedly is consenting to and affirmatively abiding by the probate court order that he is purportedly appealing.citing aubry hospital dist.cal th,d,aubry,city national argues that we should bar betts from proceeding with the appeal under the rule that a litigant choice to amend a complaint after an adverse ruling by the court,and to go forward at the trial court level,constitutes a waiver of the right to appeal the underlying ruling.
the rule set forth in aubry is not applicable here because it does not concern appeals from rulings under section.aubry stated that when a plaintiff amends a complaint in response to a ruling on a demurrer and judgment is entered after the trial court sustains a demurrer to the amended complaint,the plaintiff can not appeal from the order sustaining the first demurrer regarding the original complaint.aubry,supra,cal th at,fn,d.here,however,there was no ruling on a demurrer to an operative complaint,and there was no amendment to an operative complaint in response to such a ruling.instead,this appeal concerns a ruling on an application brought under section to obtain a ruling whether a proposed petition would constitute a contest.city national cites no authority that would prevent a party from appealing from such an order and simultaneously proceeding to file a petition reflecting the claims for relief that the probate court held would not implicate the no contest clause.
city national also argues that betts expressly consented to the probate court order by referring to it on the face of his pleading.specifically,city national points to the indication in the petition he filed against hill that certain allegations from the second proposed petition were stricken pursuant to court order.we reject city national argument because nothing in the petition against hill indicates that betts expressly consented to the portion of the second section application that he is appealing here.instead,we view the notation that certain allegations were stricken pursuant to court order as a way for betts to indicate that he had filed the same petition that the trial court had held would not constitute a contest as to hill,but with the allegations against city national and wells fargo deleted.in doing so,betts was not expressly consenting to the trial court order concerning city national and wells fargo.instead,he appears to have been carefully avoiding making any allegation that might constitute a contest in the event he was not successful in challenging the trial court order through this appeal.
standard of review 
in reviewing the probate court ruling on the second section application,we apply a de novo standard of review.burch george cal th,d,burch an appeal from a probate court ruling on a section application presents a question of law requiring the appellate court to independently construe the trust language.where,as here,t he parties presented no extrinsic evidence to the trial court to aid in the interpretation of the trust document,we must deduce the intent of the trustor from the face of the document.mcindoe olivos th,d mcindoe.
overview of the law concerning no contest clauses 
the sole issue in this appeal is whether the filing of the second proposed petition would constitute a contest under the trust no contest clause,as set forth in the seventh amendment.
we commence our analysis with an overview of the law pertaining to no contest clauses.a no contest clause essentially acts as a disinheritance device,if a beneficiary contests or seeks to impair or invalidate the trust instrument or its provisions,the beneficiary will be disinherited and thus may not take the gift or devise provided under the instrument.burch,supra,cal th at,d.the purpose of no contest clauses is to discourage will contests by imposing a penalty of forfeiture against beneficiaries who challenge the will.estate of kaila th,d kaila.in essence,a no contest clause conditions a beneficiary right to take the share provided to that beneficiary under such an instrument upon the beneficiary agreement to acquiesce to the terms of the instrument.citation.no contest clauses are valid in california and are favored by the public policies of discouraging litigation and giving effect to the purposes expressed by the testator.burch,at,d.
under section,a beneficiary may,without violating a no contest clause,apply to the court for a determination whether a particular act would be a contest provided that no determination of the merits of the petition is required.mcindoe,supra,th at,d.s ection provides a safe harbor for beneficiaries who seek an advance judicial determination of whether a proposed legal challenge would be a contest under a particular no contest clause.citation.if a court determines that a particular proposed action would constitute a contest,the beneficiary will then be able to make an informed decision whether to pursue the contest and forfeit his or her rights under a will or to forgo that contest and accede to the will provisions.kaila,supra,th at,d.
according to statute,we must apply a rule of strict construction in interpreting a no contest clause.in determining the intent of the transferor,a no contest clause shall be strictly construed.because a no contest clause results in a forfeiture,a court is required to strictly construe it and may not extend it beyond what was plainly the testator intent.burch,supra,cal th at,d.although no contest clauses are valid and favored by the public policies of discouraging litigation and giving effect to the testator intent,they are also disfavored by the policy against forfeitures and therefore are strictly construed and may not extend beyond what plainly was the testator intent.kaila,supra,th at,d.only where an act comes strictly within the express terms of the forfeiture clause may a breach thereof be declared.graham lenzi th,d,italics added.
when interpreting a no contest clause,t he answer can not be sought in a vacuum,but must be gleaned from a consideration of the purposes that the testator sought to attain by the provisions of his will.citation.therefore,even though a no contest clause is strictly construed to avoid forfeiture,it is the testator intentions that control,and a court must not rewrite the testator will in such a way as to immunize legal proceedings plainly intended to frustrate the testator unequivocally expressed intent from the reach of the clause.burch,supra,cal th at,d.in construing a trust instrument,the intent of the trustor prevails and it must be ascertained from the whole of the trust instrument,not just separate parts of it.mcindoe,supra,th at,d.
moreover,d etermination of whether a prohibited contest has occurred must be made on a basis.estate of lindstrom d,and w hether there has been a contest within the meaning of a particular clause depends upon the circumstances of the particular case and the language used.burch,supra,cal th at,d.each case depends upon its own peculiar facts and thus case precedents have little value when interpreting a trust.mcindoe,supra,th at,d.
d.the second proposed petition does not seek to void,nullify or set aside the portion of the trust limiting the liability of successor trustees 
the issue on which the parties focus is whether the second proposed petition violates the portion of the trust no contest clause applying to a beneficiary who seek s otherwise to void,nullify,or set aside this trust or any of its provisions.
betts argues that the second proposed petition does not seek to void,nullify or set aside any provision of the trust,and seeks instead merely to impose liability on city national and wells fargo for their alleged breach of fiduciary duty,which would require them to reimburse the trust for the amounts improperly disbursed during the trustor lifetime.
city national,in contrast,contends that the second proposed petition violates the trust exculpation provision,which,as we have explained,states that any successor trustee shall be liable only for its own willful misconduct or breach of good faith.italics added.city national argues that as a successor trustee to wells fargo,it is protected by the exculpation provision,and that any petition by betts seeking to hold it liable would be an attempt to void,nullify or set aside the exculpation provision,unless betts asserted a claim based on city national own willful misconduct or breach of good faith.
city national takes several different approaches to arguing that the second proposed petition does not seek to impose liability on city national for its own willful misconduct or bad faith.as we will explain,each approach lacks merit 
first,city national argues that the second proposed petition does not seek to hold city national liable for its own willful misconduct but instead is attempting to hold city national liable based on conduct that betts alleges was committed by his sister,hill.we disagree.although the second proposed petition alleges that hill improperly sought to misappropriate funds from the trust for her own use,it also alleges that actions performed solely by city national constituted a willful and knowing breach of fiduciary duty.the second proposed petition alleges,for example,that city national wrongfully released funds to joint accounts although it knew that hill would misuse the funds.thus,the second proposed petition alleges that city national is liable for its own willful misconduct.
second,city national alleges that based on a statement in the second section application not in the second proposed petition,betts seeks to impose a lower threshold of liability for city national that would void or nullify the trust language that clearly sets a higher threshold.specifically,city national points out that the second section application states,the second proposed petition does not contest any provision of the trust.the second proposed petition challenges the actions of city national in the administration of the trust that is,its negligent distribution of trust funds to hill but does not challenge the terms,or the trust.italics added.
we do not accept city national invitation to focus on language in the second section application characterizing betts claims against city national.instead,because the question presented to us is whether the filing of the second proposed petition would violate the no contest clause,we must look solely to how the second proposed petition itself asserts those claims.doing so,we conclude that the second proposed petition plainly alleges that city national committed willful misconduct and acted in bad faith.the second proposed petition alleges that city national committed willful misconduct and a breach of good faith,and wrongfully breached the fiduciary duty owed to the trustor.
third,city national argues that because the allegations in the first proposed petition pursued a negligence theory of liability against city national with its allegation that city national acquiesced to hill misconduct,betts should be prevented from asserting a different theory of liability in the second proposed petition.city national argues that betts allegations in the first proposed petition are binding on him under a doctrine it refers to as conclusiveness of the pleadings.in support of its argument,city national cites a single case,valerio andrew youngquist construction th,d.in valerio,a defendant who admitted the existence of a contract in his answer to the complaint was bound by that admission because he had not sought to amend his answer.id.at,d.as witkin explains,under the doctrine of conclusiveness of pleadings,a pleader is bound by well pleaded material allegations or by failure to deny well pleaded material allegations.witkin,cal.proc.ed.pleading.u nder the doctrine of conclusiveness of pleadings evidence may not be received to contradict an admission on the pleadings and findings contrary to such admissions must be disregarded.electronic equipment express,donald seiler d.
we conclude that this doctrine does not apply here.t
