the court of federal claims dismissed the internal revenue service determination that certain taxpayers transfers of their partnership interests to trusts were shams because the court believed it lacked jurisdiction to address the irs determination at the partnership level.the united states appeals that ruling in case.we reverse the court of federal claims dismissal.the identity of the true partners in the partnership at issue appropriately is determined at the partnership level because,on the particular facts of this case,partnership identity could affect the distributive shares reported to the partners.
after this action commenced,the taxpayers conceded certain capital gain and loss adjustments imposed by the irs and moved for summary judgment on the valuation misstatement penalties that the irs sought as a result of those adjustments.the taxpayers argued that their concession of the irs adjustments rendered the valuation misstatement penalties moot.the court of federal claims agreed,granted summary judgment to the taxpayers,and declined to impose the valuation misstatement penalties.the united states appeals that ruling in case.we vacate that judgment because the court of federal claims failed to determine whether the taxpayers underpayment of tax was attributable to the alleged valuation misstatement.
finally,the court of federal claims granted the government motion for summary judgment with respect to additional penalties for negligence,substantial understatement,and failure to act reasonably and in good faith,and imposed a penalty on the taxpayers.the taxpayers appeal that ruling in case.we dismiss the taxpayers appeal as premature.if the court of federal claims concludes on remand that the valuation misstatement penalty applies,that valuation misstatement penalty could render moot the propriety of the penalty that is the subject of the taxpayers cross appeal.
this case arises from two son of boss transactions,as well as a transaction involving charitable remainder unitrusts cruts,conducted by the heirs of the late marvin sands,the founder of constellation brands.in a son of boss transaction,a taxpayer attempts to realize tax benefits by transferring assets encumbered by significant liabilities to a partnership in an attempt to increase the partner basis in the partnership.see stobie creek invs.llc united states,korman assocs.united states,cir.normally,when a partner contributes property to a partnership,the partner basis in the partnership increases,and when the partnership assumes a partner liability,the partner basis decreases.see.a son of boss transaction recognizes a partnership acquisition of a partner asset here,proceeds,and disregards the partnership acquisition of an essentially offsetting liability here,the obligation to close out the position.see stobie creek,at korman,at.by employing this strategy,the taxpayer attempts to generate a tax loss or reduce the gain that would otherwise result from the sale of an asset.id.
in this case,marvin sands heirs owned stock in constellation.in the first son of boss transaction,they used several partnerships to convert approximately million in taxable gain that they anticipated receiving from the sale of their stock into large capital losses.the heirs also prearranged for their partnership interests to be held temporarily by cruts at the time of the sale so that,as the government alleges,any gain that might be recognized from the sale would escape taxation.the cruts were terminated shortly after they were formed,and the assets of the cruts,including the sale proceeds,were distributed to the heirs,purportedly tax free.in the second son of boss transaction,the heirs sought to generate significant capital losses to offset other income,again through the use of various partnerships.
in notices of final partnership administrative adjustment fpaas issued to the partnerships involved in the son of boss transactions,the irs determined that the transactions should be disregarded and that the transfers of the partnership interests to the cruts were shams.the irs also asserted various basis and capital gain and loss adjustments,as well as several alternative penalties,including a penalty for gross valuation misstatement,a penalty for substantial understatement of tax,and a penalty for negligence.the irs also asserted that the transactions did not increase the partners amounts at risk under.
the partnerships involved in the son of boss transactions initially challenged the irs adjustments to the basis,capital gain,and capital loss calculations.in an amended complaint,however,the partnerships conceded the capital gain and loss adjustments on the purported basis of.the court of federal claims later agreed with the partnerships that,because the adjustments had been conceded on the basis of,the gross valuation misstatement penalty sought by the irs because of the adjustments was inapplicable.the court of federal claims also held that the identity of a partnership partners is a item that can not be addressed in a partnership proceeding,such that it could not consider whether the transfers of the partnership interests to the cruts were shams.finally,the court of federal claims determined that the penalties for substantial understatement of tax and negligence applied and imposed such a penalty on the taxpayers.
during and,the years at issue,constellation was a leading producer and marketer of alcoholic beverages in north america and the united kingdom,with gross sales exceeding billion in fiscal year.constellation was founded and owned by the late marvin sands.after his death,the following family members held a controlling interest in constellation through stock ownership marvin sons,robert and richard sands his wife,marilyn sands and two trusts established for the benefit of his grandchildren,abigail stern and zachary stern the children trusts.the government claims that,in,the heirs stock was worth more than million and had a tax basis of approximately million.
the heirs received tax advice from the heritage organization,llc,which designed and directed the implementation of the two son of boss transactions.the heirs implemented the first son of boss transaction as follows.between august and,they established brokerage accounts with paine webber.through those accounts,they collectively sold short approximately million of treasury notes on august,the children trusts assigned their portion of the proceeds and the obligation to close out the short sale to cwc partnership i cwc,a preexisting family investment partnership.on august,the heirs and cwc contributed i the proceeds from the short sale,ii the obligation to close out the short sale,and iii a total of shares of constellation stock to r,r,m c group,rrmc group,a new partnership created at the direction of heritage.the general partner of rrmc group was r,r,m c management corporation rrmc,an entity created by richard and robert on august.for its claimed interest in rrmc group,rrmc contributed shares of constellation stock to the partnership.
on august,rrmc group,in turn,contributed the constellation stock,the proceeds,and the obligation to close out the short sale to r,r,m c partners,rrmc partners,another new entity established at the direction of heritage.rrmc group held a interest in rrmc partners.the remaining interest was held by gloria robinson,the mother of the heirs accountant.
on september,rrmc partners closed out the position at a net loss of.on september,rrmc group purchased robinson interest in rrmc partners,thereby effecting a termination of rrmc partners.the government alleges that,as a result of this transaction,rrmc group claimed that its basis in the constellation stock increased by approximately million,from million to million.
in connection with the first son of boss transaction,the heirs prearranged to channel the sale of the constellation stock through cruts.a crut is a charitable trust that provides an income beneficiary,often the grantor,annual payments for a fixed term.at the end of the fixed term,a charity receives the remainder interest.see.a crut generally is exempt from tax,but the income of a crut is taxable to its income beneficiaries upon distribution.b,c.
on september,eleven days after rrmc partners had terminated and distributed the constellation stock back to rrmc group with the increased basis richard,robert,marilyn,and cwc each created a crut with a term.richard and robert were designated the trustees of the cruts,and the heirs and cwc were named as the income beneficiaries.on the same day,richard,robert,marilyn,and cwc transferred their respective interests in rrmc group,which held the constellation stock,to the cruts.at that time,appraisals were obtained valuing each partnership interest at.based on these appraisals,each of the four transferors claimed a charitable contribution deduction with respect to the remainder interests purportedly transferred.
on october,rrmc group sold the constellation stock for approximately million.the government claims that the actual basis of the stock was approximately million and that rrmc group should have realized a million gain.as the government further claims,however,rrmc group claimed a million loss because the heirs inflated the basis through the son of boss transaction.
on january,the sands supporting foundation was designated as the charitable beneficiary of the cruts.on february,that charity designation was revoked,and the educational and health support fund,an entity created by robert and richard on the same day,was named as the charitable beneficiary.updated appraisals valued each crut partnership interest at.based upon the updated appraisals,on february,richard,robert,marilyn,and cwc purchased from the educational and health support fund the remainder interests in the cruts for each.this had the effect of terminating each crut because the income and remainder interests were merged,and the partnership interests in rrmc group,which held the million from the sale of the constellation stock,were distributed back to the heirs and cwc.the heirs and cwc claimed that these distributions were distributions of the cruts assets.
in the second son of boss transaction,on december,the heirs and cwc formed alpha i,alpha,a limited partnership in which they held a cumulative interest.the remaining interest was held by rrmc as general partner.by agreement dated december,alpha and gloria robinson,who was involved in the first son of boss transaction,formed beta partners beta,with alpha holding a interest and robinson holding the remaining interest.on december,the heirs and cwc collectively transferred approximately million to their respective paine webber accounts.on the same day,the heirs and cwc sold short approximately million of treasury notes.on december,the heirs and cwc contributed the proceeds,the obligations,and million to alpha.shortly thereafter,rrmc contributed to alpha.
on december,alpha purchased shares of corning,common stock for and shares of yahoo,common stock for.on december,alpha contributed its assets,including the proceeds,the obligations,and the corning and yahoo stock,to beta.on december,beta closed out the position,realizing a net gain of.on the same date,alpha purchased robinson interest in beta,causing the termination of beta.as a result of these transactions,alpha claimed it had a basis in the corning stock of and a basis in the yahoo stock of.
alpha distributed most of the corning and yahoo stock to the heirs and cwc,who,in february,transferred the stock to two other family partnerships mickey management and m,l,r each time the stock was transferred,the transferee claimed a carryover basis in the stock equal to alpha allegedly inflated basis.in december,alpha,mickey management,and m,l,r r each sold a portion of its corning and yahoo stock,claiming losses of approximately million total due to the allegedly inflated basis of the stock.
the irs audited the partnerships and partnership returns.in and,the agency issued fpaas denying the losses from the transactions.with respect to the first son of boss transaction,the irs adjusted the basis of the constellation stock and determined that the sale of the stock resulted in capital gains rather than capital losses.the irs listed several alternative theories supporting the adjustments,including and related regulations,the doctrine,and the doctrine.the irs issued similar fpaas to the partnerships involved in the second son of boss transaction,adjusting the basis of the corning and yahoo stock and eliminating the loss claimed on the sales of that stock.the irs also asserted in each fpaa a penalty for gross valuation misstatement,or,alternatively,a penalty for substantial valuation misstatement a penalty for substantial understatement of tax and a penalty for negligence.
in a section titled at risk rules,the irs further stated in each fpaa that i t is determined that none of the transactions of the partnership increases the amount considered for an activity under b,such that the amount for which a partner is considered to be at risk for an activity is not increased by any transactions with the partnership.
finally,in the fpaas issued to the partnerships involved in the first son of transaction,the irs also asserted that the transfers of the rrmc group partnership interests to the cruts should be disregarded as shams.consequently,the irs asserted,the proceeds from rrmc group sale of the constellation stock should not flow through to the cruts,but instead should flow through to the heirs and cwc as partners in rrmc group.
in their complaints,the partnerships challenged each of the determinations contained in the fpaas.the partnerships engaged in the first son of transaction filed a motion to dismiss the determination that the transfers to the cruts were shams.they argued that the identity of rrmc group partners is not a partnership item,such that the court lacked jurisdiction under f to decide whether the transfers should be disregarded.the court of federal claims granted the motion to dismiss,holding that the identity of rrmc group partners is not a partnership item and that,as a result,it did not possess jurisdiction to consider the issue.
the partnerships involved in both son of boss transactions challenged the gross valuation misstatement penalty.with respect to the fpaas determination,the partnerships asserted that the amounts were properly computed,and they argued that,even if incorrectly computed,the rules of could be used only to disallow the claimed losses and would not require a partnership or its partners to recognize any gain.
the partnerships,however,later filed a motion to amend their complaints in which they conceded the capital gain and loss adjustments on the purported basis of.they stated that p laintiffs have determined that it would be more economical to narrow the issues before the court by conceding the defendant capital gains adjustments on one of the several alternative grounds asserted by defendants.plaintiffs believe that such concession also eliminates the possibility of incurring a percent penalty.they conceded that none of the transactions of the partnerships increases the amount considered for an activity under b and that the rules would disallow losses and require the partnerships and their partners to recognize gain on the transactions as described in the adjustments set forth in the fpaas.the partnerships further stated that p laintiffs do not concede defendant capital gains and losses adjustments on any other ground,nor do they concede any other determination set forth in the fpaas issued to them.however,plaintiffs concession of the b issue and defendant capital gain adjustments eliminates the need for the court to decide whether defendant alternative grounds for such capital gain adjustments support the adjustments.the court of federal claims granted the partnerships motion to amend their complaints.
the partnerships then moved for summary judgment on the valuation misstatement penalty.the court of federal claims granted the motion,holding that the partnerships concession of the capital gain and loss adjustments on the basis of obviated the need to make any valuation determinations and,therefore,rendered the valuation misstatement penalty inapplicable.the government filed a motion for reconsideration,which the court denied,concluding that the government failed to identify error in the court summary judgment opinion.
the parties also filed for summary judgment on the government remaining penalty claims the negligence penalty and the penalty.the court of federal claims held that both penalties applied.the court found that the partnerships had engaged in a tax shelter based on the transfer of short sale proceeds to rrmc group without the transfer of the related contingent obligations 
on september,the court of federal claims entered final judgment consistent with its various opinions.
the court of federal claims erred when it dismissed the irs determination that the transfers of the partners interests in rrmc group to the cruts were shams.the court ruling was on a question of law,which we review de novo.keener united states,f d,the court of federal claims decision to grant a motion to dismiss for lack of jurisdiction is a matter of law,which this court reviews de novo.
in determining whether the transfers were shams,the court of federal claims was asked to determine the identity of the true partners of rrmc group.the court of federal claims erred in finding that it lacked jurisdiction to determine partner identity because it incorrectly found that the determination of the identity of the partners in rrmc group would not affect the allocation of the partnership items among the partners.on the facts of this case,partner identity could,in fact,affect allocation of the partnership items.as such,partner identity is properly resolved at the partnership level in this proceeding.
whether the court of federal claims may exercise jurisdiction to determine the identities of the partners in rrmc group turns on whether partner identity must be determined at the partnership or partner level.the statutory framework governing partnership and partnerlevel determinations provides the foundation on which that issue must be resolved.
partnerships are entities,meaning they do not pay federal income tax.rather,all income,deductions,and credits are allocated among the individual partners,keener,at.while partnerships are not taxpayers,they are required to file annual information returns reporting the partners distributive shares of income,gain,deductions,or credits.the individual partners then report their distributive shares on their federal income tax returns.
in the past,the differing tax treatment of partnerships and their partners resulted in duplicative audits and litigation,and,often,inconsistent treatment of partners in the same partnership.see anisa afshar,the statute of limitations for the tefra partnership proceedings the interplay between section and section,tax law.in,congress enacted legislation with the goal of establishing coordinated procedures for determining the proper treatment of partnership items at the partnership level in a single,unified audit and judicial proceeding.see tax equity and fiscal responsibility act of tefra,et,stat.and keener,at.these procedures are commonly referred to as tefra procedures.whether a tax item is a partnership item governs how the tefra procedures apply.keener,at.
when the irs disagrees with a partnership reporting of any partnership item,it must issue an fpaa before making any assessments attributable to that item against the partners.a,d,a.the partner has ninety days from the date of the fpaa to file a petition contesting the adjustments in the fpaa in the tax court,a federal district court,or the court of federal claims.a.if no such petition is filed,any other partner entitled to notice of partnership proceedings may file a petition within the following sixty days.b.
if a petition contesting the fpaa is filed,the reviewing court jurisdiction at the proceeding is limited to certain categories.f.in this action,the parties dispute whether the identity of rrmc group partners may be categorized as a reviewable item.
f specifies the categories that fall within a reviewing court jurisdiction as follows 
a court with which a petition is filed in accordance with this section shall have jurisdiction to determine all partnership items of the partnership for the partnership taxable year to which the notice of final partnership administrative adjustment relates,the proper allocation of such items among the partners,and the applicability of any penalty,addition to tax,or additional amount which relates to an adjustment to a partnership item.
f emphasis added.as relevant to this action,the court of federal claims may exercise jurisdiction to determine the identity of rrmc group partners if partnership identity is a partnership item for the relevant partnership tax year,and may then determine the proper allocation of such items among the partners.id.the statute defines a partnership item,in relevant part,as follows 
a ny item required to be taken into account for the partnership taxable year under any provision of subtitle a of the tax code to the extent regulations prescribed by the secretary provide that,for purposes of this subtitle,such item is more appropriately determined at the partnership level than at the partner level.
a.the statutory definition has two prongs a requirement that the item is one which must be taken into account for the partnership taxable year under any provision of subtitle a and a requirement that the secretary has concluded that the item is more appropriately determined at the partnership level than at the partner level.id.we must look to irs implementing regulations for guidance regarding both prongs of this inquiry.this is so for two reasons one governed by our case law and the other governed by the statutory text.
first,we concluded in keener that the reference in section a to subtitle a of the tax code is ambiguous,requiring that we give deference to any reasonable agency interpretation of that phrase.at citing chevron,natural res.def.council,next,the statute expressly requires that a partnership item be designated by the secretary via its regulatory authority as more appropriately determined at the partnership level than at the partner level.a.
thus,because the statute expressly refers to the regulations with respect to the second prong,and our precedent requires chevron deference to those regulations governing the first,we look to the regulations as the primary source for the definition of a partnership item.
treasury regulation a a implements the statutory definition of partnership item.subsection a of that provision defines a partnership item,in relevant part,as t he partnership aggregate and each partner share of i tems of income,gain,loss,deduction,or credit of the partnership.a a,a,a i the tax court determines whether partner identity would affect the partnership aggregate or each partner share of income,gain,loss,deductions,or credits of the partnership by examining the particular facts of the case before it.grigoraci comm r,cch,tax.memo lexis,at.if partner identity would affect the distributive shares reported to the partners,it is a partnership item for purposes of that case.id.at.if,under the particular facts of the case,partner identity would affect the distributive shares of the partnership,the item must be determined at the partnership level.see,blonien comm r,tax.lexis,at.
the statutory requirement that a partnership file an information return establishes a close relationship between allocation and partner identity.see a.that requirement mandates that a partnership information return identify the individuals who would be entitled to share in the taxable income if distributed and the amount of the distributive share of each individual.id.here,the parties dispute which partners are entitled to share in the taxable income and the distributive share of each party.the court of federal claims can not determine the parties who would be entitled to share in the taxable income and the distributive share of each party unless it properly identifies the true partners of the partnership.
one regional circuit that has considered this issue and the tax court have come to the same conclusion.in katz commissioner,the tenth circuit recognized the relationship between allocation and partner identity,cir.there,the taxpayer declared bankruptcy and attempted to allocate his share of losses incurred by partnerships in which he was a partner between his bankruptcy estate and himself.id.at.the irs determined that the losses should have been allocated entirely to the bankruptcy estate and attempted to challenge the allocation in a deficiency proceeding.id.at.the tenth circuit rejected the challenge.the court observed that the partnership was required to specify a partner income and losses on its partnership return.id.at.that task could not be accomplished unless allocation were conducted at the partnership level,the court observed.what is important is that the debtor was a partner during part of the partnership year,so the partnership returns must set forth the debtor share of income,loss,id.at.
the tax court,similarly,has found that partner identity can be necessary to properly allocate the partnership items.in blonien,the tax court found that partner identity was more appropriately determined at the partnership level because it could affect allocation of partnership items among the partners in that action.tax.lexis,at.blonien was a proceeding.the government argued that the court lacked jurisdiction to revisit a determination made in a prior,proceeding that the taxpayer,blonien,was a partner in the partnership.id.at.the tax court agreed with the government because,if blonien successfully argued that he was not a partner,the share of the partnership cod income wrongly allocated to blonien would have to be reallocated among the other partners.id.at.the tax court recognized that the determination of partner identity could be a partnerlevel determination where resolution of the issue would not affect the allocation of partnership items to the other partners,but found that resolution of that issue in blonien case would affect allocation.id.
this case is similar to blonien and katz.here,it is possible that the distributive shares reported to the partners of rrmc group would change if one or more of the cruts were disregarded.during the tax year,four heirs,four cruts,and rrmc management were listed as the partners of record on rrmc group partnership return.if the court of federal claims were to determine that some of the heirs transfers to the cruts were shams,each remaining partner share of the partnership items could change.if the court were to disregard one,two,or three of the cruts,for example,the distributive shares would be different than if the court were to disregard all of the cruts.in such a scenario,the court would be required to decide who should report the disregarded crut share.thus,while the validity of the cruts would not impact the partnership aggregate income,it could affect the remaining parties individual shares of that income.
even in cases in which the tax court determined that partner identity was not a determination,it recognized that the inquiry turns on the facts of the particular case and the effect that partner identity would have on the distributive shares.in grigoraci,the irs asserted in its fpaas that certain corporate partners were shams and sought to reallocate shares to certain individuals.tax.memo lexis,at.the taxpayers challenged the fpaas in a proceeding in the tax court.id.at.the government moved to dismiss on the ground that the identity of the partners was a issue over which the tax court lacked jurisdiction in the proceeding.id.at.the tax court began its analysis by stating that the hallmark of a partnership item is that it affects the distributive shares reported to the other partners.id.at.to that end,the tax court inquired whether identifying individuals rather than corporations as the true partners would affect the distributive shares.id.at.
the tax court noted that no dispute existed concerning the aggregate income,gain,loss,deductions,and credits of the partnership.id.at.it further noted that,even if the income were reallocated to the individual partners,there would be no dispute about the amount of the allocations made to the partners id.at.because the allocations would have no effect on either the partnership aggregate or each partner share of income,gain,loss,deductions,or credits of the partnership,the court concluded that partnership identity was not a partnership item on the facts of that case.id.at.while the tax court found that the partner identification question at issue before it was a partnerlevel determination,the court made clear that it made that determination based on the particular facts of that case under the circumstances of this case,we hold that a determination that the partners of record were not the true and actual partners is not a partnership item id.at emphasis added.
the facts of this case are distinct from those in grigoraci.rrmc group was required to report its gain or loss from the sale of the constellation stock on its partnership return.rrmc group also was required to assign that gain or loss to its partners.the irs fpaas challenged both the losses claimed by rrmc group and its assignment of certain of those losses to the cruts.as discussed above,whether those losses were properly assigned to the cruts could affect the distributive shares reported to the remaining partners.this is an exercise that must be conducted at the partnership level.
the court of federal claims relied on grigoraci and another tax court case,hang commissioner,to conclude that rrmc group partners identities can not be determined at the partnership level.specifically,relying on grigoraci,the court of federal claims concluded that identification of the partners in this case would not affect the distributive shares.the court stated that,w here t here is no dispute about the amount of the allocations made to the partners,as is the case before the court,a n item with no effect on either the partnership aggregate or each partner share of income,gain,loss,deductions,or credits of the partnership is not a partnership item.alpha i,united states,cv,opinion and order at quoting grigoraci,tax.memo lexis,at,and russian recovery fund united states,fed.cl.while the trial court was correct to rely on the general rule set forth in grigoraci,for the reasons noted above,its application of the facts at issue here to that rule was erroneous.
the court of federal claims reliance on hang also is misplaced.in hang,the tax court held that the identity of shareholders in an s corporation was more appropriately determined at the shareholder level,but based that conclusion on somewhat different reasoning than it employed in grigoraci.in hang,the irs attempted to reallocate an s corporation income from the two owners of record,who were minor children,to the children father,who was not an owner of record.at.the statute and regulations defining s corporation items in hang are analogous to the tefra provisions at issue here.see id.at.like the implementing regulation defining a partnership item,the regulation at issue in hang defined a subchapter s item,in relevant part,as t he s corporation aggregate and each shareholder share of,and any factor necessary to determine items of income,gain,loss,deduction,or credit of the corporation.id.at quoting.
because the father was not a shareholder of record,the tax court found that the irs proposed reallocation could not expressly fall within the scope of the s corporation aggregate,each shareholder share of,or any factor necessary to determine the income,gain,loss,deduction,or credit of the corporation.id.at.while the government argued that the tax court should find that the regulation nevertheless encompassed the proposed reallocation because the father was allegedly the beneficial owner of the corporation stock and could therefore qualify as a shareholder for purposes of the regulation,the tax court declined to adopt that argument.id.the court found that insufficient information existed at the corporate level to determine beneficial ownership a s a practical matter,there is no way for a corporation to determine who the beneficial owners of its stock are because the information necessary to make the determination would not be available at the corporate level where the beneficial owner of stock is not a shareholder of record.id.
here,the court of federal claims equated the relationship of the heirs to the cruts to that of the sons to the father in hang.it concluded that the rrmc group partnership is not in a position to go behind the transactions between a partner and its successor of record.both are questions of succession to interests that appear to the court to require determination at the individual taxpayer level.that analysis was incorrect,however.in hang,the scenario expressly fell outside the scope of the regulatory definition of an s corporation item because the father was not a shareholder of record.the tax court was required,consequently,to address the irs alternative theory of beneficial ownership by inquiring whether all information was available at the partnership level to determine whether the father was the beneficial shareholder.here,however,the scenario expressly falls within the regulation definition of a partnership item because all parties who could be identified as true partners the heirs,the cruts,and rrmc are listed as partners of record on the partnership information return,and the determination of the true partners in the partnership could affect the distributive shares attributed to one or more of those named partners the fact that the distributive shares could be affected by the determination of the partners identity is sufficient to sweep the issue within the definition of a partnership item,because the effect on the distributive shares is the hallmark of a partnership item.grigoraci,tax.memo lexis,at.
because partner identity in this case falls within the regulation definition of a partnership item,the court of federal claims erred in adding an additional layer to the analysis by requiring that all information necessary to determine the identity of rrmc group partners be available at the commencement of the proceedings.the taxpayers defend the trial court analysis,arguing that a court can not make findings in a proceeding on the intentions of the individual sands family members and the trustees of their charitable funds when they engaged in the crut transactions.the taxpayers are wrong.the court of federal claims can allow discovery and hear testimony in a proceeding as long as the inquiry regards a item,which we hold it does on these facts.indeed,adjudicating this issue in a proceeding is consistent with the congressional policy favoring that such issues be resolved in unified judicial proceedings.see afshar,tax law.tefra,et,stat.and keener,at.
the taxpayers next argue that the allocation among them will not change regardless of the identity of rrmc group true partners.they point out that the irs proposed disregarding the four cruts and reallocating the items reported by rrmc group among the four heirs in the same proportion they were allocated among the cruts.each heir,in other words,would merely stand in the shoes of its crut and be allocated the same share that its crut would have been allocated.the taxpayers claim that,because the partnership items would be allocated in the same manner among either four cruts or four heirs,the distributive shares would not change.
while the irs did propose such an allocation,its proposal does not deprive the court of federal claims of jurisdiction.the court of federal claims exercises de novo review of an fpaa and is not bound to follow the irs proposal.see jade trading,llc united states,fed.cl.the court of federal claims dismissed the portion of the fpaa at issue before it considered the fpaa merits.at this stage,we can not conclude with certainty that the trial court would accept the irs proposal if this matter were to proceed to trial 
tellingly,while the taxpayers argue that the allocation would not change under the irs proposal,they remain silent as to whether they agree with the irs proposal.they claim that the government has not pointed to anything that suggests rrmc group partnership items would be allocated to anyone other than the sands family member who made the transfer to the crut,but they do not reveal whether they would stipulate to such an allocation if the trial court were to consider the merits of it.thus,the record leaves open a live issue concerning allocation,which the court of federal claims must address on the merits.the irs proposal,therefore,does not control the jurisdictional issue.
the taxpayers also caution that the conclusion we reach here is tantamount to placing a continuing burden on partnerships to ascertain the identity of their partners.the taxpayers point out that many partnerships have hundreds or even thousands of partners whose partnership interests may be actively traded,and that congress never intended to burden partnerships with the responsibility of ascertaining their true partners.
the taxpayers are correct at least in the abstract.it is true,for example,that,after partners exchange their partnership interests,a partnership is not required to note such an exchange on its return until it is notified of the exchange.c.the taxpayers also observe,and the government does not dispute,that the irs does not require partnerships to do anything more than rely on their known partners of record to satisfy their obligation to file a return identifying the individuals who would be entitled to the partnership distributive shares under a.thus,the taxpayers correctly observe that partnerships are entitled to take their partners of record at face value.
the taxpayers are incorrect,however,in arguing that our holding,which is limited to the particular facts of this case,places a new and additional burden on all partnerships to ascertain the identity of their true partners.congress created tefra proceedings such as this one to provide a vehicle for determining partner identity when partner identity is challenged by the irs sometimes that is appropriate at the partnership level and sometimes it is appropriate at the partner level,depending upon the circumstances.partnerships do not bear the burden of identifying their true partners in all filings rather,the irs bears the burden of establishing that the partners are other than those identified as known partners in a partnership tax filings.where,as here,that challenge,if successful,would directly impact the number of distributive shares attributable to other members of the partnership,resolution of that question at the partnership level is appropriate.
for the foregoing reasons,the identity of the partners in rrmc group is appropriately determined at the partnership level 
with respect to the gross valuation misstatement penalty,the court of federal claims erred when it granted the taxpayers summary judgment on that penalty.the court of federal claims was wrong to conclude that it was not obligated to determine whether the taxpayers underpayments are attributable to a valuation misstatement merely because the taxpayers conceded the gain and loss adjustments in the fpaas.the cases on which the trial court relied for this conclusion misapply the valuation misstatement penalty,and,thus,do not properly characterize the law in this circuit.we review the court of federal claims ruling de novo.merino comm r,cir t he question of whether the valuation overstatement statute applies to a particular taxpayer situation is a question of law that we subject to plenary review.citing gainer comm r,cir.upon doing so,we vacate that ruling and remand for further penalty proceedings.
the tax code provides that a penalty shall be added to any portion of an underpayment of tax required to be shown on a return which is attributable to a ny substantial valuation misstatement.a b.a penalty may apply for both a substantial valuation misstatement and a gross valuation misstatement.the substantial valuation misstatement penalty applies when the value of any property or the adjusted basis of any property is or more of the amount the irs determines to be the correct amount the gross valuation misstatement penalty applies when the claimed value or basis is or more of the correct amount.e b i,h a ii i.here,the irs sought to impose a misstatement penalty based on its determination that the partnerships inflated the cost basis of the constellation stock by more than,the cost basis of the yahoo stock by more than,and the cost basis of the corning stock by more than.
the statute requires that any underpayment of tax on which a valuation misstatement penalty is based be attributable to the valuation misstatement.b.the taxpayers conceded the irs capital gain and loss adjustments in the fpaas solely on the ground of.they then argued that the underpayment of tax they conceded was not attributable to a valuation misstatement because does not address a valuation misstatement.that does not address a valuation misstatement,however,does not absolve the partnerships from liability for the penalty.
does not address the valuation of any claimed gain or loss.it provides that an individual deduction of certain losses must be limited to the amount considered at risk.a.the provision does not disallow the existence of a loss it limits the deduction of that loss.see id.because the deduction of a loss is typically at issue only with respect to an individual partner income tax return,the tax court has held that any question concerning whether an taxpayer meets the requirement of must be addressed in a,rather than,proceeding.hambrose leasing lp comm r,t he application of section is not a determination required to be taken into account for the partnership taxable year.quoting a.
thus,the partnerships alleged failure to report the alleged gains in this action is conceptually distinct from the issue presented in the context of.first,addresses the deduction of losses.the irs,however,did not take issue in the fpaas with the amount of loss deduction that the partnerships claimed.rather,the irs took issue with the partnership failures to report their gains.does not apply to gains.see a.second,the provision of,is generally a item.hambrose leasing,at.the irs,therefore,could not rely on,a provision that limits the deduction of a loss in a proceeding,to penalize the partnerships for undervaluing gains in proceeding.for the same reason,the partnerships could not rely on to concede the adjustments underlying the penalty that the irs sought 
the court of federal claims appeared to acknowledge that does not provide a valid basis for the partnerships concession.rather than confront this reality,however,the trial court concluded it was not required to address at all whether the partnerships relied on a valid basis for the concession or to look behind that concession to determine the real cause of the tax underpayment.the trial court stated that it was not required to endorse the validity of the ground on which plaintiffs made their concession,as long as the p laintiffs did not concede the adjustments on grounds relating to valuation that could cause the penalties to be applied.alpha i,united states,cv,opinion at penalty op.the trial court missed the point,however.the taxpayers could not revise the grounds upon which their underpayment of taxes actually is attributable by choosing to concede that underpayment on some other,invalid theory.
the court of federal claims cited several cases to support its decision to defer to the terms of the partnerships concession without further scrutiny,two of which it found particularly persuasive todd commissioner,cir,and gainer commissioner,cir.not only do we find those cases factually distinguishable from this one,we disagree with the legal analysis employed in todd and gainer,finding it flawed in material respects.
in todd,the fifth circuit affirmed the tax court ruling that penalties sought for valuation overstatements did not apply because the taxpayers underpayments were not attributable to the valuation overstatements.at.there,the irs disallowed certain depreciation deductions and credits because the property in question had not been placed in service during the tax years in issue.id.the irs separately imposed the penalty for valuation overstatement.id.the tax liability after adjusting for the failure to place the property in service did not differ from the tax liability after adjusting for the valuation overstatements.id.any alleged valuation overstatement,moreover,was irrelevant,because the property that was the subject of the alleged overvaluation misstatement was never placed in service during the relevant tax year.id.the fifth circuit,therefore,held that the tax underpayment could not be attributed to the valuation overstatement.id.
gainer involved the same fact pattern as todd.at.like the fifth circuit,the ninth circuit declined to impose valuation overstatement penalties where the irs separately disallowed depreciation deductions and credits because the property at issue was not placed in service during the relevant tax year.id.at.because a valid,independent basis for disallowing the deductions and credits existed,the court concluded that plaintiff overvaluation bec ame irrelevant to the determination of any tax due.id 
the court of federal claims concluded that this case is analogous to those in the todd and gainer category because,in its view,the adjustments were made on grounds unrelated to valuation penalty op.at.the trial court disregarded that a valid,independent basis for the adjustments existed in those cases.the only grounds on which the partnerships conceded the adjustments in this case was the inapplicable adjustment.the trial court,accordingly,analogized this case to cases in which a valid,independent basis existed for the adjustment,even though no such basis existed here.the analogy is inapt.thus,assuming we were persuaded by the legal theory employed in todd and gainer,we would find that theory inapplicable to the facts before us.
even if factually identical to this case,moreover,we are not persuaded that todd,gainer,and their progeny accurately apply the valuation misstatement penalty.indeed,the flaws in the analysis employed in todd and gainer are so apparent that subsequent panels of the circuit courts deciding those cases have questioned their holdings.
in todd,the fifth circuit looked to guidance from the blue book,a summary of the legislation prepared by the staff of the joint committee on taxation,to determine whether the tax underpayment at issue was attributable to a valuation misstatement.at interpreting staff of the joint committee on taxation,general explanation of the economic recovery tax act of,at comm.print blue book.the blue book proposed applying the following analytical rule the portion of a tax underpayment that is attributable to a valuation overstatement will be determined after taking into account any other proper adjustments to tax liability id.quoting blue book at.the blue book then proposed a formula for applying that rule the tax underpayment attributable to the valuation overstatement equals the difference between i actual tax liability,the tax liability that results from a proper valuation and which takes into account any other proper adjustments and ii actual tax liability as reduced by taking into account the valuation overstatement.id.quoting blue book at.the blue book then provided an example of the application of that rule if an improper deduction was claimed by the taxpayer as a result of a valuation misstatement,and another deduction of is disallowed totally for reasons apart from the valuation overstatement,then the overvaluation penalty should apply only to the former deduction,not to the latter unrelated deduction.id.at quoting blue book at.thus,if the taxpayer filing reflected a taxable income of,but the actual taxable income after adjusting for each improper deduction was,then the tax underpayment attributable to the valuation overstatement is r minus r,where r is the tax rate.see id.
the blue book,in sum,offers the unremarkable proposition that,when the irs disallows two different deductions,but only one disallowance is based on a valuation misstatement,the valuation misstatement penalty should apply only to the deduction taken on the valuation misstatement,not the other deduction,which is unrelated to valuation misstatement.
the court in todd mistakenly applied that simple rule to a situation in which the same deduction is disallowed based on both valuation theories.there,the irs disallowed the claim
