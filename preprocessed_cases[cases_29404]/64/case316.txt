this matter involves three appeals that arise out of a decision by the superior court of san diego county the san diego court or the court that plaintiff steven haskett haskett,the successor trustee of an irrevocable trust known as the desert falls trust,is not personally liable for a judgment for attorney fees and costs entered against him,in his representative capacity,by the superior court of riverside county the riverside court following dismissal of a contract action the riverside action that he prosecuted in his capacity as trustee.
in one of the three pending appeals in this matter,defendants james binger and rematch,together binger and rematch appeal from a may,order issued by the san diego court granting haskett petition the petition for a determination that he is not personally liable for attorney fees in the sum of about that the riverside court awarded to binger and rematch after the underlying contract action filed in that court,which was prosecuted but not initiated by haskett against them in his representative capacity as successor trustee of the subject irrevocable trust,and was dismissed on the ground it was not brought to trial within the statutory period as required by code of civil procedure sections the statute and.in granting the petition,the san diego court found that binger and rematch,and the other parties post that opposed haskett petition,failed to meet their burden of proving that he was personally at fault within the meaning of california probate code section on appeal,binger and rematch contend that the court erroneously concluded that haskett was not personally liable for the judgment for attorney fees and costs even if it is assumed that binger and rematch,in opposing haskett petition,were required to present evidence that the judgment of dismissal under the statute resulted from fault on his part,the undisputed evidence showed that he was responsible and the court correctly concluded that section does not excuse haskett from liability.
in a second appeal,defendants the villas at desert falls,the villas at desert falls,desert falls,the villas at desert falls ii,james temple,and mark temple collectively desert falls group,against whom haskett also prosecuted the riverside action and who opposed haskett petition,separately appeal from the same may,order of the san diego court determining that haskett is not personally liable for the judgment for attorney fees and other costs awarded to desert falls group in the sum of about.desert falls group appeals on grounds similar to those raised by binger and rematch,contending haskett can not invoke the protections of section see fn,ante he can be held personally liable in his representative capacity as trustee under section see fn,ante to the extent he had control of the trust the court reasoning that there were no facts to support a finding of negligence against haskett for purposes of section is unfair and prejudicial to desert falls group and other judgment creditors an innocent judgment creditor should not have to be concerned with the source of the fund that will be used to pay his claim and haskett has admitted that he is personally liable for acts that he undertook during the administration of the trust.
last,haskett filed a protective appeal challenging the san diego court earlier december,order rejecting haskett contention that section insulated him from personal liability for the judgment for attorney fees and costs entered against him in the riverside action.it is difficult to ascertain from haskett appellate brief his contentions in support of his appeal from that order,which he calls an interlocutory ruling.it appears,however,he is claiming the court ruling was erroneous because,although he was not a signatory to the settlement agreement discussed post from which the riverside action arose,he was entitled to the protection of section in his individual capacity because a predecessor trustee had validly entered into that agreement,and thus he haskett prosecuted the riverside action in accordance with his valid powers and duties as successor trustee.
this matter also involves a pending motion for sanctions sanctions motion filed by haskett in this court.haskett seeks sanctions in the amount of against all of the other parties jointly and severally under california rules of court,rules i and a,on the grounds they unnecessarily designated and included in their appellants joint appendix more than pages that were not part of the trial court record and are not reasonably material to the determination of their appeals.
we affirm the may,order challenged by binger and rematch,and by desert falls group.we conclude that haskett protective appeal is thus moot and deny his motion for sanctions.
factual and procedural background 
in february,a settlement agreement and general release hereafter the settlement agreement or the agreement was entered into by the partners of a general partnership known as the westfield group and appellants the villas at desert falls,and rematch,the general and limited partners,respectively,of appellant the villas at desert falls,a limited partnership.the settlement agreement,which was in resolution of pending litigation,provided that desert falls group would assign to the westfield group within days an percent interest in the profits and losses of the villas at desert falls partnership.the agreement also provided that the westfield group would assign its interest in the partnership to an irrevocable trust that was to be created thereafter.
later that month,on february,the desert falls trust hereafter also referred to as the trust was created in accordance with the terms of the agreement.the trust agreement under which the trust was created named michael criste as the initial trustee.
morris sankary succession as trustee,and the filing of the riverside action 
in early,a disagreement arose between criste the initial trustee and the westfield group.in resolution of this disagreement,morris sankary sankary was appointed as interim trustee.
on february,the westfield group among others commenced the underlying action against desert falls group and others by filing in the superior court of riverside county a complaint alleging various causes of action based on an alleged breach of the settlement agreement,which had provided for the creation of the trust as already discussed.sankary,acting in his capacity as trustee,prepared and filed the original complaint on behalf of the westfield group.haskett,who was not yet a successor trustee in this matter,did not participate in the filing of this lawsuit.
haskett succession as trustee 
in may,sankary tendered his resignation as trustee,and haskett agreed to serve as successor trustee.in august,the court in riverside county appointed haskett as successor trustee with full powers and duties in administering and managing the trust estate,and authorized haskett to file in the san diego court any petitions related to the administration of the trust.
in february,while acting in his representative capacity as successor trustee,haskett filed a fifth amended complaint in the riverside action.this pleading named haskett,in his representative capacity as trustee,as the plaintiff.
dismissal of the riverside action orders and judgment awarding fees and costs 
in april,more than five years after sankary filed the original complaint in the riverside action in february,binger and rematch filed a motion to dismiss the action on the ground that haskett did not bring it to trial within the statutory period as required by code of civil procedure sections and in may,desert falls group also filed a motion to dismiss the action on the same ground.
on december,the riverside court granted both motions to dismiss and entered two judgments dismissing the riverside action with prejudice one in favor of desert falls group,and the other in favor of binger and rematch.the former provided that desert falls group may recover costs from plaintiff steven haskett,but did not expressly state whether haskett was personally liable for those costs.the latter provided that binger and rematch may recover costs from plaintiff steven haskett,but similarly did not state whether haskett was personally liable for those costs.
attorney fees awards 
in february,binger and rematch filed in the riverside court a motion for attorney fees it had incurred in the riverside action.desert falls group also filed a motion for attorney fees.
on april,the riverside court issued an order granting binger and rematch fee motion and awarded reasonable attorney fees in the amount of about in favor of binger and rematch and against plaintiff steven haskett.the order,by interlineation,indicated that the award was against haskett in his representative capacity as trustee.the order directed the clerk to immediately interlineate the judgment dated january,to include award of attorneys fees of and costs as set forth in binger and rematch memorandum of costs.
on that same date,the riverside court issued another order granting desert falls group fee motion and awarded reasonable attorney fees and other costs in the amount of about in favor of desert falls group and against plaintiff,steven haskett,trustee of the desert falls trust.italics added.as indicated,this order,like the order in favor of binger and rematch,expressly awarded the fees and other costs against haskett in his representative capacity as trustee.the order directed the clerk to immediately interlineate the judgment dated december,to include the award of attorneys fees and costs in the total amount of.
at the hearing on the attorney fee motions,the riverside court stated i t is up to the probate court to make a determination whether or not the judgment,the award of attorney fees are payable by the trust assets or by haskett individually.
judgment debtor examination 
in may,desert falls group obtained an order from the san diego court directing haskett to appear for a judgment debtor examination scheduled for a date in june.
haskett petition for confirmation of no personal liability 
on the day before he was scheduled to appear for the judgment debtor examination,haskett,in his capacity as trustee,filed in the san diego court a petition for confirmation that trustee has no personal liability for judgments had against trustee in the trustee representative capacity the petition under section in the petition,citing section haskett sought an order declaring that he was not personally liable for any order or judgment for attorney fees and other costs entered against him,in his representative capacity as trustee,in the riverside action.he argued that he was protected from personal liability under section because former trustee sankary and he had prosecuted the riverside action in their capacities as trustees,in the name of the trust,and for the purpose of enforcing the trust contractual rights under the settlement agreement.
the court held several hearings on the petition and issued three orders 
the court september,order 
on september,following a hearing held about three weeks earlier on august,the court granted the relief that haskett sought by issuing a written order the september,order in which the court ruled that haskett was not personally liable for the judgments entered against him in his representative capacity in the riverside action.the court found that on september,the riverside court had issued certain nunc pro tunc orders,upon haskett ex parte application,making clear that all of the orders and judgments for attorney fees and costs entered in favor of desert falls group and binger and rematch by the riverside court in the riverside action referred to haskett only in his representative capacity as trustee of the trust and not individually.italics added.
the court also found that by reason of these nunc pro tunc orders of the riverside court,the issue presented in the petition as to whether haskett was personally liable was moot.it also found that the judgments entered by the riverside court were res judicata on this issue.
motions for reconsideration 
in late september,binger and rematch challenged the court september,order by filing a motion for reconsideration,claiming that the riverside court nunc pro tunc correction of the judgment entered in favor of binger and rematch in the riverside action did not absolve haskett of personal liability for the judgment.binger and rematch claimed among other things that the riverside court,in granting the ex parte orders on september,did not rule on the issue of whether haskett was personally liable for the judgment entered against him.desert falls group also filed a motion for reconsideration on similar grounds.
the court december,order 
on december,following a hearing held in november,the court issued an order the december,order granting the motions for reconsideration,reversing the september,order,and denying haskett petition.the court rejected haskett argument that he was exempt from personal liability under section.specifically,the court found that section did not apply because haskett did not enter into the settlement agreement as trustee during administration of the trust 
t he exception to personal liability under section applies only to situations where,unlike here,the trustee,in his fiduciary capacity on behalf of the trust,enters into a contract with a third party during the administration of the trust.the exception has no application to the facts of this case as haskett did not enter into the settlement agreement in his fiduciary capacity as trustee during the administration of the desert falls trust.italics added.
the court also ordered,however,that haskett,desert falls group,and binger and rematch appear at another hearing on the issue of haskett personal liability,explaining that its order denying haskett petition was not dispositive of the issue because haskett petition limited the court inquiry to whether or not section absolved haskett from personal liability.the court also ordered that the burden of showing why haskett should be held personally liable for any order or judgment for attorneys fees or costs as entered in the riverside court rests with judgment creditors binger and rematch and desert falls group.
amended petition 
in february,haskett amended his petition the amended petition.through the amendments,he asserted several additional grounds why the court should find he is not personally liable for the judgment for fees and other costs in the riverside action.he claimed among other things that under the provisions of section which provides for personal liability of a trustee only if the trustee is personally at fault,he could not be held personally liable because at no time did he act or fail to act in a manner that was either intentionally or negligently wrongful toward the defendants in the riverside action 
the parties submitted additional briefs and a declaration by binger and rematch attorney.the hearing was held on march,and the court took the matter under submission.
the court may,order 
on may,the court issued the written order the may,order from which desert falls group and binger and rematch appeal.the court granted the petition for confirmation that haskett was not personally liable for the judgment for fees and costs entered against him in his representative capacity as trustee in the riverside action.the court found that desert falls group and binger and rematch,as the judgment creditors,had failed to carry their burden of demonstrating negligent or intentional conduct by haskett in the prosecution of the riverside action which would warrant the imposition of personal liability for the judgment for attorney fees and costs.the court explained its reasoning 
while section states a trustee is personally liable for obligations arising from ownership or control of trust property,personal liability may only be imposed if the trustee is personally at fault.a trustee is personally at fault when the trustee,either intentionally or negligently,acts or fails to act.desert falls group and binger and rematch have failed to produce any admissible evidence to show how haskett personally,either intentionally or negligently,caused the riverside action to be dismissed.rather,the only facts that this court has been presented with are that the action was dismissed,not the circumstances behind the dismissal.third italics added.
the court also explained that they had also failed to provide any legal authority that would allow the court to automatically draw an inference of negligence or a failure to act,without any facts in support thereof,from what appears to be a bare dismissal pursuant to under code of civil procedure sections and.the court also found that haskett was not personally liable under probate code section which provides for personal liability for torts only if the trustee is personally at fault,because there was no evidence that he had committed a tort during the administration of the trust.the court rejected the contention that section required an automatic finding of personal liability,explaining that section merely governs the procedure for the assertion of claims against the trust estate.in sum,the court found that haskett was not personally liable for the judgment for attorney fees and costs.
discussion 
we begin our discussion with a brief summary of the three pending appeals and the principal issue they present.
introduction 
in separate but similar appeals,desert falls group and binger and rematch appeal from the may,order granting haskett amended petition for confirmation that he is not personally liable for the judgment for attorney fees and costs entered against him,in his representative capacity,by the riverside court following dismissal under code of civil procedure sections of the riverside action that he and a former trustee sankary had prosecuted in their representative capacities as trustees of the subject irrevocable trust created under the settlement agreement.in that order,the court found among other things that desert falls group and binger and rematch failed to meet their burden of proving that haskett was personally at fault within the meaning of section for the failure to bring the riverside action to trial within the statutory period,which resulted in the dismissal of that action.
in his protective appeal,haskett challenges the court earlier december,order rejecting haskett contention that section insulated him from personal liability for the judgment for attorney fees and costs entered against him in the riverside action.
the principal issue presented is whether the court correctly ruled that haskett is not personally liable for the judgment for attorney fees and costs entered against him,in his representative capacity.we first address desert falls group appeal from the may,order granting haskett amended petition for confirmation that he is not personally liable for the judgment for attorney fees and costs entered against him.
appeal by desert falls group 
desert falls group contends that haskett can not invoke the protections of section see fn,ante he can be held personally liable in his representative capacity as trustee under section to the extent he had control of the trust the court reasoning that there were no facts to support a finding of negligence against haskett for purposes of section is unfair and prejudicial to desert falls group and other judgment creditors an innocent judgment creditor should not have to be concerned with the source of the fund that will be used to pay his claim and haskett has admitted that he is personally liable for acts that he undertook during the administration of the trust.
court finding that desert falls group failed to carry its burden of proving haskett is personally liable under sections and 
we begin by rejecting desert falls group second haskett can be held personally liable in his representative capacity as trustee under section to the extent he had control of the its third the court reasoning that there were no facts to support a finding of negligence against haskett for purposes of section is unfair and prejudicial to desert falls group.these contentions are based on the court findings that desert falls group failed to meet its burden of proving that haskett was personally at fault within the meaning of sections and for the failure to bring the riverside action to trial within the statutory period,which resulted in the mandatory dismissal of that action in december.
section provides 
a trustee is personally liable for obligations arising from ownership or control of trust property only if the trustee is personally at fault.italics added.
as the court properly noted in the may,order,the law revision commission comment that accompanies that section explains the statutory phrase personally at fault set forth therein 
a trustee is personally at fault when the trustee either intentionally or negligently,acts or fails to act cal.law revision com,west ann.ed.foll,italics added.
section provides 
a trustee is personally liable for torts committed in the course of administration of the trust only if the trustee is personally at fault.italics added.
the relevant portion of the law revision commission comment that accompanies section provides that a trustee is personally at fault when the trustee commits a tort either intentionally or negligently.cal.law revision com,west ann.ed.foll,italics added.
a trustee thus can not be held personally liable under section for any obligation arising from his ownership or control of trust property,nor can he be held personally liable under section for any torts committed in the course of his administration of the trust,unless the party seeking to impose such personal liability on the trustee demonstrates that the trustee intentionally or negligently acted or failed to act in a manner that establishes personal fault,cal.law revision com,west ann,supra,foll.
we reject desert falls group assertion that t he test for personal liability under section is whether the trustee had control of the trust.original boldface.a trustee who like haskett acted in his representative capacity can not be held personally liable under section for an obligation such as the judgment that is the subject of the instant appeals,solely upon a showing that the obligation arose out of his ownership or control of the trust property.the imposition of such personal liability must also rest on a finding of personal fault supported by a sufficient showing that the trustee conduct was intentional or negligent,cal.law revision com,west ann,supra,foll.
here,desert falls group,as one of the parties attempting to hold haskett personally liable under sections and for the subject judgment entered against him in the riverside action,thus had the burden under the foregoing authorities of proving that the failure to bring the riverside action to trial,and thus the dismissal of that action,resulted from conduct by haskett that was either intentional or negligent.the record shows,however,that desert falls group and binger and rematch,as discussed post made no such showing in either its written response to haskett original petition,or in its responsive pleadings in opposition to his amended petition.rather,as the court properly found,the only facts that desert falls group presented during the petition proceeding are that the riverside action was dismissed,not the circumstances behind the dismissal.
even had desert falls group shown that haskett intentionally or negligently failed to bring the riverside action to trial within the statutory period,on the facts of the instant case the imposition of personal liability would have been improper because the concept of fault is a tort concept,and desert falls group has failed to cite any legal authority demonstrating that haskett owed a duty of care to desert falls group or binger and rematch.haskett and desert falls group were litigation adversaries haskett in his representative capacity as trustee was the plaintiff,and desert falls group was a defendant that ultimately became a judgment creditor when the riverside action was dismissed under the statute.
in sum,the record shows that desert falls group failed to meet its statutory burden under sections and of showing that haskett was personally at fault.accordingly,we conclude the court properly found that haskett is not personally liable to desert falls group for the judgment for attorney fees and costs entered against him in the riverside action.
because we have concluded that the court properly found that haskett is not personally liable for the subject judgment,we need not,and do not,reach the merits of desert falls group first contention that haskett can not invoke the protections of section see fn,ante.
innocent judgment creditors 
citing section,desert falls group also contends that the court erred by finding that haskett is not personally liable for the judgment because an innocent third party creditor should not have to be concerned with the source of the fund that will be used to pay his claim.section provides 
a claim based on a contract entered into by a trustee in the trustee representative capacity,on an obligation arising from ownership or control of trust property,or on a tort committed in the course of administration of the trust may be asserted against the trust by proceeding against the trustee in the trustee representative capacity,whether or not the trustee is personally liable on the claim.italics added.
in support of its contention that it may look either to the assets of the trust or to haskett personal assets for payment of the judgment,desert falls group also quotes from a report of the california law revision commission supporting the adoption of section 
b the third person should not have to be concerned with the source of the fund that will be used to pay the claim.the proposed law adopts this position.hence,a third person with a claim against the trust or trustee may assert the claim against the trust by bringing an action against the trustee in the trustee representative capacity.see witkin,summary of cal.law ed.trusts,quoting cal.law revision com,fns.omitted.
the rules of statutory interpretation are.as in any case involving statutory interpretation,our fundamental task here is to determine the legislature intent so as to effectuate the law purpose.citation.we begin by examining the statute words,giving them a plain and commonsense meaning.citation.we do not,however,consider the statutory language in isolation.citation.rather,we look to the entire substance of the statute in order to determine the scope and purpose of the provision citation.citation.that is,we construe the words in question in context,keeping in mind the nature and obvious purpose of the statute citation.citation.we must harmonize the various parts of a statutory enactment by considering the particular clause or section in the context of the statutory framework as a whole.citations.people murphy cal th,d,murphy.
applying these principles,we note that none of the provisions of section,when given their plain and commonsense meanings,confer upon a creditor the absolute right to proceed against the trustee personal assets for payment of a claim.the statute words plainly state that the enumerated types of claims may be asserted against the trust by proceeding against the trustee in the trustee representative capacity,whether or not the trustee is personally liable on the claim.italics added.this language plainly confers a right to proceed against the assets of the trust.the final clause,stating whether or not the trustee is personally liable on the claim,does not confer an absolute right to proceed against the trustee personal assets.rather,it plainly suggests that the creditor may seek payment of a claim from the personal assets of the trustee only if the trustee is personably liable.the law revision commission comment on the enactment of section supports the foregoing interpretation of that section.section alters the prior case law rule that the trustee could not be sued in a representative capacity where the trust estate was not liable.citations.cal.law revision com,west ann,supra,foll,italics added.
the statutory language of section can not be read in isolation.murphy,supra,cal th at,d.rather,on the facts of the instant case,it must be considered in the context of the statutory framework as a whole and read in conjunction with section discussed ante,which provides that a trustee is personally liable for obligations arising from ownership or control of trust property only if the trustee is personally at fault.italics added.as already discussed,a finding that a trustee is personally at fault within the meaning of section must be based on evidence that the trustee either intentionally or negligently,act ed or fail ed to act cal.law revision com,west ann,supra,foll,italics added.
the excerpt from the california law revision commission report discussed ante on which desert falls group relies does not require a different interpretation of section,because it does not expressly or by implication relieve a creditor seeking payment of a claim from a trustee personal assets from the statutory requirement of showing that the trustee was personally at fault.in sum,we reject desert falls group contention that under section it may look either to the assets of the trust or to haskett personal assets for payment of the judgment without having to demonstrate personal fault on the part of the trustee.here,it is undisputed that haskett prosecuted the riverside action action only in his representative capacity as trustee.for reasons already discussed,we have concluded that the court properly found that desert falls group failed to carry its burden of establishing that haskett was personally at fault,and it did not err by granting the relief that haskett requested in his amended petition.
haskett alleged admission 
last,desert falls group contends that haskett admitted that he is personally liable for acts that he undertook during the administration of the trust.we reject this contention.specifically,desert falls group claims that haskett admitted that he is personally liable for the subject judgment in two statements he made to the court during the hearing held on august.in the first,haskett stated 
haskett prior to,the law was that the trustee was personally liable for all the obligations that occurred in the administration of the trust.so prior to i would be personally liable for this judgment.the problem with that,of course,is that trustees did not want to pursue contract claims,for fear of contractual attorney fee obligations.so they changed the law in 
haskett made the second statement during the following exchange with the court 
the court haskett,to boil it all down,you in effect are resting your case on protection afforded by section is that right 
haskett that is exactly right,your honor.
none of these statements provides a basis for reversing the court order granting haskett amended petition.haskett statement to the court that he rested his case on the protection afforded by the provisions of section was not offered to prove the existence or nonexistence of any fact material to the ultimate issue of whether he was personally liable for the judgment for attorney fees and costs and did not constitute evidence.it was a legal argument.
furthermore,the hearing at which haskett made the foregoing statements was a proceeding that involved his original petition,filed on june,which was based on the provisions of section.it is undisputed that haskett thereafter filed an amended petition on february,in which he asserted several additional grounds why the court should find he was not personally liable for the judgment for fees and other costs in the riverside action.in that amended petition,he claimed among other things that under the provisions of section which as already discussed provides for personal liability of a trustee only if the trustee is personally at fault,he could not be held personally liable because at no time did he act or fail to act in a manner that was either intentionally or negligently wrongful toward the defendants in the riverside action 
desert falls group does not contest on appeal the merits of haskett argument to the court that the legislature in changed the law regarding personal liability of trustees in order to provide them more protection.as haskett properly notes in his appellate brief,this court in torrey pines bank hoffman d.hoffman acknowledged that before the legislature changed the law,the rules developed by case law had provided contrary to now effective section that a truste
