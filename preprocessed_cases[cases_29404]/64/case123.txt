akira akazawa akira and palm crest,collectively the appellants appeal the united states district court for the central district of california grant of link new technology international,link motion for summary judgment based on lack of standing.akira akazawa link new tech.int l,no.sacv.because issues of japanese intestacy law must be resolved by the district court in order to determine whether akira owned patent the patent,and therefore possessed standing to bring the present suit,we vacate the district court grant of summary judgment and remand for further proceedings.
yasumasa akazawa yasumasa is the only named inventor on the patent,and he owned the patent at the time of his death on march.yasumasa did not have an executed will when he died.thus,under japanese law hitomi akazawa hitomi,yuki akazawa yuki,and fumi akazawa fumi,his wife and daughters respectively,are yasumasa only heirs.yuki and fumi assigned their interest in the patent to hitomi in an inheritance agreement.hitomi then executed an assignment transferring all rights in the patent to akira.
on october,the appellants filed suit against link alleging infringement of the patent.link moved for summary judgment on the basis that akira did not have standing to file the infringement suit.the district court opined that japanese law may determine who the patent could be transferred to upon yasumasa death,but the patent act determines the manner by which the assignment must be made.id.at.it concluded that when yasumasa died,title to the patent was held by his estate until properly assigned in writing by the legal representative of the estate and that it was akira burden to prove that a writing transferring the patent from yasumasa estate to his heirs exists or that some other chain of title gives akira ownership of the patent.id.at.the district court therefore held that akira had not met his burden and granted link motion for summary judgment.
the appellants appeal,and we have jurisdiction under a.
whether a party has standing to sue is a question of law that we review de novo.see prima tek ii.
the parties focus on the interplay between and japanese law,as they did at the district court.section states that a pplications for patent,patents,or any interests therein,shall be assignable in law by an instrument in writing.link argues that this provision mandates a writing where there is a transfer upon death in order for there to be a proper assignment between two entities.according to link,any conflict between united states patent law and japanese intestacy law must be resolved in favor of united states law,because f oreign law has no place in the determination of rights and responsibilities under the p atent act.thus,in link view,akira does not own the patent because there was never a writing transferring the patent from the estate of yasumasa to hitomi,yuki,and fumi,the inheritance agreement between mother and daughters and the assignment between hitomi and akira notwithstanding.
the appellants,on the other hand,argue that under japanese intestacy law any property owned by yasumasa transferred immediately to his,yuki,and fumi.see minp√¥,japan,translated in hiroshi oda sian stickings,basic japanese laws in other words,a writing transferring the patent from yasumasa estate to hitomi,yuki,and fumi was not needed,because by operation of japanese law,hitomi,yuki,and fumi owned the patent immediately upon yasumasa death.indeed,under the appellants argument,any such writing purporting to transfer the patent from yasumasa estate would be a nullity,because the estate never owned the patent.
we conclude that the district court focus solely on section was erroneous.section of title states that e very patent shall contain a short title of the invention and a grant to the patentee,his heirs or assigns,of the right to exclude others from making,using,offering for sale,or selling the invention throughout the united states a emphasis added.as both parties note,patent ownership may be transferred by assignment,and section addresses such a assignments to be in writing.see.however,there is nothing that limits assignment as the only means for transferring patent ownership.indeed,the case law illustrates that ownership of a patent may be changed by operation of law.
of particular relevance to the present case is stickle heublein.in that case,the alleged infringer argued that the case should have been dismissed for the plaintiff failure to establish that the named parties owned the entire right,title,and interest in the patents at issue.the district court was not moved by the infringer argument,concluding that under texas law title to the patents passed to the patent owner heirs,the plaintiffs,upon his death.we agreed,noting that at the time of stickle the patent owner death texas law provided that w hen a person dies,leaving a lawful will,all of his estate bequeathed by such will shall vest immediately in the legatees of such estate id.at quoting probate code,while the district court correctly observed that stickle does not absolutely resolve the question at hand because it involves a written will that could fulfill the requirement,the case nonetheless supports the more relevant proposition that patent title may be transferred according to state probate law.see also winkler studebaker,stating u nder the indiana law,if there be no debts and no administration,personal property vests by operation of law in the next of kin.citations omitted this patent was not administered and passed by operation of law to those legally entitled to it.
the district court relied primarily on the language of the the implicit,but unsupported,assumption that intestate succession is an assignment and on two cases shaw relief valve city of new bedford,and bradley dull,which simply apples shaw.those cases are neither binding on us nor helpful in the analysis.shaw relief valve considered an amendment to the patent statutes that deleted the words executors and administrators from a section granting a patent to the patentee,his heirs and assigns.at.the shaw court held that the omission of the phrase executors and administrators did not alter the ordinary rule that a patent,like any personal property,follows the ordinary course,and goes to the executor or administrator in trust for the next of kin.id.the court thus rejected the defendant argument that a grant of title to the plaintiff by the administrator was invalid because the language of the patent statutes preempted ordinary probate law.id.this has little bearing on the question at hand it does not stand for the proposition that patent rights vest in an executor at death and until assigned in writing,but if anything supports the proposition that the question of when and to whom title is transferred is determined by state law.
our case law is clear that state law,not federal law,typically governs patent ownership.see jim arnold hydrotech,stating the question of who owns the patent rights and on what terms typically is a question exclusively for state courts.accordingly,we have looked to state law when determining ownership of the patent following a patent owner death.
applying this principle to the present case would require looking to foreign law,as opposed to state law,to determine ownership of the yasumasa was a resident of japan at the time of his death.we addressed a similar issue in international nutrition horphag research.in that case,a party argued that ownership of a united states patent is a matter of united states patent law and that granting comity based on a determination of ownership under french law would be contrary to united states patent law.id.at.after noting that patent ownership is typically a question of state law,not federal law,we explained that a contractual agreement to apply french law as to ownership is just as valid as an agreement to apply the law of a particular state.id.we discerned no conflict between united states patent law and enforcing the intentions of the parties that the contract be interpreted under the laws of a foreign country.
similarly,we see no reason japanese law should not control ownership of the patent here.indeed,the district court
