in this case,we hold that a testamentary trust no contest clause providing that one beneficiary contest voids other beneficiaries bequests along with the contestant does not,in itself,violate public policy.
elizabeth wells elizabeth appeals from an order following the trial court finding that the no contest clause in a trust established by her father was void as against public policy.she contends that the provision in question does not violate public policy and is not otherwise void.following our review of california and foreign authorities in this case of first impression,we agree with elizabeth and reverse.
robert and hazel wells,parents of the parties in this case,created a living trust in november when hazel died in,the trust assets were divided into a survivor trust,a bypass trust,and an exemption trust pursuant to the living trust terms.robert wells wells,trustee of the survivor trust,distributed all of that trust assets to himself,then in january created the robert sheaff wells family trust trust and transferred the survivor trust assets into it.the trust named his five children as beneficiaries robert wells,robert,elizabeth,robyn rae tunstall robyn,judith ann conner judith,and dianne jean morton dianne.the trust provided that upon wells death,robyn,judith,and dianne would each receive,and all other assets would be distributed to robert,and elizabeth.elizabeth was designated trustee after wells death.
the trust originally included a standard no contest clause stating that if any trust beneficiary contested the trust,then that beneficiary would be specifically disinherited.in february,wells amended the trust no contest clause to read,for the purpose of this paragraph the no contest clause,if any one of the trustor daughters,robyn,judith dianne,should be the contesting person as described above,then in that event the gift sic to all three daughters are hereby revoked.wells died in march,survived by all five children.
in july,robyn filed a safe harbor application pursuant to probate code section to determine whether the february amended no contest clause violated public policy and was void robyn did not challenge the validity of the trust original,unamended no contest clause,and she acknowledged that she would lose her gift from the trust if she contested it.in response,elizabeth denied that the amended no contest clause violated public policy.in september,judith and dianne joined robyn petition solely to determine whether the no contest clause applied to them if robyn contested the trust.
on october,the trial court heard the parties arguments.robyn counsel maintained that the amended no contest clause was punitive and against public policy in that it was designed to keep an entire class of beneficiaries from going to court to challenge the trust.elizabeth counsel countered that the clause was favored by public policy.noting concerns that the clause allowed one of elizabeth sisters to revoke unilaterally the other two sisters gifts,whether out of spite,collusion with elizabeth,or other ill motives,the trial court struck the february amendment as contrary to public policy.elizabeth timely appealed 
discussion 
elizabeth contends that the trust no contest clause is neither overbroad nor against public policy,and that a provision conditioning a testamentary gift to a beneficiary on there being no contest by another beneficiary is valid under california law.although she finds no california authority that directly addresses this particular issue,she cites authorities in california that have upheld no contest clauses disinheriting the contestant and cases from other states that have upheld provisions similar to the one in this case.
because this is a question of first impression in california,we review both california law and the law of other states in determining that a provision such as the trust no contest clause,which conditions testamentary gifts to various beneficiaries on the absence of a contest of the testamentary document by any one of them,is valid under california law.
no contest clauses in wills or trusts,sometimes called in terrorem or forfeiture clauses,provide that for beneficiaries to take gifts under a testamentary instrument,they must acquiesce to the terms of that instrument,subd.d burch george cal th,d,abrogation on a different point by later legislative enactment recognized by in re estate of rossi th,d estate of davies,supra,th at,d estate of kaila th,d.such clauses seek to prevent contests of wills or trusts by threatening disinheritance of beneficiaries who might otherwise challenge the instruments hence the label in terrorem.see estate of kaila,supra,th at,d the purpose of no contest clauses is to discourage will contests by imposing a penalty of forfeiture against beneficiaries who challenge the will.the operation and applicability of testamentary no contest clauses is partly,but not entirely,controlled by statute.this part is not intended as a complete codification of the law governing enforcement of a no contest clause.the common law governs enforcement of a no contest clause to the extent this part does not apply.see also estate of ferber th,d.
extensive california authority spanning more than a century supports the general validity of no contest clauses that disinherit a contesting heir.see,et estate of davies,supra,th at,d estate of kaila,supra,th at,d burch george,supra,cal th at,d,estate of black d.estate of friedman d.estate of goyette d.estate of markham d,in re kitchen cal,estate of miller cal,estate of hite cal.no contest clauses are valid in california and are favored by the public policies of discouraging litigation and giving effect to the purposes expressed by the testator.citations.burch george,supra,cal th at,d,see also estate of hite,supra,cal.at.
the legislature,however,has limited the reach of no contest clauses.the probate code provides that certain challenges to testamentary instruments,such as those involving allegations of forgery,later revocation,or provisions involving drafters or witnesses,or those statutorily declared to be protected by public policy,will never trigger a no contest clause.because the threat of forfeiture for contesting a will or trust is so dire,section also provides that after such an instrument has become irrevocable,a beneficiary may apply to the probate court for a determination whether a particular petition,motion,or other act by that beneficiary would constitute a contest to the testamentary instrument under the no contest clause.see also estate of davies,supra,th at,d.included among the issues that may be determined by such a safe harbor petition under section is whether a provision in a testamentary instrument violates public policy,because any other rule would make a clause virtually impenetrable to public policy attacks and could not be countenanced by the courts.estate of davies,supra,th at,fn,d see also estate of ferber,supra,th at,d.beneficiaries must be free to raise public policy issues so the court may address them.estate of ferber,supra,th at,d.
the interpretation of a will or trust instrument presents a question of law unless interpretation turns on the credibility of extrinsic evidence or a conflict therein.burch george,supra,cal th at,d.if the parties do not dispute the facts,as in this case,it is our duty to independently construe the trust instrument.ibid.at,d,see also estate of ferber,supra,th at,d.thus we review de novo whether the trust no contest clause violates public policy.estate of davies,supra,th at,d see also florio lau th,d.
authorities consistently emphasize and reaffirm that even though a no contest clause is strictly construed to avoid forfeiture,it is the testator intentions that control,and a court must not rewrite the testator will in such a way as to immunize legal proceedings plainly intended to frustrate the testator unequivocally expressed intent from the reach of the clause.citation.burch george,supra,cal th at,d,see also,estate of davies,supra,th at,d estate of kaila,supra,th at,d estate of markham,supra,d at.in this case,there is no question as to wells intent in adding his february amendment to the trust,and robyn does not allege any uncertainty he intended that a will contest by any one of elizabeth three sisters would trigger forfeiture of the testamentary gifts to each of them.construed strictly or broadly,the meaning is clear.
robyn contends that notwithstanding wells clear intent,certain public policy concerns require us to find the no contest clause invalid.some of these alleged public policies are not in issue,however,because of judicial or statutory limitations on no contest clauses.robyn,invoking estate of ferber,supra,th,d,contends that the state has a strong interest in protecting the rights of trust beneficiaries,that they must have access to courts to challenge trust terms that violate public policy and breaches of fiduciary duty,and that the trust no contest clause improperly obstructs such access.the no contest clause,however,does not prevent elizabeth sisters from raising public policy claims they are free to do that through a section application,as they have done here.estate of ferber,supra,th at,d.nor does the clause discourage challenging a trustee breach of fiduciary duty.elizabeth,as successor trustee,has a fiduciary duty to administer the trust solely in the interest of the beneficiaries,and under statutorily declared public policy,the sisters may challenge elizabeth exercise of fiduciary power without triggering the no contest clause pursuant to section,subdivision b.hermanson hermanson th,d.regarding the trial court apprehension that elizabeth could collude with any one of her sisters to have that sister contest the will and so deny the other sisters their gifts,the no contest clause would not prevent the aggrieved sisters from challenging elizabeth exercise of fiduciary power,subd.b.
citing estate of ferber,robyn argues that the clause impinges on the integrity of the probate court.the argument fails.the legislature,by imposing numerous limitations on the operation of no contest clauses,already has acted extensively to protect litigants access to the courts and the integrity of the probate court.thus,legislative limitations on no contest clauses protect the public policies discussed in estate of ferber,supra,th at pages,d nor do we perceive any threat to judicial integrity in upholding the clause.
robyn contends that no contest clauses are not strongly favored by law because their enforcement brings forfeiture the traditional public policy disfavoring forfeitures also concerns testamentary no contest clauses.estate of kaila,supra,th at,d estate of black d.but to address this concern,no contest clauses are strictly construed,which is consistent with the public policy to avoid a forfeiture absent the donor clear intent.estate of kaila,supra,th at,d,italics added.thus,this public policy only applies where the testator intent is unclear.here,as we have discussed,wells intent to establish a forfeiture condition was clear.
of the other grounds offered to support the contention that the trust no contest clause violated public and inadequate due cited no authorities to support the invocation of these public policy interests or how they apply to this case.nonetheless,we address these grounds.
briefly,overbreadth,like the related concept of vagueness,is a doctrine in constitutional law that applies to legislative enactments or similar state actions that sweep too broadly beyond the government legitimate purpose and invade constitutionally protected rights excessively.williams garcetti cal th,d,d constitutional law,black law dict.ed.we do not see how this doctrine could apply to this case,or to the no contest clause in any private testamentary instrument.the same goes for due process,which also concerns citizens relationship with the government.see people sonleitner d.d,supra,constitutional law.we have already discussed the matter of strict construction of the no contest clause and the absence of vagueness or ambiguity in wells clear intentions to create a forfeiture condition.
underlying the various specific grounds to void the no contest clause that robyn of collusion,overbreadth,denial of due her basic position that wells forfeiture provision simply is not fair and therefore is against public policy.but what to some might seem unfair does not necessarily violate public policy.
public policy is inherently hard to define.maryland fidelity,hereafter maryland.but notwithstanding this difficulty,the concept has limits,and a court therefore should not freely characterize any potential source of unpleasantness between people as a violation of public policy.it is primarily the prerogative of the legislature to declare what is against public policy,though courts may find something to be against public policy if it is clearly injurious to the interests of society.id.at,addressing the voiding of contracts on public policy grounds see also green ralee engineering,cal th,d,we continue to believe that,aside from constitutional policy,the legislature,and not the courts,is vested with the responsibility to declare the public policy of the state.the power to invalidate private agreements and instruments on public policy grounds is and easily abused and should be used carefully and sparingly.see maryland,supra.at.a public policy must be sufficiently clear to justify exercising such a potent remedy.gantt sentry insurance cal th,d,addressing public policy doctrine as to unlawful termination claims,overruled on other grounds in green ralee engineering,supra,cal th at fn,d.
to help ensure that declarations of public policy are based on more than merely a particular court sense of fairness,the policy in question should involve a matter that affects society at large rather than the litigants purely personal or proprietary interests.gantt sentry insurance,supra,cal th at,d.in the context of employment law,for example,courts in california and elsewhere generally have rejected public policy claims unsupported by constitutional or statutory authority.id.at,d.in sum,it is generally agreed that public policy as a concept is notoriously resistant to precise definition,and that courts should venture into this area,if at all,with great care and due deference to the judgment of the legislative branch,lest they mistake their own predilections for public policy which deserves recognition at law.citation.id.at,d.a public policy that has not been clearly expressed by the legislature should at least be fundamental,substantial,and firmly established.see foley interactive data cal d,fn,addressing public policy in the employment law arena.
with these strict requirements in mind,we consider whether the trust no contest clause amounts to a violation of public policy.first,we note that in general,a testator has the right to grant bequests subject to any lawful conditions he or she may select.beneficiaries of a testamentary instrument have no right to testamentary bequests except subject to the testator conditions,and it generally is not the role of a court to rearrange those bequests or conditions in keeping with the court sense of justice.i n the minds of others than the testator,the question whether a will is just or unjust is a matter of opinion,and the policy of the law is to make the disposition under a will in accordance with the desires of the testator.estate of markham,supra,d at.i t must be conceded that the property of the testator is his to dispose of as he wills,and he is not called upon to consult the wishes or views of his beneficiaries or of juries or courts.id.at.a competent testator therefore has the right to distribute his property upon such terms and conditions as to him seem just and proper and the recipient of the testator bounty is required to partake thereof under the terms provided in the testamentary document,so long as such terms and conditions are not prohibited by some law or opposed to public policy.id.at,see also estate of black,supra,d at.no contest clause creates a condition subsequent upon bequests.
in this case,wells had the right to leave elizabeth three sisters nothing at all,and he also had the right to leave them relatively modest gifts subject to an forfeiture clause.wells intentions to impose conditions on the three daughters gifts generally were within his rights as a testator.and public policy favors his desire to avoid litigation.so the question is whether the policy concerns regarding this no contest clause are so different from those raised by a traditional no contest clause that they require us to find a violation of public policy.we conclude that they are not.
in response to robyn and the trial court conclusion that the particular terms of wells no contest clause are so unfair that they trump the traditional public policy of upholding the testator intent,we point out that the fairness of a testamentary instrument,unless it violates public policy,is not an issue for judicial review.we note that valid wills or trusts may contain terms that might strike outside observers as unfair.we might see it as unfair if a testator gave nothing whatsoever to a dutiful child while giving the entirety of a large estate to the dutiful child unworthy a testator may do that,and we would step dangerously outside our proper role were we to rewrite such an instrument to reflect our sense of justice.we further note that neither we nor the trial court can ever possess the intimate understanding of the internal dynamics and interrelationships within a family that a testator would have.this is another reason why courts generally should defer to a testator clearly stated intentions,even in situations where a testamentary instrument might seem unfair to an outsider.
wells expressed a clear intention to treat elizabeth three sisters as a group,by awarding each of them the same bequest and subjecting them to the condition that a contest by any one of them would void the bequests to all three sisters.the three sisters similarly would have been treated as a group had wells specifically disinherited all of them while giving all trust assets to elizabeth and robert,or had he given them all the same bequests subject to a traditional forfeiture clause applying to them only individually,as he could have done.the only difference here is that a contest by one brings forfeiture of the others bequests.
the trial court indicated that it saw no reason for the no contest clause,except perhaps to be punitive,because wells could have simply disinherited the three sisters.but in a testamentary instrument is not in itself illegal or against public policy.moreover,we conceive of rational reasons why wells might have selected the approach he did.unlike the trial court and us,he knew his three daughters.he clearly showed an intent to treat them as a group,both by the identical bequests and by the no contest clause.this might be because wells believed that the three sisters tended to act as a group,and he might have designed his amended forfeiture clause precisely to discourage them from colluding in contesting the suit by forcing them to risk all their gifts to challenge the trust,rather than only one of the three bequests.also,the group forfeiture clause normally would tend to discourage thus promote public more than a traditional clause,because the other members of the group could be expected to exert pressure on any one member not to break ranks.
also,contrary to the trial court statement that wells clearly wanted to give gifts to elizabeth three sisters,it is possible that he actually wanted to give each of them nothing,but instead gave each a modest bequest along with the no contest clause to give them a greater incentive not to contest the will.we can not know for certain what internal dynamic within the wells family led wells to structure the no contest clause as he did.as such,reviewing courts should defer to his expressed intent based on his superior knowledge of such private matters.what we do know is that he gave elizabeth three sisters gifts conditioned on none of them contesting the trust.wells could give or refrain from giving and could attach to his gift s any lawful condition which his reason or caprice might dictate.he was but dealing with his own property and the beneficiar ies claiming thereunder must take the gift s,if at all,upon the terms offered.in re kitchen,supra,cal.
the trial court was concerned that the clause invites collusion between elizabeth and one of her three sisters to void the other sisters gifts,but it also discourages collusion between the three sisters to have one contest the trust without placing the others gifts at risk.moreover,even if the clause opens the possibility of improper collusion between elizabeth and any one sister,it does not mandate or actively encourage such impropriety.by giving each of elizabeth sisters a bequest along with the group forfeiture clause,the trust gives each a substantial incentive not to contest the will that is similar to but stronger than what the same bequests with a standard no contest clause would provide.that human deviousness can devise a way to interfere with this legitimate purpose does not necessarily make the clause improper.the trial court reasoning that the clause created an improper motive or opportunity to collude or express hatred would also apply to any testamentary clause providing that one donee takes only if another predeceases.this obviously creates a motive for the latent interest holder to dispatch the prior interest holder,and such has long been the stuff of novel and film plots,but such conditions are nevertheless valid in testamentary instruments.
as we have noted,robyn offered no authorities,either in california or out of state,indicating that this no contest clause is contrary to public policy.nor have we been able to find any such authority.it is true that the second and third restatements of trusts and certain treatises state that a provision in a testamentary instrument may be void as against public policy if it encourages disruption of a family relationship the only primary authority upon which these secondary authorities rely for their statements concerning sibling relationships is girard trust schmitz,schmitz.in schmitz,a bitter testator created a testamentary trust providing that four of his siblings would share his estate so long as none of them had any contact with another brother and sister whom the testator hated.id.at.the new jersey equity court found no statutory prohibition against such a provision or any violation of a traditional common law duty id.at,but ruled that the conditions violated public policy.id.at.the court concluded,since the family is the origin of all society and all government citation,the protection of the family being the paramount purpose of all government and laws citation,any act be it in the form of covenant,contract,or condition,testamentary or otherwise,which tends to disrupt the family must be held,on principles of the common law,to be void as against public policy.id.at.the court acknowledged that it was creating a new rule on equitable grounds without prior decisions on the subject.id.at.
in schmitz,the beneficiaries could take their gifts only if they broke off all contact with their siblings.so family disruption was written into the testamentary trust.in this case,by contrast,family disruption is not mandated by the trust.the three sisters can take their gifts peacefully and not contest the trust.if they choose to allow the trust to disrupt their relations with their siblings,that is their own decision,as with any situation in which a will contest leads to hostility between surviving family members.
foreign authorities also support our conclusion.we review them briefly.
robyn cites a treatise article that reviews state law on no contest clauses to show that many states and court opinions hold no contest clauses inoperable if will contests are made in good faith and with probable cause,validity and enforceability of provision of will or trust instrument for forfeiture or reduction of share of contesting beneficiary.the cited article proves that point,but it also indicates that california is in good company among the states that favor no contest clauses in general,and that california traditionally has been among the states that hold no contest clauses valid regardless of whether there is probable cause or good faith to challenge them.at,b.as we have discussed,the california
