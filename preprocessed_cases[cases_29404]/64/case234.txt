subject to one exception,probate code section,subdivision a gives the probate court the authority to modify or terminate an irrevocable trust if all beneficiaries consent.the exception to this general rule is found in subdivision b,which provides that even if all beneficiaries consent,a court can not modify or terminate a trust where the continuance of the trust is necessary to carry out a material purpose of the trust unless the court,in its discretion,determines that the reason for doing so under the circumstances outweighs the interest in accomplishing a material purpose of the trust,subd.b.
in this appeal we must interpret and apply section to a charitable trust the trust created by laurence moore moore in.in the trust,moore designated five beneficiaries the salvation army,guide dogs for the blind,hospice of petaluma,boys and girls club of petaluma,and face to face of sonoma county.among other powers,the trust gave the trustees broad discretion in two areas the discretion to determine the relative amounts or percentages given to these beneficiaries of the trust,including the power to make a distribution to one or more of them to the exclusion of others and the discretion to name additional beneficiaries and distribute the trust to them.
before his death in,moore named james walsh and michael wood as successor trustees.after moore death,a contentious dispute arose regarding the successor trustees discretion to identify beneficiaries of the trust.over the trustees objection,the probate court modified the trust in pursuant to section.in ordering the modification without first deciding the trustees petition to ascertain beneficiaries,the probate court gave effect to a settlement agreement reached by the beneficiaries listed in the trust and a group of other charitable organizations referenced in a document moore prepared after the execution of his trust,and dated four days after his last amendment.
the successor trustees appealed.
there are two questions before us.the first question is whether all beneficiaries of the trust consented to the modification in accordance with section,subdivision a.the answer to this question is yes.the second question before us is whether the broad discretion conferred upon the trustees constitutes a material purpose which would prevent a probate court from modifying the trust pursuant to section,subdivision b.the answer to this question is no.
accordingly,we affirm the probate court order modifying the trust.
factual and procedural background 
moore creates the trust 
moore created the trust on march.the trust was to be organized and operated exclusively for charitable purposes and its property was irrevocably dedicated to charitable purposes.article v of the trust provided as follows 
charitable beneficiaries.the t rust shall terminate upon the later of the grantor death or ten years from the date this t rust is executed.upon termination of the trust,the trustees shall distribute the entire remaining balance of the t rust in such proportions as the trustees determine in their discretion to the following charitable organizations 
the salvation army northern california division.
guide dogs for the blind.
hospice of petaluma.
boys and girls club of petaluma.
face to face of sonoma county.
such other charitable organization or organizations similar to one or more of the charities,as the trustees determine in their discretion,provided that such other charities are organized and operated exclusively for charitable purposes within the meaning of section c of the internal revenue code and are qualified to receive contributions deductible under section c and section of the internal revenue code or successor provisions.
distributions.the trustees are authorized to make the distributions under this article over a reasonable period of time as determined in the trustees discretion,provided that during such distribution period the remaining trust estate shall continue to be managed as provided herein.the trustees shall have the discretion to determine the relative amounts or percentages to be given to the respective charitable organizations,including the power to distribute more to some of the charities than others,or to make distribution to one or more of them to the exclusion of others.
moore retained the power to amend the trust in whole or in part,by a writing delivered to the trustee.moore amended the trust twice,both times to change the trustees.in a document dated september,and entitled,amendment,moore amended the trust to name walsh and wood appellants as successor trustees 
the discovery of the disbursement schedule 
moore died in april.shortly thereafter,moore niece,marsha moore marsha,claimed an interest in trust assets.during the litigation with marsha,appellants found several documents in moore files,including a handwritten letter from moore to his then attorney,robert kwasneski.the letter,dated september,stated,enclosed is a copy of the disbursement schedule we discussed.there will be changes,of course,as time passes,but i will rest easier with this in place.the letter attached a document entitled,schedule for cash disbursements to be made annually as provided for in the trust following the death of its grantor disbursement schedule.the disbursement schedule listed organizations and designated the distributions that each organization would receive annually.
in january,appellants filed a petition for construction of trust documents petition for construction seeking construction of the trust in light of the disbursement schedule.appellants acknowledged that they were unable to locate any evidence that moore did not intend the provisions of the disbursement schedule to guide their discretion.they also noted that the disbursement schedule provide d for annual ongoing distributions of the trust income.a nd name d charitable beneficiaries in addition to those identified in the t rust appellants argued that the disbursement schedule appear ed to create an ambiguity in the trust because it contemplated an indefinite term.a nd contemplates charitable beneficiaries different from those listed in the trust.
appellants file a petition to ascertain beneficiaries and the battle begins 
appellants eventually settled the litigation with marsha in february and the trust received approximately million.shortly thereafter,appellants began to focus on ascertaining beneficiaries and distributing the trust.in april,they dismissed their petition for construction and filed a petition to ascertain beneficiaries.appellants stated that they wish ed to be clear whether the disbursement schedule amended the trust they explained that they sought guidance to determine the beneficiaries of the trust.
but the five beneficiaries listed in the salvation army,guide dogs for the blind,hospice of petaluma,boys and girls club of petaluma,and face to face of sonoma a different idea.they contended that the disbursement schedule did not amend the trust and,as a result,the court should compel appellants to distribute the trust in equal shares to each of them.in november,they filed a petition to compel appellants to distribute the trust to them and only them distribution petition.appellants opposed the distribution petition.they characterized it as premature and argued that the legal effect of the disbursement schedule must be determined before distributing the trust.appellants explained that by ruling on the petition to ascertain beneficiaries,the court will answer a basic question crucial to the administration of the t rust who are the beneficiaries of the trust until that question is answered,the trustees can not move forward with distribution,although they are eager to do so.appellants also argued that granting the distribution petition would preclude them from exercising their discretion to determine trust beneficiaries and the amounts those beneficiaries would receive.in addition,several respondents opposed the distribution petition,claiming that the disbursement schedule amended the trust to name additional beneficiaries.
in the spring of,appellants and respondents participated in two mediations both were unsuccessful.the court set a trial date to resolve the petition to ascertain beneficiaries and the distribution petition and ordered the parties to attend a mandatory settlement conference.at the settlement conference,respondents negotiated a settlement among themselves.the settlement agreement defined all respondents as beneficiaries of the trust and set forth a percentage beneficial interests that each beneficiary would receive annually.the settlement agreement also provided that t he trust shall be modified to reflect the terms of this settlement agreement.appellants did not approve of,nor agree to,the settlement.
the court modifies the trust 
in september,respondents filed a petition to modify the trust petition to modify.they contended that the court had the authority to modify the trust pursuant to section,subdivision a,because all twenty beneficiaries of the trust agree to the proposed modifications.the california attorney general attorney general filed a statement of no position.
appellants opposed the petition to modify.they urged the probate court to deny the petition to modify because all the beneficiaries of the trust have not,they have not yet even been identified in addition,appellants argued that the proposed modification precluded any charitable organization other than respondents from being considered a beneficiary of the trust and prevented appellants from carrying out the clearly stated purpose and intent of the trust.
following a hearing,the probate court granted the petition to modify.the court november,order stated,this matter has been before the court since may.section a of the probate code provides that,unless the continuance of the trust is necessary to carry out a material purpose of the trust,if all beneficiaries of an irrevocable trust consent,they may compel modification or termination of the trust upon petition to the court.having carefully considered the petition and the trustee opposition,the court finds that all beneficiaries have agreed to the proposed modifications and that there is no material purpose of the t rust which would necessitate its continuance beyond the distributions to those beneficiaries.therefore,the court hereby approves the modifications to the t rust embodied in the beneficiaries settlement agreement.the parties are ordered to confer and agree upon a comprehensive form of order which approves the modifications and which addresses any other matters in this case.
on december,the court entered an order modifying the trust and dismissing the petition to ascertain beneficiaries and the distribution petition.appellants timely appealed.in april after appellants attorney general filed a consent to modification of trust with the probate court.in it,the attorney general stated that it represents the people of the state of california,the ultimate beneficiaries of charity and that on behalf of the ultimate beneficiaries of charity,it does hereby consent to the modification of the trust consistent with the court december,order.we have taken judicial notice of the attorney general consent to modification of trust.the attorney general has also filed a letter brief in this court in support of upholding the trial court modification of the trust.
discussion 
appellants contend the probate court erred in modifying the trust for two reasons.first,they argue section,subdivision a,precluded the court from modifying the trust because all beneficiaries have not been identified and,as a result,could not have consented to the modification.second,appellants contend that the order modifying the trust contravenes section,subdivision b,because the reason for the modification does not outweigh the material purpose of the trust,specifically their discretion to identify beneficiaries and to distribute the trust to those beneficiaries.
standard of review 
an appeal lies from any order made appealable by the probate code.esslinger cummins th,d cummins code civ,subd.a.with two exceptions not relevant here,the probate code permits an appeal to be taken from any final order under probate code section et seq cummins,supra,at,d.an order a pproving or directing the modification or termination of the t rust constitutes a final order under section,subd.b.the order modifying the trust is therefore appealable.
the parties disagree on the appropriate standard to review the probate court application of section,subdivision a appellants contend this case presents a mixed issue of law and fact and urge us to apply an independent review standard.respondents,however,contend that probate court ruling with respect to section,subdivision a,should be reviewed for abuse of discretion pursuant to sections,subdivision b,and.
the issue of whether all beneficiaries consented to the modification within the meaning of section,subdivision a,is a question of statutory interpretation and is a pure question of law.people ex rel.lockyer shamrock foods cal th,d,see also patton sherwood th,d sherwood interpretation of section presents a question of law.the first step in statutory construction is to scrutinize the actual words of the statute,giving them a plain and commonsense meaning.murillo fleetwood enterprises,cal th,d,internal citations omitted see also olson automobile club of southern california cal th,d.if the statutory language is unambiguous,we presume the legislature meant what it said,and the plain meaning of the statute governs.people toney cal th,d,quoting people robles cal th,d.
ii.the order modifying the trust complied with section,subdivision a 
we must first ascertain the meaning of the phrase all beneficiaries of the trust set forth in section,subdivision a.section defines a beneficiary as a person to whom a donative transfer of property is made or that person successor in interest,including a person who has any present or future interest,vested or contingent,subd.c.in the context of a charitable trust,section defines a beneficiary as any person entitled to enforce the trust,subd.d.applying section,we conclude the five beneficiaries named in the trust salvation army,guide dogs for the blind,hospice of petaluma,boys and girls club of petaluma,and face to face of sonoma beneficiaries who have a present or future interest,vested or contingent in the trust,subd.c.even if they hold mere future interests or contingent interests,the five named beneficiaries are entitled to enforce the trust pursuant to the plain language of section,subdivision d.these five entities do not lack the status of beneficiaries merely because appellants have not exercised their powers as successor trustees to select the five,or other charitable organizations.
appellants contend that respondents could not consent to the modification because they had no vested claim to assets of the trust,and,in fact,no claim to be beneficiaries at all.to support this argument,appellants rely on estate of quinn d.in that case,a will directed the residue of the decedent estate to go to charity but did not identify a specific charitable purpose or appoint a trustee to select the charity or charities.id.at.the trial court designated three charities.the charities and the decedent heirs later agreed to receive equal shares of the residue,despite the fact that the will directed the residue to go to charity.ibid.the attorney general appealed,contending that the entire residue of the estate should have been awarded to charity and that no portion of the estate should have gone to the heirs.ibid.
the appellate court agreed.it held that n either the failure to appoint a trustee nor the failure to designate a specific charitable purpose prevents a court from effectuating the will of the testator.estate of quinn,supra,d at.the court also rejected the heirs claim that the charities consented to the settlement and relinquished their share of the estate residue.id.at.the court explained that the consent of the designated charities did not sanction diverting any portion of the residue to a noncharitable purpose because the interest of the charities had not vested the court could have eliminated the charities mentioned and substituted other charities at any time prior to the filing of the decree of distribution.id.at.
estate of quinn has
