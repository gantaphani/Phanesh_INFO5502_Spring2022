this case of first impression requires us to directly confront the issue of whether probate code section irreconcilably conflicts with code of civil procedure section we determine they do conflict on the very narrow point of how much time a claimant against an estate has to file suit based on a promise to make a distribution from the estate,such as a contract to make a will.section gives claimants days from rejection of the claim by the estate to file suit section gives them a year from decedent death to file suit.under the longstanding rule of construction that newer and more specific statutes take precedence over older and more general statutes,we conclude it is section time limit that controls.
the practical effect of our determination is that plaintiff richard allen suit for breach of contract to make a will,filed days after rejection by the estate of his creditor claim but within a year of the decedent death,is not.the judgment of dismissal in favor of the estate,predicated solely on the application of section day time frame to file suit,must therefore be reversed.
this case comes to us on a judgment of dismissal after the defendant demurrer was sustained without leave to amend,so we accept as true all facts pled in the complaint.guzman county of monterey cal th,marshall gibson,dunn crutcher th.we also accept as true other relevant,facts outside the complaint.jocer enterprises,price th.in this case,the relevant,facts we accept as true concern the nature,presentation and ultimate rejection of a creditor claim presented by plaintiff richard allen.
james humpert died october.humpert had been in a stable,committed relationship with plaintiff richard allen,and during that relationship humpert had promised allen he would be taken care of should anything happen to humpert.it is undisputed humpert died intestate,and there is no evidence allen and humpert ever registered as domestic partners,or married during that brief period in when couples could marry 
allen filed a petition with the probate court to be appointed administrator of humpert estate,but humpert sister,edith marlynne stoddard,filed an opposing petition,and she prevailed.hence,as administrator of humpert estate she is the named defendant in this case.
in april,a little more than five months after humpert died,allen filed a creditor claim against humpert estate based on the would be taken care of promise made by humpert.there is no issue of late notice in making this claim on the estate.the next month,on may,the estate sent a formal notice of rejection of allen claim.
allen filed this action on august,which,given the days that hath both may and july,ended up being exactly days from may,stoddard,as estate administrator,successfully demurred to the complaint based on it being untimely under section,subdivision a.a judgment of dismissal ensued,and allen timely filed this appeal.
discussion 
preliminarily,we note a small matter not raised by either party.the entire battle at the trial level concerned the operation of section,and specifically whether the time to file a suit might be extended for five days since the notice of rejection was served by mail.civ.even though the suit was clearly filed within a year of humpert death,the possible application of section rather than section was not raised at the trial level at all.however,section is the sole issue on appeal 
since the effect of section on this case presents a pristine issue of law,and since the estate makes no attempt to show any prejudice,we exercise our discretion to address the section issue.see people rosas th,appellate courts regularly use their discretion to entertain issues not raised at the trial level when those issues involve only questions of law based on undisputed facts.
applicability of section 
section gives persons who have claims against estates based on promises to make a distribution after death such as contracts to make a will a full year from the date of the decedent death to file suit.if section governed allen claim against humpert estate,his suit was timely 
the estate argues section does apply at all.that is an argument readily disposed of.the gravamen of allen suit is what is often called a marvin claim after marvin marvin cal d,which is an express or implied enforceable contract between two nonmarital partners,usually arising out of some sort of domestic arrangements between those partners.marvin claims sometimes manifest themselves as breaches of contracts to make a will or other disposition from an estate when one of the nonmarital partners dies,mcmackin ehrheart th,see also byrne laura th.
the text of section a promise or agreement with a decedent to distribution from an estate squarely fits claims based on contracts,including marvin contracts,by a decedent to provide for someone after the decedent death or make some other distribution of an estate.this point has been readily confirmed by case law.mcmackin,supra,th at pp.marvin claim see also estate of ziegler th,claim to receive home on decedent death stewart seward th,claim based on promise to execute will leaving partial interest in property to claimant embree embree th,claim based on provision in marital settlement agreement to establish a trust or annuity to pay spousal support after decedent death.
applicability of section 
the estate also argues that section does apply,and therefore its day from date of rejection time limit bars allen suit.this argument is not so readily disposed of.
we first review the formidable array of probate code statutes bearing on the requirement imposed on persons with claims on estates to file creditor claims with those estates.generally rutter group probate treatise,supra,through.
section,subdivision a defines claim to mean a demand for payment for any of the following,whether due,not due,accrued or not accrued,or contingent,and whether liquidated or unliquidated liability of the decedent,whether arising in contract,tort or otherwise.italics added.
section,subdivision c defines creditor to mean a person who may have a claim against an estate.claims that are not filed with estates as provided in part of the probate code are barred.
section provides that creditors who have claims against estates must,unless otherwise excused by statute,file those claims as provided in the probate code 
section precludes suit against an estate unless a claim has first been filed with the estate and the claim has been rejected in whole or part 
these requirements then culminate in section.section says,plainly,that regardless of any other statute of limitations,any claimant against an estate has days after notice of rejection of the claim by the estate to file suit.
it is not surprising,then,that a claim for breach of an agreement to make a distribution from an estate has been squarely held to be a claim within the meaning of section,and therefore a creditor claim was required before the claimant could state a cause of action in a lawsuit on that claim.wilkison wiederkehr th,
and there is no basis in the texts of sections,and to say that claims against estates based on promises by decedents to make wills are not within those statutes.allen suggests that section,subdivision b somehow removes such claims which include marvin claims from the ambit of the word claim as defined in subdivision a,but that argument is unavailing.the text just does fit.subdivision b provides claim does not include a dispute regarding title of the decedent to specific property alleged to be included in the decedent estate.italics added.there is nothing in a general promise to take care of a domestic partner after one death which implicates title to specific property.
in short,if section,rather than section,controls the date of the filing of allen suit,affirmance is required.
c.the anomaly 
so,does or does not,section conflict with section the answer is it does,but section does not necessarily conflict with the sections of the probate code governing claims against estates involving matters other than the statute of limitations involving contracts to make a will.but to explain why,we must confront and resolve an anomaly that has arisen in the case l
