introduction 
the trial court vacated an order for final distribution of an estate when two women came forward who might be heirs here,the daughters of the decedent,as heir is defined under the laws of intestate succession.the two women had not received notice of the administration of the intestate estate from the petitioner for administration,the brother of the decedent.the two women had been born out of wedlock,and the petitioner for administration had concluded that they did not qualify as heirs,and were therefore not entitled to personal notice under probate code section.the statute provides in pertinent part at least days before the hearing of a petition for administration of a decedent estate,the petitioner shall serve notice of the hearing by mail or personal delivery on all of the following persons a each heir of the decedent,so far as known or reasonably ascertainable by the petitioner.emphasis added.
as we explain in detail below,though it was a close case,the trial court correctly set aside the final order of distribution.the moving papers supporting the set aside motion contained evidence which showed that the petitioner had knowledge of facts from which a reasonable person could infer that the decedent had both received the two claimants into his home and openly held them out as his natural children.see,subd.d.while the probate code clearly requires that heirship established on that basis be by clear and convincing evidence see,subd.b,that determination must ultimately be made by a court,not a petitioner for administration who has an incentive to find against a potential and rival claimant.tulsa professional collection services,pope,d tulsa collection.any narrower interpretation would offend due process as explicated by the united states supreme court in tulsa collection.that case constrains courts to give the phrase reasonably ascertainable,as used in probate code section,a broad meaning,sufficient to include individuals whose identities are known to the petitioner and who reasonably might be heirs.only then can a neutral adjudicate the merits of their claim to heirship.any other rule makes the petitioner for administration a judge in his or her own cause.
events leading to the set aside motion 
lindella and lenitra are the daughters of carman regan.their father is not listed on their birth certificates,and carman was not married at the time of the conception or birth of either child.the circumstances by which they were led to ultimately bring a motion to set aside the final order of distribution of the estate of lyndell carter on the theory that they are his daughters are somewhat unusual.those circumstances are centered in the fact that there was some confusion as to exactly who had title to the main asset in his estate,a certain house in anaheim.here are those circumstances 
in,lyndell bought the house in anaheim.carman and her daughters moved into it.shortly after the purchase,lyndell transferred title to his mother,mildred.according to lyndell brother ricky,the transfer was lyndell way of providing for his mother mildred and simultaneously preventing carman from ending up with the house.in,mildred transferred the house to her father and lyndell grandfather,leazer.according to ricky,mildred was afraid she would have future legal problems and she wanted to make sure she would lose the house.
however,in,unbeknownst to ricky and mildred,leazer gave a deed to the property back to lyndell.lyndell died the next year.he never recorded that deed.
ricky was incarcerated at the time of lyndell death in,and his younger brother was about to be incarcerated,so,according to ricky,mildred allowed carman to remain in the house if she would maintain it and pay the taxes.the degree to which she had leazer authority to do this is unclear in this record.
by grandfather leazer was in failing health.lyndell,to whom he first deeded the property,was now dead,so he deeded the property again,this time back to mildred.however,mildred never recorded that deed.
in ricky got out of prison and was able to buy a roller skate shop from an owner about to retire.by the next year,according to ricky own account,mildred was happy he had gone straight and wanted to give him the anaheim property to help build up his roller skate business.so she sent him the unrecorded deed which leazer had given her.
then ricky received a shock.the deed which leazer had given the lyndell had been recorded,in september,by the attorney who now represents lindella and lenitra.ricky could not record the deed that mildred had given him.
as soon as he discovered the recording of the deed,ricky petitioned the probate court to administrate lyndell intestate estate.concluding they were not his brother heirs,he did not give personal notice to lindella or lenitra.notice,however,was published in a local anaheim newspaper.in may ricky obtained a final order of distribution of the estate.
three months later,on august,it was carman turn to be shocked.she telephoned the county tax assessor to make certain that its office had received a certain delinquent property tax payment.she had been living in the house,as explained more fully below.she then learned that there had been a change in ownership of the house from lyndell to ricky.mildred had apparently received the house from the estate and then transferred it to ricky.carman contacted her lawyer and by september he had,on behalf of lindella and lenitra,filed a motion to set aside the order of final distribution.the motion was premised both on the discretionary relief provisions of code of civil procedure section and the general power of a court to set aside a judgment procured by extrinsic fraud.
b.the evidence bearing on the set aside motion 
the moving papers 
the set aside motion was supported by the declarations of carman,lindella,and lenitra.with regard to the claim that lindella and lenitra were lyndell natural children,the three declarations made these points 
lyndell and carman grew up close together in north carolina and began dating when carman was years old.at age carman became pregnant with lindella according to her,by lyndell and t here was never any question in the minds of lyndell and his family as to the fact that he was lindella and lenitra father.
in,lyndell and carman moved to compton,where they lived with their daughter lindella.they lived in a back house while ricky and his father lived in the front house.
in,lyndell,carman,lindella and lenitra all began living together in the anaheim house,where lyndell resided until he died in.carman and lenitra still reside there.
there is no statement in the moving papers about any public declarations which lyndell might have made concerning his paternity of lindella or lenitra.
the opposition papers 
ricky opposition papers told a somewhat different story.
lyndell left north carolina for california when carman became pregnant by another man.however,carman followed him to california in,where they lived together four or five months in the rear of ricky father property.ricky father did not like carman and insisted she move.for a while she lived in a cheap motel.lyndell and carman had an relationship,and their childhood romance motivated lyndell to make sure that carman was never destitute.when carman became pregnant with lenitra,lyndell told his brother that carman had engaged in multiple affairs with other men and lenitra was not his child.they even discussed the possibilities of who might have fathered lenitra.further,carman had received welfare checks at a residence in compton when,according to her declaration,she was supposedly living in the anaheim house.
as to the anaheim house,while lyndell had allowed carman to move into it,he always maintained other residences where he lived more often and spent more time than he did at the anaheim house.
c.the result of the set aside motion 
the motion was granted because of the lack of notice.the court finds,the minute order said,that no notice was given to potential parties.
ricky timely appealed from the formal set aside order.neither the minute order nor the ultimate final order mentions whether the court was acting pursuant to section of the code of civil procedure or the general doctrine of extrinsic fraud.
iii.discussion 
a.the problem the petitioner is a judge in his or her own cause 
this case brings into sharp focus a problem in probate estate administration that did not exist in california prior to tulsa collection,supra,d.in tulsa collection,the united states supreme court held that creditors of they were known or,more significantly for our purposes here,reasonably ascertainable were entitled to personal notice of estate proceedings,that is,by mail or personal service.id.at.mere notice by publication in a newspaper would not comport with due process.
in the wake of tulsa collection,california probate code was revised,most notably probate code section,which incorporated tulsa collection reasonably ascertainable standard for creditors not just known,but reasonably ascertainable creditors were entitled to notice by mail or personal service as distinct from the back pages of the classifieds of local newspapers.see clark kerby th,d prior california statutory scheme held unconstitutional insofar as it deprived notice to creditor who might have been reasonably ascertainable.
in the case before us,we are not concerned with reasonably ascertainable creditors,but with reasonably ascertainable heirs of an intestate estate.even so,the same rule applies.probate code section,which governs notice to heirs of an intestate estate,was,like probate code section,revised in the wake of tulsa collection to adopt a reasonably ascertainable standard for notice.see,quoted above.
the reasonable ascertainability of heirs can present a particularly acute problem in cases of children born where the decedent is male.see generally buttorff,illegitimate children right to receive notice in probate proceedings involving putative father estate louisville fam.the problem is that the petitioner himself or herself ends up deciding whether the claimant meets the legal criteria without any neat categorical lines.
of course,there are plenty of bright lines in the law,and when they apply,there is no difficulty in ascertaining heirs,even for a petitioner for administration of an estate.for example,a voluntary,signed written declaration of paternity will certainly establish heirship.so will a court order in a formal paternity action,even in a foreign jurisdiction.see,subd.b,estate of griswold cal th,d,stipulation in ohio bastardy proceeding that man was the father of the deceased held to be sufficient to acknowledge child.likewise will a determination of a relationship in a divorce judgment.see weir ferreira th,d.
there are also bright lines which categorically rule out heirship.for example,there will be cases where a claimant must be conclusively presumed to be someone else child because he or she was conceived by a wife at a time when she was cohabiting with her husband,estate of cornelious cal d,because claimant was conclusively presumed to be daughter of man married to her mother,she could not be child of mother paramour,who was the deceased.in other cases,the known familial relationship of a potential claimant to the deceased clearly makes that person not an heir under the laws of intestate succession,estate of baird d.widow not required to give notice to three who clearly were not heirs.
but we are dealing here with the harder case where the petitioner has no definitive categorical criteria to determine who is eligible for personal notice under probate code section.under california law,a child born out of wedlock is the decedent heir even if there has been no formal declaration or judgment of paternity in the decedent lifetime,if the decedent received a child into his home and held the child out as his natural child,subd.d.probate code section,which is part of the laws of intestate succession,adds the requirement that when the relationship is established that way,the evidence of holding out must be clear and convincing.
in such a case,some sort of adjudicatory process must be performed by someone,and by its terms the probate code contemplates that it will be performed,at least initially,by the petitioner for administration of the estate.there is no other way to read probate code section,which by its operation places the burden on the petitioner to send personal notice to known and reasonably ascertainable heirs.
the rub,as we have alluded to above,is that petitioner for administration is himself or herself likely to be related to the intestate decedent and,as the tulsa collection court noted in the context of creditors,will probably have a distinct disincentive to give notice to a party whose claim may preempt or diminish his or her own.see tulsa collection,supra,at.moreover,the executor or executrix will often be,as is the case here,a party with a beneficial interest in the estate.this could diminish an executor or executrix inclination to call attention to the potential expiration of a creditor claim.accord estate of mcguigan th,d noting as regard probate code section petitions to recover escheated property,there is a strong economic incentive to limit the information in the section petition so as to enhance the prospect that the petitioner will be the one to receive the escheated estate.the net result is that the petitioner for administration of the estate is likely going to be required to be a judge in his or her own cause.or,to carry the judicial metaphor further,the petitioner has a direct financial incentive to find that a potential rival for the estate is not a reasonably ascertainable heir.
interestingly enough,the very first use of the phrase,no man should be a judge in his own cause,in a reported california decision was in a probate case where our supreme court observed that an estate administrator who might have had an equitable interest in a judgment against the the judgment was ostensibly owned by his correctly in submitting the judgment as a claim against the estate to the probate court,and not just deciding that he had the unilateral right,as executor,to collect on it for himself.see estate of crosby cal,if reed,the administrator,had an equitable interest in the judgment,the propriety of its presentation to the probate judge,and not to him,is manifest.no man should be a judge in his own cause.
b.the solution notice to all potential claimants whose existence and identities are known 
as a practical matter most of the time,the problem that administrators of intestate estates must determine who gets notice is a manageable one,despite whatever a petitioner for administration may have.that is,most of the time there is no dispute about who are a decedent natural children hence it is already established that if the petitioner fails to give notice to a genuinely known heir,he or she commits extrinsic fraud and the heir may maintain an action in equity for a constructive trust later.see stevens torregano d.dicta that if the executor or administrator knows of an heir,and withholds that information from the court,his doing so is extrinsic fraud,justifying a suit in equity by that heir to impose a constructive trust.accord estate of mcguigan,supra,th,d failure to list known and closer heir in petition to recover escheated property held to be extrinsic fraud harkins fielder d,extrinsic fraud where brother of deceased concealed existence of known surviving brother and sister purinton dyson cal d,extrinsic fraud where executor of will concealed the existence of woman whom he knew to be deceased granddaughter monk morgan,extrinsic fraud where administrator sent check to rival claimant to induce claimant that deceased was still alive estate of poder d.notice to known heirs in estonia held invalid where notice sent to a lawyer in san francisco representing nephew and proponent of holographic will because there was not even some slight prospect of actual delivery to the addressees.
by the same token,in cases where the identity and existence of a potential heir is unknown,the law is also clear that the petitioner need not give that rule is pretty obvious if one thinks about it,lynch rooney cal,daughter of sister of intestate decedent mistakenly thought in good faith that decedent brother in ireland was already dead.the case which ricky primarily relies on here,parage couedel th,d,is clear on that precise point.in parage,a petitioner seeking to recover escheated property was wholly unaware of even the existence of two french citizens,cousin and a first cousin once removed of the decedent,who had heirship claims superior to his until they filed a motion for relief.so he obviously had no duty to arrange personal notice for them.see id.at,d.
parage,however,is of no help to ricky in the case before us because we are dealing with potential heirs whose identity and existence were clearly known to him.for the same reason,authority which can be read for the proposition that administrators have no affirmative duty to notify heirs whose existence is only suspected but whose specific identities are not known can not help him either.see mulcahey dow cal,hewett linstead d.under mulcahey and hewett,if all the petitioner knows is that there is someone out there somewhere who might be the decedent heir,there is no need to undertake the burden of searching out that person identity 
ricky has also taken some refuge in the lack of formal recognition by court order during his brother lifetime.ricky explained to the trial court that he considered whether lindella and lenitra were entitled to notice as heirs under the holding out and reception provisions of family code section,subdivision b,but rejected the idea because family code section,subdivision c had not been complied with first.he wrote in his memorandum of points and authorities i am not completely clear on the code and i may be incorrect,but the way i read it,the petitioners can not even reach for section d without first complying with section c which applies to determinations involving deceased fathers.probate code section b precludes action under section c unless at least one of three exceptions are met by clear and convincing evidence and the petitioners have met none of those exceptions.the import of ricky analysis is that before lindella and lenitra could be heirs entitled to personal notice under probate code section,they first had to bring an action under family code section,subdivision c.
by its terms,though,family code section,subdivision c contemplates actions to establish paternity even after the death of the putative father.here is the entire text of the statute an action to determine the existence of the father and child relationship with respect to a child who has no presumed father under section or whose presumed father is deceased may be brought by the child or personal representative of the child,the department of child support services,the mother or a personal representative or a parent of the mother if the mother has died or is a minor,a man alleged or alleging himself to be the father,or the personal representative or a parent of the alleged father if the alleged father has died or is a minor.emphasis added.
as the emphasized words show,if paternity is that would certainly include the presumptions of fatherhood set forth in section of the family code,including subdivision d then the child may bring an action after the presumed father death to establish the existence of the parent and child relationship.
the opportunity to bring an action after the putative father death is also confirmed by the analysis in estate of sanders th,d,where the court had occasion to examine the foundations of probate code section or,to be precise,its predecessor statute,former probate code section.commenting on the former statute except that the relationship may not be established by clause,the sanders court noted the obvious disjunctive in the statute structure subdivision c,with its may language,merely allows other provisions of the uniform parentage act to be used to establish a natural relationship provided that a court decree declaring paternity was entered while the father was alive or there is clear and convincing evidence that the father,while alive,had openly and notoriously held out the child as his own.estate of sanders,supra,th at,d.the current version of the statute as set forth in probate code section,subdivision b accomplishes the same disjunctive effect through the phrase any of the following conditions,and then listing those conditions,thus indicating that any one of them is sufficient.and,since one of the conditions is that a court order was entered during the father lifetime declaring paternity,it follows that the other two provisions contemplate that paternity may be established after the father death.
any other conclusion is also inconsistent with cheyanna nielsen th,d.there the trial court had granted a summary judgment in a wrongful death action on the theory that the deceased had not held the putative child out as his own,ignoring the fact that such holding out was impossible because he died prior to the child birth.the court reasoned that under probate code section,subdivision b the child should be permitted to prove paternity,albeit by clear and convincing evidence.see cheyanna,supra,th at,d.
but there is one more aspect of ricky analysis that bears comment.when he wrote that lindella and lenitra have met none of the exceptions listed in probate code section,with regard to the two that require clear and convincing evidence subdivisions b and b,he was clearly acting,in his role of petitioner for administration of his dead brother estate,as trier of fact.it was partial ricky,not an impartial judge,who was making the decision as to whether the evidence of public holding out rose to the clear and convincing level.
if the law does not trust real even administrative hearing sit on cases where they have a direct financial interest see haas county of san bernardino cal th,d,how can it trust the relatives of the deceased as our supreme court recently observed in the analogous context of the right of a parent to inherit from a child,typically,disputes regarding parental acknowledgment of a child born out of wedlock involve factual assertions that are made by persons who are likely to have direct financial interests in the child estate and that relate to events occurring long before the child death.questions of credibility must be resolved without the child in court to corroborate or rebut the claims of those purporting to have witnessed the parent statements or conduct concerning the child.estate of griswold,supra,cal th at,d,emphasis added.the same adjudicatory dynamics apply to whether children born out of wedlock are heirs of a particular decedent.the determination of public holding out must be made in court.
finally,we need only emphasize that such a liberal interpretation of the words reasonably ascertainable does not interfere with the need for the expeditious resolution of probate proceedings.see tulsa collection,supra,at.as the sanders court has noted,the thrust behind the legislature requirement of a clear and convincing standard in the holding out cases was to discourage dubious claims.see estate of sanders,supra,th at,d.thus to the degree that the intestacy laws contemplate the presentation of claims by persons born out of wedlock in the scenario where the claim is based on reception into a household and public holding out,there is the counter weight of the clear and convincing to be applied to the merits of those claims.
application 
the declarations of lindella,lenitra,and carman do not directly address the question of whether lyndell ever publicly held out lindella and lenitra as his children.they do,however,swear to long periods of continuous living together in the same household in lyndell,carman,and lindella lenitra would be born in all lived together in a house in compton,and in lyndell,carman,lindella and lenitra all moved into the anaheim house which is the subject of this whole case,and all lived there until lyndell death in.much of the focus of the declarations is on the assertion that ricky knew that lyndell,carman,lindella and lenitra were all part of the same household.
if the declarations of the moving parties seeking to set aside the order of final distribution had conspicuously failed to say that lyndell had ever lived with lindella or lenitra,or affirmativ
