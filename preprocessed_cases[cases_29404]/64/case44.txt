introduction 
jim thorpe,olympic gold medalist thorpe,died in california in without a will his estate was assigned to his third wife,patricia patsy who eventually buried him in what is now jim thorpe,pennsylvania the borough.jim thorpe,pennsylvania was a borough that had been created from the merger of the boroughs of mauch chunk and east mauch chunk.thorpe was buried in this new borough over the objections of several children from his previous marriages.thorpe was a native american of sauk heritage and a member of the sac and fox nation of oklahoma.over the years,some of thorpe eight children have spoken out in protest of their father burial,advocating that he be reburied on sac and fox tribal land in oklahoma.
in,years after thorpe death and burial,congress enacted the native american graves protection and repatriation act nagpra.nagpra was intended to ameliorate and correct past abuses inflicted upon native americans and their culture and to protect native american human remains and cultural artifacts.nagpra requires museums and federal agencies possessing or controlling holdings or collections of native american human remains to inventory those remains,notify the affected tribe,and,upon the request of a known lineal descendent of the deceased native american or of the tribe,return such remains.
in,john thorpe,the son of thorpe and his second wife freeda,sued the borough for failing to comply with nagpra the district court concluded that the borough was a museum within the meaning of nagpra and provisions of that law required the borough to disinter thorpe remains and turn them over to the sac and fox tribe as requested by john thorpe.this appeal followed.
we conclude that congress could not have intended the kind of patently absurd result that would follow from a court resolving a family dispute by applying nagpra to thorpe burial in the borough under the circumstances here.we therefore hold that the district court erred in overturning the clearly expressed wishes of thorpe wife by ordering his body to be exhumed and his remains delivered to john thorpe 
ii.facts and procedural history 
thorpe died in california in.thereafter,patsy,in cooperation with the oklahoma legislature,made initial plans for him to be buried in oklahoma according to plaintiffs,thorpe had told family members that he wanted to be buried in oklahoma.however,the parties agree that patsy thorpe had legal authority over the disposition of thorpe body and his estate.in any event,at some point following thorpe death,a bill was drafted by the oklahoma legislature that would have provided funding for a permanent memorial near the contemplated site for thorpe grave.however,in what was a harbinger of difficulties to come,the bill was vetoed by the governor of oklahoma.this sad and regrettable posthumous saga took an even more ominous turn when patsy,assisted by state law enforcement officers,intervened in thorpe ritual burial ceremony in oklahoma,and caused thorpe casket to be removed and stored.after considering various sites for thorpe burial patsy arranged to have thorpe buried at a location in jim thorpe,pennsylvania.that municipality was to be formed by the merger of mauch chunk and east mauch chunk,and the resulting borough was to be named jim thorpe.this agreement was reached despite the objection of several of thorpe children the agreement provided in part that mauch chunk and east mauch chunk would consolidate under the name jim thorpe as a fitting tribute and memorial to the person and memory of the husband of patsy thorpe and that appropriately correlated to such designation of the name jim thorpe the remains of him be laid to rest in the community so bearing his name.appendix app.patsy thorpe intended that the borough would be the final and permanent resting place for her husband.id.
after the arrangements were made for the burial site in the borough,thorpe was first buried at the evergreen cemetery in the borough while a mausoleum was being constructed for his remains.in,he was interred in what was believed to be his final resting place the agreement patsy had reached with the borough provides that the borough is responsible for the maintenance at the burial site.however,family members have visited the site over the years and have worked with the borough to conduct tribal ceremonies.the jim thorpe hall of fame has also worked to improve the site.
john thorpe filed the instant complaint in,alleging that the borough had failed to comply with nagpra the borough immediately moved to dismiss the complaint.the district court dismissed john thorpe claim but allowed him to proceed under nagpra john thorpe was also ordered to join all necessary parties in an amended complaint or submit evidence and briefing showing that joinder of any or all of the necessary parties was not feasible and that the action could proceed in equity and good conscience under rule b.app.john thorpe died the following year and the proceedings were stayed until his attorney filed an amended complaint naming as new plaintiffs john brothers richard and william thorpe,the sons of jim thorpe and his second wife freeda plaintiffs.
thereafter,the district court granted plaintiffs motion for summary judgment based on its conclusion that t he borough of jim thorpe is a museum under nagpra and subject to the requirements of the act,including those provisions governing repatriation requests.app.the borough appealed that finding and plaintiffs appealed the district court dismissal of their claim 
iii.jurisdiction and standard of review 
the district court had federal question jurisdiction pursuant to,and we have jurisdiction pursuant to.nagpra jurisdictional provision vests federal courts with jurisdiction over any action brought by any person alleging a violation of nagpra.this court exercises plenary review over the district court finding of law that nagpra applies to thorpe burial.pell dupont de nemours,cir.
iv.history and overview of nagpra 
nagpra,was first enacted in as a way to correct past abuses to,and guarantee protection for,the human remains and cultural objects of native american tribal culture.fed.it was passed with two main objectives first,to protect native american burial sites and to require excavation of such sites only by permit,and second,to set up a process by which federal agencies and museums holding native american remains and cultural artifacts will inventory those items and work with tribes to repatriate them.kickapoo traditional tribe of chacon,d,citing,reprinted in.united states corrow,cir.
the act was an attempt to respond to the looting and plundering of native american burial grounds and the theft of cultural artifacts from native american tribes that continued to pour salt into the many wounds that have been inflicted on native americans throughout the history of the united states.as stated in the house report 
digging and removing the contents of native american graves for reasons of profit or curiosity has been common practice.these activities were at their peak during the last century and the early part of this century.
in,the surgeon general issued an order to all army field officers to send him indian skeletons.this was done so that studies could be performed to determine whether the indian was inferior to the white man due to the size of the indian cranium.this action,along with an attitude that accepted the desecration of countless native american burial sites,resulted in hundreds of thousands native american human remains and funerary objects being sold or housed in museums and educational institutions around the county.
for many years,indian tribes have attempted to have the remains and funerary objects of their ancestors returned to them.this effort has touched off an often heated debate on the rights of the indian versus the importance to museums of the retention of their collections and the scientific value of the items.
the scope of the cultural plundering is breathtaking.national estimates are that between and two million deceased native people have been dug up from their graves for storage or display by government agencies,museums,universities and tourist attractions.jack trope walter echo hawk,the native american graves protection and repatriation act background and legislative history.
the movement to pass a law protecting native american human remains,funerary objects,cultural patrimony and sacred objects originated in a hearing held by the select committee on indian affairs in.that hearing was for a bill that would provide for the repatriation of indian artifacts.smithsonian secretary robert mccormick adams testified that of the remains in the institution collection,approximately of the specimens were the remains of north american indians.tribal reaction to secretary adams testimony was swift,and in the months which followed,indian tribes around the country called for the repatriation of those human remains that could be identified as associated with a specific tribe or region for their permanent disposition in accordance with tribal customs and traditions,and for the proper burial elsewhere of nonidentifiable remains.id.the proposed bill led to additional hearings,which resulted in establishing a panel for a national dialogue on american relations between museum professionals and native americans,designed to develop recommendations to address the necessity of responding to tribal demands for repatriation.the national museum of the american indian act,enacted in,was the precursor to nagpra and established such a museum in the smithsonian.it also included provisions for the treatment and disposition of human remains and sacred objects,including an inventory process.
legislative efforts to protect native american remains continued throughout and.during a hearing of the select committee on indian affairs,tribal representatives testified that 
in cases where native americans have attempted to regain items that were inappropriately alienated from their tribes,they have met with resistance from museums and have lacked the legal ability of sic financial resources to pursue the return of the items.several witnesses testified that in many instances indian tribes do not know what types of remains or objects are in the possession of museums and have been unsuccessful in their attempts to obtain access to this information.
native american leaders also spoke about the need to provide additional protections to native american burial sites.they testified that 
indian tribes have had many difficulties in preventing the illegal excavation of graves on tribal and federal lands.several witnesses testified that there is a flourishing trade in funerary and sacred objects that have been obtained from burials located on tribal and federal lands.additional testimony was received from witnesses who indicated that tribal and federal officials have been unable to prevent the continued looting of native american graves and the sale of these objects by unscrupulous collectors.
the repatriation procedure proposed was modeled after the national museum of the american indian act,which authorizes the repatriation of human remains and funerary objects from the collections of the smithsonian institution.new procedural requirements were a response to testimony by tribal witnesses about vast numbers of native american human remains contained in the smithsonian collections which,according to tribal religious practices,must be given appropriate burials.id.
the first draft of the native american repatriation of cultural patrimony act which eventually became nagpra was modeled after the provisions contained in the national museum of the american indian act.it attempted to extend the inventory,identification and repatriation provisions in the national museum of the american indian act to all federal agencies and any institution which receives federal funding.id.this bill,along with a bill introduced by senator mccain,the native american grave and burial protection act,formed the basis of nagpra.nagpra extended the museum of the american indian act to federal agencies and museums receiving federal funds.id.nagpra reach in protecting against further desecration of burial sites and restoring countless ancestral remains and cultural and sacred items to their tribal homes warrants its aspirational characterization as human rights legislation.united states corrow,cir quoting trope echo hawk,supra,at.
nagpra has two parallel procedures,depending on whether the item in question is held by a federal agency or museum or is discovered on federal lands after november,nagpra effective date.pueblo of san ildefonso ridlon,cir.first,the act addresses items excavated on federal lands after november,and enables native american groups affiliated with those items to claim ownership.see.second,nagpra provides for repatriation of cultural items currently held by federal agencies,including museums.id.
the procedure for repatriation of human remains under nagpra is as follows each federal agency and each museum which has possession or control over holdings or collections of native american human remains shall compile an inventory defined as a simple itemized list of such holdings or collections of native american human remains and,to the extent possible based on information possessed by such museum or federal agency,identify the geographical and cultural affiliation of such item.a.these are required to be completed in consultation with tribal governments no later than five years after november,and made available to a review committee established under the statute.b.
if the cultural affiliation of native american human remains is established,then the federal agency or museum,upon the request of a known lineal descendant of the native american or of the tribe or organization,shall return the remains.a.where there are multiple requests for repatriation of any cultural item which includes human remains,and the museum can not clearly determine which requesting party is the most appropriate claimant,the museum may retain such item until the requesting parties agree upon its disposition or the dispute is otherwise resolved pursuant to the provisions of this chapter or by a court of competent jurisdiction.e.any museum that fails to comply with these requirements may be assessed a civil penalty by the secretary of the interior.
v.the borough is not a museum under 
nagpra defines the word museum very broadly,as 
any institution or state or local government agency including any institution of higher learning that receives federal funds and has possession of,or control over,native american cultural items.
the borough is a local government entity that maintains jim thorpe burial site.the parties agree that the borough has possession of,or control over,jim thorpe remains,and that he is of native american descent.thus,the main question before the district court was whether the borough receives federal funds.the district court found that the borough was a museum because the record showed that the borough received federal funds after the enactment of nagpra.however,for the following reasons,we find that the borough is not a museum as intended by nagpra.it is therefore not required to comply with nagpra procedural requirement of providing an inventory of thorpe remains.similarly,it is not subject to the statute requirement that his remains be returned to thorpe descendants for repatriation at their request 
ordinarily,we look to the text of the statute,rather than the legislative history,to interpret a statute or determine legislative intent as an aid to interpretation.see.bank germain,d c ourts must presume that a legislature says in a statute what it means and means in a statute what it says there.in re visteon,cir it is for congress,not the courts,to enact legislation.when courts disregard the language congress has used in an unambiguous statute,they amend or repeal that which congress enacted into law.first merchs.acceptance bradford,cir.however,this rule of statutory construction is not an inviolable commandment that we must blindly enforce regardless of surrounding circumstances or the practical results of rigidly applying the text to a given situation.thus,we have made exceptions in rare cases in which the literal application of a statute will produce a result demonstrably at odds with the intentions of its drafters.first,at quoting griffin oceanic contractors,d.in such situations,those intentions must be controlling.id.as the supreme court has explained,s tatutory interpretations which would produce absurd results are to be avoided if alternative interpretations consistent with the legislative purpose are available.id.quoting griffin,at.but only absurd results and the most extraordinary showing of contrary intentions justify a limitation on the plain meaning of the statutory language.id.quoting garcia,d see also united states terlingo,cir noting that courts may look behind a statute only when the plain meaning produces a result that is not just unwise but is clearly absurd internal quotation marks omitted.
furthermore,a reviewing court should not confine itself to examining a particular statutory provision in isolation.rather,t he meaning or ambiguity of certain words or phrases may only become evident when placed in context.ass of home builders defenders of wildlife,d internal citation and quotation marks omitted.a court must interpret the statute as a symmetrical and coherent regulatory scheme,and fit,if possible,all parts into an harmonious whole.fda brown williamson tobacco,d citation and internal quotation marks omitted.accordingly,the supreme court has concluded that a n inference drawn from congressional silence certainly can not be credited when it is contrary to all other textual and contextual evidence of congressional intent.burns united states,d,abrogated on other grounds by booker united states,d.
we conclude that we are confronted with the unusual situation in which literal application of nagpra will produce a result demonstrably at odds with the intentions of its drafters.griffin,at.we must therefore look beyond the text of nagpra to identify the intentions of the drafters of the statute,and that intent must control our analysis.id.
as we have explained,nagpra requires repatriation of human remains from museums,where those remains have been collected and studied for archeological or historical purposes.it is clear from the legislative history we have recounted above that congress was also concerned with returning to native american tribes the human remains and artifacts that had been taken for profit,gain,exploitation,or rank curiosity without regard to the concerns of the native american tribe whose legitimate and paramount interest should have been recognized.however,the definition of museum in the text of nagpra sweeps much wider than that.if interpreted literally,it would include any state or local governmental entity that has possession of,or control over,native american cultural items regardless of the circumstances surrounding the possession.this could include any items given freely by a member of the tribe.here,it would include human remains buried in accordance with the wishes of the decedent.literal application would even reach situations where the remains of a native american were disposed of in a manner consistent with the deceased wishes as appropriately memorialized in a testamentary instrument or communicated to his or her family.there is therefore no limitation that would preserve the final wishes of a given native american or exempt determination of his or her final resting place from the procedural requirements of nagpra 
we have reserved some scope for adopting a restricted rather than a literal or usual meaning of a statute words where acceptance of that meaning would thwart the obvious purpose of the statute.griffin,at internal quotations,ellipsis and citation omitted.here,it is clear that the congressional intent to regulate institutions such as museums and to remedy the historical atrocities inflicted on native americans,including plundering of their graves,is not advanced by interpreting museum to include a gravesite that thorpe widow intended as thorpe final resting place.as we stated earlier,plaintiffs do not maintain that patsy was without authority to determine where thorpe was to be buried.moreover,as also explained above,the record is clear that plaintiffs delayed bringing this suit until certain of thorpe survivors who favored his burial in the borough died.
as stated in the house report,t he purpose of nagpra is to protect native american burial sites and the removal of human remains.emphasis added.nagpra was intended as a shield against further injustices to native americans.it was not intended to be wielded as a sword to settle familial disputes within native american families.yet,that is what we would allow if we were to enforce nagpra repatriation provisions as written here.
aside from the unusual arrangements between patsy thorpe and the borough,and plaintiffs understandable desire to move thorpe remains to where they prefer for him to be buried his burial in the borough is no different than any other burial,except that he is a legendary figure of native american descent.if we were to find that nagpra applies to thorpe burial,we would also have to conclude that it applies to any grave located in any institution or state or local government agency that receives federal funds and has possession of,or control over,native american cultural items.this could call into question any institution or state or local government agency that controls a cemetery or grave site where native americans are buried,and would give rights to any lineal descendant or tribe that has a claim to a person buried in such a cemetery.the amicus brief on behalf of thorpe grandsons,michael koehler and john thorpe,makes this clear 
imagine a scenario where a deceased person is buried by his widow at the site of her choosing.but after the widow dies,the next generation or even complete strangers in the case of a tribe decides to dig up the body with court approval and move it somewhere else for any reason they desire.they are even required to bury the remains.this is not a parade of horribles conjured up by the thorpe grandsons.that is their reality.if the district court decision is allowed to stand,this scenario can repeat for funerals past and future as long as the deceased has any native american ancestry.
amicus br.for koehler and thorpe,at.accordingly,based solely on the language and context of the most relevant statutory provisions,the court can not say that congress intent is so clear and unambiguous that it foreclose s any other interpretation.king burwell,cir quoting grapevine imports,united states.
there are numerous indications that congress did not intend for nagpra to apply to this situation.the senate report explains that the statute was designed to provide additional protections to native american burial sites.indian tribes have had many difficulties in preventing the illegal excavation of graves on tribal and federal lands,and tribal and federal officials have been unable to prevent the continued looting of native american graves and the sale of these objects by unscrupulous collectors.the amicus brief submitted by the national congress of the american indians in support of plaintiffs summarized the antiquities act of.that act defined native american remains on federal lands as archeological resources.amicus br.of cong.of the am.indians,at.the collateral consequence was the disinterment of many remains for preservation in museums.the amici also refer to the archaeological resources protection act of.that statute also deemed native american remains on federal lands archaeological resources and permitted those remains to be disinterred.id.at.this was in sharp contrast to the legal treatment of burials and remains,which were generally protected from looting and disturbance.nagpra was needed to ensure equal treatment of native american remains.id.emphasis added.with this objective,congress sought to repatriate human remains and other objects by ensuring human remains are returned.id.at.
our conclusion that congress did not intend the result required by a literal application of the text of nagpra is reinforced by examining multiple sections of the statute.for example,as noted earlier,defines right of possession to include human remains freely given by the deceased
