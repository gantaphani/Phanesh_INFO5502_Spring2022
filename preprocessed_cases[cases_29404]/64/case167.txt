the intestate heirs of decedent taruk joseph ben ali appeal from a judgment admitting the decedent will to probate.appellants contend there was insufficient evidence of due execution under probate code section.we agree,and reverse the judgment.
background 
a.the parties 
taruk,born in,was the only biological child of hassan ben ali and ann jackson.hassan and jackson were married in and divorced in,but maintained a relationship over the next years.hassan also had a son from a different relationship,lloyd,with whom hassan had little contact before.according to hassan attorney,respondent ivan golde,hassan was a very shrewd and savvy real estate investor who had owned a lot of properties over the years and had also gone through financial problems,including tax problems.one of hassan properties was an apartment building at ashby avenue in berkeley hereafter ashby property or ashby building,which hassan had transferred to taruk in approximately,perhaps to avoid losing the property to the irs.
in,jackson moved into an apartment in the ashby building.hassan occupied another apartment in the building at that time and,according to jackson,continued to handle all aspects of managing the property despite title being in their son name.on august,taruk married appellant wendelyn wilburn.according to wilburn,hassan opposed the marriage,believed wilburn just wanted to obtain a portion of the ashby property,and persisted in trying to talk taruk out of marrying her down to the day of their wedding.at the time of the marriage,taruk had a young daughter from a previous relationship,appellant brittany desmond,and wilburn had a son.wilburn was aware when she married taruk that he had spent time in prison and had a history of drug problems.according to wilburn,drugs were not an issue for taruk during their relationship and marriage until sometime in early,when he relapsed into using drugs.
decedent disappearance and death 
wilburn was on a business trip in las vegas on june,when she communicated with taruk by telephone for the last time.over the next two days,wilburn repeatedly tried to call taruk from las vegas,but got no answer.when she returned from her trip,she called hassan to find out if he knew where taruk was.hassan told her taruk had decided to leave her and start a new life somewhere else.he told similar stories to jackson and others who inquired about taruk whereabouts.wilburn testified she did not believe hassan,and made attempts to locate taruk,but neither wilburn nor anyone else reported taruk disappearance to the police.between june and december,hassan continued to manage taruk apartment building in taruk name,collected rents,forged taruk name on checks drawn against taruk bank accounts,and refinanced the property in the amount of by forging taruk signature and the signature of a notary.
in november,hassan called golde and asked to meet with him.hassan informed golde that taruk had in fact died in.hassan explained he had found taruk dead of a drug overdose in a hotel room.not wanting to report the death for fear of losing the ashby property,he had taken taruk body to the property and hidden it in the wall of a storage area of the building.hassan further informed golde that a person who had assisted him in the removal and concealment of taruk body was extorting substantial sums of money from him by threatening to reveal what had happened.
hassan committed suicide on december,while berkeley police officers were visiting the property.two days later,taruk body was discovered on the premises.police believed taruk had died four and half years earlier,in june.hassan left a will,not contested in this proceeding,in which he named his former spouse,ann jackson,as the sole beneficiary of his estate.
decedent will 
among hassan possessions,police found a purported will of taruk,bearing the apparent signatures of taruk and two attesting witnesses.the typewritten document was dated august,two weeks after taruk and wilburn were married,and the day before they were to leave town for a honeymoon in hawaii.it recited that taruk had one living child,brittany desmond.the document provided taruk wife,who was the only person not referred to by name in it,was to receive all of taruk personal property,and his father,hassan ben ali,was to receive all other assets.it further stated desmond has been provided for by a life insurance policy on my life,which is held in trust for her by my father,hassan ben ali.hassan was identified as executor of the estate in the document,and attorney ivan gold was named as the alternate executor 
the purported will contained an attestation clause stating it was signed by taruk in the presence of two witnesses who also signed in the presence of each other and that taruk declared to them the document was his last will and testament.one of the witness signatures was of wendy ben ali with an address of ashby berkeley,ca.the handwritten name and address of the second purported witness were illegible,and the identity of that person has never been determined.
probate court proceedings 
wilburn filed a petition for appointment and for letters of administration.lloyd filed a separate petition for appointment and for probate of the will.golde filed a petition to be appointed the executor of taruk will,and for probate of the will.wilburn and desmond objected to the petitions filed by lloyd and golde,and filed contests to the validity of the purported will.the question of the validity of taruk purported will of august,was tried to the court.the primary issues were whether the will was duly executed according to the requirements of section,subdivision c or,if not,whether the will proponents proved by clear and convincing evidence under subdivision c that taruk intended the instrument to constitute his will when he signed it 
respondent forensic document expert,david moore,testified he believed with a high degree of certainty taruk signature on the will was authentic based on comparing it with known signatures of taruk.he further believed wilburn signature was probably genuine based on comparison with one known signature by wilburn in which she signed as wendy ben ali.appellants forensic document expert,james blanco,opined it was highly probable the signatures of taruk and wilburn on the will were not genuine.wilburn denied witnessing or signing the will,although she acknowledged the wendy portion of the signature looked like something she would write.she testified hassan asked her to sign something in,which he told her was a medical release needed in case taruk required medical attention.wilburn further testified she never lived at the ashby building,and did not use or sign documents with the surname ben ali,except for one application she filled out with taruk on august.
probate court decision 
the probate court rejected expert blanco analysis of taruk and wilburn signatures and accepted the testimony of expert moore that both signatures were genuine.the court found these conclusions were bolstered by circumstantial evidence including the common understanding that wills are often executed in anticipation of taking a trip,the fact taruk and wilburn were flying to hawaii the morning after the will was executed,a reasonable inference taruk wanted to be certain his testamentary intentions were made clear before embarking on that journey,and the reasonable inference taruk would want to make clear after his marriage that his father would receive the ashby property rather than his intestate heirs.the court also noted wilburn interests were adverse to the will and her testimony accordingly had to be evaluated with caution.
with respect to the signature of the unknown witness,the court held the regular and complete attestation clause on the signature page of the will was prima facie evidence of the validity of the unknown signature.further,the court held its findings regarding the validity of taruk and wilburn signatures,and the expert opinion and circumstantial evidence supporting those findings,by reasonable inference,lent credibility to the unknown signature.the court noted the evidence against the validity of the unknown signature derived from wilburn testimony that she did not sign the will,and by inference that the unknown signature and attestation must also be fictitious.the court found wilburn testimony unreliable for the following reasons she had a financial interest in having the will invalidated her testimony that she chose not to use the ben ali last name during her marriage was contradicted by her use of it just two weeks before the date of the will and her testimony regarding what she may have signed,and when,was vague and equivocal,and her memory seemed selective.the court found the evidence in favor of the validity of the unknown signature outweighed the evidence against its validity.the court found it unnecessary to determine if there was clear and convincing evidence under section,subdivision c that taruk intended the will to be his testamentary instrument,but observed such evidence far outweighs the evidence to the contrary.
the court denied wilburn petition for letters,denied the will contest,granted the petitions for probate of the will,and made its own appointment of an administrator in view of an express waiver by golde of his right to appointment.
this timely appeal followed.
ii.discussion 
appellants contend the trial court erred in applying a presumption of due execution since the proponents failed to establish the genuineness of the signatures of both witnesses,and the proponents failed to establish by clear and convincing evidence the decedent intended the contested document to be his will.
standard of review 
the question of due execution of a will is one of fact,and the probate court finding will not be reversed on appeal if there is any substantial evidence to sustain it.estate of fletcher cal d.in this case,however,the probate court relied on a rebuttable presumption of due execution which it found arose as a matter of law from the regular and complete attestation clause on the signature page of the will,buttressed by evidence of the genuineness of the signatures of taruk and wilburn.thus,as a threshold matter,we are confronted with a question of law in the face of contrary evidence is evidence of the genuineness of the signatures of the testator and one of two subscribing witnesses on the signature page of a will containing a regular and complete attestation clause sufficient to establish due execution for purposes of section,subdivision c this is a purely legal issue the interpretation of a statute that is subject to de novo review.people ex rel.lockyer shamrock foods cal th.
if the proponents evidence was insufficient to establish compliance with section,subdivision c,we must address whether the proponents nonetheless proved by clear and convincing evidence under section,subdivision c that taruk intended the document in issue to be his will.the probate court made no finding on this issue to which this court must defer.we may therefore decide as a matter of law whether a reasonable fact finder could determine the evidence of taruk intent was clear and convincing.see,in re henry th,city of santa cruz pacific gas electric th,aquino superior court th.
proof of due execution 
relying on estate of pitcairn cal pitcairn,the trial court held the regular and complete attestation clause on the signature page of the will was prima facie evidence of the validity of the unknown witness signature.for the reasons discussed below,we believe the trial court misread pitcairn.it did not hold a regular and complete attestation clause could establish the genuineness of an unknown signature,but the converse proof of the genuineness of the subscribing witnesses signatures is sufficient to create a presumption of due execution notwithstanding an irregular or incomplete attestation clause.
preliminarily,we note the power to make a will is conferred solely by statute the power to dispose of one property by will and the mode by which it may be exercised are matters under legislative control,and the mode prescribed by the statute must be followed,or there is no will.estate of manchester cal.when due execution of a will is contested,the proponents of the will have the burden of proving it,subd.a.section specifies how execution may be proven at the trial,each subscribing witness shall be produced and examined.if no subscribing witness is available as a witness within the meaning of section of the evidence code,the court may admit the evidence of other witnesses to prove the due execution of the will.
pitcairn was an appeal from a judgment admitting a contested will to probate.pitcairn,supra,cal d at.the only ground of contest was that the will was not executed with the formalities required by statute.ibid.there was no dispute the will was signed by the testatrix or that it was subscribed by two witnesses,both of whom testified at the trial.ibid.however,one of the subscribing witnesses testified she was not present in the room when the testatrix signed and that she was asked to sign a piece of paper without being told it was a will.ibid.there was some evidence of an adverse attitude and untrustworthy recollection on the part of the witness.id.at pp.further,the attestation clause was incomplete and merely recited it was signed witnessed by the witnesses.id.at.the trial court found in favor of the proponents,and the issue before the reviewing court was whether there was substantial evidence to support its findings and judgment.ibid.the court described the issue more particularly as follows we have,then,a case where the signatures of the testatrix and subscribing witnesses are genuine the will is attested,but lacks a formal attestation clause reciting the steps in execution the attesting witnesses,seemingly adverse but uncontradicted on the essential issues,testify to a technical failure to comply with the formalities of execution.in such a case,may the trial court admit the will to probate id.at,italics added.
the supreme court concluded the trial court could admit the will to probate on those facts.first,the court noted the rule that a regular and complete attestation clause makes out a prima facie case of due execution.pitcairn,supra,cal d at.this rule came about because if the witnesses are dead,unavailable,or unable to testify or recollect,or are adverse or corrupt,it is necessary to rely on other evidence of the sufficiency of the instrument.ibid.however,the court rejected the suggestion that it is the specific recitals in the clause that furnish the basis for the presumption.ibid.instead,it found t he foundation of the presumption is the proof of genuineness of the signatures,for the instrument is then on its face a valid will.ibid.the recitals in an attestation clause may add to the weight or force of the presumption,but they do not in themselves create the logical basis for it.id.at pp.the pitcairn court cited two earlier california cases also standing for the proposition that the presumption of due execution,when it exists,depends upon proof of the genuineness of the subscribing witnesses signatures.see estate of kent cal,kent testimony of a single subscribing witness authenticating signatures of both witnesses validates will lacking any attesting clause estate of tyler cal,tyler will upheld notwithstanding an incomplete attestation clause where the evidence established the genuineness of the testatrix and both subscribing witnesses signatures.
respondent cites estate of gerst d.the relevant facts in gerst were stated as follows the signatures of both witnesses are genuine.one witness predeceased testatrix and the other had absolutely no recollection of the circumstances surrounding the execution of the will or the affixing of his own signature thereto.id.at.in gerst,the court merely applied the rule stated in pitcairn,kent,and tyler that where a will bears the genuine signatures of the testator and attesting witnesses,the presumption exists on the death of the witnesses or failure of their memory that all of the requirements of probate code,section section predecessor statute,proof of which depends on the recollection of the witnesses,were duly observed.gerst,at,citing tyler and other cases,italics added.
