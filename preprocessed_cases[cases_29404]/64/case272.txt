in this probate case,eric williams towle,the biological son of the decedent,homer eugene williams,appeals from orders admitting to probate a holographic will offered by the decedent stepdaughter,deborah ann cox,and appointing cox executor.appellant principal argument is that the document is not a valid holographic will under probate code section because it is not signed by the decedent.appellant also argues that the document is not a valid will because it does not completely dispose of the decedent assets and because it lacks language demonstrating testamentary intent.our review of the law regarding holographic wills and the evidence in this case supports the trial court finding that the document admitted to probate is a valid holographic will.we therefore affirm the orders.
background 
procedural history 
homer eugene williams died on december.on february,his son,eric williams towle towle,filed a petition to administer his father estate,alleging that his father had died intestate.the petition was granted on march.
on may,the decedent stepdaughter,deborah ann cox cox,filed a petition for suspension of towle powers as personal representative of the estate.concurrently,she filed a petition to admit a holographic will into probate,and a petition to be named the executor of the estate,as specified in the will.towle objected to cox petition for probate of the holographic will and to her appointment as the executor of the estate.
on may,following a hearing on may,the court ordered towle powers as personal representative suspended,pending a decision on the purported holographic will.
a hearing was held over four days between june,and august,after which the court took the matter under submission.on the following day,august,by minute order,the court granted cox petitions and issued orders entering the holographic will into probate and naming cox as executor of the decedent will.
towle filed a notice of appeal on october.he appeals the order admitting the holographic will to probate and the order appointing cox as executor 
cox,towle,and virginia towle,the decedent first wife,testified at the hearing.testimony centered around the circumstances in which the will was found,the decedent customary way of signing and completing documents,the relationship the decedent had with his children and stepchildren,and his expressions of his testamentary wishes.
after the decedent death,towle was unable to locate a will in the decedent belongings and thus began probate proceedings based on the understanding that no will existed.about a week after the decedent death,cox found what appeared to be a holographic will in the center drawer of decedent desk and later brought this to the attention of towle attorney.the desk contained other important documents such as bank statements and tax returns.the center drawer did not appear to contain any important documents other than a checkbook.
the document found by cox was handwritten on the front and back of the first page of a note pad.the entire text was written in capital letters.the next two sheets of the note pad were blank.after the blank pages,the next page of the note pad contained what appeared to be a list of movies,in the same block printing.the remaining pages were blank.
the words last will,or what of homer eugene williams appear at the top of the document,followed by the decedent address.the document then names deborah cox and lorna williams as executors,states their relationships to the decedent stepdaughter and respectively,and includes their addresses.it then states power of attorney now deborah cox.this is followed by a disposition of the decedent collectibles.the document says,all my collictables everything including two pistols and two rifles,none fired to nephew kirk bell.kirk bell address is included.next is a paragraph stating,in the event of a serious sickness or accident i do not want to be kept alive by life support means.i name my executors to see to my wishes are carried out.then there is a heading entitled my estate.this is followed by two items house and bank account.the present market value of the house is stated to be to.the bank accounts include checking and savings,but no balances are stated.the final paragraph states,i would like my step daughter,debra cox to be able to live in the house as long as she wants before putting it up for sale.
cox testified that the name written at the top of this document appeared to be written by the decedent.she explained that the decedent often left her notes to do things for him that were in block letters,with his name also written in block letters,similar to that on the holographic will.cox had never seen the decedent write in cursive,although she had come across checks where he had signed his name.cox explained that her stepfather was aware of the value of properties in the neighborhood because he would talk to people on the block when properties were for sale.therefore,she believed that his estimate of the value of the house at to likely reflected values at the time he wrote the document.cox estimated that the current value of the house is approximately,which she believed indicated that the document was written some years ago.where she found the notepad,in the decedent desk drawer,he would have had easy access to it.
cox testified that the decedent had told her that he put her and his law both down as the executor for his will.he was aware that cox had previously been the executor for her grandmother estate and he knew that the probate had gone smoothly.cox testified that she is the general cashier in charge of the cash at the marriott hotel in santa clara.in this position,she handles thousand dollars in cash each day.prior to being the general cashier,cox was the accounts payable person and was in charge of paying bills.cox also testified that on two occasions her stepfather had promised her the house.he had told her if i stayed there with him,i would get the house if he died,and then also when the house was paid off and he showed me the paper from the bank and says now,you do have anything to worry about.the decedent had two life insurance policies.one was payable to cox,and her niece was the beneficiary of the other one.
the decedent and virginia towle divorced when their two children,eric and gayle,were three and seven respectively.virginia towle remarried four years later and subsequently began using towle as her last name and the last name for her children.the decedent also remarried and began living with his second wife and her children,including cox.in the,they moved as a family to serge avenue,san jose,where the decedent lived until his death in.cox left home while in college,but moved back into the home at serge avenue for good in,at her stepfather request after her mother had died.she provided companionship and care for her stepfather for the last years of his life.she did things such as fixing his dinner,cleaning,shopping,doing laundry,running errands,picking up medications,and taking him to the doctor.when he became ill,she continued to take care of him.the night before he died,she went to the hospital with him and stayed with him until he died.the towle family decided not to have a funeral because the family had plans for virginia towle birthday.cox later learned that the cremation had taken place and that the ashes had been sent back to nebraska.she and her niece were very upset by this.
cox testified that she and her stepfather had a close,loving,familial relationship.she called him dad.he had mentioned to her that he wanted to adopt her.in contrast,she testified that the decedent had a distant relationship with his biological children.she said that eric towle only visited his father five times in thirty years,although he lived in scotts valley and worked in san jose.his father home was only approximately minutes off of the route towle would take back and forth to work.cox thought towle called his father two or three times a year.cox remembered four occasions when the decedent daughter visited him in thirty years.she did not remember the decedent daughter calling.cox felt that the families were completely separate after the divorce and that the decedent essentially became part of his second wife family.she said her stepfather had been very upset when he found out that his biological children were no longer using his name.
towle and virginia towle provided testimony that conflicted with cox testimony regarding family relationships and the way the decedent wrote documents.virginia towle testified that the decedent loved his biological children and that she and her children socialized with the decedent constantly.he was invited to everything and anything that had to do with graduation,special performances in school there was constantly baptisms and weddings we were always there together.virginia towle explained that cox never attended those events and that the decedent never discussed cox.virginia towle continues her relationship with the decedent remaining siblings.she testified that the funeral was not held for the decedent because no one was interested and it seemed why,there was no one to go to it.
virgina towle testified that she had never seen the decedent print anything and that any letters,documents and things were always written rather than being printed.additionally,virginia towle had asked the decedent about making a will at a party about ten years ago.she explained,i said,have you done anything about the will and the property he said i do it,i do it.i go,you have to.what about the house he said it goes to gail and eric.
towle testified that he had a very good relationship with his father.he did not see him regularly because i was in a very busy phase of my life,and he basically,like many elderly people,became much more bound to his routines,and the list of things he would do got shorter and shorter.according to towle,the relationship was not estranged and the decedent sent towle and his sister birthday and christmas cards every year.the cards to towle were signed,love,dad.he also sent his grandchildren cards and gifts.towle testified that cox relationship with the decedent was not close.he never talked about her and she seemed to be living a separate life t here was nothing they ever did together.pictures introduced during towle testimony depicted the decedent with his biological children and their families at family events such as a wedding and a christening.
towle testified that he had never seen his father write any documents in block letters similar to that in the purported holographic will.he introduced credit cards,checks,and identification cards,all of which the decedent had signed in cursive.towle identified the signatures on those documents as his father.
standard of review 
it is a judicial function to interpret a written instrument unless the interpretation turns upon the credibility of extrinsic evidence.this rule has been specifically applied by the california supreme court to the interpretation of wills.estate of macleod d.macleod,quoting parsons bristol development cal d.where an issue can be determined from evaluating the document on its face,and by reference to applicable law,we can make such determination independently of the lower court.estate of morgan cal,estate of black cal d.where,however,extrinsic evidence is properly received,and such evidence is conflicting and conflicting inferences arise therefrom,the appellate court will accept or adhere to the interpretation adopted by the trial court provided that that interpretation is supported by substantial evidence.estate of ehrenfel d.parsons bristol development,supra,cal d.it is for the probate court in the first instance to say whether the document was signed by the decedent,and its determination will not be disturbed unless it is without support of the evidence.estate of kinney cal d.where,as here,there are no written findings by the trial court,we presume the court made all findings necessary to support the order.schubert reynolds th,d.
the holographic will statute 
section of the probate code provides that a formal will must be witnessed.however,section further provides that if a will does not comply with section,it is nonetheless valid as a holographic will,whether or not witnessed,if the signature and the material provisions are in the handwriting of the testator,subd.a.section provides that e xtrinsic evidence is admissible to determine whether a document constitutes a will pursuant to section or,or to determine the meaning of a will or a portion of a will if the meaning is unclear.
the primary purpose of the holographic will statute is to prevent fraud by requiring that the material provisions be in the testator writing.estate of southworth th,d.whether a document should be admitted to probate as a holographic will depends on proof of its authorship and authenticity,and whether the words establish that it was intended to be the author last will and testament at the time she or he wrote it.id.at,d.courts are to use common sense in evaluating whether a document constitutes a holographic will.id.at,d estate of black,supra,cal d at.
as the supreme court observed in estate of black,supra,cal d,t he policy of the law is toward a construction favoring validity,in determining whether a will has been executed in conformity with statutory requirements.citations.id.at.the high court affirmed the tendency of both the courts and the legislature toward greater liberality in accepting a writing as an holographic will substantial compliance with the statute,and not absolute precision is all that is required.citation,italics in text see also estate of baker cal d.
the signature requirement 
appellant primary argument is that the will was not a holographic will because it did not contain a valid signature.since the trial court admitted the holographic will to probate,we must presume that the court found it complied with the statute requiring that the signature and the material provisions are in the handwriting of the testator.two components of the signature requirement are relevant here the location of the name in the document,and whether the testator use of block letters constituted his signature.
location of the signature 
there is no requirement that the signature on a holographic will must be at the end of the document,so long as it appears from the document itself that the signature was intended to authenticate the document.it is settled in california that the signature need not be located at the end but may appear in another part of the document,provided the testator wrote his name there with the intention of authenticating or executing the instrument as his will.estate of bloch cal d.
several cases illustrate this rule.in estate of morgan,supra,cal,morgan,a document found after the decedent death contained her name only twice and was not signed at the end of the document.the court found that this did not render the document invalid as a will.if the words last will and testament of ynez morgan appeared at the end of the will,all doubt that the signature was intended to be and was adopted as the final executing signature in authentication of and in execution of the document as a completed testamentary act would be removed.looking at the instrument as a whole,we are of the view that,by the use of these words in the beginning of the instrument,it was the intention of the testatrix to thereby execute the document as a will.id.at.
similarly,in estate of brooks cal,brooks,the decedent included her name only in the first sentence of her will.the court found that t he first sentence this is my ryan brooks has probative force to uphold the inference that the name of the decedent was written with the intention of evidencing the fact that the document was her fully executed completed will.id.at.while there were other factors that supported a contrary inference that the will was as the lack of a period at the end,two blank lines between two of the clauses,the failure to name an executor,and the fact that the writing ended court in brooks found it could not say as a matter of law that the will before it was not complete.the court therefore upheld the finding of the lower court.id.at.
in the holographic will before us,similar to those in brooks and morgan,the testator did not include his name at the end of the document.however,the evidence on the face of the document as a whole supports a finding that the name was placed with the intention of authenticating the document.the phrase last will of homer eugene williams located at the top of the document is almost identical to the title of the holographic will in morgan.in addition,there are other factors indicating that the document was complete.cases have shown that completeness is highly relevant in determining if the name was written with an intent to authenticate the document.
from the earliest consideration of the question,completeness of the testamentary declaration has been deemed sufficient evidence of the signing of the writing,even though the declarant name was written by him at a place other than the end.estate of kinney,supra,cal d at,kinney.in kinney,the name of the decedent is included in only one location,after the date at the top of the page.the first sentence states,i anna leona graves kinney,do bequeath all my possessions to my four sisters who were living in.id.at.the court noted that two characteristics indicated the document was complete.first,i t was written with studied care,indicated by the fact that the decedent copied into her will the names and addresses of her sisters who were living at the time stated id.at.second,t he fact that sufficient space remained on the paper to include additional writing if the decedent intended any further declaration is also some evidence of finality and completeness.ibid.the court concluded the writing here involved appears to be a complete testamentary declaration.ibid.
the document before us has similar indicia of completeness.first,the decedent took the time,with studied care,to list the addresses of those people included in the will cox,his,and his nephew.kinney,supra,cal d at.he also wrote down his own address.second,as in kinney,there was sufficient room at the end of the document for the decedent to write more if he had wanted to do so.another characteristic indicating completeness was the age of the document.here the inference could be drawn from the property values stated in the document that it was written a number of years ago.cox testified that she found it in the decedent center desk drawer,where it was readily available had he wanted to change or add to it.all of this evidence reasonably supports the conclusion that the writer had done everything that he intended to do.estate of brooks,supra,cal.at,italics in original.
the case before us differs from estate of bernard cal,in which the document clearly appeared to be unfinished.there the court wrote the abrupt termination of the document near the middle of the last page is a strong indication of decedent intent to do something more in order to make it a complete will.id.at.in contrast,here the decedent appointed an executor,disposed of his collectables,listed assets for reference,and then indicated his intention for the house.unlike the will in brooks,supra,the document ended with a period.see also estate of bloch,supra,cal d at,bloch court noted that the document appeared to have a period at the end when determining if it was complete.
from an evaluation of the whole document in the case before us,it appears that the name at the top of the document was intended as a mark of execution.by comparison,the supreme court in estate of bloch,supra,cal d,found a will that was written on two sides of an envelope to be properly executed,where the testator name appeared only once in the document,and neither at the bottom nor the top,but rather as part of a description of bonds to be distributed.the document listed the amount of the bonds following the phrase,bonds belonging solely to helene bloch id.at.although it appeared that the testator had used her name to describe the property,the court found that it could also serve as a signature authenticating the will.the court in bloch held since it appears that the holographic document written by bloch is a complete testamentary instrument,it follows,under the decision in estate of kinney,supra,cal d,that her name is to be regarded as having been written in the body of the instrument with authenticating intent.id.at.the supreme court in bloch observed that courts of this state have been very liberal in sustaining the validity of holographic wills which appear to be complete testamentary documents although signed elsewhere than at the end.estate of bloch,supra,cal d at.the court then cited a number of cases in which wills were upheld where the testator name appeared in the title or somewhere other than at the end of the document.see estate of brooks,supra,cal,estate of wallace d,estate of gardener d,estate of kaminski d,estate of bauman,et,estate of sullivan,estate of england.
under the foregoing cases,the document before us provides sufficient indicia of completeness from which to conclude that the name at the top was intended to be a mark of authentication.when the name is used to identify the decedent as the author of the alleged will or to identify the instrument as decedent will and in addition the instrument appears to be a complete testamentary document,it may reasonably be inferred that the name was placed where it was with the intention of executing the instrument.in such cases the name is linked to the alleged testamentary act and the probabilities that it was intended as a signature are strong.estate of rowe d.
form of the signature 
appellant contends that the decedent name at the top of the document is written in block letters,and therefore,can not be considered a signature.this argument is based upon the decision in estate of twohig d.twohig.twohig concerned a handwritten codicil to an executed formal will.however,the testator failed to sign the codicil.the court reasoned that the unsigned codicil could not incorporate the formal will by reference because it was not itself a complete testamentary document since it lacked a signature.the court explained that w hile the courts have been liberal with regard to the form and location of the signature within the holograph citations they have not condoned its absence.id.at.the court further found that the two documents could not be deemed integrated because one was holographic and one was not,and the holographic document altered the provisions of the formal document.the court concluded that the codicil could not be admitted into probate because it was unsigned.
our case is distinguishable from twohig.in twohig,the codicil did not include the testator name at all.there was therefore no authenticating mark from which an intent to execute the document could be inferred.further,it appeared that the testator had intended to sign it because he wrote signed on a particular date.thus,unlike our case,the document on its face tended to show that there was something else the testator intended to add before the document was complete,namely his signature.finally,there was no issue in our case that the document attempted to modify a valid will.the holographic will in our case was the testator only expression of his testamentary wishes.
appellant asserts that the block letters at the top of the document are not in the form the decedent used to sign legal documents and,therefore,it must be found that the document was not properly executed.however,several cases illustrate that the way a testator signs a holographic will does not need to be identical to a signature used to sign other legal documents.in estate of morris d.morris,the court found that t he use of the initials as a signature was an effective signing of the will.citations.the words,love from muddy,signed at the end of a holographic will in the form of a letter,were also considered a valid signature.estate of button cal,button.and similarly,in estate of henderson cal,henderson,the court found the phrase your loving mother constituted a valid signature.
morris,button,and henderson demonstrate that the name on a holographic will does not need to be a legal signature to validly authenticate the will.therefore,appellant evidence that the decedent signed checks,credit cards,and identification cards in a different manner does not require a find
