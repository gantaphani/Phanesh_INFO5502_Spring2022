introduction 
helen wilson appeals from orders in two consolidated probate proceedings to determine the beneficiaries to the henry and bernice stoddart inter vivos trust the trust.the trustors,henry stoddart henry and bernice stoddart bernice,were husband and wife.they directed distribution of the trust for the benefit of their son,george stoddart george,upon the death of the trustors however,george predeceased both henry and bernice,and the trust provided no alternative distribution.henry died in and bernice died in.after bernice died,wilson,who is henry niece and claims to be an heir of henry and george,filed petitions in estate of bernice stoddart super.san diego county,no.estate case and wilson hall,super.san diego county,no.trust case,claiming she was entitled to a portion of the trust under the laws of intestacy,as an heir of henry.the probate court denied wilson petitions and ordered the trust distributed to bernice estate.wilson appeals from these orders,as well as from orders denying her motions for reconsideration.
wilson claims that amendments to the probate code that purportedly would entitle her to distribution of a portion of the trust as an intestate heir of henry,and which took effect after the probate court made its orders,apply to this case on appeal.in the alternative,wilson claims that under the law in effect at the time the probate court issued its orders,bernice estate was not entitled to distribution of the entire trust,and that george heirs were entitled to a portion of such distribution.respondent thomas hall contends that wilson appeal of the probate court original orders is untimely,and that the orders denying her motions for reconsideration are not appealable.
we conclude that wilson appeal of the underlying orders is timely.we also conclude that the probate court orders denying wilson motions for reconsideration are not appealable.we further conclude that the law in effect at the time the probate court made its orders applies to the issues raised in this case on appeal and that,under that law,the trust is distributable to bernice estate.we therefore affirm the probate court orders denying wilson an interest in the trust and ordering that the trust be distributed to bernice estate.we dismiss that portion of wilson appeal taken from the court orders denying her motions for reconsideration.
factual and procedural background 
henry and bernice executed the trust in.the trust contained their community property.the trust provided that upon the death of the first trustor,the trust would be divided into two trusts,trust a and trust trust b would be comprised of assets and interests belonging to the first trustor to die,and trust a would be comprised of assets and interests belonging to the survivor.both trust a and b were to be administered for the benefit of the survivor during the survivor life.in addition,the survivor was entitled to elect to direct full distribution of trust a during his or her lifetime.the trust further directed that upon the survivor death,any of trust a not effectively appointed by the survivor would be added to trust with respect to how the trust should be distributed upon the death of the survivor trustor,the trust provided 
upon the death of the survivor of the trustors,the successor trustee shall distribute the trust estate to george henry stoddart in trust.george henry stoddart shall receive the net income from the trust estate in quarterly installments until he reaches the age of years,at which time the trust shall terminate and all proceeds both principal and interest of the trust estate shall be distributed to george henry stoddart.
george predeceased both henry and bernice.the trust contained no alternative disposition.
henry died testate in.his will provided in relevant part 
i give all the rest and residue of my estate,both real and personal,of whatever nature and wheresoever situated,to my wife,bernice stoddart,as trustee,if she survives me,and if she does not survive me,then to my son,george henry stoddart,as successor trustee of the trust 
if for any reason the disposition as above set forth is not operative or is invalid,or if the trust referred to fails or has been revoked,then i give the residue of my estate to my wife,bernice stoddart,if she survives me and if she does not survive me,then to my son,george henry stoddart,and if he does not survive me,then to his heirs by right of representation.
bernice died in.in september,wilson filed petitions in both the trust case and the estate case asserting a right to distribution of a portion of trust b under the laws of intestacy.
on june,the probate court entered orders denying wilson petitions in both the trust case and the estate case.the orders were the same in all material respects.the court determined that george had predeceased the trustors,and that the trust contained no alternative distribution.the court concluded that the common law of trusts provides that under such circumstances,the trust reverts to the trustor who contributed the property.because henry contributed the assets in trust b,the court determined that those assets reverted to him,to be distributed consistent with the provisions of his will.
the court then interpreted henry will and concluded that the distribution of trust b under the terms of the trust was not operative or is invalid.because bernice survived henry,the court concluded that henry will directed distribution of all of trust b to bernice.
the court further noted that henry probate estate was closed and that there was no reason to open that estate merely in order to pass trust b to that estate and then distribute it to bernice estate.the court observed that all of the persons who claimed to be intestate heirs of henry were present at the hearing on this matter.the court noted that,at that hearing,all of the alleged heirs gave their consent to distributing trust b directly to bernice estate in lieu of opening henry estate.the court denied wilson petitions in both cases and ordered trust b distributed to bernice estate in the trust case.
on july,wilson filed motions for reconsideration in both cases.on september,the probate court orally denied the motions for reconsideration.on october,wilson filed an appeal from the june,orders denying her petitions and the september,orders denying her motions for reconsideration.on october,the probate court entered written orders denying the motions for reconsideration.
discussiona.the june,orders are appealable the probate court orders denying reconsideration of these orders are not.wilson appeal from the probate court june,orders is timely 
hall claims that wilson appeal from the probate court june,orders is untimely and must be dismissed.we disagree.
california rules of court,rule d provides in relevant part 
if any party serves and files a valid motion to reconsider an appealable order under code of civil procedure section,subdivision a,the time to appeal from that order is extended for all parties until the earliest of days after the first motion to reconsider is filed 
hall concedes that if wilson july,filings were valid motion s to reconsider,her appeal of the june,orders is timely.cal.rules of court,rule d,italics added.however,hall claims that wilson motions for reconsideration were not valid because the probate court june,rulings were final judgments,and that a motion for reconsideration may not be brought after a final judgment.hall thus contends that the extension of time to appeal provided in rule d does not apply because wilson july,motions were not valid motion s to reconsider cal.rules of court,rule d.we conclude that the court june,rulings were final orders and not final judgments,and that the motions for reconsideration of these orders were valid.
wilson filed her petition in the estate case pursuant to probate code section.section authorizes petitions seeking a determination of the persons entitled to distribution of an estate.section,subdivision a expressly provides that in ruling on such a petition,the court shall make an order that determines the persons entitled to distribution of the decedent estate and specifies their shares.italics added.in addition,section specifies that the grant or refusal to grant the following orders is appealable f determining heirship,succession,entitlement,or the persons to whom distribution should be made.italics added.consistent with these statutes,the court ruling in the estate case stated that it was an order on petition of helen wilson,to determine heirship.italics added.
in the trust case,wilson filed her petition pursuant to section,which allows a person to petition the court for the purpose of a scertaining beneficiaries and determining to whom property shall pass or be delivered upon final or partial termination of a trust,to the extent the determination is not made by the trust instrument,subd.b.section provides that,w ith respect to a trust,the grant or denial of the following orders is appealable a any final order under chapter commencing with section of part of division italics added.further,as in the estate case,the court designated the ruling in the trust case an order.
hall relies on estate of wise cal d,and estate of roberts cal d,to support his contention that the probate court rulings on wilson petitions were final judgments.however,wise and roberts both involved former sections,which have been superseded.those sections provided for a special advisory proceeding in probate to determine heirship,with the conflicting claimants regarded in much the same light as if engaged in a civil action.witkin,summary of cal.law ed.wills and probate.witkin explains that such a proceeding was a separate action in which participants were granted the right to a jury trial and t he judgment determined those persons entitled to distribution of the decedent estate and specified their interests.id.at,italics added.
the proceeding provided for in former sections,discussed in wise and roberts,was replaced by the procedure provided in sections.see witkin,summary of cal.law,supra.the revised procedure eliminated the special proceeding,the jury trial and the final judgment discussed in wise and roberts.therefore,those cases are inapposite.
we conclude that the probate court june,rulings were appealable orders,and not final judgments.wilson appeal was filed october,which was days after she filed her motions for reconsideration.therefore,her appeal is timely pursuant to california rules of court,rule d.
the orders denying wilson motions for reconsideration are not appealable 
wilson motions for reconsideration were brought in the context of a probate proceeding.it is well established that a ppeals which may be taken from orders in probate proceedings are set forth in the probate code,and its provisions are exclusive.estate of downing d.there is no right to appeal from any orders in probate except those specified in the probate code.witkin,cal.procedure ed.appeal.appeals in general probate matters are limited.conservatorship of smith d.i f there was a free appeal in every probate matter,estates could be unreasonably delayed.ibid.
code of civil procedure section,subdivision a provides that an appeal may be taken f rom an order made appealable by the provisions of the probate code an order denying a motion for reconsideration is not among the orders made appealable by the probate code.see.further,to allow an appeal from an order denying a motion for reconsideration would be contrary to the probate code purpose to foster the expeditious resolution of estate matters.in the absence of specific statutory authority authorizing such appeals,we conclude that the court orders denying wilson motions for reconsideration are not appealable 
we reject wilson reliance on trujillo north county transit dist.th,d for the proposition that her appeal from the orders denying her motions for reconsideration is subsumed in her appeal from the underlying orders.trujillo involved an appeal from a judgment entered after an order denying reconsideration of an order granting judgment notwithstanding the verdict.id.at,d.the trujillo court noted that the order denying reconsideration is subsumed in the appeal from the judgment.id.at,fn,d.in this case,wilson is appealing from underlying orders entered before the orders denying the motions for reconsideration.
b.the validity of the probate court june,orders are governed by the law in effect on the date of the orders 
wilson argues that under section,the validity of the probate court june,orders is governed by amendments to the probate code that took effect after the orders were entered.specifically,wilson argues that we must apply sections and,as amended,which became operative on january,the amendments,to our review of the june,orders.she claims that under this new law,a portion of trust b would pass to her as an intestate heir of henry.this claim raises an issue of statutory interpretation,which we review de novo.see,lockheed martin th,d.

the california supreme court has described section as including a general rule of retroactivity set out in subdivision c,as well as exceptions to subdivision c rule of retroactivity.rice,supra,cal th at,d.similarly,the california law revision commission has explained the statutory scheme provided in section in the following manner 
the general rule prescribed in subdivision c is that a new law applies immediately on its operative date to all matters,including pending proceedings.the general rule is qualified by the exceptions listed in subdivision d contents,execution,and notice of papers and documents are governed by the law applicable when the paper or document was filed,subdivision e orders are governed by the law applicable when the order was made,subject to any applicable modification procedures cal.law revision com,west ann.ed.foll,italics added.

in this case,all of the probate court orders at issue were made prior to the operative date of the amendments.therefore,on appeal,pursuant to subdivision e exception to subdivision c rule of retroactivity,the validity of the order s are governed by the old law and not by the new law,subd.e.
