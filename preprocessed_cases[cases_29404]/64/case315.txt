this case involves the interplay between two provisions of code of civil procedure,section concerning peremptory challenges of judges.section,subdivision,provides that in a case assigned to a judge for all purposes,a late appearing party can bring a motion to disqualify the judge,a peremptory challenge within days after the party appearance.however,the same subdivision also contains a provision precluding a peremptory challenge after the judge has decided contested fact issues relating to the merits.we hold that the latter provision precludes a peremptory challenge by a late appearing party in a proceeding in which the judge determined a contested fact issue relating to the merits or in a subsequent proceeding that qualifies as a continuation of such a proceeding.here,the court properly denied the peremptory challenge motion at issue because the motion was made in a proceeding that was a continuation of a proceeding in which the judge determined contested fact issues relating to the merits.
factual and procedural background 
the instant case involves a trust created by the late lawrence john stephens for the benefit of his wife,grace maxine maxine,and his six children gwendolyn gwen,james,gail,john,david and jacqueline dawn dawn.the trust provides that maxine is to receive all the net income of the trust and as much of the principal as is necessary for her support,and that upon her death any remaining principal is to be distributed in equal shares to the six children.
the trust names james,john and dawn as the initial cotrustees and provides that if any of them dies,resigns or becomes unable to serve,the other three children,in order of their ages gwen,gail and david,are to act as trustees.when lawrence died in,john,james and dawn became cotrustees of the trust.in may dawn resigned as cotrustee and a dispute ensued over the third trustee position.
in april,james and john petitioned the court for instructions as to whether the third trustee was gwen or gail.they also asked the court to modify the trust to provide that cotrustee actions could be taken by a majority rather than unanimous vote.maxine joined in james and john petition.in may,gail filed a petition seeking removal of james and john as trustees and the appointment of a corporate successor trustee in place of all three sibling trustees or,alternatively,an order confirming that gwen was the third cotrustee and gail was the next in line to serve as cotrustee.
judge cline heard the petitions together and in august issued an order providing that gwen was to have days to accept or reject the cotrustee position.the court ruled that if gwen or one of the other trustees failed or refused to serve,gail was the next child eligible to serve as cotrustee.if gail failed or was unable to serve,david would become eligible to serve.the court denied james and john request to modify the trust to provide for majority rather than unanimous voting.james,john and maxine appealed and this court affirmed judge cline order in october.
in may,while the appeal was pending,gwen sought ex parte relief,the precise nature of which is not clear from the record,but which apparently included access to the books of the trust and the appointment of an interim trustee or,alternatively,the freezing of distributions from the trust during the pendency of the appeal.on the day of the ex parte hearing,james and john filed a peremptory challenge against judge cline,who denied the challenge on the ground he had ruled on contested fact issues.judge cline then set a hearing on gwen anticipated formal petition for interim relief and ordered james and john to make the books and records of the trust available to gail and gwen.
gwen filed a formal petition requesting,among other things,an order removing the cotrustees and appointing an independent successor trustee or,alternatively,directing the cotrustees to act unanimously pending the appeal of judge cline august order.james,john and maxine filed a response and objections to the petition,and david made his first appearance in the proceedings by filing a joinder in james,john and maxine response and objections.
five days after appearing,david filed a peremptory challenge against judge cline.judge john einhorn signed the challenge and reassigned the case to another judge,although he neglected to check the granted box on the peremptory challenge form.three days later gwen filed an objection to david peremptory challenge on the ground it was untimely because judge cline had ruled on contested fact issues relating to the merits of the case.judge einhorn agreed with gwen and issued an order striking david peremptory challenge and rescinding his order granting the challenge.
david filed an ex parte application to reinstate the order granting his peremptory challenge.judge einhorn denied the application and invited david to test the validity of his ruling by filing the instant writ petition.
discussion 
iright of a party in a case assigned to a judge for all purposes to exercise a peremptory challenge 
david contends a party in a case assigned to a judge for all purposes can exercise a peremptory challenge under code of civil procedure section within days of appearing regardless of whether the challenged judge determined a contested fact issue relating to the merits before the appearance.gwen contends a party in a case assigned to a judge for all purposes can not challenge a judge under section if the judge determined a contested fact issue before the party appeared.the parties do not dispute that the instant case was assigned to judge cline for all purposes or that judge cline determined contested fact issues before david appearance.

code of civil procedure section,subdivision provides in part if a peremptory challenge motion is directed to the trial of a cause that has been assigned to a judge for all purposes,the motion shall be made to the assigned judge or to the presiding judge by a party within days after notice of the all purpose assignment,or if the party has not yet appeared in the action,then within days after the appearance.section,subdivision also provides the fact that a judge has presided at or acted in connection with a pretrial conference or other hearing,proceeding or motion prior to trial and not involving a determination of contested fact issues relating to the merits shall not preclude the later making of the peremptory challenge motion provided for herein at the time and in the manner hereinbefore provided.the implicit corollary to that provision is that if the judge has presided over a hearing,proceeding or motion prior to trial that did involve a determination of contested fact issues relating to the merits,a subsequent peremptory challenge motion is precluded as untimely.people richard d.
code of civil procedure section,subdivision additionally provides in no event shall any judge,court commissioner,or referee entertain the motion if it be made after the drawing of the name of the first juror,or after trial of the cause has otherwise commenced.based on that provision,the california supreme court in jacobs superior court cal d,articulated the following continuation of proceedings rule although section does not expressly so provide,it follows that,since the peremptory challenge must be made before the trial has commenced,it can not be entertained as to subsequent hearings which are a part or a continuation of
