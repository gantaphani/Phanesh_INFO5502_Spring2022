a distribution request in the final account of a probate estate,seeking distribution of certain litigation proceeds to the beneficiaries who funded the litigation rather than to all the residuary beneficiaries of the estate,was not an attempt to frustrate the testator intent and did not violate the no contest clause of the testator will.
factual and procedural background 
estelle strader died testate on september.her will,executed in,leaves the residue of her estate to five persons her nieces valerie mccuen,susan mary crickenberger and jane grant,who each received a share her husband niece sue ward,who also received a share and james hixon,the son of her husband deceased nephew,who received a share.the dispute before this court pits hixon against the other residuary beneficiaries,and involves the results of litigation relating to an earlier conservatorship of strader estate.we recite first the facts relating to the conservatorship litigation,and then turn to the actions taken in this probate proceeding.
the conservatorship litigation.
strader mental state deteriorated some years before her death,and in farmers and merchants trust company farmers became the conservator of her estate.strader nieces eventually came to believe that farmers mishandled strader conservatorship estate in numerous ways.after strader died,grant and ward were appointed special of her probate estate.shortly thereafter,on may,grant and ward as filed objections to farmers final account as conservator of strader conservatorship estate.those objections and the ensuing litigation resulted,five years later,in a settlement agreement between farmers and the objectors mccuen,crickenberger,grant and ward,the last two both individually and as of the probate estate.
under the settlement of the conservatorship litigation,farmers paid the objectors a total of certain of the objectors had advanced their own funds for attorney fees,costs and other litigation expenses,and the settlement agreement provided for reimbursement from the payment of all of such monies or advances to those who advanced them.the agreement stated that a a memorandum of costs filed with the court reflected the bulk of the attorney fees,costs and expenses as of the date of that memorandum,b the objectors had incurred other fees,costs and related expenses of approximately since the date of that memorandum or not included in it,and c a fter all of these fees,costs and expenses are reimbursed and any outstanding fees and costs are paid,the remaining proceeds from the settlement payment will become a part of the probate estate.the court approved the settlement on may.
probate proceedings during the conservatorship litigation.
unlike the other four residuary beneficiaries under strader will,james hixon did not wish to risk the depletion of his share of the estate in the litigation with farmers,and refused to participate.he objected to the appointment of grant and ward as,and objected to their august request for payment of attorney fees from the estate for the farmers litigation.according to hixon attorney,hixon withdrew his objections after it was agreed that hixon share of the estate would not be charged with the fees incurred if the litigation were unsuccessful.on september,according to stipulation,the court approved the first account of the,ordered preliminary distributions,and authorized payment of in attorney fees related to the farmers litigation to be charged against the shares of the four nieces.the order stated there would be no reduction of james hixon share of the estate for the farmers related fees,and james hixon distribution ordered below is increased by his share of the farmers related fees the estate then remained open for four more years,until the farmers litigation was concluded by the settlement described above.
probate proceedings after the conservatorship litigation.
on october,the filed their third and final account,report and request for final distribution final account.the final account describes the preliminary distributions,and requests the final distribution of two separately described amounts,as follows 
less approved fees,to be distributed according to strader will to the residuary beneficiaries,to hixon and each to ward,grant,crickenberger and mccuen.
the net amount received as a result of the conservatorship action as authorized in the may,order to be distributed to those who participated in and supported the farmers action ward and mccuen assigned their shares to grant and crickenberger,so that the final account requested distribution of percent each to grant and crickenberger 
on november,hixon filed objections to the final account.hixon asserted a he was entitled to a share of the total residuary estate,including the assets received in the conservatorship litigation b the failed to account for the proceeds of the conservatorship litigation,specifically million paid by farmers,less expenses of identified in the memorandum of costs referred to in the settlement agreement,less available for distribution under the final account c the powers of the should be immediately suspended and d grant and ward violated the in terrorem clause of the will and accordingly should receive nothing from the estate,and should be ordered to return preliminary distributions previously received.
on january,the court continued the hearing on the final account to march,and ordered the to issue a supplemental accounting through december.the supplemental accounting was to include a schedule describing the deductions made from the gross settlement against farmers merchants trust to arrive at the net sum distributed to the estate,and the explanation of how the expenditures were approved by the court.a supplemental accounting was filed on march.
meanwhile,on february,the demurred to certain of hixon objections,contending that the claimed violation of the no contest clause of the will,and the challenge to the reimbursement of expenses in the conservatorship litigation,were insufficient to state a cause of action.at the march hearing,the court denied hixon petition to suspend the powers of the,and granted the motion for a protective order regarding discovery served by hixon,subject to reconsideration at a hearing scheduled for april.all other matters were continued to april.
at the april hearing,the court ordered distribution to hixon of a share of the net proceeds of the conservatorship litigation,and otherwise approved the final account.the court stated that a s far as the demurrer is concerned,the court finds that the demurrer should be sustained without leave to amend,and found no violation of the no contest clause.judgment was entered on july,notice of entry was served on july.on august,hixon moved for reconsideration of the court rulings on the final account,his objections and the demurrer.at a hearing on september,the trial court denied hixon motion on the ground it lacked jurisdiction to entertain it.
hixon filed a notice of appeal from the judgment,and the then from the portion of the judgment directing them to distribute of the proceeds from the conservatorship litigation to hixon.
discussion 
the no contest clause.
hixon principal argument on appeal is that the distribution request in the final account violated the no contest clause in estelle strader will.we conclude it did not.we describe first the principles under which the issue is to be analyzed,and then turn to the application of those principles to these circumstances.
an in terrorem or no contest clause in a will conditions a beneficiary right to take the share provided under the will upon the beneficiary agreement to acquiesce in the terms of the instrument.burch george cal th,d.such clauses are valid in california and are favored by the public policies of discouraging litigation and giving effect to the purposes expressed by the testator.ibid.however,because a no contest clause results in a forfeiture,a court is required to strictly construe it and may not extend it beyond what was plainly the testator intent.ibid.summarizing these principles,burch stated 
whether there has been a contest within the meaning of a particular clause depends upon the circumstances of the particular case and the language used.citations.t he answer can not be sought in a vacuum,but must be gleaned from a consideration of the purposes that the testator sought to attain by the provisions of his will.citation.therefore,even though a no contest clause is strictly construed to avoid forfeiture,it is the testator intentions that control,and a court must not rewrite the testator will in such a way as to immunize legal proceedings plainly intended to frustrate the testator unequivocally expressed intent from the reach of the clause.citation.cal th at,d.
accordingly,to ascertain whether grant and ward final account request violated the no contest clause in strader will,we examine both the particular circumstances and the language of the clause to determine whether the distribution request in the final account was an action that would thwart strader unequivocally expressed intent.see also estate of pittman th,d thwarting of the testator intent is the appropriate test in determining if a no contest clause has been triggered.
the circumstances are unusual.no case presents an analytically comparable situation that is,the assertion of a no contest clause violation in a final accounting after distribution of more than eighty percent of the estate moreover,the dispute arises over funds that were not in the estate at the time of strader death,and would not have been available for distribution had the four nieces,like hixon,decided not to risk depletion of their inheritance by pursuing the claims against farmers.the scope of the no contest clause is broad.it states that if any beneficiary shall contest this will or attack or seek to impair or invalidate any of its provisions then i specifically disinherit such person or persons 
hixon contends grant and ward,by requesting distribution of the proceeds of the conservatorship litigation to those who funded it,sought to impair the provision of the will devising of the residue of strader estate to him,and therefore must forfeit their shares.we disagree.
we begin with the obvious.many claims which would result in a variation in amounts distributed under the residuary clause of a will are not contests.for example 
normally,a beneficiary attempt to characterize property for example,as joint tenancy property or community property is not an attack on the will or provisions within the will.estate of pittman,supra,th,d.a recharacterization effort violates the no contest clause only when the will or other instrument already sets forth the manner in which the property is to be characterized ibid.
similarly,a petition seeking to interpret a will does not ordinarily violate a no contest clause.rather than thwarting the testator dispositive intent,the proceeding serves to ascertain and enforce that intent.estate of kruse d.
an assertion of rights independent of a will,such as a claim of an implied domestic partnership interest in the testator property,also may not violate a no contest clause.for example,in estate of black d,the court held the filing of a proposed claim would not violate the no contest clause,as testator did not express a clear intent his domestic partner should forfeit her inheritance if she pursued her implied contract rights.
while this case does not fit precisely into any of the above categories,the circumstances are akin to an attempt to characterize property not expressly mentioned in the will.because strader will did not contemplate the existence of the litigation proceeds,no unequivocally expressed intent exists with respect to those proceeds.while strader clearly intended to divide the residue of her estate among the five beneficiaries,that general intent does not address the question of the property that belongs or remains in the residue of the estate.the case of estate of kruse,supra,d,is illustrative.
in estate of kruse,the testator bequeathed the income from a testamentary trust to his wife for her life,with power to invade the corpus,and devised the residue remaining upon her death to shriners hospital.shriners sought an accounting,and objected to the accounting it eventually obtained.shriners complained the materially reduced the residue to be distributed to shriners by paying herself a monthly family allowance in addition to the income from the trust.the wife contended shriners action constituted an attempt to change the will and violated the no contest clause,which effectively disinherited any beneficiary who directly or indirectly sought to impair any provision of the will or have any provision or devise limited or diminished.id.at.the court concluded shriners had a right to demand an accounting,and that its objections to the wife accounting were not an attempt to thwart the will of the testator since the will contained no reference to payment of the family allowance to which shriners objected,it can not be said that shriners,in asking for an interpretation and clarification of the family allowance in relation to the will,with the possibility of surcharging the wife if payments were improper,attempted to change the will.id.at.
the final account request to distribute the conservatorship litigation proceeds to those who funded the litigation is comparable to shriners attempt in estate of kruse to have the family allowance the wife paid to herself surcharged against her.in kruse,if shriners had been successful and the wife payment of an allowance to herself had been found improper,the amount available for distribution as the residue of the estate would have been increased.indeed,the court pointed out that some items not involved in the appeal were found to have been improperly claimed as credits by the and were surcharged against her.estate of kruse,supra,d at.in this case,the distribution of the conservatorship proceeds to those who funded the litigation would similarly affect the amount of the residue available for distribution.the same is true in any case in which a beneficiary seeks to characterize property by asserting an interest in property otherwise passing under the will,that is,the amount remaining for distribution will be affected.nonetheless,the effort to assert interests in a testator assets violates a no contest clause only if the testator intention with respect to those assets is clear.
in sum,we conclude a change in the amount available for distribution to residuary beneficiaries as a result of an accounting does not constitute an attack on the provision of the will apportioning the residue among beneficiaries,in the absence of an unequivocal indication of the testator intent with respect to the property in dispute no such unequivocal intent is found here,where the property in conservatorship litigation not even exist when strader made her will,or when she died.accordingly,the final accounting request for distribution of the conservatorship proceeds to those who funded the litigation,while misguided,was not an attempt to frustrate the testator unequivocally expressed intent burch george,supra,cal th at,d,internal quotations omitted,and therefore did not violate the no contest clause.
hixon other contentions.
hixon argues that the trial court abused its discretion in sustaining the demurrer to hixon objections without leave to amend.the demurrer addressed only a hixon claim the no contest clause was violated,and b his claim,based on information in the court order approving the settlement agreement in the conservatorship litigation,that in proceeds from that litigation were missing from the estate since we have determined the no contest clause was not violated,that leaves only hixon contention that funds from the conservatorship litigation were missing from the estate.
we find no merit in hixon argument.in sustaining the demurrer,the court explicitly ruled hixon was not entitled to question the amount of the expenses reimbursed in the separate conservatorship litigation,because he had notice of and did not object to or appeal from the court order that only the net proceeds,after reimbursement of expenses,would pass into the probate estate.hixon makes no legal argument about these funds or about the trial court rationale for sustaining the
