in an earlier appeal arising out of this probate matter,we affirmed the trial court ruling that respondent elenice dito is the surviving spouse of decedent frank and is entitled to receive a share of his estate as an omitted spouse pursuant to probate code section et.after the earlier appeal had been decided,appellants barbara and george merritt filed a petition alleging that elenice is liable for financial elder abuse committed against frank.the trial court sustained a demurrer to the petition without leave to amend on the ground the claim was barred by the doctrine of res judicata.
we conclude the trial court erred.because the primary right at issue in appellants petition is different from the one at issue in the earlier appeal,the petition is not barred as a matter of law on the basis of res judicata.nevertheless,we conclude the demurrer should have been sustained on other grounds,albeit with leave to amend.
factual and procedural history 
in reviewing an order sustaining a demurrer,we would ordinarily take the factual background from the properly pleaded material allegations of the complaint.see moore regents of university of california cal d.here,however,because one of the claimed grounds for the demurrer is res judicata,we must necessarily consider the prior judgment that purportedly has res judicata effect.see planning conservation league castaic lake water agency th,court may take judicial notice of court records in considering demurrer based on res judicata.therefore,we begin by summarizing the prior judgment that allegedly precludes appellants petition 
summary of prior appeal 
elenice was born in brazil.she came to the united states in the early to work as a housekeeper for a brazilian family.elenice began working as a housekeeper for decedent frank dito and his wife,rosana,after being introduced to them in late or early.the couple were elderly and physically impaired when elenice began working for them.elenice visa did not permit her to work legally for the ditos.
rosana died in december.elenice continued to live with frank and care for him after rosana death.at some point in,frank and elenice began discussing marriage as an option.they were married in august.at the time of their marriage,frank was years old and elenice was years old.before they were married,frank and elenice entered into a prenuptial agreement.the agreement provided that both parties waived their right to alimony,maintenance,or spousal support in the event of divorce,death,or dissolution of marriage.
frank and rosana had one child,appellant barbara merritt,who is married to appellant george merritt.barbara was the trustee of her parents living trust.
frank died in december.in early,elenice filed a petition for letters of administration.barbara filed a competing petition to administer frank estate and to admit his will to probate.barbara attached to her petition a will executed by frank in that identified rosana as his wife.the will did not mention elenice.in july,frank grandson,terrence,filed a petition to administer the estate.barbara withdrew her petition to administer frank estate in favor of her son,terrence.
in october,elenice filed a petition seeking,among other things,her share of frank estate as an omitted spouse,a determination that the prenuptial agreement is unenforceable,and a determination that the surviving spouse waiver in the prenuptial agreement is unenforceable.she also sought an accounting and a reconveyance of trust assets allegedly transferred to barbara.she further alleged that barbara was liable for financial elder abuse and should be deemed to have predeceased frank pursuant to section as a result of the elder abuse.
upon stipulation of the parties,the trial court ordered the issues raised by the competing petitions bifurcated so that the following issues could be tried before all other issues in the case whether elenice is the surviving spouse of frank and is entitled to receive a share of his estate pursuant to section et whether the prenuptial agreement is enforceable and whether the surviving spouse waiver contained in the prenuptial agreement is enforceable.the parties stipulation explains that they agreed the court should first decide whether elenice dito is the omitted spouse of frank dito and whether the premarital agreement and the surviving spouse waiver contained therein,are enforceable,and that,in the event that the court decides that elenice dito is the omitted spouse of frank dito and that the premarital agreement and the surviving spouse waiver contained therein are enforceable,the court will then try all other remaining issues in this case.
the court conducted a bench trial on the three issues identified in the bifurcation order.in an order filed december,the court ruled that elenice is the surviving spouse of frank and is entitled to receive a share of his estate pursuant to section et.the court further ruled that the prenuptial agreement was invalid and unenforceable.for the same reasons it found the prenuptial agreement invalid,the court ruled that the spousal waiver contained in the agreement was likewise invalid.
terrence appealed.he claimed the marriage between frank and elenice was void because it was entered into for the sole purpose of allowing an illegal immigrant to remain in the united states.he also contended the prenuptial agreement was valid and that the surviving spouse waiver should be given effect.in an unpublished opinion filed march,we affirmed the trial court order.we concluded terrence lacked standing to challenge the validity of his grandfather marriage on the grounds he raised.we also concluded the prenuptial agreement was unenforceable because it was both procedurally and substantively unconscionable.terrence sought review in the supreme court,which denied his petition.
post appeal procedural history 
following the issuance of the remittitur,terrence filed a petition seeking a hearing on whether elenice is exempted from receiving a share of frank estate as an omitted spouse.terrence relied on section,subdivision b,which in general provides that an omitted spouse is not entitled to a share of the estate under section if the decedent intended to and did provide for the spouse by means other than the testamentary instrument.terrence claimed this issue had never been decided or litigated.the court denied the petition on the basis of res judicata,reasoning that t he stipulation for bifurcated trial issues referred to elenice dito entitlement under probate code section et the court stated that any challenge under section should have been raised at trial.
on february,appellants barbara and george merritt filed the petition that is the subject of this appeal,entitled petition to determine entitlement to receive omitted spousal share.in the petition,appellants allege that elenice committed financial elder abuse against frank welf,and,as a consequence,that elenice should be deemed to have predeceased frank pursuant to section.as support for the petition,appellants allege that elenice paid her friends amounts totaling at least from her joint account with frank.attached to the petition are copies of checks with dates ranging from december until the date of frank death in.because elenice did not have paid employment outside the marital home,it is alleged the funds paid to elenice friends necessarily belonged to frank and were not used for his benefit.it is further alleged that frank suffered from dementia as of april,and that many of the checks were written after that date.according to the petition,w hile frank dito may have owed an obligation to support elenice,he certainly did not owe an obligation to support her friends.appellants seek a determination that elenice is deemed to have predeceased frank pursuant to section as a result of the elder abuse.further,they allege that by operation of law elenice would not be the surviving spouse under the probate code irrespective of the validity of the marriage.appellants also seek compensatory damages,punitive damages,and attorney fees and costs.
elenice demurred to the petition.she argued the elder abuse claim fails as a matter of law because it is barred by the statute of limitations,it is barred by the doctrine of res judicata in that the court had already determined elenice entitlement to receive a share of the estate or trust,appellants lack the capacity to sue for elder abuse because only the personal representative,elenice could pursue such a claim,and the petition fails to state facts sufficient to state a cause of action because there were no allegations that elenice acted with oppression,fraud,or malice when making the purportedly abusive distributions.as to the claim that elenice should be deemed to have predeceased frank under section,elenice demurred on the ground that the claim necessarily fails if the court grants the demurrer to the elder abuse claim.she also contended the petition fails to state a cause of action under section because there are no factual allegations that she acted in bad faith or that the decedent was substantially unable to manage his finance resources or resist fraud or undue influence at the time the alleged abuse occurred.
in an order filed may,the trial court sustained the demurrer without leave to amend.the court based its decision solely on res judicata grounds,reasoning as follows here the spousal share was explicitly determined in the trial conducted before the rosemary pfeiffer that decision was ultimately appealed to the supreme court and is now final.the court judgment contains the following language elenice dito is the surviving spouse of frank dito and is entitled to receive a share of his estate and trust pursuant to probate code et all parties had a fair opportunity to litigate the issue.on december,the court struck terrance merrit sic attempt to relitigate the issue after the return of jurisdiction to this court on the grounds of res judicata.appellants latest attempt to plead the same spousal property entitlement under a theory of financial elder abuse is similarly barred.the issue could have been raised at the prior trial.the court stated that the question of whether causes of action are identical for purposes of claim preclusion is whether the primary right sought to be protected is the same in the two actions.the court reasoned as follows the primary right in both the action tried and that before the court today is the entitlement of elenice dito to receive a share of the estate and trust of frank dito as a surviving spouse.the same interest was litigated by both terrence at trial and the appellants here.in view of its ruling that the claims were barred by the doctrine of res judicata,the court did not reach any of the other grounds for the demurrer.
appellants appealed from the order sustaining the demurrer without leave to amend.

appealability 
an order sustaining a demurrer without leave to amend is not an appealable order.gu bmw of north america,llc th.rather,an appeal is properly taken from the order of dismissal.citations.quick pearson th,fn.
here,appellants appeal is taken from the order sustaining the demurrer without leave to amend.they concede there is no formal order dismissing their petition.it is unclear why they failed to secure an order of dismissal.nevertheless,appellants argue that where it is clear the court intended to entirely dispose of the action,we are empowered to amend the order to make it an appealable judgment of dismissal.see molien kaiser foundation hospitals cal d,swain california casualty ins.th.under the circumstances presented here,we agree.the order sustaining elenice demurrer was a final adjudication of all of the causes of action contained in the petition.no purpose would be served by dismissing the appeal and requiring appellants to file a new appeal after securing a judgment of dismissal in the trial court.elenice has not been prejudiced or misled by the failure to secure a judgment of dismissal.indeed,she has not challenged the appealability of the order but has instead responded to the appeal on its merits.accordingly,we shall amend the court may,order sustaining the demurrer without leave to amend to specify that it is a judgment of dismissal as to appellants petition.see swain california casualty ins,supra,th at.having deemed the order to be an appealable judgment,we proceed to consider the appeal on it merits.

res judicata 
appellants argue that the trial court erred in concluding their petition is barred by the doctrine of res judicata.as we explain,we agree with appellants that the claims raised in their petition are not identical to the issues litigated in the prior proceeding.
res judicata describes the preclusive effect of a final judgment on the merits.mycogen monsanto cal th.it prevents relitigation of the same cause of action in a second suit between the same parties or parties in privity with them.id.at.under the doctrine of res judicata,all claims based on the same cause of action must be decided in a single suit if not brought initially,they may not be raised at a later date.ibid.
a claim raised in a second suit is based on the same cause of action as one asserted in a prior action if they are both premised on the same primary right.see mycogen monsanto,supra,cal th at.the plaintiff primary right is the right to be free from a particular injury,regardless of the legal theory on which liability for the injury is based.citation.the scope of the primary right therefore depends on how the injury is defined.a cause of action comprises the plaintiff primary right,the defendant corresponding primary duty,and the defendant wrongful act in breach of that duty.citation.federation of hillside canyon assns.city of los angeles th,accord mycogen monsanto,supra,cal th at.
here,the trial court reasoned that the primary right at issue in both the prior judgment and the petition filed by appellants is elenice right to receive a share of the estate and trust as a surviving spouse.likewise,elenice argues on appeal the analysis should be viewed at a higher level of abstraction and that the primary right at issue in both proceedings is her entitlement to the decedent estate and trust.
the primary right at issue in the former proceeding was elenice own right under section to receive a share of the decedent estate as an omitted spouse.section provides that,except as set forth in section,if a decedent fails to provide for a surviving spouse in a testamentary instrument executed before the marriage to the surviving spouse,the omitted spouse is entitled to receive a share of the decedent estate as provided in the statute.specifically,the omitted spouse is entitled to of the decedent community and property plus a share of the decedent separate property as specified in the statute,subds.a c.section provides in general that an omitted spouse is not entitled to a share of the estate under section if any of three circumstances are established the decedent intended to omit the surviving spouse from the testamentary instrument the decedent provided for the surviving spouse by transfer outside the testamentary instrument and intended that such transfer was in lieu a provision for the surviving spouse in the testamentary instrument or the surviving spouse made a valid agreement waiving the right to a share of the decedent estate.
among the issues the parties contested in the prior proceeding were the validity of elenice marriage to frank and the validity of the spousal waiver contained in the prenuptial agreement.it was necessary to resolve these issues to determine the primary right asserted by elenice,her status as an omitted spouse entitled to receive a share of frank estate under section et.
the primary right at issue in appellants petition is different from that considered in the prior proceeding.as stated in the petition,appellants seek a finding that elenice committed financial elder abuse against frank.see welf.the purpose of the elder abuse act,welf,et is essentially to protect a particularly vulnerable portion of the population from gross mistreatment in the form of abuse and custodial neglect.citations.estate of lowrie th.thus,the primary right addressed by the petition is that of frank not to be abused or defrauded.this primary right belongs to frank and interested persons entitled to assert that right on his behalf.see welf,subd.d personal representative or other interested person may pursue elder abuse action on behalf of decedent.
the financial elder abuse allegations have no bearing upon the determination of whether elenice is an omitted spouse entitled to receive a share of frank estate pursuant to sections and.section specifies that an omitted spouse shall be entitled to a share of the estate unless one or more of the exceptions in section applies.a finding of elder abuse is not one of the listed exceptions.thus,even if the elder abuse issue had been raised in the prior proceeding,it would have been improper for the court to rely on a determination that elenice committed financial elder abuse as the basis for denying her entitlement to a share of the estate under section et.
appellants petition also seeks a determination that elenice is deemed to have predeceased frank pursuant to section as a result of the elder abuse.the purpose of section is to deter the abuse of elders by prohibiting abusers from benefiting from the abuse.citations.estate of lowrie,supra,th at.the primary right at issue under section remains the right of frank to remain free from abuse.section simply provides a remedy for that primary right.nevertheless,the claim under section presents a closer issue than the elder abuse claim on which it is predicated because it appears to seek a result directly at odds with the court previous determination that elenice is entitled to a share of the estate as an omitted spouse.as we explain,a section claim is distinct from,and unrelated to,a claim that an omitted spouse is entitled to a share of the estate.
the parties and the court below appear to be operating under the assumption that a person found liable for elder abuse is deemed to have predeceased the decedent for purposes of any entitlement to property,interests,and benefits the abuser would otherwise receive by reason of the decedent death.while that may be the practical effect of section in some cases,the statute does not necessarily disinherit an abuser entirely but rather restricts the abuser right to benefit from his or her abusive conduct see witkin,summary of cal.law ed.wills and probate,ross,cal.practice guide probate,supra,at to.section,subdivision a provides in pertinent part that a ny person shall be deemed to have predeceased a decedent to the extent provided in subdivision c where it is proven that the person is liable for elder abuse of the decedent,acted in bad faith,and was reckless,oppressive,fraudulent,or malicious in the commission of the abuse.italics added.subdivision c,in turn,provides in relevant part that a ny person found liable under subdivision a shall not receive any property,damages,or costs that are awarded to the decedent estate in an action described in subdivision a,whether that person entitlement is under a will,a trust,or the laws of intestacy 
thus,a person found liable under subdivision a of section is deemed to have predeceased the decedent only to the extent the person would have been entitled through a will,trust,or laws of intestacy to receive a distribution of the damages and costs the person is found to be liable to pay to the estate as a result of the abuse section does not necessarily eliminate the abuser entitlement to a share of the estate it simply restricts the value of the estate to which the abuser percentage share is applied and prevents that person from benefiting from his or her own wrongful conduct.
in this case,the section claim advanced by appellants does not affect or threaten the prior determination that elenice is a surviving omitted spouse under section.elenice retains that status and is entitled to her share of the estate as specified in section,although she is not allowed to share in any damages and costs she could be liable to pay to the estate as a result of the alleged elder abuse.it is conceivable that any damages and costs elenice might be liable to pay to the estate would exceed her share of the estate,resulting in a situation in which she pays more to the estate in damages and costs than she receives as an omitted spouse under section.however,the mere fact that application of section might reduce or even effectively eliminate elenice inheritance does not mean that it concerns the same primary right as a claim she is an omitted spouse with an entitlement to a share of the estate.
to reiterate,in the earlier proceeding the parties litigated the primary right of elenice to share in her husband estate notwithstanding her omission from the testamentary documents,an inquiry that necessarily focused on her spousal status and the intent of the decedent.here,the primary right is frank to remain free from abuse or fraud,a right that is enforced by restricting an abuser ability to benefit from his or her own abusive conduct.after the earlier appeal was final,the trial court properly denied on res judicata grounds the attempt by the decedent grandson,terrence,to relitigate an issue that involved the same primary right as the earlier proceeding.specifically,terrence sought to claim that elenice should be denied a share as an omitted spouse because the decedent intent was to provided for her outside the testamentary documents.the court correctly recognized that any such challenge should have been raised in the earlier trial because it concerned elenice entitlement to a share of the estate pursuant to section.by contrast,appellants petition does not require relitigation of whether elenice is an omitted spouse entitled to a share of the estate pursuant to section et.
therefore,elenice and the trial court are mistaken in construing the petition as one to determine elenice entitlement to a share of the estate or trust as an omitted spouse.appellants contributed to the confusion by entitling their petition,petition to determine entitlement to receive omitted spousal share,and by asserting in the petition that elenice would not be the surviving spouse under the probate code because of the alleged abuse,irrespective of the validity of the marriage.for purposes of assessing res judicata,we may disregard the caption and the legal conclusions contained in the pleading.under california law,it is the allegations in the body of a pleading that constitute the cause of action against a party.davaloo state farm ins.th.
we conclude the court erred in sustaining the demurrer on the ground of res judicata.appellants petition here involves a different primary right than the one litigated in the prior proceeding.we need not and do not address appellants alternative contention that they were not parties to the prior proceeding or in privity with the parties to that proceeding.
our inquiry is not at an end,however.because we must affirm if any ground offered in support of the demurrer justifies
