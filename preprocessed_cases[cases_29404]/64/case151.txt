in this case we are called upon to examine the relationship between special needs trusts,which allow certain individuals to qualify for public medical assistance under the federal medicaid program,and the provisions entitling the state to recover the amounts it has paid to provide such assistance.deborah herting,trustee of the alexandria pomianowski special needs trust,appeals from an order requiring the trust to reimburse respondent,the department of health care services dhcs or the department for medical expenses the department had paid in behalf of the trust beneficiary,alexandria pomianowski,before her death.herting contends that the trust assets were exempt from the department reimbursement rights because the beneficiary was under years of age when the services were provided.we conclude that the department was entitled to reimbursement of the medical expenses it paid under both the federal medicaid statutes and the statutes and regulations implementing medicaid through california medical assistance program,known as medi cal.accordingly,we will affirm the order.
the federal medicaid program,created in by adding title xix to the social security act,is a complex system of cooperative federalism,in which both the federal government and participating states reimburse certain costs of medical treatment for needy persons.harris mcrae,see et those eligible for medicaid assistance include severely impaired individuals such as alexandria pomianowski,the beneficiary of the trust at issue,subd.a a i ii bb.
the functioning of the medicaid system depends on a financial contribution by both the federal government and the participating state.harris mcrae,supra,at.although participation in the medicaid program is entirely optional,once a state elects to participate,it must comply with the requirements of title xix,many of which are set forth in section et hereafter section harris mcrae,supra,at.nevertheless,t he medicaid program was designed to provide the states with a degree of flexibility in designing plans that meet their individual needs.citation.as such,states are given considerable latitude in formulating the terms of their own medical assistance plans.citation.olszewski scripps health cal th.california has implemented the medicaid program through the medi cal act,described in welfare and institutions code section,et.
in this case,the relevant statutory provisions are those delineating medicaid and medi cal eligibility and recovery requirements,particularly section hereafter section and welfare and institutions code section,respectively.section,subdivision a,specifically requires the state to comply with the provisions of section with respect to liens,adjustments and recoveries of medical assistance correctly paid,transfers of assets,and treatment of certain trusts.accordingly,welfare and institutions code section prescribes the conditions under which dhcs may claim reimbursement from the estate of a medi cal recipient.entering into the picture are the provisions for special needs trusts,which,in probate code sections,enable a disabled person to qualify for medi cal benefits by sheltering money that exceeds the limit of the individual eligibility.this case calls for application of these provisions and for resolution of any apparent incongruities among them.
procedural background 
alexandria pomianowski was years old in april,when she was in a catastrophic automobile accident which left her a quadriplegic with associated medical complications.after being released from a hospital stay she continued to need total care in all aspects of daily living,including bathing,feeding,dressing,toileting,and mobility.a lawsuit was filed on her behalf against the county of santa cruz and ford motor company,eventually culminating in a settlement for.in a december order approving the settlement the superior court directed that these funds be deposited in a special needs trust,less amounts directly payable to kaiser permanente for medical care,to dhcs,and to alexandria attorney.accordingly,on february,was placed in the alexandria pomianowski special needs trust.appellant deborah herting,alexandria mother,was the trustee.
on january,when she was,alexandria died.by this time there was in cash left in the trust account.herting notified dhcs of the death in accordance with probate code section,which gave the department four months thereafter in which to file a claim against alexandria estate.within that period the department filed its claim for reimbursement of in health care costs it had paid under the medi cal program.
in july herting filed a final account and petition for termination of the trust,along with a request for denial of the department claim for reimbursement from the trust.herting invoked the exceptions set forth in section,subdivision b b,and welfare and institutions code section,subdivision b,which limit the department right to recover from the estate of a decedent who received medical care while under years of age.
dhcs opposed herting request for preclusion of its reimbursement claim.citing section,subdivision d a,the department pointed out that a special needs trust,while allowing a disabled person under to be eligible for public assistance under medicaid,must also provide for reimbursement to the state upon the person death.tracking that federal mandate,the department noted,was title of the california code of regulations,which in section prescribes the same condition of eligibility alexandria had been deemed eligible for medi cal benefits only because her trust contained that reimbursement provision.finally,the department cited probate code sections and,which give specified government agencies including dhcs priority over the funds remaining in the trust after the death of a special needs trust beneficiary.in short,the department argued,t o apply the and under limitation in section b,as argued by the trustee,to special needs trusts,would not only thwart the intent of the statute to provide for payback of medi cal expenses,but would lead to an unreasonable result that is contrary to public policy.for no logical reason,recovery by the state from special needs trusts would be limited to those individuals who incurred medical expenses between the ages of and,and the heirs of all others would get a windfall of taxpayer funds,contrary to the intent of congress.
the superior court approved the settlement but granted the department claim.the court recognized that the express purpose of the trust had been to enable alexandria to qualify for medi cal and that the payback provisions of the document reflected that purpose.the court therefore ordered that the department be reimbursed from the remaining funds in the trust in the full amount of its claim.herting filed a timely appeal from the order.
herting central argument is that dhcs has no right of recovery from a special needs trust when the beneficiary is under the age of.as herting recognizes,congress revised the medicaid system in response to abuses by wealthy individuals,particularly those over,who used trusts not only to establish eligibility for benefits but also to preserve their assets for the benefit of their children or other third parties.lewis alexander cir,see also weisner,obra and medicaid asset transfers,trust availability and estate recovery statutory analysis in context,nova.rosenberg,supplemental needs trusts for people with disabilities the development of a private trust in the public interest pub.int,rosenberg.as part of the omnibus budget reconciliation act of,congress tightened the eligibility rules,while adding certain exceptions,notably subdivision d a,to section in order to exempt the severely disabled under age whose assets would otherwise make them ineligible for medicaid,by permitting the establishment of a supplemental or special needs trust.congress thus struck a balance between curbing abusive asset transfers and ensuring access to public assistance by the disabled.section,subdivision d a,now states that a determination of eligibility does not include the assets in a trust established for an individual under age who is disabled as defined in section a of this title and whic
