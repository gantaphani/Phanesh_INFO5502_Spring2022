this interpleader action involves a dispute over the ownership of an individual retirement account established by decedent wayne wilson and held by charles schwab company schwab.katherine chandler,wilson surviving spouse,appeals the grant of summary judgment in favor of the named beneficiaries of the schwab ira,wilson four adult children from a previous marriage.the district court determined that the surviving spouse protections in the employee retirement income security act of erisa,stat,as amended,et,do not apply to the schwab ira even though some of the funds originated from an pension plan,and that the internal revenue code,et,also does not impose automatic surviving spouse rights on iras similar to those protections afforded under erisa.we affirm.
the essential facts are undisputed.wayne wilson was employed with until.during that time,he participated in the company k plan.in,while employed with another company,wilson elected to close his siemens k and take a lump sum distribution,which he rolled over into an ira with smith barney.between and,wilson also transferred or rolled over funds into the smith barney ira from other accounts and retirement plans.
after having lived together since,wilson and katherine chandler married in december.in june,wilson opened another ira,this time with charles schwab,which he funded by transferring approximately half the proceeds from the smith barney ira.despite his marriage to chandler,wilson advised schwab he was divorced and named as the primary beneficiaries his four adult children from a previous wilson,roberta wilson,cheryl debickero,and rebecca wilson the beneficiaries.
on august,at the age of,wilson died unexpectedly in a flash flood.he was survived by chandler and his four children,who asserted competing rights to the funds in the schwab ira.faced with that dispute,schwab filed this interpleader action naming chandler and the beneficiaries as defendants.chandler then filed a against the beneficiaries asserting that under either erisa or the internal revenue code she was entitled to the funds as wilson surviving spouse.chandler also asserted a state law claim based on the theory of constructive trust.
on for summary judgment,the district court ruled in favor of the beneficiaries as to chandler federal claims.finding it significant that wilson and chandler were not married until several years after wilson ended his participation in his k plan,the court rejected chandler argument that erisa surviving spouse protections continued to apply even after the funds were rolled over into an independently managed ira.it also rejected chandler alternative argument that the internal revenue code should be construed to impose on such iras surviving spouse protections identical to those found in erisa.in subsequent rulings,the court declined to exercise supplemental jurisdiction over the state law claim and granted the beneficiaries request for release of the interpleader funds.this appeal followed.

chandler primary claim to automatic surviving spouse benefits is based in section of erisa,as amended by the retirement equity act of rea,stat.it requires that in the case of a vested participant who dies before the annuity starting date and who has a surviving spouse,a qualified preretirement survivor annuity shall be provided to the surviving spouse of such participant.a.in order to receive the survivor annuity,the surviving spouse must have been married to the participant for at least one year from the earlier of the participant annuity starting date or the date of the participant death.id.f.although the plan participant may elect to waive the survivor annuity and designate another beneficiary,it shall not take effect unless the spouse of the participant consents in writing to such election.id.c a hamilton.state plumbing pipefitting indus.pension plan,cir.
of course,erisa surviving spouse provisions may apply only when an plan is implicated.it is undisputed that the siemens k plan in which wilson participated was covered by erisa,and that chandler,as wilson surviving spouse at the time of his death,never consented to the designation of another beneficiary.but this alone does not entitle her to automatic surviving spouse benefits under erisa.although wilson was at one time a participant in an employee benefit plan subject to erisa protections and limitations,erisa ceased to apply when,long before his marriage to chandler,wilson terminated his participation in the employee benefit plan and transferred the proceeds to an independent ira.
congress enacted erisa to ensure the proper administration of employee benefit plans,including pension plans,both during the years of an employee active service and after retirement.hamilton,at.that scope may be substantial,but it is also inherently limited.by erisa own terms,employee benefit protections apply only to an employee benefit plan that is established or maintained by an employer,employee organization,or both.a.the term employee benefit plan or plan is likewise defined as an employee welfare plan or pension plan that is established or maintained by an employer or by an employee organization,or by both.id,a.the schwab ira at issue here was established and maintained by wilson personally and not by his employer or any employee organization,and thus it falls outside these basic coverage limits.
it is beside the point that the ira proceeds originated as employee benefits within an plan.section a delineates erisa coverage not in terms of employee benefits,but in terms of employee benefit plans.see fort halifax packing,coyne.the focus of the statute thus is on the administrative integrity of benefit presumes that some type of administrative activity is taking place.id.at.only plans involve administrative activity potentially subject to employer abuse.id.at.with respect to the schwab ira,there was no employer oversight,no ongoing employer commitment,nor any potential for employer abuse.on the contrary,the schwab ira was established and maintained by wilson years after he left his employment with siemens and terminated his participation in the siemens k.
if that were not enough,iras are specifically excluded from erisa coverage.consistent with the statutory definitions and coverage limits discussed above,federal regulations clarify that so long as the involvement of an employer or employee organization is strictly limited,the terms employee pension benefit plan and pension plan as defined in a shall not include an individual retirement account described in section a of the internal revenue code d.moreover,erisa itself excludes iras categorically from the participation and vesting provisions of part of title i,which includes the joint and survivor annuity requirements of at issue here.this part shall apply to any employee benefit plan described in section a of this title other than an individual retirement account or annuity described in section of title see cline indus.maint.eng g contracting,cir 
chandler would have us interpret these ira exclusions more narrowly.she submits that,properly construed,excludes only individual retirement accounts from erisa,and that the schwab ira does not qualify because it contains funds that originated as employer contributions to wilson former k.section itself contains no such language limiting its application to iras,thus chandler relies instead on the limitations on employer involvement enumerated in d.that regulation excludes iras from the terms employee pension benefit plan and pension plan provided that
