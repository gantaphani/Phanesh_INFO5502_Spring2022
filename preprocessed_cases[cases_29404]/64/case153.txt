in an unsigned minute order following summary judgment proceedings initiated by trustee,the court sua sponte struck chabad objection and counterclaim on the basis that the code of civil procedure precludes a party from seeking affirmative relief in an answer.chabad appeals.however,because this unsigned minute order is not an appealable order under either the code of civil procedure or the probate code,we lack jurisdiction and will dismiss chabad appeal.
background facts and procedure 
according to the petition,in decedent and his wife executed the documents that established the trust,and they amended it in and.decedent,whose wife had predeceased him,died in august.upon the death of decedent,according to the terms of the trust,trustee became the sole successor trustee and has remained the sole successor trustee ever since.trustee alleged that in decedent purchased genworth life insurance company policy genworth policy and that at all times the trust was the named beneficiary of the genworth policy.trustee sought both a declaration that the genworth policy benefits belong to the trust and an award of damages against chabad for interfering with the payment of the genworth policy benefits to the trust as the named insured,subd.a a.
in the objection and counterclaim,chabad alleged it is a nonprofit organization that includes at least a jewish synagogue and a senior center chabad contended that decedent gave it an irrevocable pledge of the death benefits in two life insurance policies the genworth policy and sun life financial life insurance policy together the policies in exchange for renaming the senior center the robert feinberg sunshine club to be operated by chabad after decedent death by use of the p olicies death benefits.to this end,according to the objection and counterclaim,chabad renamed the senior center and publicized decedent name in connection with receiving the pledge in addition to alleging facts which chabad contends required the court to deny the relief trustee seeks in the petition,chabad objection and counterclaim also contained affirmative claims for relief against trustee based on unjust enrichment and breach of contract.
in a response to chabad objection and counterclaim,trustee denied the material allegations and affirmatively asserted that any document signed by decedent purporting to gift the genworth policy benefits to chabad was unenforceable because the signature was obtained by fraud,duress,undue influence or when decedent lacked the capacity to sign such documents.
following discovery,trustee brought a motion for summary judgment or in the alternative for summary adjudication of the issue of whether the genworth policy life insurance proceeds are the property of the trust.chabad opposed the motion,and trustee filed a reply.
the court issued a lengthy tentative ruling denying summary judgment on the basis that the motion did not mention trustee claim for damages under probate code section granting summary adjudication on the basis that,because the genworth policy designated the trust as the sole beneficiary,there were no triable issues of material fact as to trustee claim that the genworth policy benefits were property of the trust and sua sponte striking the objection and counterclaim on the basis that,in responding to the petition,chabad was statutorily precluded from seeking affirmative relief,the claims against trustee based on unjust enrichment and breach of contract.in this latter regard striking the objection and counterclaim the only ruling at issue in this appeal,the court relied on code of civil procedure sections,subdivision b,and,subdivision c,and applied them to the underlying proceeding according to probate code section 
the court entertained oral argument,during which most of the exchange concerned the tentative striking of chabad objection and counterclaim in part,the court described to chabad counsel who stated that he was representing chabad on a pro bono basis some of the differences between the procedures in the code of civil procedure and the probate code,explaining that claims in probate need to be presented properly.at the conclusion of the hearing,the court confirmed its tentative ruling,explained in detail the bases of its rulings and filed an unsigned minute order the order consistent with the tentative ruling,namely,denying trustee motion for summary judgment,because the motion did not deal with trustee pending claim for damages granting trustee motion for summary adjudication,because the beneficiary statement in the genworth policy named the trust and sua sponte striking chabad objection and counterclaim,because it improperly asserted claims for affirmative relief in the response to the petition.
trustee gave written notice of entry of the order,and chabad timely appealed from the order.
prior to briefing,trustee filed a motion to dismiss the appeal on the basis that an order granting summary adjudication is a nonappealable order.more specifically,trustee argued that,because the order did not dispose of the entire matter,trustee still had pending a claim for damages against chabad in the petition the order was interlocutory,and we lacked jurisdiction to hear the appeal.chabad opposed the motion on two grounds because the order effectively disposed of the entire case,it was final and appealable under section,subdivision a and because the order adjudicated and denied payment of chabad claim,it was appealable under probate code section and,thus,section,subdivision a.at the time,we deferred the motion until the merits briefing could be completed,directed the parties attention to subdivision d of probate code section which makes appealable an order d irecting or allowing payment of a debt,claim,or cost and requested the parties to address in their respective appellate briefing whether the order directed or allowed the payment of a claim.the parties have discussed the applicability of probate code section,subdivision d in their merits briefs,and not surprisingly they disagree chabad argues the order is appealable under the statute,and trustee argues it is not 
meanwhile,following briefing,on different jurisdictional grounds,we became concerned because the record on appeal does not contain a judgment or signed order of dismissal,only an unsigned minute order.accordingly,we directed the parties to section which requires that an order of dismissal be in writing,signed by the court and filed in the action and asked them to provide supplemental letter briefs addressing the issue whether,in the context of this appeal,an unsigned minute order is an appealable order for purposes of appellate jurisdiction.we have received and considered the parties letter briefs 
because an unsigned minute order is not appealable,we lack jurisdiction and must dismiss the appeala.introduction

as we noted ante,except to the extent that the probate code provides applicable rules,the rules of practice applicable to civil actions apply to,and constitute the rules of practice in,proceedings under th e probate c ode.given this background,we begin with the understanding that,in a civil action not under the probate code,an order striking an answer and counterclaim is not an appealable order.hill wrather d,order striking affirmative defenses and counterclaim yandell city of los angeles cal,order striking,but recognizing same rule for order striking counterclaim keenan dean d,order striking counterclaim merchants nat.bank clark parker.order striking counterclaim without leave to amend hayward union high school dist.madrid d,order striking answer and.that is because,in a civil action not under the probate code,where an action contains both a complaint and a counterclaim or involving the identical parties,both must be resolved before there is a final appealable judgment.ecc construction,oak park calabasas homeowners th,complaint and hill,at complaint and counterclaim.our focus now becomes whether the result is different in an action brought under the probate code.
probate code section,subdivision d 
at our request,the parties briefed whether probate code section,subdivision d provides the statutory basis on which we have jurisdiction namely,whether the order directed or allowed payment of a claim 
chabad argues that the legal effect of the order which in part granted summary adjudication by which trustee is entitled to the genworth policy benefits and in part struck the objection and counterclaim adjudicated the merits of both trustee petition and chabad objection and counterclaim.without citing,subd.d,chabad made the same argument in opposition to trustee motion to dismiss.we agree with chabad that the appealability of an order of the probate court is determined not from its form,but from its legal effect.estate of martin th.however,chabad raises no argument on appeal with respect to the grant of summary adjudication and contrary to chabad argument,we do not agree that the legal effect of striking the objection and counterclaim was to adjudicate either trustee petition or chabad affirmative claims.any adjudication of trustee petition was based on trustee motion for and chabad opposition to summary adjudication and given the court explanation of its ruling striking trustee objection and counterclaim discussed in the next paragraph,there was no adjudication of chabad claims against trustee.
trustee,in contrast,argues that the statute does not apply,because that part of the order on appeal,the striking of chabad objection and counterclaim did not direct or allow payment of any claim.an exchange between chabad counsel and the court at the hearing supports trustee position.when chabad counsel summarized the court sua sponte ruling as dismissing the cause of action for breach of contract and unjust enrichment,the court corrected counsel,explaining,well,not so much dismissing but just saying it needs to be presented properly.minutes later,when counsel for chabad suggested that,instead of the objection and counterclaim,chabad could have filed an objection to the petition and a separate petition seeking the relief for unjust enrichment and breach of contract against trustee,the court indicated at least procedural ly it would be presented correctly.
rather than attempting to present its claim properly or correctly,however,chabad appealed the ruling striking the objection and counterclaim.because that ruling did not dismiss any claim by chabad,it can not be considered a refusal to direct or allow a payment to chabad for purposes of the statutory grant of appellate jurisdiction under probate code section,subdivision d.even if we assume that the grant of summary adjudication d irect ed or allow ed payment of a claim to trustee on her petition sufficient to confer appellate jurisdiction under probate code section,subdivision d,chabad does not challenge the summary adjudication ruling that trustee is entitled to the genworth policy benefits.the only error asserted by chabad in this appeal is the striking of the objection and counterclaim without leave to amend.
in any event,we will assume without deciding that the sua sponte ruling was a refusal to direct or allow a payment to chabad and,therefore,that probate code section,subdivision d provides the statutory basis for appellate jurisdiction to review the ruling.we will next consider whether,assuming statutory jurisdiction for the appeal,the order an unsigned minute order striking a pleading is an appealable order.
the parties have not directed us to,and our research has not disclosed,any provision in the probate code that arguably applies either to striking pleadings or to appealing from unsigned minute orders.accordingly,the rules of practice applicable to civil actions apply to,and constitute the rules of practice in the underlying proceedings here that resulted in the striking of chabad objection and counterclaim and in the entry of the order and,consequently,in our handling of these issues on appeal.in this latter regard,the law revision commission comments to probate code section expressly provide that,unless the probate code provides otherwise,the general rules of practice apply to appeals,and other matters of procedure.cal.law revision com,west ann.ed.foll,italics added.
as part of these general rules of practice,therefore,since orders striking answers,counterclaims and are not appealable orders in civil appeals see cases cited in part,ante,we have no difficulty concluding that an order striking an objection and counterclaim to a petition in probate is not an appealable order either.
likewise,as part of these general rules of practice,for a dismissal to constitute a judgment and be effective for all purposes including the right to appeal it shall be in the form of a written order signed by the court and filed in the action,italics added.indeed,in the parties letter briefs,chabad and trustee agree that section is applicable to the order here,and we so conclude thus,a n order that is not signed by the trial court does not qualify as a judgment of dismissal under section.powell county of orange th,unsigned minute order of dismissal for failure to prosecute under,subd.b.this has been the law for more than a half century.powell,at prior to,under section a dismissal in the form of a n unsigned minute order was proper.
for these reasons,the order here striking the objection and counterclaim,but not dismissing anything is not appealable.absent a basis for exercising jurisdiction,we have no choice but to dismiss the appeal.cole rush cal d dismissal of appeal from order sustaining demurrer without leave to amend art movers,ni west,th,art movers appellate court must dismiss an appeal from a nonappealable order italics added.
in an attempt to create jurisdiction,in its letter brief chabad suggests a number of alternatives.none is persuasive.
first,chabad suggests that the order substantially compl ies with section in light of the widespread electronic filing now available in courts.we disagree.without the required signature,there is no compliance.further,electronic filings may contain electronic signatures.in any event,there is no indication that the order here was electronically filed.
second,we decline chabad invitation that we order the trial court to sign the order nunc pro tunc as of june,the date of the hearing and court minutes.chabad tells us that the trial court c learly intended the order to be a section order of dismissal,because the court granted summary judgment.to the contrary,there is no indication,either in the reporter transcript or the order,that the court intended to dismiss anything.indeed,the court denied summary judgment,granting only summary adjudication and an order granting summary adjudication is not an appealable order.jennings,supra,cal th at.finally,although chabad cites us to four opinions in which the appellate courts directed the trial courts to enter a judgment nunc pro tunc to the date of a nonappealable order,in each the nonappealable order left nothing for the trial court to do in contrast,here,the order left in place
