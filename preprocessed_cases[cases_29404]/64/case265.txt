two children of the decedent attack the order on a petition in probate directing the administrator of their mother estate to quitclaim to their sister any interest of the estate in certain real property.in reaching this decision,the court rejected the siblings assertion that the petition was barred by the statute of limitations set forth in code of civil procedure section.as we explain,this decision is correct.section pertains to actions on the liability of the person that survive the decedent death.the petition asserted a resulting trust.this doctrine does not implicate the personal liability of a decedent.nor was there any cause of action,whether accrued or not accrued,that existed at the time of death.accordingly,we affirm the order.
background 
the facts as set forth in the agreed statement are undisputed.leona yool decedent or yool died on july,and was survived by four children.decedent bequeathed all her property to a trust,with her four children as equal beneficiaries.respondent joseph starita was appointed as the special administrator of decedent estate in april.
in october,decedent and respondent daughter nancy mattingly acquired record title to a residence in oakley,california.the deed of reconveyance did not specify the nature or extent of their respective interests.decedent interest in the oakley property was not placed in decedent trust prior to her death.
following yool death,mattingly asserted that decedent had provided no consideration for the property,never intended to take beneficial title,and accepted legal title as a mere accommodation to facilitate financing.mattingly argued that the facts supported imposition of a resulting trust in her favor.
to resolve the matter,on july,the special administrator filed a petition under probate code section to determine title to real property and to require transfer to party entitled thereto.therein he indicated,among other matters,that mattingly alleged her mother frequently disclaimed any interest in the property and frequently spoke of putting title solely in mattingly name,but never did before her death.appellants bart yool and cheryl schwab,mattingly siblings,moved for judgment on the pleadings,arguing that the petition was untimely under code of civil procedure section.denying the motion,the probate commissioner ruled,among other points,that section does not apply to actions for resulting trusts.
at the conclusion of the hearing on the section petition,the probate court ruled that the evidence supported imposition of a resulting trust in mattingly favor,and,as a matter of law,code of civil procedure section did not apply.consequently,it ordered the administrator to execute and record a deed quitclaiming any record interest of the estate in the oakley property to mattingly.this appeal followed.
ii.discussion 
appellants are adamant that code of civil procedure section governs,and thus bars,mattingly claim for resulting trust commenced under section.we do not agree.
