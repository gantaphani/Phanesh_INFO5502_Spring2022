satish trikha,appeals from the probate court judgment sustaining a will contest and denying admission of the will to probate on the ground the decedent destroyed his will with the intent to revoke it.he contends the trial court misapplied probate code section,which creates a presumption the testator destroyed the will with intent to revoke it where the will was last in the testator possession,the testator was competent until death,and neither the will nor a duplicate original of the will can be found after the testator death satish,contends he introduced substantial contrary evidence to negate the revocation presumption,and the court erred in weighing his evidence in determining whether to apply the presumption.we agree the court prejudicially erred and therefore reverse the judgment.
factual and procedural background 
satish trikha committed suicide in a yorba linda hotel room on october.at the time of his death,he was married to suchitra trikha although she had filed a marital dissolution action the previous december and divorce proceedings were pending.the couple had two sons,neel and rishi.suchitra filed for divorce when she learned satish had resumed contact with his two children from a prior relationship,sharmila and satish,satish.the mother of these two children also had a son,charles arrieta.
the dispute at trial involved a will dated october.the will left satish estate to neel,rishi in trust,sharmila,satish,charles,and grandchildren gio sy in trust and jenna in trust.satish designated his sister santosh as executor.
satish had possession of the original will,but no one could find it after his death.in march,satish,and charles filed a petition to probate a copy of the will obtained from the attorney who prepared it because the original will was lost or stolen.santosh subsequently filed a separate petition to probate the will,as did neel and rishi.suchitra filed a will contest and opposed the petitions to probate the will,alleging satish revoked the will by destroying it and his estate should pass by intestate succession.under intestate succession,suchitra would receive percent of the couple community property her percent and satish percent because they were still married when satish died,subds.a b.she also would receive of satish separate property,subd.c.
as a will contestant,suchitra had the burden of proving satish revoked his will by destroying it,subd.a contestants of the will have the burden of proof of lack of testamentary intent or capacity,undue influence,fraud,duress,mistake,or revocation.satish,however,had the initial burden of producing evidence under section,which provides if the testator will was last in the testator possession,the testator was competent until death,and neither the will nor a duplicate original of the will can be found after the testator death,it is presumed that the testator destroyed the will with intent to revoke it.this presumption is a presumption affecting the burden of producing evidence.the parties agreed the will was last in satish possession,he was competent until death,and neither the will nor a duplicate original of the will was found after his death.they disagreed on whether he intended to revoke the will by destroying it.

the trial court concluded in its statement of decision that satish,and charles did not establish,by substantial evidence it was equally likely the will was lost,or that it was destroyed by someone other than the testator.the court explained it weighed the evidence and credibility of the witnesses in reaching its decision that it is not substantially likely that a person other than satish destroyed this will.this is true even though suchitra had motive and opportunity.the court can not find she perjured herself when asked point blank about this will.even if the court assumed satish had mailed a copy of the will to his sister,it still found the evidence is not substantial enough to rebut the presumption.
satish,moved to vacate the judgment code civ,based on insufficient evidence,and because the court imposed on him the wrong burden,and therefore reflects an incorrect or erroneous legal basis for the decision,not consistent with or not supported by the facts.at the hearing on the motion to vacate,the court stated it had reviewed its statement of decision and notwithstanding any awkwardness,the court had not shifted the burden of proof to satish,to prove satish did not revoke the will,remarking that was my intent.the court acknowledged it might have overstated the fact satish left suchitra business card in a prominent place in the hotel room because the card was apparently found in his wallet,but also stated this was not the linchpin of the court decision.the court denied the motion to vacate.
discussion 
satish,contends he produced substantial evidence to overcome section revocation presumption,and the trial court prejudicially erred by weighing the conflicting evidence because doing so effectively placed the burden of proof on him to establish suchitra destroyed or appropriated the will,or that satish did not destroy it.suchitra responds that satish,did not meet his burden to produce substantial evidence that satish did not destroy the will.alternatively,she argues that even if satish,produced enough evidence to overcome the presumption,the error was not prejudicial because there was a preponderance of evidence to support the trial court finding that satish destroyed his will with the intent to revoke it.as we explain,the trial court prejudicially erred in finding satish,did not produce substantial evidence to overcome the presumption.
a.the revocation presumption 
rebuttable presumptions affect either the burden of proof or the burden of producing evidence.by its express terms,section falls into the latter category if the testator will was last in the testator possession,the testator was competent until death,and neither the will nor a duplicate original of the will can be found after the testator death,it is presumed that the testator destroyed the will with intent to revoke it.this presumption is a presumption affecting the burden of producing evidence.italics added see also,burden of producing evidence means the obligation of a party to introduce evidence sufficient to avoid a ruling against him on the issue,subd.a burden of producing evidence as to a particular fact is on the party against whom a finding on that fact would be required in the absence of further evidence.
evidence code section declares that presumptions affecting the burden of producing evidence,like section revocation presumption,implement no public policy other than to facilitate the determination of the particular action in which the presumption is applied.the law revision committee comments to section explain that these presumptions are based on experience,intended solely to eliminate the need for the trier of fact to reason from the proven or established fact to the presumed fact and to forestall argument of the existence of the presumed fact when there is no evidence to prove the nonexistence of the presumed fact.cal.law revision com,pt.west ann.ed.foll,italics added.in other words,a presumption affecting the burden of producing evidence is not evidence but merely an assumption designed solely to help the trier of fact reach a determination,subd.a haycock hughes aircraft th.
evidence code section establishes how the presumption operates the effect of a presumption affecting the burden of producing evidence is to require the trier of fact to assume the existence of the presumed fact unless and until evidence is introduced which would support a finding of its nonexistence,in which case the trier of fact shall determine the existence or nonexistence of the presumed fact from the evidence and without regard to the presumption.nothing in this section shall be construed to prevent the drawing of any inference that may be appropriate.the law revision commission comment accompanying evidence code section explains that the presumption is merely a preliminary assumption in the absence of contrary evidence,evidence sufficient to sustain a finding of the nonexistence of the presumed fact.cal.law revision com,pt.west ann.ed.foll.for example,under evidence code section,the trier of fact must presume a letter correctly addressed and
