mcdonald contends the trial court erred in denying her creditor claim because it was not timely filed.she asserts her creditor claim was timely filed on february,within the statute of limitations for filing a creditor claim.mcdonald argues that,even though her initial claim did not state the amount of her claim,her supplemental creditor claim,filed on september,did so.mcdonald further argues that her claim was properly filed as a creditor claim because it was based on a contract.therefore she was not required to assert her creditor claim by bringing a petition under probate code section 
respondent structured asset sales,llc sas argues mcdonald is appealing a nonappealable order and therefore this court must dismiss her appeal.we agree.
townsend was an exceedingly successful songwriter,who earned royalties on his songs amounting to hundreds of thousands of dollars annually.townsend died intestate in august.at the time,he had three grown children and no spouse.
townsend son,clef michael townsend michael,sold and assigned his interest in townsend estate to sas in june.in addition,michael granted david pullman,corporate executive officer of sas,power of attorney to act on michael behalf for the purpose of insuring that sas received all the benefits of michael inheritance.
according to mcdonald declaration supporting her creditor claim,mcdonald,who was very close to townsend,agreed to give him in exchange for a percent interest in townsend business income,including copyrighted material and royalties.townsend memorialized the agreement in a notarized letter dated january,royalties agreement.townsend also requested in his letter that mcdonald serve as representative of his estate upon his death.
mcdonald did not receive any of the proceeds promised,which accrued during townsend life,because,after agreeing to give mcdonald a share of his royalties,townsend went into substantial debt.he borrowed large sums of money against his future royalties from various music companies that were collecting the royalties on townsend behalf.mcdonald told townsend he need not pay her any of the proceeds owed until he was financially able to do so.as of townsend death,mcdonald was owed pursuant to the royalties agreement.
on december,mcdonald filed a petition for letters of administration.on january,the court issued letters of administration appointing mcdonald administrator and personal representative of townsend estate.
on february,mcdonald filed a creditor claim,asserting her rights under the royalties agreement,including recovery of unpaid royalties townsend owed her during his life.the total amount claimed was stated in her claim as amount not yet ascertained.see attached exhibit a.exhibit a was a copy of the royalties agreement.
on september,mcdonald filed a supplement to her creditor claim,stating that the total amount owed her for the period preceding townsend death amounted to,which consisted of percent of the royalties earned from january until townsend death.
on march,pursuant to section,the probate court ordered mcdonald to file a petition to approve her claim.accordingly,mcdonald filed a petition,along with her supporting declaration,claiming she was entitled to percent interest in townsend business income,including copyrighted material and royalties,from the date of the royalties agreement until his death,plus the right to percent of all income from townsend estate earned after townsend death.
on april,sas,as a beneficiary to the townsend estate and as assignee of michael interest in the estate,filed an objection and supplement to mcdonald creditor claim.sas alleged the royalties agreement was highly suspect as to its terms and content,was vague and ambiguous,lacked adequate consideration,and did not qualify as a will townsend was misconstruing the true meaning of the agreement terms the agreement in actuality was a loan the agreement was over years old and therefore any contract claim was barred by the statute of limitations and mcdonald separate request for extraordinary fees was excessive.sas requested the court to reject mcdonald entire creditor claim or alternatively that mcdonald be reimbursed from the estate for the she lent townsend,plus legal statutory interest.
on may,sas filed a supplemental objection to mcdonald creditor claim,in which sas argued that mcdonald should have retained separate counsel to assert her creditor claim because there was a conflict of interest,and mcdonald should not receive any extraordinary fees related to her creditor claim.sas further objected to mcdonald attorney filing in los angeles a petition to establish a conservatorship for michael.

appealability of order denying mcdonald claim 
sas maintains this court must dismiss mcdonald appeal because an appeal may not be taken from the order rejecting her claim.we agree.
generally,a ruling in a probate proceeding is not appealable unless expressly made appealable by statute.estate of martin th,d.citing estate of moore d.moore,sas argues the order in the instant case is not appealable because it is not one of the orders enumerated as appealable under section.
in moore,supra,d,the trial court ruled the creditor had waived her probate creditor claim by failing to bring it within the limitation period.on appeal,the court in moore dismissed the appeal on the ground there was no statutory provision allowing the creditor to appeal the trial court ruling.the court in moore,stated it has long been settled that there is no right to appeal from any orders in probate except those specified by section predecessor statute to section.the statute is exclusive citations,and much narrower in its scope than code of civil procedure section.citation.neither an order overruling objections to an account nor an order rejecting a claim are specifically mentioned in the statute estate of middleton d,and orth superior court d.orth,most recently held that there is no right to appeal from an order rejecting a probate claim.thus,there is no need to discuss the contention that the order of the court below was appealable as one directing or allowing the payment of a debt.the relief sought,in fact,was an order approving anne claim which had already been rejected citation.moore,supra,at.
mcdonald argues the order denying her creditor claim is appealable under section,subdivision d.that provision states in all proceedings governed by this code,an appeal may be taken from the making of,or the refusal to make,any of the following orders d directing or allowing payment of a debt,claim,or cost.as indicated in moore,supra,d,that provision is inapplicable because the relief mcdonald sought was an order approving her probate claim,not an order directing or allowing payment of a debt.
moore relied on orth,supra,d,which stated there is no right to appeal from the rejection of a probate claim.citations.therefore,the appeal which was taken from the denial
