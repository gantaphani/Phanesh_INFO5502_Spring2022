this is a petition seeking relief by writ of mandate after respondent court entered an order disqualifying petitioner baker manock jensen hereafter the law firm from serving as attorneys for any party in the probate action pending before respondent.we will grant the petition and direct respondent to vacate the orders in question 
facts and procedural history 
the law firm drafted a will duly executed by lillian salwasser in.lillian died on september,and the will was admitted to probate.because many of the persons relevant to this proceeding are members of the salwasser family,we will refer to those persons by their given names for clarity and convenience.two of lillian four sons,george and gary,were named in the will as of the will.george and gary were duly appointed executors and were issued letters testamentary with full authority to administer the estate under the independent administration of estates act,et.
george was represented by the law firm.gary was represented by separate counsel,michael farley.
lillian will left certain property to her husband,walter,and left the remainder of her estate to a trust created at the same time she executed the will.george and gary were named successor trustees of the trust they and their families were the sole beneficiaries of the trust.lillian other two sons,denis and marvin,were omitted from the will and the trust.
soon after the proceeding for probate of lillian will was filed,walter died.his will was admitted to probate and denis was appointed executor.after serving as executor for about six months,denis also died.marvin,real party in interest in the present proceeding,was appointed administrator of walter estate.
at the time of her death,lillian had an interest in bank,brokerage,and investment accounts.one of these accounts stood in her name,one in walter name,and the other were in various forms of joint account with walter.in addition,there were issues concerning real property transferred by lillian to the trust during her lifetime and issues concerning ownership of certain improvements to real estate.
lillian will has a no contest clause.that clause provides if any beneficiary under this will in any manner,directly or indirectly,contests this will or any of its provisions in any legal proceeding that is designed to thwart my wishes as expressed in this will,any share or interest in my estate given to that contesting beneficiary under this will is revoked and shall be disposed of in the same manner provided herein as if that contesting beneficiary had predeceased me without issue.
in order to begin to seek resolution of the questions concerning ownership of the accounts,the real property,and the improvements,george and gary filed separate applications under probate code section these applications sought a declaration that proposed petitions to determine these questions of ownership would not violate the no contest clause of the will.the court granted the applications,finding that the proposed petitions would not violate the no contest clause of the will.
subsequently,marvin,as walter executor,filed an application for a determination that petitions he proposed to file would not violate the no contest clause of lillian will.the first proposed petition sought a determination of entitlement to distribution of assets of lillian estate it claimed lillian will gave her share of all community property to walter in addition,the petition sought a declaration that marvin was entitled to modify walter retirement plan to confirm to walter all of lillian interest in any such plan.
the second petition marvin proposed to file was under probate code section.acting on such a petition,the court can order property transferred to or from the administrator of an estate.see.the proposed petition sought possession of all banks accounts to which walter and lillian had joint title and walter half of any community property in certain other accounts and assets.thus,this proposed petition sought a determination that these assets did not belong to the estate at all.the proposed petition stated that the administrators of lillian estate were claiming all such property as part of the estate.
george,through the law firm and as a beneficiary of lillian will,filed an opposition to marvin application.the opposition contended both of marvin proposed petitions would constitute a contest of lillian will under the terms of the no contest clause 
in response to this opposition,marvin filed a petition to disqualify the law firm from representing george in his individual capacity as a beneficiary under lillian will.marvin contended the law firm representation of george in opposing marvin application for no contest declarations creates actual conflicts of interest that warrant and mandate disqualification.marvin contended the law firm,as attorney for george as executor of lillian estate,is prohibited from concurrently representing george salwasser in a matter that is adverse to a beneficiary under lillian will.marvin also contended the law firm representation of george as an individual is directly adverse to the law firm prior representation of lillian in the preparation of her estate plan and the testamentary and disposition of all of her assets.such adverse representation is a breach of the law firm duty of loyalty and confidentiality owed to lillian.george filed an opposition to the petition for disqualification.
after a hearing,the court entered an order granting marvin petition and,on its own motion,further disqualifying the law firm from representing george as executor of the will.in addition,on its own motion,the court issued an order to show cause why george should not be relieved as executor.after further proceedings,the court entered the amended order that is the subject of the present petition for writ of mandate.the amended order further clarified that the court intended to disqualify the law firm from representing any person in any capacity in the matter of the probate of lillian estate.
the law firm filed its petition for writ of mandate.after receiving marvin response,this court issued an order to show cause why the relief sought should not be granted.
discussion 
we review for abuse of discretion a trial court determination to remove counsel.however,where that exercise of discretion is based on a legal error,the trial court order is not entitled to deference.that is the case here the trial court found that the circumstances presented to it constituted a conflict of interest those circumstances did not constitute a conflict of interest,and the trial court action based on its erroneous conclusion must be vacated.see generally horsford board of trustees of california state university th,d.
the trial court concluded the law firm had a conflict of interest.the court reasoned as follows because it had represented lillian in the drafting of her will,the law firm had a duty of loyalty to lillian.because it drafted the will,the law firm had a duty of care to the beneficiaries of the will.because it represented the executor,the law firm was not permitted to represent a beneficiary of an estate in a controversy with other beneficiaries except in those unusual cases where each of the parties expressly consents in writing and the attorney is not professionally hampered by the conflict problem.estate of effron d.
the trial court concluded,however,the law firm has now undertaken to represent one of lillian three beneficiaries against another one of lillian three beneficiaries with regard to the very estate plan it drafted and for which it acted as attorney to the estate fiduciary.the representation of george as an individual in his personal dispute with marvin placed the law firm in an active and acute conflict of interest.
we disagree with this line of reasoning in several respects.first,the trial court implied there was an relationship between the law firm and marvin as a result of the former having drafted lillian will.this is incorrect.while an attorney under some limited circumstances may have liability to an intended beneficiary of a will who,because of the attorney error,does not receive the bequest intended by the testator se
