after a trial of designated issues on stipulated facts,the court gave judgment for all defendants,finding that the statute of limitation code civ,subd.a undesignated section references are to that code had run before the may filing of this lawsuit and had not been tolled by lack of actual injury,subd.a such injury existed by september from either loss of the right to amend a form federal estate tax return to obtain a refund or loss of the right to claim certain expenses as deductions.the court further found that borissoff,a successor fiduciary to any fiduciary defendants had advised,lacked standing to sue for malpractice.
borissoff appeals the judgment,challenging the tolling and standing findings.he also claims the court exceeded the scope of stipulated issues by granting judgment based on the statute of limitation rather than ruling just on the tolling issue of actual injury.he claims this prejudicially foreclosed litigation of possible tolling due to legal disability,subd.a,and he requests judicial notice of certain probate proceedings to bolster his disability theory.he has separately appealed a award of costs,challenging denial of his motion to tax costs.we ordered the appeals consolidated for decision.
we will find the issue of standing dispositive and thus not reach the tolling issues or find reason to grant borissoff related request for judicial notice we set out the stipulated facts and supporting documents,stressing the dispositive issue,and reserve discussion of the costs award for the unpublished portion of the opinion.
background 
decedent died in june and left conflicting wills,one from and another from,and the latter designated borissoff as executor.in september,mary,decedent grandniece,filed a probate action contesting the will,and the court appointed clifton ohman as special administrator.ohman was removed four months later,and springer,an attorney and former probate commissioner,was appointed to assume his duties,including marshalling the estate assets and preparing a federal estate tax return.springer filed an application for extension of time to file the return,and in may,filed another action related to the will contest.
the order appointing springer provided that he could be represented by legal counsel of his choice,in the event that he elect ed to be represented by counsel,and he did this in june,engaging the faust defendants to assist him in filing the estate tax returns,to provide him with tax planning advice concerning the estate,and to perform any other legal services which you springer request.
faust filed federal and state fiduciary income tax returns for the estate for fiscal year and,in september,filed the internal revenue service irs form,and state,returns at issue in this malpractice action.the gross estate was valued at,and was paid in state and federal estate taxes.faust attached to the form a statement summarizing the will contest,stating that the parties had made no progress in resolving it,and saying the estate would amend the form,if necessary.a file memo by william mccullough of the firm noted that when the form was amended,real estate taxes and other odds and ends not originally deducted some itemized with dollar amounts in the stipulated facts should be reexamined regarding deductibility.
a timely amendment had to be filed by september,three years after the original filing,but this never occurred.by then,faust had resigned as counsel,springer had died,no extension of time a federal form had been sought as to that particular filing,and the estate had undergone a period of months without an administrator.during the representation,faust had filed later tax returns and extension requests,and springer sought and obtained court approval of attorney fees for the work.springer petition of december to approve first report,settling first account,and for instructions,shows his retention of faust as tax consultant and request for approval of payment of for work detailed in a declaration by faust,which notes that faust had acted as tax counsel to paul springer,special administrator of this estate.springer,himself an attorney,stated in the petition that he waive d any employment of a n estate attorney.the court ultimately approved the attorney fees.
springer found himself in trouble for having misused estate funds and turned to the faust defendants for legal advice in that regard as well.in early november,he wrote to steven kravitz of the firm to explain,despondent and worried,that he had borrowed from the estate during a sale of one home and purchase of another and that the estate now had an interest of in the matter.an ensuing exchange of letters,and a meeting with faust,were addressed to the problem and an unsuccessful effort to have springer borrow replacement money from a financier client.then,in early february,faust wrote to inform springer that the firm had decided not to represent him any longer.
springer died in late may,and the estate files were eventually turned over to mcgovern.in july,borissoff moved to have a particular person appointed successor to springer,but that person was not appointed.the time for filing the amended return or a time extension passed without action in september.pacific bank was appointed special administrator in february,and the bank retained mcgovern as counsel.
in september,a judgment in the probate litigation resulted in the will being admitted to probate the next month the court issued letters testamentary and appointed borissoff executor.
in january,borissoff filed a petition to surcharge the springer estate and pacific bank for springer embezzlement,documenting as missing from the estate.he filed the instant malpractice action in may,but was aware since april of the failure to timely file a form to extend the time.
as already noted,the court in this action held that borissoff lacked standing to maintain the action against attorneys to the predecessor estate administrator,springer.the tolling issue we do not reach is whether,as borissoff contends,there was no actual injury until december,when a judgment settling his second and final account and report awarded attorney fees for the underlying action.
discussion 
the court standing ruling rested primarily on goldberg frye d.goldberg,which examined at length and rejected possible bases for granting beneficiaries under a will standing to sue an estate administrator attorney for malpractice allegedly harming the estate.borissoff does not directly challenge goldberg but tries to distinguish it as limited to the standing of beneficiaries,not successor estate fiduciaries administrators or executors,and he urges that provisions of the probate code,as well as reasoning in moeller superior court cal th,d,moeller,support successor standing.
to frame the issue in a broader context an attorney generally will not be held liable to a third person not in privity of contract with him since he owes no duty to anyone other than his client.the question of whether an attorney may,under certain circumstances,owe a duty to some third party is essentially one of law and,as such,involves a judicial weighing of the policy considerations for and against the imposition of liability under the circumstances.citation.schick lerner d.it is a policy matter involving the balancing of various factors.id.at,citing lucas hamm cal d,and biakanja irving cal d.the imposition of a duty of professional care toward third persons generally has been limited to those situations wherein the nonclient was an intended beneficiary of the attorney services to the client,or where the foreseeability of harm to the nonclient as a consequence of professional negligence was not outweighed by other policy considerations.schick lerner,supra,at.
