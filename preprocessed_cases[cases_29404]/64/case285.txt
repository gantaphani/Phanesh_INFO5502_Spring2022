plaintiffs and appellants angela ann bernard bernard,ann cassell cassell,arthur erman arthur erman,cathy lee miller miller and benny tumminello tumminello collectively,appellants appeal a judgment denying their petition to invalidate the seventh amendment to the carmel bosco revocable living trust trust.
the essential issue presented is whether james foley foley and ann erman,close personal friends of decedent who took care of her at the end of her life and who were benefited by the seventh trust amendment,were care custodian s within the meaning of probate code section so as to implicate a rebuttable presumption that the donative transfer to them was procured by undue influence.we conclude foley and ann erman qualified as care custodians within the meaning of the statute because they provided health services to decedent.welf,subd.y.
we decline to follow conservatorship of davidson th,d davidson,which held when an individual becomes a care custodian of a dependent adult as a direct result of a preexisting genuinely personal relationship rather than any professional or occupational connection within the provision of health or social services,that individual should not be barred by section from the benefit of donative transfers unless it can otherwise be shown that the subject transfer was the result of undue influence,fraud or duress.id.at,d,first italics added.davidson recognition of a preexisting friendship exception to the definition of care custodian is at odds with the statutory scheme,which specifies which persons are exempt from the definition of care custodian,subd.a.
because foley and ann erman were care custodians and failed to rebut the presumption the donative transfer was procured by undue influence,the judgment is reversed with directions and the matter remanded for further proceedings.
factual and procedural background 
factual overview.
on august,carmel bosco decedent executed the trust.over the years,decedent amended the trust seven times.it is only the seventh and final amendment to the trust which was in issue here.
decedent was a widow and had no children,but was close to her extended family.the appellants are related to decedent as follows angela bernard is a niece,cassell is decedent sister,arthur erman and tumminello are nephews,and miller is the to a nephew of the decedent.
foley is the successor trustee of the trust.foley and his girlfriend,ann erman,were longtime friends of decedent for two months before her death,decedent resided at the riverside home shared by foley and ann erman,who jointly cared for her during her final illness.
on september,three days before she died,decedent executed the seventh amendment to the trust.pursuant to said amendment,foley became a fifty percent residuary beneficiary in his individual capacity and ann erman became the beneficiary of the other fifty percent of the trust residue.neither foley nor ann erman was related to decedent,and neither was named as a beneficiary in any of the earlier versions of the trust.as a result of the seventh amendment,the respective share of each of the appellants was either reduced or eliminated in favor of the transfer of the residue of the trust estate to foley and ann erman.
proceedings.
on april,appellants filed a petition to invalidate the seventh amendment to the trust and its residuary clause,and to determine beneficial interests in the trust estate.the petition alleged the seventh amendment was the product of undue influence by foley and ann erman at the time decedent executed the seventh amendment,she was gravely ill and heavily sedated and therefore lacked testamentary capacity and that foley and ann erman were care custodian s of a dependent adult within the meaning of section,subdivision a,and therefore they both were disqualified persons pursuant to section 
a bench trial was held in february.various witnesses testified,including foley,ann erman,and three of the five appellants herein.
on march,the trial court issued a tentative decision denying the petition to invalidate the seventh amendment.the tentative decision ultimately became the trial court statement of decision.the trial court ruled in relevant part 
the grounds asserted in argument against validity are that the residual beneficiaries,ann erman and james foley are disqualified under probate code,and that the amendment was the product of undue influence upon the decedent.specifically,petitioners argue that erman and foley are care custodian s as listed in probate code,and are thus disqualified donees.the term care custodian is defined in welfare and institutions code.if is initially applicable,it nevertheless does not apply if the donee presents clear and convincing evidence that the transfer was not the product of fraud,abuse or undue influence.probate code d.nevertheless,in this case,there is no evidence that erman or foley are care custodians.neither of them fit the indicated agencies or persons in welfare and institutions code.thus,d is not applicable here.fn.omitted.even if it were,erman and foley have met the burden of showing no undue influence,as asserted by petitioner s.
with respect to the issues of undue influence and mental capacity,the trial court found there is insufficient evidence of a mental disorder affecting decedent testamentary disposition.the incident of decedent daydreaming about deceased persons and other relatives not present does not reach the level of a mental disorder.rosko testimony referred to delirium but there was insufficient evidence to prove delirium.rosko testimony was too general and unspecific.he discussed concepts but did not sufficiently relate them to carmel bosco or medical records that he reviewed.
the assertion of morphine affecting decedent judgment fails in the proof.although morphine was available to relieve decedent pain in her last days,the evidence does not show such amounts that would render her incapable of any decisions she made.it is only suspicion on the part of petitioners and foley sic,this should be rosko as to the possible effects of the morphine actually administered.
the evidence does show that ann erman took carmel bosco into her home to care for her.there was some evidence of compensation to ann erman relating to expenses for caring for decedent but the evidence was insufficient to establish a business relationship.ann erman had a personal relationship with decedent founded on a familial bond.
moreover,petitioners have failed to establish undue influence.decedent was in the habit of changing her trust beneficiaries for various reasons.although her amendment changed the disposition of her assets,none of her intended beneficiaries were left out.they just received less than they would have had there not been the residual disposition.the residue disbursement to erman and foley was decedent own choice and could well have been a showing of gratitude for the care and attention they gave her during her last days.the petition is denied.
appellants filed a timely notice of appeal from the judgment.
contentions 
appellants contend ann erman and foley provided health care and other services to a dependent adult,ann erman and foley qualified as care custodian s within the meaning of section,and there is no substantial evidence to support the trial court finding that ann erman and foley effectively rebutted the presumption of undue influence.
discussion 
overview of the statutory scheme.
section provides that with certain exceptions,no provision of any instrument shall be valid to make a donative transfer to various persons,including a care custodian of a dependent adult who is the transferor,subd.a,italics added.
the enactment of the provision adding care custodians of dependent adults to the list of presumptively invalid recipients was intended to apply to gifts made to practical nurses or other caregivers hired to provide care.com.on judiciary,com.on assem.bill reg.sess.davidson,supra,th at,d.the legislature aim was to prevent caregivers from taking advantage of dementing elders.id.at,d.
the prohibition of section does not apply if t he court determines,upon clear and convincing evidence,but not based solely upon the testimony of any person described in subdivision a of section,that the transfer was not the product of fraud,menace,duress,or undue influence,subd.d.thus,where a donee is a care custodian,there is a rebuttable presumption of invalidity section,subdivision d places the burden on the donee to establish by clear and convincing evidence that the transfer created by the dependent adult was not the product of fraud,menace,duress or undue influence.estate of shinkle th,d.
with this brief overview,we turn to the particulars of the instant case.
foley and ann erman were care custodian s within the meaning of section,giving rise to a rebuttable presumption the transfer to them was procured by undue influence.
statutory prohibition on transfers to care custodians of dependent adults.
section sets forth various prohibited transferees.section provides in relevant part at subdivision a except as provided in section,no provision,or provisions,of any instrument shall be valid to make any donative transfer to any of the following a care custodian of a dependent adult who is the transferor.italics added.
b.the definition of care custodian.
the term care custodian has the meaning as set forth in section of the welfare and institutions code,subd.c.thus,section imports the definition of care custodian from welfare and institutions code section,within the elder abuse and dependent adult civil protection act.welf,et.
welfare and institutions code section provides care custodian means an administrator or an employee of any of the following public or private facilities or agencies,or persons providing care or services for elders or dependent adults,including members of the support staff and maintenance staff a health facilities,as defined in sections,and of the health and safety code.b clinics.c home health agencies.d agencies providing publicly funded supportive services,nutrition services,or other home and support services.e adult day health care centers and adult day care.f secondary schools that serve to dependent adults and postsecondary educational institutions that serve dependent adults or elders.g independent living centers.h camps.i alzheimer disease day care resource centers.j community care facilities,as defined in section of the health and safety code,and residential care facilities for the elderly,as defined in section of the health and safety code.k respite care facilities.l foster homes.m vocational rehabilitation facilities and work activity centers.n designated area agencies on aging.o regional centers for persons with developmental disabilities.p state department of social services and state department of health services licensing divisions.q county welfare departments.r offices of patients rights advocates and clients rights advocates,including attorneys.s the office of the care ombudsman.t offices of public conservators,public guardians,and court investigators.u any protection or advocacy agency or entity that is designated by the governor to fulfill the requirements and assurances of the following the federal developmental disabilities assistance and bill of rights act of,contained in chapter commencing with section of title of the united states code,for protection and advocacy of the rights of persons with developmental disabilities.the protection and advocacy for the mentally ill individuals act of,as amended,contained in chapter commencing with section of title of the united states code,for the protection and advocacy of the rights of persons with mental illness.v humane societies and animal control agencies.w fire departments.x offices of environmental health and building code enforcement.y any other protective,public,sectarian,mental health,or private assistance or advocacy agency or person providing health services or social services to elders or dependent adults.italics added.
c.the definition of dependent adult.
for purposes of section,the term dependent adult has the meaning as set forth in section of the welfare and institutions code and also includes those persons who are older than age and would be dependent adults,within the meaning of section,if they were between the ages of and,subd.c.
welfare and institutions code section provides in relevant part a dependent adult means any person between the ages of and years who resides in this state and who has physical or mental limitations that restrict his or her ability to carry out normal activities or to protect his or her rights,including,but not limited to,persons who have physical or developmental disabilities,or whose physical or mental abilities have diminished because of age.
decedent was a dependent adult.
in this regard,the trial court ruled the court does find that decedent would fit the definition of a dependent adult as referred to in probate code and defined in welfare institutions code and c because of her physical limitations and need for daily care.
the record reflects decedent needed assistance with personal needs such as bathing,putting on diapers and application of topical medications.the parties do not dispute that decedent was a dependent adult.the real issue is whether foley and ann erman were her care custodians within the meaning of section and welfare and institutions code section.
foley and ann erman were care custodians within the meaning of the statutory definition trial court erred in its ruling to the contrary.
as indicated,the trial court found there is no evidence that ann erman or foley are care custodians.neither of them fit the indicated agencies or persons in welfare and institutions code.given the state of the evidence and the language of the statute,the trial court finding is erroneous.
welfare and institutions code section provides in relevant part care custodian means an administrator or an employee of any of the following public or private facilities or agencies,or persons providing care or services for elders or dependent adults,including members of the support staff and maintenance staff y any other protective,public,sectarian,mental health,or private assistance or advocacy agency or person providing health services or social services to elders or dependent adults.italics added.thus,the definition of care custodian is broad indeed,extending to persons providing health services or social services to elderly or dependent adults.
here,the uncontroverted evidence established that foley and ann erman came within the statutory definition.with respect to the care they rendered to decedent,the evidence showed,inter alia,foley did her grocery shopping.as for ann erman,she prepared decedent meals,spent every day with her,assisted decedent in getting to and from the bathroom,helped her into bed,fixed her hair,cleaned her bedroom and did her laundry.further,ann erman administered oral medications to decedent,including liquid morphine administered from a dropper,when the home hospice nurses were not present.in addition,ann erman provided wound care.she applied salves and antibiotics to sores on decedent legs and thereafter bandaged the affected area.ann erman also helped decedent apply ointments to her intimate areas.this care was somewhat akin to that which is rendered by practical nurses 
given this record,we readily conclude foley and ann erman were care custodians of decedent,subd.c welf,subd.y.
f.the davidson decision,purporting to exempt close personal friends from the definition of care custodian,erred in its analysis.
foley and ann erman rely on davidson,supra,th,d,for the proposition that because their care of decedent arose out of a preexisting personal and family relationship with her,they do not fit within the definition of care custodian for the reasons set forth below,we believe davidson is erroneous and we decline to follow it.
by way of background,davidson upheld a trial court determination that for purposes of section,beneficiary gungl was not a care custodian providing health services or social services to decedent davidson.davidson,supra,th at,d.it reasoned the care and companionship gungl rendered to davidson in her declining years was the natural outgrowth of a genuinely close personal relationship which preexisted by many years the caregivi
