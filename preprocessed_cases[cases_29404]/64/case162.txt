factual background and procedural history 
factual allegations of the second amended complaint 
plaintiffs claims arise out of three separate representations undertaken by engstrom the allegro matter,the malibu construction matter,and the perlmutter matter.the second amended complaint sac alleged causes of action professional of interest breach of fiduciary duty fraudulent concealment of conflict of interest fraudulent concealment of embezzlement intentional fraud constructive fraud unjust enrichment unfair business practices allegro matter unfair business practices perlmutter matter conversion civil conspiracy to commit intentional fraud civil conspiracy to commit conversion and accounting.plaintiffs complaint alleged the following 
a the allegro matter 
plaintiffs home was severely damaged in the northridge earthquake.from january to january,engstrom and two other law firms represented plaintiffs and other property owners in a bad faith and property damage claim against their insurer,state farm.the action was not a class action,and plaintiffs were specifically assigned to engstrom.in or around november,engstrom entered into a settlement with state farm and obtained over million for insured families.plaintiffs allege that engstrom received,about of plaintiffs settlement share,and distributed the remaining to plaintiffs.in february,plaintiffs were able to randomly contact of the plaintiffs in the allegro matter.based on their discussions with the allegro plaintiffs,it was clear to plaintiffs that engstrom had instructed all plaintiffs in the allegro matter not to discuss the settlement funds with anyone.however,plaintiffs concluded,after conducting a mathematical analysis of the settlement and of the overall litigation,that there was over million of settlement funds unaccounted for.based upon this discrepancy,plaintiffs calculated that engstrom had withheld funds from plaintiffs share of the settlement funds.
b the malibu construction matter 
from january through january,engstrom represented plaintiffs in connection with the malibu construction matter.in late,plaintiffs purchased land in malibu,california,a fact which engstrom knew.in early,due to a contractor negligence,the malibu property sustained hill cut failure.engstrom provided representation to plaintiffs in connection with the contractor negligence,plaintiffs insurance claim against its insurer,state farm,and other construction matters.state farm provided a defense to plaintiffs in connection with the hill cut failure this defense was provided at the same time as the allegro matter was being litigated.as a result,engstrom requested that plaintiffs permit engstrom to review all of plaintiffs documents and discovery responses prior to submission to state farm.
engstrom requested that plaintiffs estimate the cost to repair the hill cut failure,including the cost of importing dirt.plaintiffs had learned they could obtain free dirt from the los angeles county public works department public works,and engstrom knew of plaintiffs plans to import dirt to repair the hill cut failure.plaintiffs requested that engstrom keep this information confidential.
during the malibu construction matter,engstrom provided legal advice regarding plaintiffs neighbors the perlmutters in connection with a nuisance,and also assisted in getting a restraining order against jacob perlmutter,who allegedly hired thugs to harass plaintiff navamalar prakashpalan.
c the perlmutter matter 
in january,plaintiffs malibu property sustained damages due to a landslide originating on the perlmutters property.in,plaintiffs learned the perlmutters were involved in unpermitted construction activity and illegal construction that caused the landslide,including abandonment of their feet deep septic pits.plaintiffs filed a complaint against the perlmutters for negligence arising from the landslide,and the perlmutters filed a against plaintiffs alleging that plaintiffs malibu construction was the cause of the landslide.the perlmutters insurer hired the law office of paul wright to represent them in this matter.
in early,allegedly after discovering their case had no merit,the perlmutters retained engstrom on a contingency basis as their additional attorneys.although they knew the perlmutter matter was substantially related to the malibu construction matter,engstrom did not notify plaintiffs of the representation or obtain their consent,and engstrom knew that the perlmutters were claiming that plaintiffs slope repair was the cause of the landslide.yet engstrom failed to disclose the conflict of interest and during the litigation,engstrom and their expert claimed that the cubic yards of dirt plaintiffs imported caused the landslide.engstrom used attorneys who did not have direct communication with plaintiffs in the malibu construction matter and allegro matter,all of which was a clever plan to conceal the conflict of interest from plaintiffs.
sometime after the perlmutters retained engstrom,the perlmutters insurance company hired the law firm of gibbs,giden,locher,turner senet gibbs to join as additional attorneys to represent the perlmutters in settling the perlmutter matter.during the perlmutter matter,the perlmutters revealed that their unpermitted construction activities were performed by entities collectively known as the mcdermott contractors.plaintiffs amended their complaint to add the mcdermott contractors as defendants,including mcdermott plumbing represented by skapik law group and mcdermott pumping represented by walters,mcclusky boehle.
after pretrial discovery,gibbs wanted to settle the matter on behalf of the perlmutters with plaintiffs,and the perlmutters made a code of civil procedure section offer.plaintiffs declined the offer.gibbs requested continuance of the trial to settle with plaintiffs,and the court granted a continuance to permit mediation.at a mediation held december,defendant wolfe revealed the damaging information that plaintiffs intended to import dirt from public works.the next day,plaintiffs realized the significance of wolfe revelation to their case.plaintiffs caved in and accepted the code of civil procedure section offer,although plaintiffs loss was over million and the offer was.when the mcdermott contractor entities who were motivated to settle because their negligence caused the landslide learned of the settlement,plaintiffs were likewise forced to settle with the mcdermott parties for.
plaintiffs allege they did not discover the conflict of interest until april while in court on the perlmutter matter.at that time,plaintiffs observed a familiar face in the courtroom gallery among the spectators,and recognized the individual as defendant attorney ramsey.in early may,plaintiffs wrote to engstrom regarding the conflict of interest,and on may,received a letter in response from engstrom in which engstrom denied any conflict of interest,stated that plaintiffs waived the conflict,any contact with plaintiffs adversaries was insignificant and minimal,and the two matters were not substantially related.plaintiffs further allege that o n may,engstrom emailed their attorney threatening them with a debtor examination to effectuate a lien on plaintiffs property and thereby engstrom collected over million.elsewhere in the sac,plaintiffs allege the million constituted the judgment against them in the perlmutter matter.
procedural background 
on june,plaintiffs commenced this lawsuit,alleging six causes of action for professional negligence and malpractice breach of fiduciary duty and conflict of interest fraudulent concealment constructive fraud,fiduciary fraud,intentional fraud and conspiracy to commit fraud unjust enrichment and unfair business practices under business professions code section ucl.plaintiffs filed a first amended complaint on january,alleging eight causes of action the same six as the original complaint plus claims for conversion and civil conspiracy.
on april,the trial court overruled defendant demurrer to the first cause of action and sustained the demurrer as to the second,third,fourth,fifth,sixth,seventh,and eighth causes of action of the first amended complaint,with leave to amend.plaintiffs filed their sac on april.
engstrom demurred to the sac,arguing the alleged confidential information about the source of the dirt used in the malibu construction matter was a matter of public record and therefore not confidential engstrom was entitled to dismissal of the allegro matter claims because it could not mount an adequate defense without breaching the privilege with respect to the other allegro matter plaintiffs under solin myers th solin plaintiffs did not plead fraud with sufficient particularity plaintiffs could not seek restitution because their claims were made under an enforceable contract plaintiffs failed to allege recoverable damages under the ucl plaintiffs conversion claim failed to allege an identifiable sum of money plaintiffs failed to allege all elements of a civil conspiracy plaintiffs failed to state facts sufficient to state a claim for accounting and certain of plaintiffs claims relating to the allegro matter the second,fourth,seventh,eighth,tenth causes of action were.engstrom requested judicial notice of the grading permit plaintiffs obtained from the city of malibu in connection with installation of a manufactured fill slope and the permit issued to the county of los angeles for the purpose of entering the plaintiffs property to deposit fill material.
engstrom also moved to strike certain portions of plaintiffs sac that requested punitive damages and attorney fees and costs on the grounds that the sac failed to allege malice,fraud or oppression and the cause of action for accounting did not permit the recovery of damages,and the ucl did not provide for attorney fees.
in opposition plaintiffs generally contended the public works documents were expired permits and had been obtained as a result of a privileged communication with plaintiffs.further,plaintiffs argued the documents were not public records because public works does not provide information over the phone or over the counter unless a party is aware of the information and makes a request in writing.plaintiffs further distinguished the case from solin,supra,th,in which the clients intervened in a case to prevent disclosure of confidential information here,the other parties in the allegro matter were coming forward and volunteering information,and thus the evidence was available.further,the statute of limitations was not a bar to plaintiffs claims because engstrom actions were committed in secret.
plaintiffs also opposed the motion to strike,contending the fraud alleged was sufficient under civil code section,pointing to engstrom alleged conduct in representing adverse interests without disclosing same to plaintiffs and in disclosing confidential information,and by taking settlement funds to which they were not entitled.
in reply,engstrom asserted that plaintiffs failure to plead facts sufficient to entitle them to equitable tolling of the statute of limitations under the discovery rule in the allegro matter because there was nothing preventing plaintiffs from discovering any alleged misconduct in the years since the settlement of the allegro matter.further,unless all the allegro plaintiffs waived the privilege,plaintiffs would not be able to demonstrate how the settlement monies were disbursed.with respect to the public works document,engstrom contended plaintiffs shared this allegedly confidential information with a public entity long before engstrom allegedly improperly informed their adversaries.
the court granted engstrom request for judicial notice and granted plaintiffs request for judicial notice only as to the final approved plan from the city of malibu.
the court sustained the demurrer without leave to amend.the court found that with respect to those claims based on the allegro matter second,fourth,seventh,eighth,tenth,twelfth and thirteenth causes of action,the statute of limitations did not bar those claims even under the delayed discovery rule because plaintiffs alleged sufficient facts to show they did not discover their claim until november however,plaintiffs claims based on the allegro matter settlement were barred under solin,supra,th,which held that where a lawsuit is incapable of complete resolution without breaching the privilege,the suit may not proceed,if a balancing of certain factors set forth in solin and explained in dietz meisenheimer herron th is satisfied.here,the trial court found the plaintiffs had failed to satisfy those factors because although some of the allegro plaintiffs had come forward,engstrom would be forced to reveal confidential information relating to the other allegro plaintiffs in order to defend the action,and thus demurrer was sustained as to those claims on that basis.further,plaintiffs claims that a portion of the allegro matter settlement proceeds were unaccounted for was entirely based on speculation.
with respect to claims based on the perlmutter matter first,third,fifth,sixth,ninth,and eleventh causes of action,the trial court found that although engstrom judicially noticed documents did not establish plaintiffs importation of fill dirt was a matter of public record,plaintiffs nonetheless failed to explain how they were damaged by this disclosure.
the court also addressed the specific merits of certain of plaintiffs claims,as more fully discussed below.
the trial court denied leave to amend because plaintiffs failed to show how they could correct the deficiencies in their complaint.in addition,because plaintiffs failed to plead any viable causes of action to support punitive damages,the trial court granted the motion to strike.
discussion 
standard of review 
the function of a demurrer is to test the sufficiency of a pleading as a matter of law,and we apply the de novo standard of review in an appeal following the sustaining of a demurrer without leave to amend.california logistics,state of california th,holiday matinee,rambus,th.a complaint is sufficient if it alleges ultimate rather than evidentiary facts,but the plaintiff must set forth the essential facts of his or her case with reasonable precision and with particularity sufficient to acquaint the defendant with the nature,source,and extent of the plaintiff claim.legal conclusions are insufficient.doe city of los angeles cal th,fn.we assume the truth of the allegations in the complaint,but do not assume the truth of contentions,deductions,or conclusions of law.the trial court errs in sustaining a demurrer if the plaintiff has stated a cause of action under any possible legal theory,and it is an abuse of discretion for the court to sustain a demurrer without leave to amend if the plaintiff has shown there is a reasonable possibility a defect can be cured by amendment.california logistics,state of california,supra,th at.

ii.engstrom demurrer 
plaintiffs claims based on the allegro action statute of limitations 
notwithstanding the trial court ruling that plaintiffs claims based on the allegro matter were not barred by the statute of limitations,engstrom brief argues that the statute of limitations bars such claims.as a general rule,respondents who fail to file a can not claim error in connection with the opposing party appeal.estate of powell th.a limited exception to this rule is provided by section,which states in pertinent part the respondent may,without appealing from the judgment,request the reviewing court to and it may review any of the foregoing described orders or rulings for the purpose of determining whether or not the appellant was prejudiced by the error or errors upon which he relies for reversal or modification of the judgment from which the appeal is taken.the purpose of the statutory exception is to allow a respondent to assert a legal theory which may result in affirmance of the judgment.citation.hutchinson city of sacramento th.we therefore consider the statute of limitations issue.
malpractice claim 
an action against an attorney for a wrongful act or omission,other than for actual fraud,arising in the performance of professional services shall be commenced within one year after the plaintiff discovers,or through the use of reasonable diligence should have discovered,the facts constituting the wrongful act or omission,or four years from the date of the wrongful act or omission,whichever occurs first,subd.a.section states two distinct and alternative limitation periods one year after actual or constructive discovery,or four years after occurrence the date of the wrongful act or omission,whichever occurs first.the statute applies to an action for malpractice as well as breach of fiduciary duty arising out of the performance of an attorney professional duties,but it does not apply to actions for fraud.favila katten muchin rosenman llp th.further,the statute applies to actions for any act or omission arising out of the performance of an attorney professional duties.ibid.
the statute is tolled only during the time the plaintiff has not sustained actual injury,subd.a.actual injury occurs where the plaintiff suffers any loss or injury legally cognizable as damages based on the asserted errors or omissions of an attorney.jordache enterprises,brobeck,phleger harrison cal th.the fact of injury or damage need not be recognized or noticed by the plaintiff.nor does the fact that damage may be difficult to calculate or prove prevent the legal malpractice statute of limitations from running.croucier chavos th.
here,plaintiffs injury occurred in when engstrom allegedly wrongfully withheld the settlement funds,more than four years before the filing of the plaintiffs sac in april.thus,plaintiffs malpractice and breach of fiduciary duty claims based on the allegro matter settlement funds distribution are barred by section.
fraud based claims 
we requested the parties to brief separately the issue of the applicability of the statute of limitations in probate code section to client trust accounts and the disbursement of settlement funds from such accounts.plaintiffs contend that engstrom had a duty as holder of their client funds in trust,to account for and maintain records of such funds under rules of professional conduct,rule,and that probate code section governs the limitations period,as well as lessens their duty of inquiry into engstrom handling of such funds as a fiduciary furthermore,the holding of client trust funds is arguably not the rendering of professional services to which code of civil procedure section would apply.engstrom counters that code of civil procedure section controls any claims for breach of trust such as alleged here and code of civil procedure section,subdivision d controls any fraud claims,and also that probate code section by its express terms states that it applies unless the potential breach of trust is covered by another statute.furthermore,engstrom argues that both code of civil procedure section,subdivision d and probate code section supply the same time period and delayed discovery rule and plaintiffs are not under any lessened duty of discovery as a result,plaintiffs have failed to establish that any new facts not available to them in came to light in to justify their late amendment of their pleading.
by its own terms,section does not govern claims for fraud generally,courts have applied section,subdivision d to actions for fraud against attorneys.this statute of limitations for fraud is three years,subd.d.this section also codifies the delayed discovery rule,providing that a cause of action for fraud is not to be deemed to have accrued until the discovery,by the aggrieved party,of the facts constituting the fraud or mistake.brandon gray th,subd.d.the date a complaining party learns,or at least is put on notice,that a representation was false is the date the statute starts running,subd.d.the fraudulent concealment doctrine will also toll the statute of limitations under section,subdivision d.t he ground of relief is that the defendant,having by fraud or deceit concealed material facts and by misrepresentations hindered the plaintiff from bringing an action within the statutory period,is estopped from taking advantage of his own wrong.pashley pacific ry.cal d.to take advantage of this doctrine the plaintiff must show the substantive elements of fraud and an excuse for late discovery of the facts.snapp associates ins.services,robertson th.
with respect to trust accounts,probate code section applies to a fiduciary duty to provide an accounting to a beneficiary and provides a limitations period that is triggered by the trustee accounting duty.a beneficiary of a trust who receives an accounting that would put him or her on notice of a claim against the trustee has three years from the date of receipt of the accounting to file an action if no accounting is provided,any action must be filed within three years of the discovery of the claim.under probate code section,the duty of inquiry is triggered where there is sufficient information either through an accounting or otherwise to put the beneficiary on notice to take action,subd.a noggle bank of america th,fn.a duty of inquiry exists even where the alleged wrongdoer is a fiduciary.
an express trust is defined as a fiduciary relationship whereby a trustee holds property for another benefit.placerville fruit growers irving d.there can be no reasonable dispute that an attorney client trust account is an express trust rules of professional conduct,rule provides a all funds received or held for the benefit of clients by a member or law firm,including advances for costs and expenses,shall be deposited in one or more identifiable bank accounts labeled trust account,client funds account or words of similar import,maintained in the state of california further,an attorney owes the client a duty to account for funds held in the client trust account.rule also provides b a member shall maintain complete records of all funds,securities,and other properties of a client coming into the possession of the member or law firm and render appropriate accounts to the client regarding them preserve such records for a period of no less than five years after final appropriate distribution of such funds or properties and comply with any order for an audit of such records issued pursuant to the rules of procedure of the state bar.promptly pay or deliver,as requested by the client,any funds,securities,or other properties in the possession of the member which the client is entitled to receive.
in addition,california rules of professional conduct,rule d,which was in effect at the time of the settlement of the allegro matter,provided that a member who represents two or more clients shall not enter into an aggregate settlement of the claims of or against the clients without the informed written consent of each client.although the california rules of professional conduct do not specifically address what must be disclosed to a client to obtain the client informed consent,the american bar association model rules of professional conduct impose additional demands,and require the lawyer to disclose the total amount of the aggregate settlement,the details of that lawyer other clients participation in the settlement.aba model rules of conduct,rule g.
as pointed out in vafi mccloskey th,where there are two statutes governing the same subject,the question of which statute governs is subject to de novo review.id.at.vafi further explained that when a general and a particular statutory provision are inconsistent,the latter is paramount to the former.so a particular intent will control a general one that is inconsistent with it.citation.thus,a specific statute of limitations takes precedence over a general one,even though the latter would be broad enough to include the subject to which the more particular provision relates.citation.ibid.
although california has declined to adopt american bar association model rules of professional conduct,rule g,which precisely defines the scope of disclosure in an aggregate settlement,an attorney duty accurately to account for client trust funds in the context of an aggregate settlement is nonetheless governed by rules of professional conduct,rule b.under rule b in the context of an aggregate settlement,the attorney must disclose sufficient information to enable the client to evaluate whether the settlement proceeds have been properly distributed.that rule imposes a more particularized duty than the general duty imposed under civil code section not to omit or misrepresent facts,which duty is the basis for a generic claim of fraud 
thus,under the rule of statutory construction that we apply a more specific statute,given the accounting duty applicable to the express trust that is a client trust account,we apply probate code section to plaintiffs claims that engstrom did not properly distribute the aggregate settlement proceeds in the allegro matter.as alleged,the only information plaintiffs received from engstrom was the amount of their share of the allegro settlement,engstrom attorney fees,and that the families received a total of million.even without applying the more detailed standard of american bar association model rules of professional conduct,rule g,engstrom accounting was incomplete because it did not provide plaintiffs with sufficient information to evaluate whether all monies were distributed,and whether they received the sums they were entitled to receive.
as a result,plaintiffs asserted they did discover the claim in february after they filed their original complaint when they conducted a survey of some of the other settling plaintiffs in the allegro matter,making plaintiffs complaint timely under the principles of probate code section.thus,plaintiffs should be permitted to amend their complaint to set forth delayed discovery entitling them to a tolling of the statute of limitations on the allegro matter under probate code section based upon an assertion that engstrom failed to provide an accounting sufficient for them to determine whether their portion of the settlement proceeds was fairly and accurately distributed to them as a result of this insufficient accounting which plaintiffs have alleged was the result of concealment,plaintiffs,who had no other sources of information,were not put on notice of any wrongdoing until they later conducted an investigation by surveying other settling plaintiffs in the allegro matter.we note that substantively,the trial court found plaintiffs claims based on the allegro matter failed because they were based upon speculation.however,based upon the accounting duty engstrom owed to plaintiffs under the professional rules of conduct,and the fact plaintiffs allegations indicate they received an insufficient amount of information concerning the disposition of the aggregate settlement,this ground for sustaining engstrom demurrer is without merit because the plaintiffs lack of information resulted from engstrom alleged failure to adequately account.where no duty is imposed by law upon a person to make inquiry,and where under the circumstances a prudent man would not be put upon inquiry,the mere fact that means of knowledge are open to a plaintiff,and he has not availed himself of them,does not debar him from relief when thereafter he shall make actual discovery.citation.vai bank of america cal d,failure of fiduciary to fully and fairly disclose material facts constituted breach of fiduciary duty and constructive fraud.
although no other cases have so applied probate code section,we do not see this as a reason for not doing so here.the statutory limitations period of probate code section which we only apply to plaintiffs claims due to the exception of code civ.proc,is identical to that of the statute of limitations of code of civil procedure section,subdivision d,and there is a similar,if not identical,delayed discovery rule.the difference is that discovery is triggered under probate code section by the receipt of an accounting,or if no accounting is supplied,by facts sufficient to put the plaintiff on notice of any wrongdoing.given that accounting duties for an attorney a client trust account were already in place under the rules of professional conduct at the time of the allegro settlement,applying probate code section here does not work an injustice instead,we clarify and reinforce an attorney duty in the context of an aggregate settlement where the settling plaintiffs will have limited information about the other settling plaintiffs receipts and the device of the aggregate settlement could provide a shield for an attorney to misappropriate or improperly distribute funds,as plaintiffs have alleged here.
finally,with respect to an attorney duties of confidentiality owed to multiple clients in an aggregate settlement,to the extent that other clients settlement information is confidential,that does not preclude disclosure of some information regarding the settlement sufficient to permit the aggregate settlement plaintiffs to determine whether the settlement funds have been properly distributed.in that manner,the rule of solin,supra,th at that where confidential information is vital to an attorney defense and the suit could not proceed without disclosure of such confidential information,the suit must be dismissed will not be implicated because we do not advocate a disclosure of confidential information.we require that the information disclosed regarding an aggregate settlement must be sufficient to put the plaintiffs on notice of any potential claim and must comport with an attorney duties under rules of professional conduct,rule a and b.
first cause of action professional negligence second cause of action breach of fiduciary duty 
plaintiffs first cause of action for professional malpractice based upon conflict of interest breach of duty of confidentiality and breach of duty of loyalty alleged that engstrom representation of the perlmutters was undertaken without plaintiffs informed written consent in breach of rule of the rules of professional conduct,and engstrom performed below the standard of care when it disclosed to plaintiffs adversaries plaintiffs plan to import free fill dirt from public works.plaintiffs alleged that they suffered damages in the form of a settlement for substantially less than they were actually damaged in the perlmutter matter,as well as threatening them with a debtor examination to effectuate a lien on plaintiffs property and thereby engstrom collected over million.plaintiffs second cause of action for breach of fiduciary duty is based upon the alleged insufficient distribution of settlement funds in the allegro matter and the conflict of interest and disclosure of confidential information in the perlmutter matter.
plaintiffs contend the trial court erred in concluding that they failed to allege how engstrom disclosure of their plan to import dirt caused them damage because they alleged they would not have settled for if the disclosure had not been made,which they assert is a sufficiently detailed allegation to withstand demurrer.further,even if their dirt importation plan was a public record,defendants were barred from disclosing information obtained during the course of their representation of plaintiffs under oasis west realty,llc goldman cal th.further,plaintiffs alleged sufficient facts to establish breach of fiduciary duty in their allegations of defendants embezzlement of the settlement funds,and the trial court erred in applying solin,supra,th because the balancing determination necessary under solinis fact intensive and can not be made at the demurrer stage 
rule c of the california rules of professional conduct provides that a member shall not,without the informed written consent of each client accept representation of more than one client in a matter in which the interests of the clients potentially conflict or accept or continue representation of more than one client in a matter in which the interests of the clients actually conflict rules conduct,rule c.rule e provides that an attorney shall not,without the informed written consent of the current or former client,accept employment adverse to the client or former client where,by reason of the representation of the client or former client,the member has obtained confidential information material to the employment.see also bus,subd.e.however,a violation of the rules of professional conduct does not,in and of itself,render an attorney liable for damages.citations.stanley richmond th.in a tort action for breach of fiduciary duty or professional negligence,however,the rules may inform the scope of an attorney duty.slovensky friedman th.

where the potential conflict is one that arises from the successive representation of clients with potentially adverse interests,the courts have recognized that the chief fiduciary value jeopardized is that of client confidentiality but that the primary value at stake in cases of simultaneous or dual representation is the attorney duty and the client legitimate expectation of loyalty,rather than confidentiality.flatt superior court cal th.a n attorney is forbidden to do either of two things after severing his relationship with a former client.he may not do anything which will injuriously affect his former client in any manner in which he formerly represented the client nor may he at any time use against his former client knowledge or information acquired by virtue of the previous relationship.oasis west realty,goldman,supra,cal th at.
here,with respect to the perlmutter matter,plaintiffs claims for professional negligence and breach of fiduciary duty fail because they allege no causation,a required element of these claims.plaintiffs assert that attorney wolfe divulged their plan to import free dirt obtained from public works,but do not explain how the perlmutters knowledge of their plan caused plaintiffs damage claim against the perlmutters to collapse.plaintiffs have not alleged the basis for their valuation of their case,why their use of fill dirt,or free fill dirt,harmed their position,or why their use of fill dirt was a matter that could be kept confidential in a lawsuit involving damage to their property based upon the fill dirt.
with respect to the allegro matter,as discussed above,claims based on professional negligence and breach of fiduciary duty are barred by the statute of limitations in section.
fraudulent concealment of conflict of interest third cause of action and fraudulent concealment of embezzlement fourth cause of action 
plaintiffs fraudulent concealment causes of action allege that engstrom failed to disclose that it was representing the perlmutters in the perlmutter action,although attorneys lack and ramsey avoided direct contact with the perlmutters,they were involved in legal work,while wolfe,who had not worked on the malibu construction matter,had contact with the perlmutters.as a result,plaintiffs allege they would not have settled the allegro matter and would not have settled the perlmutter matter for the sums they did.the court found on the third cause of action for fraudulent concealment of conflict of interest in the perlmutter matter that although a disclosable conflict of interest existed,plaintiffs failed to allege how they were damaged by wolfe disclosure of their plans regarding the fill dirt.on the fourth cause of action for fraudulent concealment of funds not distributed in the allegro matter settlement,the court found plaintiffs damage claims speculative and plaintiffs failed to show how the alleged concealment caused damages because the alleged concealment came after the plaintiffs had agreed to settle the matter.plaintiffs contend the trial court erred in concluding they did not sufficiently allege causation on the allegro matter or perlmutter matter.
civil code section,paragraph provides that deceit includes t he suppression of a fact,by one who is bound to disclose it.in general,to prove a fraud based on concealment,a plaintiff must demonstrate the defendant concealed or suppressed a material fact,the defendant had a duty to disclose the fact to the plaintiff,the defendant intentionally concealed or suppressed the fact with the intent to defraud the plaintiff,the plaintiff was unaware of the fact and would not have acted as he or she did if he or she had known of the concealed or suppressed fact,and as a result of the concealment or suppression of the fact,the plaintiff sustained damage.linear technology applied materials,th.
with respect to the perlmutter matter,the mere disclosure of plaintiffs fill dirt plan does not establish why such disclosure was the cause of plaintiffs lowered settlement figure,and the trial court properly sustained to demurrer to plaintiffs third cause of action.however,with respect to the allegro matter,as set forth above plaintiffs claims set forth in their fourth cause of action are not time barred,nor are they speculative and plaintiffs are permitted to amend such claims to set forth a basis for their delayed discovery of the facts.
fifth cause of action intentional fraud 
plaintiffs fifth cause of action alleges that engstrom failed to disclose its conflict of interest in the perlmutter matter to plaintiffs,and in communication with plaintiffs by letter dated may,falsely maintained that the matters were not substantially related,plaintiffs had waived the conflict,and engstrom contact with the perlmutters was insignificant and minimal.as a result of these misrepresentations,engstrom defrauded plaintiffs of million.
the trial court found plaintiffs theory of liability unclear because plaintiffs did not allege why million was paid based on defendants misrepresentations about the conflict of interest.plaintiffs argue the trial court erred because if plaintiffs had known of the conflict,they would have taken steps to vacate the judgment improperly obtained against them.
the elements of a claim for fraudulent concealment require the plaintiff to show that the defendant concealed or suppressed a material fact,the defendant was under a duty to disclose the fact to the plaintiff,the defendant intentionally concealed or suppressed the fact with the intent to defraud the plaintiff,the plaintiff was unaware of the fact and would not have acted as he did if he had known of the concealed or suppressed fact,and as a result of the concealment or suppression of the fact,the plaintiff sustained damage.marketing west,sanyo fisher usa th.there must also be a duty to disclose.such a duty may be established where there is a confidential relationship between the parties,defendant has made a representation which was likely to mislead due to the nondisclosure,there is active concealment of undisclosed matters,or one party has sole knowledge of or access to material facts and knows such facts are not known to or discoverable by the other party.goodman kennedy cal d.
