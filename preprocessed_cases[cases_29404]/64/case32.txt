marshall caro filed a complaint in the united states district court for the district of connecticut dorsey,alleging,inter alia,a civil cause of action under title iii of the omnibus crime control and safe streets act of,codified at title iii or the wiretap act.the district court dismissed caro complaint.we affirm,and,in so doing,hold that the exception to the consent provision of d requires that a communication be intercepted for the purpose of a tortious or criminal act that is independent of the intentional act of recording.
background 
in early february,elizabeth caro,who was in the final days of a painful battle with lung cancer,was visited by her sons eric and david weintraub,along with their families,and her brother and thomas and lynn corrigan.during the visit,elizabeth spoke with her,lynn,in the kitchen about lynn desire to have elizabeth sign a draft of a will that thomas had prepared.the draft named thomas as the executor of elizabeth estate and contained provisions to which elizabeth allegedly objected.elizabeth husband,marshall lynn that he had already hired an attorney to prepare their wills and that in their meeting with their attorney,elizabeth had expressed different intentions than those set out in thomas draft.
at some point during this conversation,david and eric weintraub entered the kitchen.david placed his iphone on the kitchen table and,unbeknownst to marshall,used the device to record the conversation after the recording began,thomas also entered the kitchen.it appears from caro complaint that the conversation at times included thomas corrigan and david weintraub and,in the end,became quite heated between those involved.
four days later,on february,elizabeth died without completing a will.marshall filed elizabeth death certificate with the connecticut probate court and filed a petition for letters of administration for elizabeth estate.eric and david weintraub,represented by attorneys from day pitney llp,filed an opposition to marshall caro petition.
the probate court held a hearing on april.david testified that he had recordings of the kitchen conversation between marshall and elizabeth,and his attorney submitted a cd of the recordings 
on february,marshall caro filed a complaint in the united states district court for the district of connecticut dorsey,alleging violations of title iii,along with various connecticut state law claims in addition to david and eric weintraub,caro named as defendants day pitney llp and one of its lawyers,glenn william dowd.upon day pitney motion and over caro objection,the district court relieved day pitney from connecticut local civil rule and allowed a firm attorney to represent day pitney for the purpose of filing a motion to dismiss the complaint.
moved to dismiss,arguing,inter alia,that the recorded conversations did not qualify as oral communications within the scope of title iii because david weintraub was a party to the conversation and caro had no reasonable expectation of privacy in the conversation.caro opposed the motion,arguing that he did not reasonably expect to be recorded and that david was not a party to the conversation.he also requested leave to amend his complaint.
the district court granted the motion to dismiss and denied caro motion to amend his complaint.caro weintraub,cv,wl,at.july.the district court agreed that the recordings were not oral communications under the wiretap act because david weintraub was a party to the conversation and caro did not have a reasonable expectation that his conversation was private.id.at.the district court declined to exercise supplemental jurisdiction over caro state law claims.id.at.
caro appealed.
ii.discussion 
we review the dismissal of a complaint de novo,accepting all factual allegations in the complaint as true and drawing all reasonable inferences in favor of the plaintiff.chambers time warner,cir.to survive a motion to dismiss,the complaint must plead sufficient facts to make out a plausible claim to relief.bell atl.twombly.when,as here,the complaint is filed by a pro se plaintiff,we construe the complaint liberally,interpreting it to raise the strongest arguments that it suggest s.triestman fed.bureau of prisons,cir per curiam accord harris mills,cir.
in relevant part,the wiretap act affords a civil cause of action to an aggrieved individual who has had her oral communications intentionally intercepted by a party to those communications for the purpose of committing a crime or tort,d.we hold that david weintraub was a party to the conversation,but caro did not allege a tort that could provide the independent tortious intent necessary to bring a civil claim under the wiretap act.thus,it is futile to allow him to amend his complaint.
party to the conversation 
the district court found that david weintraub was a party to the relevant conversation,and we agree.
caro argues that david weintraub was not a party to the conversation because there were actually multiple conversations that occurred in the kitchen,and the participants in the conversations did not invite david to join any of them.limiting ourselves,as we must,to the facts pled in the complaint,we conclude that david weintraub was a party to the conversation for purposes of the wiretap act.
in the context of the statute,a party to the conversation is one who takes part in the conversation.caro we can support for the proposition that one must be invited to a conversation in order to be a party to it.caro admits in his complaint that david weintraub was present at the table during the conversation in the kitchen and that david spoke up a few times urging caro to continue.those facts are sufficient to establish that david was a party to the conversation 
concluding that david weintraub was a party to the conversation is not fatal to caro claims.the wiretap act forbids someone who is a party to a conversation to record it,if the oral communication is intercepted for the purpose of committing any criminal or tortious act.d.invocation of this provision raises the question of what must be alleged to demonstrate tortious intent.
tortious intent 
the statute requires that an oral communication be intercepted for the purpose of committing any criminal or tortious act.d.the district court did not address this issue and the original complaint as filed does not allege a tortious intent behind david weintraub recording.caro requested leave before the district court to amend his complaint.the district court denied caro request,a decision that both sides agree was in error under the federal rules of civil procedure in effect at the time caro now argues that if he were permitted to amend the complaint,he would allege that weintraub recorded his statements with tortious intent,while weintraub argues that the effort would be futile.
caro assertion that he would plead a tortious intent is simply a recitation of the missing element in his exercise insufficient to rescue the complaint from its deficiencies.see ashcroft iqbal.however,we remain obligated to construe pro se complaints liberally.see harris mills,cir.because caro,a pro se plaintiff,should have been afforded leave to amend his complaint,and because he contends that he will address the deficiency,there is a strong argument that we should remand the case to allow him a chance to fix the fault.fulton goord,cir.but weintraub contention is need not remand if the effort would be futile.id.
determining the futility of an amended pleading turns on whether title iii requires that the claimant assert that the recording occurred with a separate and independent tortious intent,or whether the necessary tortious intent can be inferred from the act of recording itself.in other words,must a plaintiff plead that the defendant had intent to use the illicit recording to commit a tort beyond the act of recording illicitly or may the defendant merely have the intent to record and that alone is sufficient several of our sister circuits have tackled the issue,each reaching the conclusion that,under title iii,the defendant must have the intent to use the illicit recording to commit a tort of crime beyond the act of recording itself.
