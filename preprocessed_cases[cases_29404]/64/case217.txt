this appeal concerns the presumptive disqualification of a care custodian from receiving a donative transfer from a dependent or elder adult.appellant elizabeth pryor,daughter of the decedent,argues that her stepmother,respondent jennifer pryor,may not invoke the spousal exception to this presumption because the marriage was the product of undue influence and fraud.we find nothing in the statutory scheme or the legislative history which would warrant the judicial creation of an exception to the rule that a spouse may receive a donative transfer.we shall affirm the judgment.
factual and procedural summary 
elizabeth is one of six children of richard pryor,the comedian and actor jennifer and richard married in and divorced.richard was diagnosed with multiple sclerosis in the and his condition deteriorated thereafter.it is undisputed that jennifer became a care custodian for richard in.in,four and years before richard death in,richard and jennifer entered into a confidential marriage.before and after this remarriage,richard revised his estate plan to leave substantial assets to jennifer rather than his six children.apparently elizabeth did not learn of the remarriage until after richard death.
in a companion appeal,pryor pryor no,we affirmed the denial of elizabeth petition to annul the marriage between jennifer and richard on the ground of fraud.this case arises from a probate proceeding brought by elizabeth.the first amended petition is the charging pleading.we are concerned here only with the fifth and sixth causes of action to set aside donative transfers under section,because elizabeth has confined her appeal to those claims.these causes of action seek to have various gifts,bequests,and transfers of property or assets made by richard between and declared void under section because jennifer status as care custodian raises a presumption they are invalid.
jennifer demurred to the first amended petition,invoking section,subdivision a which allows a donative transfer by a dependent adult to a spouse.she argued that section,subdivision a insulates any transfer to her by richard from the presumption of invalidity raised by section regardless of the date of transfer.elizabeth opposed the demurrer,challenging the validity of the remarriage,and arguing that transfers made by richard before the remarriage come under section.her theory was that jennifer status as care custodian beginning in renders her ineligible to receive transfers under section and that the marriage does not cancel out her care custodian status.
the court rejected jennifer expansive reading of section,subdivision a the court read of the statute is not as expansive.the statute centers on a transferor and a transferee and whether they are related by marriage.the legislature use of the language suggests that the relevant inquiry is the nature of the parties relationship at the time of the transfer.the court found support for this interpretation in section,subdivisions b and c and concluded there is nothing in the statute that suggests that a transfer might be subject to an exemption.in fact,subdivision d suggests that an otherwise prohibited transfer may be exempted later only upon a showing that the transfer was not the result of fraud,menace,duress,or undue influence.
elizabeth interpretation of section also was rejected.the trial court distinguished the cases on which she relied because none involved a formal legal relationship like marriage.in this case,the probate court concluded that the formally recognized marriage between richard and jennifer on june,created a bright line unlike the circumstances in the cases cited by elizabeth.it ruled that this bright line provides a division for transfers made before and after that time.elizabeth annulment action is pending.absent success in that action,transfers to jennifer from richard occurring after june,are exempt from attack under probate code section.transfers occurring prior to june,are not.
the demurrer to the fifth and sixth causes of action was sustained to the extent that they alleged transfers to jennifer after her remarriage to richard.elizabeth was given leave to amend at the conclusion of the annulment action and to amend the cause of action to allege only transfers occurring prior to the remarriage.
elizabeth elected not to amend her petition.jennifer applied for entry of an order of dismissal with prejudice,which elizabeth opposed.the probate court granted jennifer application and dismissed the action.elizabeth filed a timely appeal.

elizabeth chose not to amend her complaint after the trial court sustained jennifer demurrer with leave to amend as to premarital gifts.it is the rule that when a plaintiff is given the opportunity to amend his complaint and elects not to do so,strict construction of the complaint is required and it must be presumed that the plaintiff has stated as strong a case as he can.citations.reynolds bement cal th,d.we treat the demurrer as admitting all material facts properly pleaded,but not contentions,deductions or conclusions of fact or law.citation.we also consider matters which may be judicially noticed.citation.further,we give the complaint a reasonable interpretation,reading it as a whole and its parts in their context.citation.when a demurrer is sustained,we determine whether the complaint states facts sufficient to constitute a cause of action.citation.zelig county of los angeles cal th,d.questions of statutory interpretation are subject to de novo review.elsenheimer elsenheimer th,d.
jennifer argues that elizabeth has forfeited her argument because she did not amend her petition to apply to gifts by richard between their first and second marriages and because she failed to present argument as to those gifts.we agree.see estate of felder th,d failure to raise argument on appeal results in waiver of issue.
