order modifying opinion and denying petition for rehearing no change in judgment 
it is ordered that the opinion filed herein on april,be modified as follows 
on page,in the case title,the name jackie stennett is changed to jackie 
on page,in the first paragraph,second sentence change the name jackie stennett to jackie 
on page,in the first full paragraph,line,delete the name stennett and in its place insert 
at the end of the last paragraph on page,after the citation ending with apfel,supra,at.add as footnote the following footnote 
on petition for rehearing,jackie notes,inter alia,that we did not discuss the case of arizmendi system leasing d.that is true,for at least one good reason.arizmendi was not cited by any party to this appeal,nor by amici.under a former version of the wrongful death statute,arizmendi held that a nonmarital child has standing to sue for the wrongful death of a parent,despite not qualifying as an heir under former law,because to hold otherwise would deny the child equal protection of the law under the fourteenth amendment to the united states constitution.id.at.the arizmendi court relied on the decision of the united states supreme court in levy louisiana,which held that a louisiana statute,as interpreted by its highest court,denied equal protection of the law to nonmarital children by denying them standing to bring an action for the wrongful death of their biological parent.in lalli,supra,at,footnote,the high court distinguished levy,stating the presence in this case of the state interest in the orderly disposition of a decedent property at death distinguishes it from others in which that justification for an classification was absent,citing,inter alia,the levy decision.thus,the question becomes whether the california statute governing standing to sue for wrongful death code civ,interpreted by the courts as being governed by the intestacy laws,survives an equal protection challenge under the rationale of levy and arizmendi.see,cheyanna,supra,th at standing to bring a wrongful death action remains linked to the intestacy laws.lalli suggests the equal protection analyses of the wrongful death statute and the intestacy statute differs because the state interest in maintaining disparate treatment of marital and nonmarital children differs under each statute.
in her petition for rehearing jackie attempts to shoehorn the arizmendi levy equal protection analysis into this case by asserting this is a wrongful death case.but this is not a wrongful death case.this appeal was taken from competing petitions in the probate court for letters of administration and to determine heirship.accordingly,our opinion deals only with the heirship question.whether the wrongful death statute,as interpreted by the courts,survives an equal protection challenge by a nonmarital child has not been litigated in this case,either in the trial court or here,and we express no opinion on the issue.the equal protection issue under the wrongful death statute is more appropriately litigated in a suit for the wrongful death of amine.
the petition for rehearing is denied.
the modification does not change the judgment.

amine britel died intestate in.appellant jackie stennett,the mother of,a child born out of wedlock,petitioned to administer amine estate and for to be declared amine heir under probate code section,subdivision b section b under section b,a nonmarital child may establish that he or she is the natural child of an intestate decedent by proving the decedent openly held out the child as his own.
the court denied jackie petitions.it granted the petition of respondent mouna britel amine adult sister to administer amine estate,which petition listed respondent rhita bhitel amine mother as amine surviving parent.
we affirm the court order.in doing so,we conclude section b phrase,openly held out,requires the alleged father to have made an unconcealed affirmative representation of his paternity in open view.we also conclude substantial evidence supports the court finding amine did not openly hold out as his child.finally,we conclude section b does not violate the state or federal equal protection rights of nonmarital children or of nonmarital children who can prove paternity using dna tests.
evidence prior to birth 
in the fall of,amine and jackie met at harvard business school and developed a romantic relationship.in the early summer of,they graduated.jackie went to work in atlanta,georgia,while amine moved to newport beach,california.
in august,jackie phoned amine and told him she was pregnant.the next day,amine sent jackie an message saying he was devastated,he would never be able to share the news with his parents,and that having a child out of wedlock was contrary to his muslim religion and his culture and would bring him a total shame he would have to bear for the rest of his life.amine continued please understand that i do love you but i am just not ready to be a father right now.i want us to have a child through a legitimate marriage and not outside of wedlock.we need to live together,learn about each other,and then make a committment sic for life.i perceive marriage as a very serious engagement.i was devastated for the past two years as a result of a bad marriage.in all fairness,i believe i should be a part of this decision.it is important for us to meet to discuss this issue as soon as possible and find a suitable arrangement for both of us.
later that month or possibly in early september,jackie visited amine in california for three or four days.she had initially planned to stay around a week,but the trip was cut short and she returned to atlanta.within the next few days,amine and jackie spoke by phone between five to times.the end result was that amine told jackie not to contact him again and that he did not want her or the baby to be in touch with him or his family.
amine told his best friend,youssef choukri,that jackie said she was pregnant with his baby,and that his having a child out of wedlock would bring shame to his family who were highly regarded in morocco and might possibly cause amine to be disinherited.amine initially told choukri he was not sure whether jackie was really pregnant,but that he had told jackie that if she was indeed pregnant,he would like her to have an abortion.
in late or early,amine told choukri that jackie had had an abortion.amine and choukri never discussed the matter again.
at trial,jackie testified she never told amine she had had an abortion.
evidence after birth 
was born to jackie in february.amine is not listed as the father on birth certificate.prior to amine death,jackie never sought a paternity order to determine whether amine was father.amine never provided any financial support to,never met her,and never communicated with her.
for many years,jackie comported with amine request that she not contact him.then,in november,jackie sent amine an message,which stated in part,per your last request i have kept my distance from you for the past six years.jackie message informed amine that wanted a relationship with him.
amine did not respond to jackie message,so jackie phoned him.in the phone call,jackie told amine that asked about him and wanted him in her life.amine was terse and cold,asked jackie not to phone him again,and made it clear he wanted nothing to do with jackie or.this phone call and jackie message were the only communications between jackie and amine from the time was born until amine death.
amine was close with his family members,but never told them he had a child.
in february,amine was years old,and a world class bicyclist.he was riding his bicycle in broad daylight,when he was struck and killed by a drunk,texting driver.at the time of his death,amine was not married and had no domestic partner.he died intestate.
jackie never sought a paternity order while amine was alive because she wanted him to participate when he was ready and by his own choice,and she did not want to force his hand.
over respondents objection,the court admitted into evidence a dna test showing a percent probability that amine was father.
the court ruling 
the court found jackie testimony was not convincing and that choukri was a credible witness.the court ruled the evidence submitted on the question of whether amine britel held out as his own child was disputed.after consideration and weighing of all testimony and evidence,and the demeanor and credibility of the witnesses,the court finds that jackie stennett did not carry her burden of establishing by clear and convincing evidence that amine britel openly held out as his own child in accordance with section b.the evidence presented to suggest that amine britel held out as his own child is thin,at best 
in reaching its ruling,the court struggled with the statement in estate of burden that section b phrase,openly held out,is synonymous with acknowledge estate of burden th,burden and that acknowledge means to concede to be real or true or admit id.at.the court stated i f it was for the burden case,the court would be looking at the words of the statute itself,whether amine britel openly held out as his own.and the answer to that would be a clear no ultimately,the court concluded amine had not openly held out as his own child.
the court denied jackie petitions for determination of heirship and for letters of administration,and granted mouna petition for letters of administration.by doing so,the court ruled that amine mother rhita is his sole heir.
discussion 
amine did not openly hold out a s his child 
relying on burden,supra,th,jackie contends amine openly held out as his daughter within the meaning of section b and therefore the court erred by denying her petition for to be determined amine natural child and sole heir.
intestate succession is governed entirely by statute.blaylock et,cal.probate practice a.the heirs of a person are those whom the law appoints to succeed at the decedent death to his or her estate in case of intestacy,by virtue of the statutes of succession.witkin,summary of cal.law ed.wills and probate.
section et governs intestate succession.as relevant here,if there is no surviving spouse or domestic partner of an intestate decedent,the intestate estate passes to the decedent issue,subd.a,or if there is no surviving issue,to the decedent parent or parents,subd.b.issue of a person means all his or her lineal descendants of all generations,with the relationship of parent and child at each generation being determined by the definitions of child and parent.
section et chapter of part of division of the probate code chapter governs the relationship of parent and child.under section,for the purpose of determining intestate succession,the relationship of parent and child exists between a person and the person natural parents,regardless of the marital status of the natural parents,subd.a,and between an adopted person and the person adopting parents,subd.b.
jackie contends biological parents are,by definition,natural parents within the meaning of section,subdivision a.not so.section is expressly s ubject to the provisions of chapter.section,also contained in chapter,governs whether a person is a natural parent as that term is used in this chapter.
at issue here is subdivision b of section.under section b,a natural parent and child relationship may be established when p aternity is established by clear and convincing evidence that the father has openly held out the child as his own.
thus,we must determine whether jackie established by clear and convincing evidence under section b that amine openly held out as his own child.to resolve this issue,we independently construe section b phrase,openly held out the child as his own.estate of joseph cal th,burden,supra,th at.we then review for substantial evidence the court finding jackie failed to prove by clear and convincing evidence that amine openly held out as his own child.estate of joseph,at see burden,at.
section b phrase,openly held out,requires an unconcealed affirmative representation of paternity in open view 
jackie contends no public statement or public display is required to satisfy section b openly held out standard.in her view,the lone requirement is that the father acknowledge the fact of fatherhood to someone at some time regardless of whether the father remains silent as to that status with respect to others including family members.she contends amine satisfied this requirement by,at some point during jackie pregnancy,expressing an acceptance of paternity even a grudging one to jackie or choukri,or failing to deny to jackie or choukri that he was the father.
jackie relies on burden statement that section b phrase openly held out is synonymous with acknowledge d burden,supra,th at,and that acknowledge means to show by word or act that one has knowledge of and agrees to a fact or truth or admits or concedes it to be true id.at.thus,jackie contends amine openly held out to be his child when he privately conceded during the pregnancy that he fathered her unborn child.
respondents counter that a private acknowledgement of paternity does not satisfy the openly held out standard.
under the rules of statutory construction,a statute plain meaning controls unless its words are ambiguous.imperial merchant services,hunt cal th.we give the statute words their usual and ordinary meaning.id.at.if possible,we give significance to every word.burden,supra,th at.only if the statutory language is ambiguous may we consider other aids,such as the statute purpose,legislative history,and public policy.imperial,at.
accordingly,we consider the usual and ordinary meaning of each term in section b phrase openly held out.the adverb,openly,has several dictionary definitions that might apply here freely and without concealment webster new internat.dict,without concealment,deception,or prevarication,esp.where these might be expected new oxford american dict.ed,and frankly or honestly ibid.another dictionary,while not containing a separate definition for the adverb openly,defines the adjective open in this context as completely free from concealment and exposed to general view or knowledge.merriam webster collegiate dict.ed.
two of the three dictionaries mentioned above contain a definition in this context of the verb hold out to make out to be represent webster new internat,supra,and to present as something realizable proffer or to represent to be merriam webster collegiate,supra.
consistent throughout these dictionary definitions is the notion of an affirmative representation being made in an unconcealed manner,not a mere acknowledgment of paternity nor an admission of parentage inferred from a failure to deny.but the ambiguity debated by the parties remains.an unconcealed affirmative representation could include a representation made frankly or honestly to a single person,even if done secretly and in private,if we adopt the new oxford american dictionary alternative definition of openly.on the other hand,an unconcealed affirmative representation could be construed to require a public representation,one that is done in open view new oxford american,supra,or exposed to general view merriam webster collegiate,supra.
under the rules of statutory construction,we may resolve this ambiguity by interpreting section b to effectuate the statute purpose.burden,supra,th at.the purposes of the intestacy succession statutes are to carry out the decedent likely intent at the time of death as to the distribution of his or her estate,and to do so in an efficient and expeditious manner.estate of joseph,supra,cal th at burden,at.for the reasons discussed below,these purposes are best served by construing openly held out to require an unconcealed affirmative representation of paternity in open view.
such a construction serves a principal goal of intestacy law.pendleton,intestate inheritance claims determining a child right to inherit when biological and presumptive paternity overlap cardozo.intestacy law strives to effectuate the decedent likely intent in the distribution of his property.a man who represents his paternity in open view is more likely to intend for his estate to pass to the child.i t makes sense that a decedent would intend his estate to pass to a child he actively raised and nurtured within his family.on the other hand,it is less logical to presume that a decedent would intend to pass his estate to a child he may not even have known,simply on account of a biological connection or legal presumption.id.at,fns.omitted.
our construction of openly held out also serves the second goal of intestacy law,to efficiently and expeditiously carry out the decedent probable intent.when an affirmative representation of paternity is made in open view,clear and convincing evidence of it is more likely to exist.this injects a strong dose of certainty into such matters and eliminates,or at least reduces,marginal claims.estate of joseph,supra,cal th at.conversely,if a secret acknowledgment were sufficient such that the decedent family members,friends,or estate administrator were unaware of the putative child existence no timely notice of the probate proceedings would be given to the potential heir.lalli lalli,lalli.this could cause disruptions in the probate proceedings,such as delaying inheritance and finality in estate administration.ibid.
we conclude section b requires an affirmative representation of paternity that is unconcealed and made in open view.but although the representation must be a public one,in the sense of being made in open view,the statute does not require an announcement to the world,an official action,or an affectionate fatherly intent.
each case depends upon its own circumstances as to whether an affirmative representation was unconcealed and made in open view.see estate of baird cal,baird.baird,although it interpreted an adoption statute provides some potentially useful general guidelines while it is not required in order to constitute public acknowledgment that the father declare his paternity under all circumstances,it would be opposed to the idea of public acknowledgment if he deliberately refrained from declaring his paternity when the occasion would naturally demand it or misrepresented the fact,or remained silent when he would reasonably be expected to announce he was the father of the child,as,for instance,in the case of immediate relatives.id.at.nor does a person publicly acknowledge a child by revealing the child existence to persons who are not likely to make public what the decedent had said to them on such a subject,but rather to accept it as a matter of confidence,to be kept secret.id.at.
to the extent burden holds that a private acknowledgment of paternity is synonymous with openly holding out the child as one own,we disagree 
burden the case on which jackie relies states that section b phrase openly held out is synonymous with acknowledge d,admitted or conceded.burden,supra,th at,id.at.if the burden court intended by this statement to hold that a private admission of paternity without more is sufficient to satisfy the openly held out requirement,we respectfully disagree.arguably,the statement is dictum,and the burden court did not mean to hold that a private acknowledgment is sufficient,since the court recognized the decedent there did more than privately acknowledge the nonmarital son.id.at.indeed,the father in burden affirmed his paternity in open view on a number of occasions to a number of people,both orally and in writing id.at,including his sister and the nonmarital son id.at.as a result,the relationship was e veryone in the family knew that the nonmarital son was the alleged father son id.at,and the son had a close relationship with the alleged father mother and siblings id.at.
although we are uncertain whether the burden court statement was intended to equate a private admission of paternity with the openly held out requirement of section b,jackie has certainly interpreted it that way.accordingly,to the extent the burden court held that a private admission of paternity is sufficient to satisfy the openly held out standard,we now explain the reasons for our disagreement.in doing so,we assume for purposes of our discussion that the burden court did hold that a private admission of paternity was sufficient.
because burden was a case of first impression in construing the openly held out standard of section b burden,supra,th at,the appellate court looked for guidance to cases interpreting other statutes.the court turned first to family code section,subdivision d family code section d,which establishes a rebuttable presumption of parentage under the uniform parentage act for a person who receives a child into his or her home and openly holds out the child as his or her natural child.unfortunately,in our view,the burden court erroneously concluded that n umerous appellate opinions have interpreted family code section d use of the term acknowledge as a synonym for openly holds out.burden,at.we find two flaws with this analysis.
first,family code section d does not use the term acknowledge.instead,it uses the phrase openly holds out.
second,three of the six cases cited by burden specify that family code section d requires a public acknowledgment.in re salvador th,openly and publicly acknowledged paternity in re julia th,public acknowledgment of paternity in re spencer th,openly and publicly admit paternity see also gabriel suedi th,publicly acknowledging paternity and receiving the child into his home.in a fourth case,the father was present at the child birth,was listed on the birth certificate,and was represented by the mother to the world as the father.brian ginger,supra,th at.brian concluded the family code section d presumption of paternity was the product of one year living with the child followed up with visitation after the relationship with the mother ended.ibid.brian did not address whether a private admission of paternity satisfied the openly held out standard.ibid.a fifth case briefly mentions receiving and acknowledging as a shorthand description of family code section d language in a footnote.dawn superior court cal th,fn.dawn does not address whether a private admission of paternity satisfies the openly held out standard.the last case uses the word acknowledged as a synonym for openly held out in holding that family code section d did not have any reasonable application to surrogacy cases.in re marriage of moschetta th.moschetta does not address whether a private admission of paternity is sufficient.
burden also based its statutory construction on section,which governs the less common situation where a parent seeks to inherit from a predeceased child.under section,as then in effect,a natural parent could not inherit from a nonmarital child unless the parent had acknowledged the child and contributed to the child support or care.burden,supra,th at.but section demonstrates the legislature uses the word acknowledge with no adverbs when appropriate.
finally,burden noted that,prior to,the predecessor to section b required the father to openly and notoriously hold out the child as his own.burden,supra,th at.but by deleting notoriously,the legislature simply discarded an outdated,pejorative adverb for having a child out of wedlock.see,webster new internat,supra,defining notorious,inter alia,as widely and unfavorably known or discussed for something reprehensible or scandalous or for some negative quality or trait.
in the absence of a court decree or enforceable contract,a decedent estate is not generally liable for the support of a minor 
in her opening brief on appeal,jackie briefly suggests that the law governing child support should apply to a nonmarital child inheritance.she urged the same contention even more forcefully at oral argument.she suggests a man who impregnates a woman can not evade his obligation to support his child simply because he is not ready to be a father or he believes that having a child would embarrass his family.the same rule should prevail with respect to intestacy.
but the law of intestacy is distinct from child support law,as revealed by an examination of the relevant history and purposes of intestate succession law.at common law the court had no power to direct the payment of money out of the estate of a deceased person for the support and education of his family,to the exclusion of his creditors or heirs at law.such power to do so as the court now has comes entirely from statute.in re estate of mcswain cal,see jacobs gerecht d affirming trial court sustaining of demurrer to complaint alleging common law claim for child support against decedent father estate.the only statutory provisions for support of a minor child by a decedent estate are found in section,subdivision a,providing for a family allowance during administration of the probate estate and family code section,providing that where a parent chargeable with the support of a child dies leaving the child chargeable to the county,the county may claim provision for the child support from the parent estate.
in contrast,it has long been the rule that the obligation of a father to support his minor child which is fixed by divorce decree or property settlement agreement,does not cease upon the father death,but survives as a charge against his estate.taylor george cal d.in other words,claims for child support based upon divorce decrees or property settlement agreements may be enforced against the estate as ordinary creditor claims under section et.
just as divorce decrees and settlement agreements can create child support obligations,paternity suits brought during a father lifetime under family code section enforce his duty to support his children.establishing paternity is the first step toward a child support award,which,in turn,provides children with equal rights and access to benefits,including,but not limited to,social security,health insurance,survivors benefits,military benefits,and inheritance rights,subd.a.furthermore,in paternity actions,family code section establishes a rebuttable presumption of paternity based on dna tests.
consequently,during a man lifetime,he can be mandated by court order or by contractual agreement to provide for his child support,regardless of the father personal preferences.and,if the father dies during the child minority,his support obligation continues as a claim against his estate.taylor george,supra,cal d at.
but once a man dies,the laws of testate and intestate succession focus on his intent or his likely intent if he died intestate in the distribution of his estate.the emphasis at that stage is on the decedent property rights.the goal of carrying out the presumed intent of most decedents follows from the concept of private property,a concept at the heart of american property law.connected to the idea that individuals can own and control property,separate and apart from ownership by the family unit or other social unit,is the idea that an individual property owner should be able to control the disposition of the property at his or her death.gary,adapting intestacy laws to changing families law ineq,gary.
we recognize this emphasis on property rights represents a policy choice,but the choice is within the legislature purview and is consistent with tradition.intestacy statutes have,since the first adoption of such statutes in this country,given a decedent property to those family members closest to the decedent.gary,supra,law ineq.at.persons can opt out of the intestacy statute either by executing a will or by holding title to property in a manner that provides for the transfer of title at death by means other than the probate system.id.at,fn.omitted.since each person is constitutionally free to dispose of his property in an unfettered manner,it can not be said that statutes reflecting the probable intent of individuals are unreasonable.estate of ginochio d.
as respondents point out,the issue here is not whether amine had an obligation under the family code to support while he was alive.jackie chose to wait for amine to become ready to be father.she never brought a paternity action.her decision carried the risk that amine could die intestate while she waited for him to grow into fatherhood.conversely,had she brought a paternity suit,amine might have chosen to write a will excluding 
substantial evidence supports the court finding jackie failed to show amine openly held out as his child 
jackie argues undisputed evidence showed amine acknowledged paternity in his email to jackie and his statements to his best friend.as a threshold matter,respondents contend amine actions prior to birth are irrelevant to this issue under cheyanna,supra,th.cheyanna held the term child,as used in section b,does not include an unborn child,and therefore it is impossible for a man to hold out a fetus as his child.id.at.jackie counters that cheyanna holding does not apply here.we need not resolve this issue because substantial evidence supports the court finding,even taking into account the prebirth evidence.
substantial evidence shows amine never made an unconcealed affirmative representation of his paternity in open view.prior to birth,amine made it clear,in a private message to jackie,that he could never tell his parents about the pregnancy in other words,that he would conceal it from them.the court found amine maintained a close,open and loving relationship with his family.yet,he never told them about the pregnancy or,later,the child.he told his best friend choukri that jackie had had an abortion,and never mentioned the matter again to choukri.there is no evidence that after birth,amine acknowledged paternity in any way.indeed,in late,less than four and years before his death,amine told jackie not to contact him again and that he wanted nothing to do with her or.in sum,substantial evidence supports the court finding amine did not openly hold out as his child.
ii.section does not violate the state or federal equal protection clauses 
jackie contends that even if the court correctly interpreted and applied section,the statutory scheme violates the equal protection rights of nonmarital children because marital children enjoy a rebuttable presumption of a natural relationship under section,subdivision a.amici argue the statutory scheme violates the equal protection rights of nonmarital children who can prove paternity using dna tests.
whether a statutory classification is unconstitutional depends upon the character of the discrimination and its relation to legitimate legislative aims.mathews lucas.the united states supreme court has generally applied an intermediate level of scrutiny to discriminatory classifications based on illegitimacy.clark jeter,clark astrue capato.to withstand intermediate scrutiny,a statutory classification must be substantially related to an important governmental objective.clark,at,italics added.the supreme court has explained why strict scrutiny does not apply p erhaps in part because the roots of the discrimination rest in the conduct of the parents rather than the child,and perhaps in part because illegitimacy does not carry an obvious badge,as race or sex do,the discrimination against illegitimates has never approached the severity or pervasiveness of the historic legal and political discrimination against women and african americans.mathews,at.although illegitimacy is analogous in many respects to the personal characteristics that have been held to be suspect when used as the basis of statutory differentiations,the supreme court has concluded that the analogy is not sufficient to require our most exacting scrutiny.trimble gordon,trimble.
jackie contends the modern day accuracy of dna tests compels the conclusion that section violates the equal protection rights of nonmarital children.she argues dna proof of paternity eliminates the risk of fraudulent claims and therefore section no longer serves that state interest.even if that were true,however,section effectuates the state important interests in carrying out an intestate decedent likely intent and in doing so efficiently.
jackie relies on clark,supra,and mills habluetzel,both of which involved statutes of limitation for paternity actions,not intestate succession statutes.the state interests implicated in clark and mills differ from the legislative purposes underlying intestacy succession laws.paternity actions enforce the state interest in ensuring that genuine claims for child support are satisfied clark,at and that a child may have a relationship with his or her father county of shasta caruthers th.california intestate succession laws,in contrast,further the state interest in carrying out the likely intent of a decedent,at the time of death,in the distribution of his or her estate.as recognized by the united states supreme court,state intestacy laws embody the popular view within the jurisdiction of how a parent would have his property devolve among his children in the event of death mathews lucas,supra,at.
jackie also relies on lalli,supra,which involved intestate succession.lalli identified another state interest underlying laws limiting the right of nonmarital children to inherit from putative fathers who die intestate unless reasonable restrictions are imposed,such inheritance can significantly disrupt the administration of estates both intestate and pursuant to a will.id.at.
lalli involved a constitutional challenge to a new york statute that allowed a nonmarital child to inherit from an intestate father only if a court had issued a paternity decree during the father lifetime.lalli,supra,at.drafted by a state commission of experts in the practical problems of estate administration id.at,the statute was intended to soften the rigors of previous law which permitted illegitimate children to inherit only from their mothers id.at.although the overarching purpose of the proposed statute was to alleviate the plight of the illegitimate child,the commission considered it necessary to impose the strictures of the challenged statutory provision in order to mitigate serious difficulties in the administration of the estates of both testate and intestate decedents.id.at.the commission recognized that a putative father often goes his way unconscious of the birth of a child.id.at.the commission identified serious problems which would arise in both intestacy and will probate proceedings if nonmarital children were unconditionally entitled to notice and an opportunity to be heard.for example,h ow does one cite and serve an illegitimate of whose existence neither family nor personal representative may be aware and of greatest concern,how does one achieve finality of decree in any estate when there always exists the possibility however remote of a secret illegitimate lurking in the buried past of a parent or an ancestor of a class of beneficiaries id.at.
in lalli,a divided supreme court held the statute was substantially related to the important state interests the statute is intended to promote and therefore found no violation of the equal protection clause.lalli,supra,at plur.opn.of powell.justice powell plurality opinion observed that the statute was intended to ensure the accurate resolution of claims of paternity,to minimize the potential for disruption of estate administration,and to permit a man to defend his reputation against unjust paternity claims.id.at.the plurality held the statute bore a substantial relationship to those purposes the administration of an estate will be facilitated,and the possibility of delay and uncertainty minimized,where the entitlement of an illegitimate child to notice and participation is a matter of judicial record before the administration commences.id.at.
lalli recognized that in some cases,unfairness would result we do not question that there will be some illegitimate children who would be able to establish their relationship to their deceased fathers without serious disruption of the administration of estates and that,as applied to such individuals,the statute appears to operate unfairly.but few statutory classifications are entirely free from the criticism that they sometimes produce inequitable results.our inquiry under the equal protection clause does not focus on the abstract fairness of a state law,but on whether the statute relation to the state interests it is intended to promote is so tenuous that it lacks the rationality contemplated by the fourteenth amendment.lalli,supra,at.
here,section,subdivision b,under which a paternity decree entered during the father lifetime creates a natural relationship for purposes of intestate succession,is similar to and more generous than the new york statute upheld in lalli section provides two additional methods by which paternity can be established,pursuant to section b openly held out standard and section,subdivision b impossibility provision.thus,lalli upheld the constitutionality of a new york statute that was similar to,but even more restrictive than,section.campbell ex rel.campbell apfel cir.
as lalli recognized,the states have an interest of considerable magnitude in the just and orderly disposition of property at death.lalli,supra,at.section b openly held out standard promotes the purpose of minimizing disruption of estate administration if a putative father has openly held out a child as his own,the child is less likely to be a secret or unknown illegitmate with concomitant concerns of identification and finality discussed in lalli,supra,at page.equally important,section b carries out the decedent likely intent at the time of death as to the distribution of his estate.because section b is substantially related to these important state interests,it does not violate the federal or state constitutions.estate of sanders,supra,th at estate of ginochio,supra,d at rejecting equal protection challenge under state and federal constitutions to former,under which nonmarital child was heir of mother and of person who,in writing,acknowledged himself to be the father campbell ex rel.campbell apfel,supra,at.

the order is affirmed.respondents shall recover their costs on appeal.
aronson,acting

i have concurred in the majority opinion because its analyses of probate code section,subdivision b,and the constitutional questions presented are correct.under the facts of this case,a natural parent and child relationship can not be established under that statute as between amine britel and because no court order declaring paternity was entered during amine lifetime,amine did not openly hold out as his own child,and it was not impossible for amine to have held out as his own child.under the authorities cited in the majority opinion,the statute is constitutional.
i write separately to invite the legislature to revisit probate code section,subdivision b,in light of the current state of dna science and the societal interest in protecting children.specifically,i urge the legislature to add to the list of conditions for proving the existence of a natural parent and child relationship that paternity may be established by dna evidence if the father,during his lifetime,acknowledged fathering the child,regardless of whether he publicly or openly held out the child as his own.
in this case,it is without question that amine is the father of.the dna test performed pursuant to court order found a percent probability that amine was father.the statute as it currently stands does not address significant advances in genetic testing that have occurred since the statute was last substantively amended.this court may not,however,read into the statute an additional means for determining paternity in intestate succession cases.the contention that scientific advances in genetic testing have rendered this construction of the statute obsolete by removing the uncertainty of proof that justified the restrictive nature of the statute is more appropriately addressed to the legislature.witkin,summary of cal.law ed.wills and probate,citing estate of sanders th.
