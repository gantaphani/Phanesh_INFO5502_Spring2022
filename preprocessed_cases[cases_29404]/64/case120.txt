certification from the united states court of appeals for the eleventh circuit to the supreme court of florida,pursuant to.app.a.to the supreme court of florida and its honorable justices 
this case involves the interpretation of florida statutes section,application of that statute in federal bankruptcy proceedings,and,potentially,the constitutionality of retroactively applying an amendment to that statute.because resolution of issues of florida state law may preclude the need to reach federal constitutional issues,we grant the appellants motion to certify the state law questions to the florida supreme court.neumont florida,cir.
the facts are undisputed.in,robert raborn and his wife,lenore raborn settlors or grantors,attempted to establish a trust for their children,douglas,robin,and richard beneficiaries.the corpus of the trust was the raborn family horse farm.on january,the settlors executed two documents.the first document,entitled raborn farm trust agreement trust agreement,named and raborn as settlors douglas raborn as trustee and douglas,robin,and richard as beneficiaries of the trust.the trust agreement also set forth the specific terms and purposes of the trust,including the broad powers of douglas raborn as trustee to deal with trust property.before the current dispute arose,the trust agreement was not recorded in the public records.
the second document,entitled conveyance deed to trustee under trust agreement deed,was recorded in the palm beach county real estate records on february.the dispute in this case concerns the meaning and effect of this document.the deed names and raborn as settlors under the raborn farm trust agreement dated january,and conveys the farm to douglas raborn,as trustee under the raborn farm trust agreement dated january.according to the deed,the trustee is to have and to hold the said real estate with the appurtenances upon the trust and for the uses and purposes herein and in said trust agreement set forth.the deed repeatedly refers to the trust agreement and acknowledges the trustee broad powers to deal with the property.the settlors signed the deed and swore before a notary public that they executed said instrument for the purposes therein expressed.
on august,douglas raborn filed for chapter bankruptcy.the bankruptcy trustee filed an adversary proceeding against the beneficiaries of the trust,alleging that the farm was part of the bankruptcy estate.the bankruptcy trustee argued that,under florida statutes section,the deed actually conveyed fee simple title to douglas individually,rather than conveying mere legal title to douglas in his capacity as trustee of the trust.florida statutes section,as it existed in and at the time of the bankruptcy filing,provided that 
e very deed or conveyance of real estate heretofore or hereafter made or executed in which the words trustee or as trustee are added to the name of the grantee,and in which no beneficiaries are named nor the nature and purposes of the trust,if any,are set forth,shall grant and is hereby declared to have granted a fee simple estate with full power and authority in and to the grantee in such deed to sell,convey and grant and encumber both the legal and beneficial interest in the real estate conveyed,unless a contrary intention shall appear in the deed or conveyance provided,that there shall not appear of record among the public records of the county in which the real property is situate at the time of recording of such deed or conveyance,a declaration of trust by the grantee so described declaring the purposes of such trust,if any,declaring that the real estate is held other than for the benefit of the grantee.
stat.in essence,the statute specifies that a conveyance of property that merely adds the words trustee or as trustee to the grantee name is a conveyance of fee simple title and no conveyance in trust unless one of four conditions is met the deed names the beneficiaries the deed sets forth the nature and purposes of the trust a contrary intention appears on the face of the deed or the trust itself is recorded.
determining that the property was conveyed to douglas in his capacity as trustee of the trust,the bankruptcy court concluded that the farm was not part of the bankruptcy estate and dismissed the bankruptcy trustee complaint for failure to state a claim.on appeal,the district court reversed the bankruptcy court raborn i.the district court determined that the deed did not meet the statutory conditions that would have made the deed a conveyance in trust and that,therefore,the deed conveyed fee simple title to douglas in his individual capacity rather than conveying mere legal title to douglas as trustee we then dismissed the beneficiaries appeal to this court because the bankruptcy court had not issued a final order.on remand,the bankruptcy court followed the district court earlier order and granted the bankruptcy trustee motion for summary judgment.
in,the florida legislature,however,added an amendment to section.responding to raborn i and a request by the real property,probate and trust section of the florida bar,the legislature amended the statute to add a fifth condition that would cause a conveyance to be in trust language in the deed identifying the trust by either name or date.this bill expressly provided that the amendment was intended to clarify existing law and shall apply retroactively.laws.
on a second appeal from the bankruptcy court,the district court applied the same reasoning as its previous order,affirmed summary judgment for the bankruptcy trustee,and denied equitable relief for the beneficiaries raborn ii the district court determined that the conveyance deed does not on its face otherwise reflect a contrary intention of the grantors to convey the property in trust.the district court also concluded that the bankruptcy trustee rights to the property had vested when the bankruptcy was filed in and that retroactive application of the statutory amendment would be unconstitutional.this appeal followed.
the beneficiaries contend that,even under the unamended version of section,the deed validly conveyed the farm in trust to douglas raborn as trustee because the deed refers to the nature and purposes of the trust and the deed language clearly demonstrates the intention of the settlors to convey the farm in trust to douglas raborn as trustee under the trust agreement the beneficiaries also contend that the amendment to section only clarified the statute meaning and can apply retroactively to the deed.in their view,retroactive application of the amendment is constitutional because the bankruptcy trustee had no vested interest in the farm at the time of the amendment,which was before the bankruptcy court final judgment.
the bankruptcy trustee counters that the district court correctly applied the florida statute as it existed before the amendment because the deed merely adds the words as trustee to the name of the grantee does not name the beneficiaries does not set forth the nature and purposes of the trust and does not establish a contrary intention on the part of the grantors.the bankruptcy trustee also argues that the district court properly decided that the statutory amendment did not apply retroactively to the deed because even explicitly retroactive legislation can not be applied retroactively if it impairs vested rights.in addition,pointing to the district court application of a,the bankruptcy trustee argues that her powers give her the rights of a hypothetical bona fide purchaser of the farm from douglas raborn and that,therefore,she can avoid the beneficiaries unrecorded equitable interest in the property even if the property was held in trust.see in re seaway express,cir.
as a preliminary matter,we point out that a bankruptcy trustee rights in the debtor property vest when the property becomes part of the bankruptcy estate.the district court correctly stated that the bankruptcy trustee rights vested on august because douglas raborn filed the bankruptcy petition on that date,which constitutes the commencement of the case for purposes of federal bankruptcy law,a.
the central issue in this case,however,is not at what
