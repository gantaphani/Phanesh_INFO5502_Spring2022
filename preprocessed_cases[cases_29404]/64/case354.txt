this action was brought by plaintiff,the northern trust company,as trustee of the caroline haskell trust northern trust,which sought instructions from the trial court on how to distribute the trust principal upon termination of the trust.defendant new england conservatory of music nec and defendant charles eliot filed for summary judgment arising from their mutual claim of the same share of the trust principal known as the lucy smith share.the trial court,finding that eliot was entitled to the entire lucy smith share of the trust principal,granted eliot motion for summary judgment and denied nec motion.on appeal,nec argues that the trial court incorrectly determined when the trust vested.for the following reasons,we affirm the decision of the trial court.
background 
caroline haskell executed a trust indenture on july,and a companion trust indenture on april,that transferred real property to northern trust as trustee.under the terms of the trust,after caroline death,each of named individuals first takers received a specified income interest in the trust until the earlier to occur of the trust termination or the income beneficiary death.specifically,paragraph first provided that lucy smith,caroline sister and one of the first takers,would receive of the income interest for and during her natural life should she survive said party of the first part,and after her death,or after the death of said party of the first part should she survive said lucy smith,and up to the time of the final sale and distribution of the proceeds of said property as hereinafter provided,to the lawful heirs of the said lucy smith,per stirpes.
furthermore,pursuant to paragraph second of the trust,the trust terminated on october,years after the last to die of certain named individuals,which included haskell three first takers,including lucy smith and the children of those three first takers,including lucy smith children,lillian maclennon and lucius waldo smith,paragraph second provided that upon the termination date,the property was to be sold and the proceeds were to be distributed either among the first taker lawful heirs,per stirpes,as to the three first takers named as measuring lives or to the first taker,if living,otherwise to the first taker lawful heirs,per stirpes,as to the first takers not named as measuring lives.the trust specifically provided that of the trust principal was to be distributed among the lawful heirs of the said lucy smith,per stirpes.
caroline died in april,and each of the first takers died before the termination of the trust.lucy smith died in with two lawful heirs lucius waldo smith,and lillian maclennon.lucius died in and bequeathed his entire interest in the trust to his sister,lillian.from until her death in,lillian received the income interest originally paid to lucy smith.
lillian will provided that her husband,norman maclennon,and son,sidney eliot,were each to receive a lifetime interest of the income interest,which nec would receive upon their respective deaths.lillian will also attempted to bequeath her interest in the proceeds of the final sale and distribution of the trust property to nec.
sidney eliot died a widower in.he had one child,charles eliot,who survived him.charles eliot is lucy smith and her only surviving heir.
soon after the trust terminated,northern trust filed this action seeking a determination as to the remainder beneficiaries under the trust.nec and charles eliot each attempted to claim lucy smith share and filed for summary judgment.nec argued that the trust vested at the time of the first taker death and,therefore,lucy smith lawful heirs were determined as of lucy smith death.accordingly,lucius and lillian were entitled to lucy smith share of the net proceeds of the trust estate at the time of the termination of the trust,and lillian could bequeath her share of the trust principal to nec.eliot,however,claimed that vesting was determined at termination of the trust.therefore,eliot,lillian grandson,was entitled to the lucy smith share of the trust principal.
the trial court held that a illinois supreme court case interpreting the trust addressed the question of vesting,while a circuit court decree interpreting the trust addressed the question of who was to receive the income.the decree gave lawful heirs of first takers the right to dispose of the income in any way they wanted but did not give them the right to dispose of the principal.although the court did not believe that the case had a res judicata effect,it found the case to be very instructive.accordingly,lucy smith lawful heirs would be determined for purposes of the principal distribution at the time of the termination of the trust,not at the time of lucy smith death.therefore,the trial court granted eliot motion and found he was entitled to the entire lucy smith share of the trust.
the trial court found that there was no just reason for delaying enforcement of the order granting eliot motion for summary judgment and denying nec motion.this appeal followed.
ii.analysis 
summary judgment is appropriate when the pleadings,depositions,and other evidence reveal that there is no genuine issue of material fact and that the moving party is entitled to judgment as a matter of law.ilcs west.summary judgment is a drastic means of resolving litigation and should only be allowed when the right of the moving party is clear and free from doubt.bier leanna lakeside property ass n,d.an appellate court review of a grant of summary judgment is de novo.woods pence,d.
eliot and nec agree that there is no genuine issue of material fact but disagree as to when the trust vested.nec argues that the decree held that lucy smith lawful heirs were determined as of lucy smith death,while eliot contends that the parties are bound by the case because it determined that the sole interest of the initial heirs was income interest.furthermore,both nec and eliot argue that the plain language of the trust rules of construction support their respective positions.
previous trust constructions 
nec contends that the decree held that lucy smith lawful heirs were determined as of lucy smith death,and the parties are bound by it pursuant to the doctrine of collateral estoppel.conversely,eliot argues that the decree only sets the time at which heirship is determined at each generation,not the time for vesting of the principal interest.instead,eliot contends,the parties are bound by the supreme court case because it determined that the sole interest of the initial heirs was income interest.as such,lillian maclennon could not bequeath an interest in the principal.
supreme court case 
like the trial court,we find the supreme court case to be dispositive.in,the trustee of the haskell trust sought instructions from the circuit court as to whether it should execute a contract accepting increased rent in exchange for allowing the lessee to demolish and replace a building on the land.wallace condict,son of first taker louisa condict,and lucy smith,a first taker,objected to the lease.louisa condict and her son,wallace,like lucy smith and her children,were named as measuring lives in paragraph second.in the northern trust thompson,our supreme court rejected wallace condict and lucy smith objections and found that the contract was in the beneficiaries best interests.the court also stated,
it is not suggested how or in what manner the rights of wallace condict,or of those in his class in their relation to the property,can be adversely affected by the new building under the lease.their right to possession of the lot,and the building on it,is not affected,for no such right is vested in them.their sole right under the terms of the will is in their portion of the income,enhanced by the compromise agreement at condict insistence,though not as much as he demanded.under the terms of the trust,the fee will not pass to any of the present beneficiaries.at the expiration of years after the death of the last survivor of haskell and of her descendants named in the trust instrument,the trustee is directed to sell and convey the leasehold interest and distribute the net proceeds of the sale as directed.it is not contended that security for the income of the ultimate beneficiaries is imperiled by the new building.thompson,at.
we agree with eliot that because lillian,as a fellow initial heir,was in the same class as wallace condict,the supreme court determined that the sole interest of the initial heirs was income interest.
nec argues that the trial court misconstrued the supreme court reference to the fee when it stated that under the terms of the trust,the fee will not pass to any of the present beneficiaries.the trial court held that in this context,the fee was the principal,whether it was in fee simple or cash.nec attempts to limit the supreme court holding by arguing that it must have meant that no beneficiary would ever receive fee title to the underlying real estate.however,it would not make sense for the supreme court to bar condict and those in his class from objecting to the lease if it believed that they were owners of the trust remainder but had no interest in the building.
in this same vein,nec argues that the present beneficiaries of the trust in include initial heirs who could receive trust principal at the termination date because they were not named as measuring lives.therefore,it contends,when the supreme court stated that present beneficiaries would not receive the fee,it must have meant the actual title to the real estate,since the property was to be sold at the termination of the trust and the cash was to be divided and distributed among remainder beneficiaries.we again reject nec strained reading of the opinion even assuming the validity of nec definition of present beneficiaries,the supreme court would not prohibit the owners of a trust corpus from objecting on the basis that the building owned by the trust would be sold at some point.
nec also contends that the trial court erred in relying on the case because it misconstrued the case holding on the merits of the beneficiaries as a holding on their standing.nec cites the following passage from the supreme court opinion 
it is also contended that the bill should have been dismissed for want of necessary parties.all necessary is,all persons having a present interest in the subject matter of the controversy and who would take a distributive share if distribution had been made at the commencement of the parties to the suit.others who would take in the event of those who were parties were represented by them.citation.the trustee represents those having a contingent interest in the trust fund.citations.all present or contingent interests were properly represented and are bound by the decree.thompson,at.
nec contends that these findings state that the present beneficiaries,which included wallace condict,were necessary parties.see village of lansing sundstrom,general rule is that beneficiaries of a trust are necessary parties to an action brought to foreclose their interests.thus,as a necessary party,wallace condict had standing by definition.nec interpretation,however,would go against the supreme court clear statement that condict,and those in his class,only had an interest in the income of the trust and would render it superfluous.
furthermore,according to nec,the only reference to condict allegation on the issue of standing appears in the appellate court opinion,which states that o ther allegations are made,particularly as regards condict interest in the rents and in the trust estate upon a final distribution,the northern trust of chicago thompson,overruled,the northern trust thompson.nec contends that condict claim to of his mother share based on the rule in shelley case was the full extent of the other allegations regarding condict interest in the trust estate upon a final distribution.however,the supreme court,which did not identify who asserted that argument,summarily dispensed with an objection based on the rule in shelley case because there was no real estate to which the rule could apply,since the real estate would be sold at the termination of the trust.thompson,at.it did not link its holding regarding the rule in shelley case with its ruling regarding standing.
eliot argues that nec is bound by the opinion pursuant to the doctrine of collateral estoppel.collateral estoppel is an equitable doctrine of judicial origin created to prevent relitigation of previously adjudicated claims and is founded in principles of judicial economy.ballweg city of springfield.the requirements for the application of collateral estoppel include the following the issue decided in the previous litigation was identical to the one presented in the case in question,there was a final judgment on the merits,and the party against whom estoppel is asserted is a party or in privity with a party from the prior adjudication.ballweg,at.
eliot argues that nec is in privity with the parties in the case because it is a legatee under the will of an initial heir.eliot cites people ex rel.burris progressive land developers,in support of his contention that privity contemplates successive interests in the same property rights that were the subject of prior litigation,and a successor in interest is bound by the judgment of that prior litigation.however,an argument that nec is a successor in interest seems to belie eliot other argument that nec has no interest in the principal of the trust.while the case does not have a collateral estoppel effect,the sound reasoning of the supreme court is accepted.
superior court decree 
on july,the superior court of cook county also interpreted the trust in a decree filed in the northern trust condict.in that case,the superior court held that the first takers only had a life interest in the net rents from the trust property.upon the deaths of the first takers,their respective heirs were vested with an indefeasible equitable interest in the first taker share of net rent,which they could convey by will.condict,slip op.at.while the overwhelming majority of the decree involved the vesting of the income interest under paragraph first of the trust,the court briefly discussed paragraph second.under article xxvi,the court stated that the issue was raised 
as to the persons who will be entitled to take the net proceeds of sale of the trust estate at the time of the termination of the trust under the provisions of paragraph numbered second of said trust indenture of july,in this,whether in the respective gifts to the lawful heirs of lucy smith per stirpes,if such first takers,respectively,be not living at the time of the termination of the trust,the lawful heirs referred to are the lawful heirs of their respective ancestors determined as of the time of the ancestor death,or the lawful heirs of their respective ancestors determined as of the time of the termination of the trust.condict,slip op.at.
the court concluded 
that the lawful heirs referred to of the named ancestors in the provisions of said paragraph numbered second of such trust indenture,providing for the distribution of the net proceeds of sale in shares as there set forth,are and will be,under the proper construction of said trust indenture,the lawful heirs of their respective ancestors as of the respective times of the death of such ancestors.condict,slip op.at.
section m of the decree also repeats the second paragraph verbatim.see condict,slip op.at.nec argues that the decree dictates that lucy smith lawful heirs were determined as of lucy smith death.therefore,lucius and lillian were entitled to bequeath their interest,and eliot had no claim to the principal.
nec admits that the cited portions of the decree are dicta and,therefore,only instructive.furthermore,we find that even if the superior court ruled on when the trust principal vested,such a ruling would be contrary to the supreme court interpretation of the trust.a decision of the illinois supreme court is binding on all trial courts.garcia hynes howes real estate,d.
it is also significant that while the superior court specifically held several times that income interests had vested at the deaths of the first takers,the word vesting does not appear in subsection m,the portion of the decree relating to the principal of the trust.finally,it was impossible for lucius or lillian to
