introduction 
any interested person who wishes to contest a will may bring a contest before the will is admitted to probate,a preprobate contest,in addition,any interested person,other than a party to a will contest and other than a person who had actual notice of a will contest in time to have joined in the contest,may bring a contest after the will is admitted to probate,a postprobate contest,italics added.upon filing either a preprobate or postprobate contest,the contestant must serve a summons on certain statutorily specified persons.a person who receives such a summons may file a demurrer to the contest within days of service of the summons,subd.b.
in this case,lorraine bergeron moss lorraine filed a petition to probate a will of robert clinton moss,the decedent.in her petition,lorraine alleged that she was the decedent spouse and executor of the will.the decedent son,oliver moss oliver,and grandson,barry moss barry,filed preprobate contests.the trial court admitted the will to probate without adjudicating,on the merits or otherwise,the preprobate contests.
barry filed a postprobate contest to the will.barry effectuated personal service of his postprobate contest on lorraine attorney of record in the action,margaret herring.attorney herring subsequently filed a declaration in which she asserted that the time for filing a demurrer had not yet expired because herring was not authorized to accept service of process on lorraine behalf,and barry had failed to serve lorraine personally with a copy of the postprobate contest.lorraine subsequently filed a demurrer to barry postprobate contest,claiming that barry was precluded from bringing a postprobate contest because he had already brought a preprobate contest and because he had actual notice of oliver preprobate contest,among other contentions.without expressly ruling on the timeliness of the demurrer,the trial court sustained lorraine demurrer without leave to amend,ruling that the bar against successive probate contests contained in section precluded barry postprobate contest.
on appeal,barry contends that the trial court erred in implicitly concluding that lorraine demurrer was timely.barry contends that service of process on a party attorney of record in a case is sufficient service of process under code of civil procedure section.courts have interpreted that statute to permit service of process to be made on a person who has ostensible authority to accept service on behalf of a party.warner.records,golden west music sales d,warner.we conclude that barry service of his postprobate contest on lorraine attorney of record in the action constituted proper service of process on lorraine,and that lorraine demurrer was therefore untimely under the applicable statutes.
in the alternative,barry contends that the trial court erred in concluding that section barred his postprobate contest.we conclude that the trial court erred in sustaining lorraine demurrer on the ground that that the bar against successive probate contests contained in section barred barry postprobate contest,because the trial court never adjudicated barry preprobate contest.accordingly,we reverse the court order sustaining the demurrer

lorraine demurrer

discussion 
a.the trial court erred in implicitly ruling that lorraine demurrer was timely 
barry contends that the trial court erred in allowing lorraine demurrer because it was clearly submitted late.
factual and procedural background 
on january,barry filed a petition to revoke probate of the will postprobate contest.barry filed a proof of service indicating that on march,copies of barry postprobate contest were mailed to attorney herring,together with two copies of a notice and acknowledgement of receipt.barry also filed a proof of service indicating that on march,a person named daniel dolezal personally served attorney herring with a summons and a copy of barry postprobate contest.the proof of service states in relevant part,party served margaret herring,on behalf of lorraine bergeron moss.
on may,attorney herring filed a declaration in opposition to barry postprobate contest.in her declaration,attorney herring contended that barry had not properly served his postprobate contest on lorraine.attorney herring further stated 
previously,barry attempted to serve my client,lorraine,by having a process server personally serve me with the summons and petition,the postprobate contest.i specifically informed the process server that i was not authorized to accept service of the summons and petition on behalf of lorraine i have now been authorized to accept service of the summons and petition and am now returning to barry a complete notice and acknowledgement of receipt.the time by which my client has to file a formal response to the summons and petition will be days from today date,which is the date i have signed the notice and acknowledgement of receipt.

governing law 
probate code provisions 
the probate code provides generally that a party may file a demurrer to a postprobate contest within days of the service of the summons pertaining to the petition to revoke.section provides 
a on the filing of the petition to revoke the probate of a will,a summons shall be directed to the personal representative and to the heirs and devisees of the decedent,so far as known to the petitioner.the summons shall contain a direction that the persons summoned file with the court a written pleading in response to the petition within days after service of the summons.failure of a person timely to respond to the summons precludes the person from further participation in the revocation proceeding,but does not otherwise affect the person interest in the estate.
b the summons shall be issued and served with a copy of the petition and proceedings had as in the case of a contest of the will.
c if a person fails timely to respond to the summons 
the case is at issue notwithstanding the failure and the case may proceed on the petition and other documents filed by the time of the hearing,and no further pleadings by other persons are necessary.
the person may not participate further in the contest,but the person interest in the estate is not otherwise affected.
the person is bound by the decision in the proceeding.italics added.
section provides in turn that the summons shall be served pursuant to the rules governing issuance and service of a summons contained in the code of civil procedure 
a when a will is contested under section,the contestant shall file with the court an objection to probate of the will.thereafter,a summons shall be issued and served,with a copy of the objection,on the persons required by section to be served with notice of hearing of a petition for administration of the decedent estate.the summons shall be issued and served as provided in chapter commencing with section and chapter commencing with section of title of part of the code of civil procedure.the summons shall contain a direction that the persons summoned file with the court a written pleading in response to the contest within days after service of the summons.
b a person named as executor in the will is under no duty to defend a contest until the person is appointed personal representative.italics added.
section outlines the time frame within which an interested party may file a demurrer to a will contest,a preprobate contest or a postprobate contest and provides in relevant part 
a the petitioner and any other interested person may jointly or separately answer the objection or demur to the objection within the time prescribed in the summons.
service of a summons pursuant to the code of civil procedure 
the code of civil procedure provides that a party may serve process upon a person by delivering a copy of the summons and of the complaint to such person or to a person authorized by him to receive service of process.code civ,italics added.in summers mcclanahan th,summers the court of appeal reviewed the legislative history of section and stated 
in the california legislature enacted a comprehensive revision of the laws governing service of process.the legislature based this revision on recommendations contained in a report by a joint committee representing the judicial council and the state bar and these recommendations were adopted as the legislative history of the statute.
the summers court noted that the judicial council comment to code of civil procedure section provides if the process is delivered to an agent of defendant,such agent must be one who is authorized by law or by appointment to receive service of process,and the agent of an individual for other purposes is not necessarily authorized to receive such process.summers,supra,th at,citing jud.council of cal.annual to the governor and the legislature,revision of title commencing with section of the code of civil procedure relating to jurisdiction and service of process.
in pasadena medi center associates superior court of los angeles cal d,pasadena,the supreme court concluded that service of process on a person erroneously identified by a corporation in official documents as its secretary and treasurer constituted service on the corporation under code of civil procedure section,subdivision b,which authorizes service by delivering a copy of the summons and complaint to the corporation secretary or treasurer.the pasadena court held that by serving a corporate agent with ostensible authority to receive process,the plaintiff effected valid service upon the defendants.pasadena,supra,at,italics added.
the court in warner,supra,d applied pasadena in holding that service pursuant to code of civil procedure section may be effectuated where a person has ostensible authority to accept service on behalf of the party.warner,supra,at.the plaintiffs in warner sued an attorney leeds and several of leeds clients.id.at.in their complaint,the plaintiffs alleged that attorney leeds had assisted the defendants in pirating recorded performances that plaintiffs owned.id.at.the plaintiffs purported to serve the defendants by personally serving the summons and complaint on attorney leeds.id.at.several of the defendants moved to quash service of the summons,on the ground that attorney leeds was not authorized to receive service on their behalf ibid.the trial court granted the motions to quash,stating that in order for attorney leeds to be such an agent,an agent authorized to accept service,his authorization must be real and actual and can not be inferred or implied.citation.id.at.
on appeal,the warner court held that the trial court requirement of an actual appointment was an incorrect principle,in light of pasadena.warner,supra,d at.the warner court further concluded that an attorney may have a relationship with a party such that service of a summons on the attorney constitutes sufficient service of the party under code of civil procedure section.id.at accord summers,supra,th at the question remains whether service can be upheld on the theory that a close connection between the agent and the party made it highly probable the party would receive actual notice of the service of process on the agent on her behalf.in reaching this conclusion,the warner court discussed the relationship between the attorney and the parties to be served in that case,as follows 
as an attorney retained by defendants,leeds was their agent.citation.the nature of the services performed by leeds for defendants and the necessity for his repeated communication with them in performing those services,made it highly probable that defendants would receive actual notice of the service of process on leeds upon their behalf.this conclusion is strengthened by the fact that the instant action was based,in part,upon the services which leeds rendered for defendants as their agent.therefore,considering the situation from a practical standpoint,service of the summons and complaint on leeds could be valid as to defendants 
defendants point to the rule that an attorney has no power to receive,on behalf of his client,service of the original process by which jurisdiction is acquired,unless the attorney has been specifically authorized by the client to receive service.attorney and client.that rule has no application in view of code of civil procedure section,which does not distinguish between an attorney and other persons who may be,actually or ostensibly,authorized to receive service of process on behalf of the principal.
defendants contend code of civil procedure section does not apply because leeds is an independent contractor,not an employee or an agent.citation.such labels are not determinative in ascertaining the validity of substituted service under code of civil procedure section.citations.the essential factor here is that leeds relationship with the individual defendants may have been sufficiently close and enduring to make it reasonably certain that they would be apprised of the service on leeds upon their behalf.warner,supra,d at.
the warner court remanded the matter for a determination as to whether leeds was in fact the defendants ostensible agent to receive service of process.warner,supra,d at.
application 
pursuant to sections and,lorraine demurrer to barry postprobate contest was due within days after service of the summons,subd.a see demurrer must be filed within the time prescribed in the summons.for the reasons that follow,we conclude that barry service of the summons and postprobate contest on attorney herring on march was effective,and that lorraine response was therefore due no later than april.
it is undisputed that barry served attorney herring with a copy of his postprobate contest on march,and that barry postprobate contest was filed in the very same action in which attorney herring was already representing lorraine applying warner and summers,the relevant inquiry is whether it was reasonably certain and highly probable that attorney herring would inform lorraine of the service of the postprobate contest.we have little doubt that under the circumstances,it was both reasonably certain and highly probable that attorney herring would so inform lorraine.indeed,attorney herring had a statutory duty to apprise her client of significant developments in matters with regard to which attorney herring ha d agreed to provide legal services.bus.and,subd.m.the service of process of barry postprobate contest unquestionably constitutes a significant development in the case.because it was reasonably certain and highly probable that attorney herring would apprise lorraine of the march service of the postprobate contest,we conclude that attorney herring was,as a matter of law,lorraine ostensible agent to receive service of process.warner,supra,d at.
we emphasize the narrowness of our holding.in this case we consider only whether service of process on a party attorney of record is sufficient where the process is issued in the same case as that in which the attorney is already representing the party.compare with warner,supra,d at concluding that party prior relationship with its attorney may be sufficiently close that the attorney could be deemed to be the party ostensible agent for service of process of a new action and zirbes stratton d,court refused to impute knowledge of lawsuit against party for breach of contract where party attorney in separate divorce suit received notice of the breach of contract lawsuit.we also note the unusual procedural context in which this case arises.service of process ordinarily occurs at the outset of a case,before a defendant or her attorney has appeared in the action.in those circumstances,service of process is required to obtain personal jurisdiction over the defendant.see,american express centurion bank zara th.however,thereafter,all subsequent pleadings in the action may be served on the defendant attorney.code civ,see also engebretson harrison d,commentators have suggested that because the court in which the action is pending has jurisdiction over a defendant who has been properly served with summons citation,plaintiff need not obtain an additional summons to serve that defendant when the complaint has been amended citation.it is only in circumstances such as exist in this case,in which a party and her attorney have already appeared in the action,and as to whom new process against that party related to that same action is issued,that our holding has any applicability.in such a case,we conclude that proper service of process on the party attorney of record in that same case is sufficient as a matter of law under code of civil procedure section.
because barry service on attorney herring on march constituted proper service,lorraine response to barry summons and postprobate contest was due no later than april.it is undisputed that lorraine did not file a response until after april.the trial court thus erred in implicitly concluding that lorraine demurrer was timely.in addition,because section,subdivision c provides that if a person fails timely to respond to the summons t he person may not participate further in the contest,we further conclude that the trial court erred in sustaining lorraine untimely demurrer 
accordingly,we reverse the august,order sustaining lorraine demurrer.in light of our reversal of the order sustaining the demurrer,we also reverse the order dismissing barry may petition to probate the will 
b.the trial court erred in concluding that the bar against successive probate contests contained in section barred barry postprobate contest,because the court never adjudicated barry preprobate contest 
barry contends,in the alternative,that the trial court erred in sustaining lorraine demurrer to his postprobate contest on the ground that the bar against successive probate contests contained in section precluded barry contest.assuming for purposes of this opinion that lorraine demurrer was timely,we agree that the court erred in sustaining the demurrer on this ground.

several courts have interpreted the meaning and purpose of the italicized portion of section,quoted above.in in re estate of hoover,estate of hoover,the court considered whether section statutory predecessor former precluded a contestant from filing a postprobate contest where the contestant had filed,but subsequently dismissed,a preprobate contest.the estate of hoover court concluded that the contestant postprobate contest was not precluded under such circumstances,reasoning 
without question where the contest before probate has been determined adversely it is the intent of former section of the probate code to prevent another contest after probate.however,where,like in the case at bar,the contest before probate has been dismissed by the contestant before any trial of the issues of the contest as provided by former section of the probate code,it does not preclude a contest after probate under the aforementioned former section of the probate code.
former section of the probate code provides for the contest before probate and former section provides how the issues of such contest shall be tried.when the contest is dismissed before trial of the issues there ceases to be a contest in other words,there has not been a determination of the issues.a contest implies a trial and final judgment.the mere institution of a contest and dismissal without a trial is not a contest.citations.the provisions of section of the probate code,are intended merely as a prohibition against two successive trials of the same issues.estate of hoover,supra.at,italics added.
in estate of meyer d,the court explained the history and purpose of former section 
prior to the code of civil procedure relating to contests of wills provided as to postprobate contests that when a will had been admitted to probate any person interested might contest the same in the legislature enacted the qualifying provisions recited above excluding from the interested persons who might contest after probate those who had been parties to preprobate contests or had had actual knowledge thereof in time to have joined therein.under the older provisions it often happened that persons entitled to contest wills would,instead of joining in a preprobate contest,withhold their contest until such contest had been determined,benefiting equally with the contestants if the will were defeated,and reserving to themselves a second chance to have the will invalidated by postprobate contest.we think it to have been the purpose of the legislature in the amendment to discourage this practice.
the estate of meyer court concluded that the purpose of former section was to preclude litigants from attempting to litigate probate contests twice 
i t is left apparent that the legislature did not intend to do away with postprobate contests.we think the amendatory legislation was aimed exclusively at those who had full opportunity to contest before probate but preferred to be dilatory,waiting to see what might happen and then filing their contests after probate if disappointed in the outcome of the first contest.estate of meyer,supra,d at concluding that that the legislature did not intend that persons who knew of the pendency of the preprobate contest should be excluded from the class of those who might file postprobate contests if those persons had neither actual nor implied knowledge of their right to contest in that they had neither actual nor implied knowledge that they were interested persons ibid.
finally,in estate of horn d,this court concluded that the rules governing preprobate and postprobate challenges contained in former sections and should not deprive a contestant who timely filed her preprobate contest under section of the opportunity to contest the will postprobate,where the preprobate contest had not been litigated.the contestant in estate of horn filed a will contest approximately one week before the trial court admitted a will to probate.estate of horn,supra,at.the trial court admitted the will to probate without considering the contest.ibid.after admitting the will to probate,the trial court granted the executor demurrer to the contest on the ground that the contestant had waived her right to contest the will by failing to comply with various procedural requirements.ibid.
on appeal,this court concluded that the trial court had acted properly in admitting the will to probate given the contestant failure to make the court aware of its contest.estate of horn,supra,d at.the estate of horn court reasoned,when the party contesting the will fails to appear or otherwise inform the court of the status of the contest,the court can reasonably conclude the will contest was either amicably resolved or that the contestant had decided to challenge the will under former section.id.at.however,citing the similarities between preprobate and postprobate contests,this court further concluded that the trial court should have granted the contestant request that the court treat her preprobate contest as a postprobate contest.id.at.accordingly,the estate of horn court remanded the matter with directions to overrule the demurrer.ibid.
factual and procedural background 
as noted in part,ante,on november,the trial court held a hearing on lorraine petition to probate the will.oliver and attorney herring appeared at the hearing.at the outset of the hearing,the trial court asked oliver how soon he could be ready for trial.oliver responded that he could be ready within a week or so i think.after further discussion concerning whether there were assets in the estate or rather,whether the assets were all contained in a separate trust,the court again inquired of oliver as to when he could be ready for trial and how long a trial he contemplated.oliver stated that he could be ready right after thanksgiving,and that he would need probably two hours.the court then directed a similar inquiry to attorney herring.
in responding to the trial court inquiry,attorney herring asserted that oliver had not raised proper objections to her petition,stating in part,oliver has not submitted any of his papers in proper format.he has presented no legal arguments.he has not presented his own petition for probate.he has stated no legal grounds to object to my client appointment as executor under the will.attorney herring also objected that oliver had not properly served her with many of the documents in the case,including the will that oliver was offering to probate.attorney herring concluded her remarks by stating,a trial on exactly what topic i need to know wha
