in a letter written on november,benjamin franklin famously warned that in this world nothing is certain but death and taxes.this appeal proves the enduring wisdom of franklin pithy admonition.the tale follows.
refined to bare essence,the appeal presents two interconnected questions.the first,which concerns the amount of tax due,turns on whether shares of stock held in the name of a decedent were community property under the marital property regime of belgium where the decedent and his wife resided when he acquired the shares and when he died or the decedent separate property under the marital property regime of england which was the marital property regime in effect where the decedent and his wife resided at the time they celebrated their marriage.the second question concerns a refusal to abate a fragment of a penalty assessed in consequence of the late filing of the decedent estate tax return.
the tax court held that england separate property regime applied and that,therefore,all the shares were includable in the decedent gross estate for federal estate tax purposes.estate of charania comm r,wl,at.it simultaneously refused to abate the fragment of the penalty.id.at.the decedent estate and heirs collectively,the estate assign error to both rulings.
we affirm in part and reverse in part.we agree with the tax court that the disputed shares were the decedent separate property and,thus,were includable in full in his gross taxable estate.we disagree,however,with the tax court refusal to abate the balance of the penalty.
background 
the raw facts are set forth in a stipulation submitted to the tax court pursuant to tax court rule.see estate of charania,wl,at.we offer a thumbnail sketch,beginning with the identities of the protagonists,proceeding through the more important of the stipulated facts,and ending with the travel of the case.
the decedent,noordin charania,and his wife,roshankhanu dhanani,married in uganda in.both of the newlyweds were native ugandans.uganda had been under the hegemony of the united kingdom for many years and,therefore,both spouses were citizens of the united kingdom.
after their nuptials,the couple made their home in uganda.the decedent worked as an agent for a belgian shipping company.in,idi amin,then the ruler of uganda,ordered the expulsion of ugandans of asian descent.mindful of this edict,the decedent and his wife,who were both of asian descent,fled to belgium.they took only a few items of personal property all of their assets within uganda were expropriated by the ugandan government.
the couple arrived in belgium in october of,intending to remain there indefinitely.the decedent resided in that country until he died on january.he was survived by his wife and children,farhana and mehran.his will,without specific enumeration of particular assets,bequeathed of his property to his wife and to each of his two children.
at no time had the decedent and his wife availed themselves of a mechanism,available under belgian law,that permits married couples to modify or change the matrimonial regime governing their property.by the same token,they had not entered into any prenuptial agreement or other contractual arrangement touching upon the ownership of assets acquired during their marriage.
to this point,the tale would not seem to implicate the taxing power of the united states.but under the internal revenue code,the internal revenue service irs has a long reach.its interest here stems from the decedent purchase,in august of,of shares of stock in an american financial services company citicorp.these shares were later converted into shares of stock in another related american company citigroup.after a series of stock splits and stock dividends,the investment grew to a total of shares of citigroup stock.the value of the shares at the time of the decedent death was.
a federal estate tax return was due on october.on that day,the estate filed an application for an extension of time to i file a return and ii pay any estate tax that was due and owing.the irs approved the requested filing extension but not the requested delay in payment.
nearly two weeks after the deadline for paying estate tax,the estate paid to the irs.the estate also missed the deadline for submitting the estate tax return,filing that document on april,almost one year late.
the estate tax return set the value of the decedent gross estate for federal estate tax purposes at,which was the value of shares of citigroup stock of the total bloc of stock held in the decedent name on a valuation date permitted by the tax code the estate explained that the gross estate did not include all shares because the stock,although issued in the decedent name alone,was owned as the community property of the decedent and his wife under the laws of belgium.
on june,the irs assessed unpaid taxes in the amount of against the estate,together with a penalty of for the late filing of the return,id.a,and a penalty of for late payment of tax,id.a.
after making these assessments,the irs proceeded to complete its examination of the estate tax return.it concluded that all shares of citigroup stock were includable in the gross taxable estate.accordingly,the irs issued a notice of deficiency for unpaid tax in the amount of.see id.the notice also increased the section a penalty by to reflect the newly assessed tax deficiency.
having received a demand for payment of both the initial penalty and the penalty,the estate sought a waiver of those penalties on the ground that any shortcomings were based on reasonable cause and did not reflect willful neglect.the irs granted the waiver and abated the penalties.
on july,the estate repaired to the united states tax court.invoking,it sought redetermination of the sums claimed in the notice of deficiency.the estate petition contained two prayers for relief.first,it contended that the decedent held the shares of citigroup stock as community property with his wife under belgium marital property regime and,therefore,only of the shares were properly includable in his gross estate.second,it contended that the portion of the penalty should be abated.
the parties submitted the case to the tax court on stipulated facts.see fed.tax.to explain the fine points of their arguments,they also filed briefs and reports about relevant foreign law.see fed.tax.
the tax court upheld both the determination of the tax deficiency and the challenged portion of the penalty.with respect to the former issue,the court concluded that the decedent held the shares not as community property under the marital property regime of belgium but,rather,as his separate property under the marital property regime of england.estate of charania,wl,at.with respect to the latter issue,the court found insufficient justification for the untimely filing.id.at.relatedly,it concluded that the irs earlier abatement of a portion of the penalty did not compel the abatement of the remainder of the penalty.id.at.this timely appeal ensued.we have jurisdiction by designation of the parties.a,b see also estate of charania,wl,at noting parties joint designation of first circuit.
ii.analysis 
we bifurcate our discussion of the estate claims of error,separately addressing the tax and penalty issues.
every nonresident decedent who is not a citizen of the united states is subject to federal estate tax on the transfer of certain assets within his taxable estate.a.pertinently,such a decedent taxable estate includes stock owned in domestic corporations.id.a,a.the dollar amount that is includable in the gross estate is equal to the value of the property to the extent of the interest therein of the decedent at the time of his death.id.this calculation may,in certain circumstances,be premised on an alternate valuation date.id.
the controversy here hinges on a narrow issue.the estate does not dispute that citigroup is a domestic corporation within the meaning of these statutory provisions.the commissioner does not contest the estate right to use the alternate valuation date.the parties part ways,however,as to how many of the citigroup shares were includable in the decedent gross taxable estate.
on this critical issue,the estate asserts that only of the shares were includable in the decedent gross taxable estate because,under the marital property regime of belgium,the stock was community property.the commissioner responds that all the shares were includable in the decedent gross taxable estate because,under the marital property regime of england,they were the decedent separate property.this dispute presents a question of foreign law and,thus,the tax court resolution of it engenders de novo review.see textron comm r,cir see also fed.tax.noting that the tax court determination of foreign law shall be treated as a ruling on a question of law.
even on this compact battlefield,the parties occupy some common ground.they agree that,for federal estate tax purposes,ownership of intangible personal property is controlled by the whole law of the decedent domicile at the time of death the parties further agree that the decedent in this case was domiciled in belgium when he died and that a belgian court,applying belgian rules,would look to the whole law of the country of the spouses common nationality.finally,the parties agree that the country of the spouses common nationality is england so framed,the question reduces to what marital property regime an english court would apply to determine the spouses property rights in the citigroup shares.
the estate argues that an english court would adhere to the doctrine of mutability.under the doctrine of mutability,the marital property regime of the jurisdiction in which the spouses were domiciled when the property was acquired governs questions of ownership.collier,conflict of laws ed.in this case,the spouses were living in belgium when the decedent purchased the stock.that jurisdiction has a community property regime.thus,if an english court were to follow the doctrine of mutability,ownership of the citigroup shares would be split.
the commissioner counters that an english court would apply the doctrine of immutability.under the doctrine of immutability,the marital property regime of the jurisdiction in which the spouses were domiciled at the time of their marriage governs all personal property that they acquire thereafter,regardless of where they are living when the property is acquired or whether their domicile changes id.thus,because the spouses were domiciled at the time of their nuptials in uganda,and because the parties have stipulated that uganda marital property regime corresponded,at the relevant time,to england marital property regime,the doctrine of immutability would call for application of england marital property regime.that is a separate property regime,so that if an english court were to follow the doctrine of immutability,all the citigroup shares would be the decedent property.
the question of which jurisdiction marital property regime should prevail after spouses have changed their domicile is a recurring one in conflict of laws analysis.in the united states,courts have tended to favor the doctrine of mutability.see,united states itt consumer fin,cir saul his creditors,mart.the primary rationale undergirding this approach is that the jurisdiction in which a couple was domiciled at the time of the acquisition of property has the most significant interest in both the spouses and the property.see restatement second of conflict of laws.in continental european countries,the doctrine of immutability is favored.see dicey,morris collins,the conflict of laws ed friedrich juenger,marital property and the conflict of laws,colum.champions of the immutability doctrine tout its ease of administration and the desirability of applying a single marital property regime to the entire inventory of a couple personal property.see,ernest lorenzen,the french rules of the conflict of laws,yale,thomas oldham,what if the beckhams move to and divorce,fam.
this background is interesting,but our task is neither to decide which policy rationale is more attractive nor to determine which view is more prevalent across the globe.rather,it is our task to inquire which of the competing doctrines an english court would place into service on these facts.we undertake that inquiry.
historically,the house of lords has been the court of last resort in england see appellate jurisdiction act,eng.see also glenn dymond,house of lords library,the appellate jurisdiction of the house of lords.the only relevant decision of the house of lords is de nicols curlier,appeal taken from.that case involved two french citizens,who married in france.id.at.they did not enter into either a prenuptial agreement or other contractual arrangement relating to the disposition of assets acquired during the marriage.id.
after nine years,the spouses moved to england,and the husband became a british subject.id.they spent the next years in england,amassing a considerable fortune.id.at.when the husband died,a question arose as to which marital property or england governed the ownership of the couple personal property the bulk of which was acquired after they moved to england.id.at.
the de nicols court looked to the marital property regime of the jurisdiction in which the spouses were domiciled when they celebrated the marriage to determine their rights in each other personal property.id.at.that brought french law to the forefront,and the court concluded i that an immutability rule was baked into french law,and ii that law impressed a community property regime on a married couple rights in personal property.id.at.the court considered this immutability rule to be rooted in implied contract theory under the french civil code,entering into a marriage without a prenuptial agreement placed the spouses in the same legal position as if they had executed a contract that expressly adopted the community property regime of the french civil code.id.at.once that regime attached,it could not be changed except by the spouses express agreement to a different arrangement or by the occurrence of certain external events,divorce.id.at.wielding this reasoning,the court held that the french community property regime governed,even as to property that had been acquired in england.id.at.
this decision lights our path.the rule of de nicols is that a change in marital domicile does not,in itself,effect a change in the marital property regime governing the spouses rights in personal property acquired throughout the course of the marriage.this,then,is a clear indication that,in this context,england adheres to the doctrine of immutability.see dicey et ed,supra,at.
de nicols is the only english precedent on point.it is still good law it has never been overruled or discredited.like the tax court,we are persuaded that we must follow it.we add that the rule of immutability is also commended to us by the absence of any english precedent suggesting that its rule of with respect to the marital property see dicey et ed,supra,at noting that there is no english authority for the proposition that the mutability doctrine may prevail.therefore,the rule of immutability applies here.
as part of a campaign to convince us that mutability is the english rule,the estate points to the eleventh edition of dicey and morris treatise,which states that the english rule governing spouses rights in each other property is one of mutability.see dicey morris,on conflict of laws ed.there are two principal reasons why this endeavor fails.first,even this cited version cautions that whether a mutability rule obtains in england is controversial and not settled law.id.at.more most recent edition of the same treatise reversed direction and states that immutability is the rule in england.see dicey et ed,supra,at rule change in the matrimonial domicile after marriage does not in itself alter the rights of the husband and wife to each other property.the clear import of this is that the authors,having reconsidered the point,now agree that de nicols heralds a rule of immutability.
taking a different tack,the estate tries to distinguish de nicols on the ground that the de nicols opinion was driven by.this theory posits that the result in de nicols proceeds solely from the fact that french law implied a contract between the spouses to adopt france marital prop
