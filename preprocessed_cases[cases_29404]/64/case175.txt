introduction 
on december,eileen gillis decedent executed the eileen gillis trust hereinafter the trust which named her daughter,beverly sims sims,as successor trustee and distributed the entire contents of the trust equally between her children sharyn christine matriotti,barbara des rochers,wayne demmel,kim des rochers,and sims,upon decedent death.the trust provided that the beneficiaries must survive distribution of the assets of the trust to inherit or their shares would be distributed equally among the surviving beneficiaries.on december,decedent executed a first amendment to declaration of trust of eileen gillis trust hereinafter first amendment which removed sims as both a beneficiary and successor trustee the first amendment named kim des rochers as successor trustee.
on september,decedent executed a second amendment to declaration of trust of eileen gillis trust hereinafter second amendment,which removed kim des rochers as the successor trustee and replaced her with defendant and respondent john gillis,decedent husband from whom she was legally separated.the second amendment provided,under no circumstances do i wish my eldest daughter,beverly sims,beverly edwards,to receive anything whatsoever from my estate or to have any control or influence over the administration or distribution of the estate.
decedent died on february.on june,sims filed a petition to void the trust amendments claiming decedent was ill and in a weakened physical and mental condition when she executed the amendments,and defendant used undue influence and unfair advantage to induce her to amend the trust.sims died on may.defendant made a preliminary distribution to the beneficiaries of each on july.plaintiff and appellant rex edwards was substituted in as the special administrator and executor of sims estate.defendant successfully moved for bifurcation of the trial to separately consider first whether plaintiff had standing to challenge the amendments because she predeceased distribution.after a bench trial,the court ruled plaintiff failed to demonstrate defendant had unreasonably delayed distribution of the trust assets therefore,plaintiff lacked standing to challenge the amendments because even if invalidated,she would not have stood to inherit from the trust.the court entered judgment for defendant.
on appeal,plaintiff maintains the court applied an incorrect rule of law in requiring plaintiff to bear the burden of proving defendant unreasonably delayed distribution of the trust assets.instead,plaintiff contends the court should have applied a rule that would only have required plaintiff prove defendant could and should reasonably have made preliminary distributions of the trust assets prior to sims death.we affirm the judgment.
factual and procedural history 
the operative petition,after amendment,sustained demurrers,and plaintiff own requests for dismissal,alleged causes of action for duress and undue influence exercised by defendant in inducing execution of the first amendment second cause of action and duress and undue influence exercised by defendant in inducing execution of the second amendment third cause of action.sims testified at an expedited deposition due to her poor health that she received an anonymously sent letter from england after her mother death,in which her mother wrote that she was forced to remove you from my trust.i am writing this to let you know it was not my intention to take you out of my original trust and will.please do feel that i did not appreciate all the work you did for me,and then for me to take you out of my will,that is not what i wanted.
sims testified she later found another letter addressed to her from her mother behind a picture of her grandmother.in that letter,decedent wrote she was forced by defendant to sign papers saying that if i should die,you are on notice to immediately demand through your attorney to rescind any written agreements.i was very ill at the time and not able to read the papers that defendant was forcing me to sign.i had a previous encounter years ago and was forced to sign something and was knocked to the ground which is on police records as it was reported to them.petitioner prayed for enforcement of the terms of the trust as of the date it was originally executed on december.
at trial,nora teasley,the cpa hired by defendant on march,to conduct accounting and tax preparation for the trust testified she had worked as a cpa since.she had obtained both a masters degree in business administration and a masters degree in business taxation.she was an accredited estate planner,had taught accounting classes,and was an expert in trust administration.teasley testified she had prepared approximately fiduciary tax returns for trustees,estate tax preparations,and approximately trust accountings.
the trust consisted of five real properties in cash and prepaid accounts,a small amount of household furnishings,a vehicle,and some clocks and figurines.that total amounted to.the trust had debts upon decedent death consisting of a mortgage of immediately due upon her death,another debt based on a marital property settlement which was undeterminable at that time because it was based on a percentage of the proceeds from a prospective sale,and three liens on properties amounting to.the marital property debt was later determined to be.
one of the real properties,a residence in newport beach,was appraised for million,but eventually sold for million.the trust realized million in proceeds from the sale,which closed on november.a home in alta vista appraised for,but sold on february,for the marital property settlement of was paid from the proceeds of the sale of the alta vista home.federal estate taxes on the trust in the amount of were paid from the sale of the newport beach home.teasley prepared and timely filed the estate tax return.
defendant sought teasley advice regarding the making of preliminary distributions of the trust assets after the sale of the alta vista home he was anxious to distribute as soon as he possibly could.defendant never indicated any desire to delay distribution.teasley advised against the distribution.as of march,there was no independent indication from the internal revenue service what any possible judgment on that estate tax return that had been filed would be.we did not receive the irs closing document until months after the filing of the form we also did not know at that time what additional expenses were going to be incurred in this case.for one thing in maintaining properties and additional costs to the trust.we had no way to measure that.
teasley testified that in her experience,her advice to trustees in the past and present had been not to do any significant distribution until after receipt of the closing document because the personal liability falls totally on the fiduciary.defendant is personally liable.m y recommendation always is to delay any distribution to the beneficiaries until after receipt of the closing letter.she told defendant there was personal risk to him if he made any distributions too early.
a united states estate tax closing letter is an indication to the cpa and the trustee that there will not be an additional examination by the irs.it is definitely prudent for the trustee to delay distribution until after the receipt of the closing letter because a t that point we have somewhat of an assurance that the irs is not going to look further at the reported document.the cpa guidance service specifically say s it is unwise to distribute prior to receipt of the estate closing document because of the risk to the trustee or executor 
teasley testified in particular that the difference in the appraised value and sale amount of the newport beach property caused concern from a tax perspective because the estate taxes had been paid on the appraised value and there was always the possibility that the internal revenue service could audit the return and demand that the million value be used additionally,the newport beach property comprised more than percent of the value of the trust.the risk is very high when one single asset comprises more than percent of the gross estate b ecause if the value of that asset is changed in an audit,then the amount of estate tax due could be significantly higher.
nevertheless,defendant made a distribution from the trust to the beneficiaries on july,of each for a total amount of.teasley apparently acquiesced because there was a strong feeling that it was a small dollar amount relative to the entire estate.nonetheless,at that time,three additional parcels of real property had yet to be sold.there was a vacant parcel in alabama valued at.a home in riverside on brockton street was appraised at,but later sold on december,for,netting the trust.another home in riverside on jurupa avenue appraised for,but sold for,netting the trust.
while sale of the various real properties was pending,the estate incurred a lot of expenses repairing,maintaining,and preparing the properties for sale,which were taken out of the cash assets of the trust,including in property management fees.however,after the sale of the first two properties and payment of taxes,the estate had approximately million in cash available as of july.nonetheless,nothing of significance occurred between march,and july,to make trust distributions any wiser.
the closing letter from the irs was received on february.on may,defendant made another preliminary distribution from the trust totaling.teasley opined it was not unreasonable for defendant to have made no distribution prior to may,because there was no requirement that such a distribution be made,there was no such request from the beneficiaries,and they had yet to receive the estate tax closing letter.she concluded it would have been reasonable and prudent for defendant to wait until after receipt of the letter before making any distributions.teasley testified defendant promptly administered the trust there was no unreasonable delay to any aspect of his administration of the trust.
eric gronroos,a cpa with years of experience and a master degree in tax,testified on behalf of plaintiff.he testified he had been retained to prepare taxes for estates in over cases,and tax returns in at least trusts.gronroos testified distributions from trust assets can be made prior to receipt of a closing letter from the irs it is done all the time.he testified that in percent of the cases in which he has been involved,preliminary distributions have been made prior to receipt of a closing letter from the irs i ca think of a case where all the money of the estate was held for an irs matter.when asked whether it was appropriate to conduct preliminary distribution,gronroos replied typically what we do is we will estimate the potential tax liability that we feel that there is exposure on the estate,if any,and recommend,based on that calculation,what amount should be withheld for potential disputes with the irs.
in his opinion,preliminary distributions could have been made without unreasonably exposing the trustee or the beneficiaries to any tax liability.he believed the potential liability could be estimated and make a conservative judgment and the balance could have been distributed to the beneficiaries without unreasonably exposing the beneficiaries or the trustee,and that is commonly done in his practice.gronroos conceded trustees are personally liable to creditors,including the irs,if they distribute trust assets in amounts in excess of that needed to pay its debts.he described waiting for an irs closing letter before making disbursements as a matter of practice.it is not always done.it not typically done unless there is really something out there that is disturbing.
defendant testified he did not learn sims was terminally ill until her deposition in.he made the preliminary distribution on july,at the behest of one of the beneficiaries he did so over teasley objection i felt that that small amount of would not have a direct impact upon the trust.he also set aside an additional should the court determine sims was entitled to inherit.defendant testified he deferred to teasley on virtually all issues regarding the administration of the trust i was a novice.i had never done this before.i understood i would be liable for any monies that were not available once distribution had been made had someone come back against the trust like the irs or state franchise tax board.it would fall on me to make up that difference.
after the court heard testimony,plaintiff argued the standard by which the court should resolve the matter was whether defendant reasonably could and should have made a preliminary distribution.defendant countered that t he test,which plaintiff urges the court to use,would render virtually every distribution survivorship clause found in any trust completely meaningless.it is almost always the case that some small distribution can be made almost immediately after the trustor death.the court stated,the trust document itself provided for the reality that you ca just close an estate right after death.there some properties that you going to have to manage while you closing.and when i look at the trust instrument and the cases,the issue really is whether it could have been done,it whether it was unreasonable to not make a distribution.t he issue is whether,based on all of the circumstances,it was unreasonable to not make a distribution prior to the first distribution date.based on the evidence submitted,i ca find that it was unreasonable to wait,based on the cpa testimony saying i always consider it imprudent to distribute prior to a closing letter.i ca say that it was unreasonable to wait for distribution to occur,especially when we have a trustee who not a beneficiary of this trust,and he the one personally liable if he messes up.
discussion 
unreasonable delay 
as he argued below,plaintiff contends on appeal the court should have required only that he prove it was reasonable for defendant to have made preliminary distributions prior to sims death in order for him to maintain standing to challenge the trust amendments.defendant counters the court applied the correct standard that plaintiff had the burden to prove defendant unreasonably delayed making preliminary distributions from the trust assets to the beneficiaries.we agree with defendant.

in taylor,the decedent died testate providing in her will that one of the beneficiaries,ellen catherine glasky,would take a third share of the estate if she survived distribution if not,her share would be distributed equally among the remaining two designated beneficiaries.taylor,supra,cal d at.the will was admitted to probate on november,and letters testamentary were issued to the executor of the estate,on december.the petition for final distribution was filed march,requesting that of the residue of the estate be distributed to glasky.hearing on the petition was set for march.glasky died march.one of the remaining beneficiaries then filed a petition requesting that the portion of the estate bequeathed to glasky be distributed among the remaining beneficiaries.id.at.glasky legatees filed an objection to the petition.the court sustained the objections to the petition for final distribution and decreed that glasky interest vested in her before her death.the court found that the estate could have been distributed in september of and should have been distributed before the death of glasky in march of.ibid.
on appeal,the court framed the issue as whether a clause requiring survivorship should be interpreted to mean survivorship to distribution or survivorship to the time distribution should have occurred,or,as an alternative,whether survivorship to the earlier date constitutes substantial compliance with the condition.taylor,supra,cal d at.the appellate court cited the rule that vesting can not be postponed by unreasonable delay in preparing an estate for distribution and that when there is such delay contingent
