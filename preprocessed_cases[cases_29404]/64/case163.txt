introduction 
tina yesson,successor trustee of the john enrico revocable living trust,appeals from the order of the sonoma county superior court denying her petition for an order determining that she,as the trustee of her father trust,had the right to sell the taxi permit also known as a taxi medallion held by her father at the time of his death,under the taxi medallion sales pilot program pilot program adopted by respondent san francisco municipal transportation agency sfmta.the court concluded that neither the medallion nor the right to sell the medallion became the property of the decedent or of his estate or trust as a result of sfmta authorization of the pilot program.we shall affirm the trial court,but on the alternative grounds found persuasive by the trial court,that the pilot program did not go into effect until march,after enrico death.
background 
on december,the san francisco police commission granted john enrico permit number,to operate a taxicab in san francisco sometimes referred to as the city.under city law,taxi permits could be inherited,sold,assigned and transferred.
in,san francisco voters passed proposition k,an initiative ordinance establishing a new system of regulation for taxi medallions.proposition k barred the inheritance,sale,assignment or transfer of taxi medallions.under proposition k,all taxi medallions belonged to the city,had to be held by working drivers,and were distributed as they became available to individuals on the medallion waiting list.in accordance with the requirements of proposition k,enrico surrendered his permit to the city and on december,the city issued him taxi medallion number t.his operation of the medallion was subject to the requirements of proposition k,as well as to additional taxi regulations codified in article of the san francisco police code and subsequently in the san francisco transportation code transportation code.in,the police department approved enrico request to lease medallion t to yellow cab company.enrico leased the medallion to yellow cab company from until his death in.during this time,yellow cab company paid enrico a monthly lease fee in exchange for operating the medallion.
in,san francisco voters passed proposition a,giving the san francisco board of supervisors the power to transfer regulatory authority over taxi affairs to the sfmta.authority to regulate san francisco taxis passed to sfmta in march.subsequently,the sfmta board of directors sfmta board proposition k requirements,as well as additional taxi regulations,in the transportation code,division ii,article,et.proposition a also gave the sfmta board the power to adopt taxi regulations that would override any prior ordinance,including the provisions of proposition 
by,when sfmta assumed its regulatory function over the local taxi industry,significant flaws had become apparent in the process by which medallions were issued.it is unlawful to operate a taxi in the city without a medallion.the demand for medallions far exceeded the supply and medallions were issued to drivers on a waiting list,for a fee of approximately.approximately names were on the waiting list at the time of trial and people qualifying for medallions had been on the waiting list for about years.a medallion holder is allowed to lease the medallion to a cab company or to a driver.it is thus an asset for the medallion holder.however,because the waiting list is so lengthy,applicants are often senior citizens by the time they actually receive a medallion.at the same time local law requires that every medallion holder who received a medallion after proposition k was adopted in,and who is physically able to do so must be a driver.that is,the medallion holder must actually drive his or her taxi for at least shifts,or for hours,during a single calendar year.transportation code,subdivision o.the advanced age of many medallion holders can make it difficult,or even unsafe,for them to comply with the city legal requirements,especially the driving requirement.sfmta began exploring possible reforms to the proposition medallion distribution service,holding multiple town hall meetings to solicit input from various stakeholders.
at a public hearing on february,the sfmta board approved resolution,adopting amendments to transportation code,division ii,article,to implement the pilot program the resolution explained that the pilot program represents an interim measure that would allow the san francisco taxi industry to gradually transition away from the waiting list system of medallion distribution that has characterized the san francisco taxi industry for years and that it represents an opportunity to collect information,monitor results and elicit industry recommendations for the purpose of adopting a taxi medallion reform solution the resolution enacted new transportation code section,subdivision e,stating,among other things any medallion held by a natural person who has attained or will attain the age of years old or older as of december,or has a bona fide disability is eligible for sale in accordance with this subsection e.transportation code,subd.e.transportation code section,subdivision e authorized the director of transportation to set the initial medallion sales price after a public hearing and at a price not to exceed and after considering certain specific factors in setting that price.transportation code section,subdivision e further stated that medallions shall be purchased and sold under the pilot program in accordance with procedures adopted by the sfmta.
the resolution also stated that p rior to authorizing any medallion sale,sfmta staff will return to the board to inform the board of the established medallion sale price and to propose additional regulations governing medallion financing following meetings with potential lenders,and the composition of an industry group to monitor the results of the pilot program that will provide recommendations for taxi industry reform 
on march,enrico died at the age of.
at public hearings held march,april and may,the sfmta board adopted additional regulations to implement the pilot program.on or about april,sfmta mailed to potentially eligible medallion sellers and buyers a notice opportunity to participate in taxi medallion sales pilot program,a buyers participation form,and a sellers participation form.
on april,yesson,a resident of sonoma county,filled out and signed a sellers participation form as trustee for john enrico and mailed it to the sfmta,which received the form on april.on april,yesson notified yellow cab company by phone of enrico death and on april,yellow cab company transmitted written notice to the sfmta that enrico had died.
as of the may,filing deadline,the sfmta had received approximately sellers participation forms from medallion holders expressing a desire to participate in the pilot program.upon receipt of the forms,sfmta staff screened the forms to determine which applicants met the age requirement,disability requirement,or both requirements to be eligible to participate in the pilot program.following the completion of the screening process,on or about june,the sfmta sent commitment to sell agreements to the medallion holders who it had determined were eligible to participate in the pilot program.the sfmta did not send a commitment to sell agreement to yesson.
on august,the sfmta wrote yesson rejecting her request to participate in the pilot program and explaining its view that y our father interest in medallion t,which consisted of his right and duty to operate the medallion,expired upon his death.if,prior to his death,your father was eligible to sell his medallion under the pilot program by virtue of either age or disability,that eligibility was also extinguished by his death and his interest in the medallion is not part of his estate.
in august,the first sale of a medallion under the pilot program occurred.yellow cab company returned medallion t to sfmta for reissuance in february.sfmta did not sell the medallion or otherwise use it in the pilot program.rather,on march,it reissued the medallion to the next qualified applicant at the top of the waiting list,who paid sfmta only the standard processing fee.
on may,yesson filed a claim against the city,alleging she had the right to sell medallion t.the city rejected her claim on june.on september,yesson filed the underlying petition in the sonoma county superior court,seeking an order determining ownership of disputed trust property and for damages,restitution,and imposition of a constructive trust.
in her petition,yesson asserted the year old enrico was eligible to participate in the pilot program when it passed on february,and from that date forward was qualified to sell his medallion pursuant to the provisions of the amended transportation code.she asserted he wished to do so and that he died after adoption of the pilot program,but before sfmta promulgated formal procedures for qualified medallion holders to notify sfmta of their eligibility and intention to sell.yesson argued below,as she does here,that upon his death and pursuant to his will,enrico personal property,including the medallion and the right to sell it,became the property of his trust.she sought an order determining that title to the medallion was vested in her as trustee and requiring sfmta to pay her,the amount a medallion holder would net by selling a medallion through the pilot program the medallion sale value of,less a medallion sale transfer fee and a driver fund transfer fee.
the sonoma county superior court denied the petition,finding beginning in,decedent taxi medallion was at all times owned by the city and county of san francisco the medallion was not,and never could be,property of the decedent or of his estate or trust.furthermore,the sfmta did not confer a vested or alienable property right upon the decedent to sell his medallion through the pilot program,and,a fortiori,no such right could be transferred to the decedent estate or trust.it described yesson claim as an attempt to cobble together a property interest where none exists.the court also found persuasive sfmta argument that resolution did not take effect until after enrico death,but the court prefer red to decide this case on settled principles of the law of inheritance.the court concluded,had the decedent survived a little longer,he likely could have benefitted from the pilot program.his inability to so benefit was due to unfortunate timing.it is not uncommon that the timing of changes in laws and regulations sometimes determines people fortunes,yet bad timing establishes neither a denial of constitutional due process nor a cause of action for legal or equitable relief.
this timely appeal followed.
discussion 
standard of review 
as the parties here agree,the case was tried below on stipulated facts and so we apply the de novo standard of review.crocker national bank city and county of san francisco cal d,nguyen calhoun th.
we agree with the initial argument made by sfmta that adoption of resolution,establishing the pilot program and amending the transportation code was a legislative act,subject to referendum.therefore,resolution took effect days after adoption of the resolution and five days after enrico death.consequently,whether or not the resolution created any property rights and we do not suggest that it did enrico was not possessed of any such rights at the time he died.
referendum 
under both the california constitution and the charter of the city and county of san francisco,the initiative and referendum are powers reserved by the people.cal,art.ii,city charter.the referendum is the means by which the electorate is entitled,as a power reserved by it under our state constitution,to approve or reject measures passed by a legislative body.cal,art.ii,subd.a,art.iv,associated home builders,city of livermore cal d.empire waste management town of windsor th,empire waste lindelli town of san anselmo th,lindelli.the initiative and referendum are not rights granted the people,but power s reserved by them.declaring it the duty of the courts to jealously guard this right of the people citation,the courts have described the initiative and referendum as articulating one of the most precious rights of our democratic process citation.i t has long been our judicial policy to apply a liberal construction to this power wherever it is challenged in order that the right not be improperly annulled.if doubts can reasonably be resolved in favor of the use of this reserve power,courts will preserve it.citations.rossi brown cal th,see lindelli,supra,th at.
an essential component of the referendum power is the ability to stay legislation until voters have had the opportunity to approve or reject it.with limited exceptions,every municipal ordinance is subject to an automatic day stay before it becomes effective.elections code.during that period,any qualified registered voter may circulate a referendum petition challenging the ordinance.elections code.provided that the requisite number of signatures is obtained,the effective date of the ordinance shall be suspended,and the legislative body shall reconsider the ordinance.ibid.lindelli,supra,th at.section of the san francisco charter similarly provides for the referendum power to apply to ordinances adopted by the city.
as explained in midway orchards county of butte d midway orchards,the power of referendum is simply not the power to repeal a legislative act under current article ii,section of the state constitution,the referendum is the power of the electors to approve or reject statutes the power is the same as the legislature approval of a bill.citation.the power is to determine whether a legislative act should become law.citation.it is not to determine whether a legislative act,once effective,should be repealed.in accord with this view of the referendum power,neither state statutes nor local ordinances subject to referendum go into effect during the time permitted for the filing of a referendum petition.citations.thus,a prime purpose of deferment of the effective date of ordinances is to preserve the right of referendum.citation.id.at pp.
moreover,it is well established that any legislative act may be subject to referendum,regardless of whether that act is denominated an ordinance or resolution.devita county of napa cal th,fn.accord,midway orchards,supra,d at.resolutions subject to referendum,like ordinances,are not effective until days from the date of their enactment.midway orchards at.a legislative act subject to referendum can not be effective before the power of referendum can be exercised.id.at pp.
we recognize that resolutions ordinarily take effect immediately and that many administrative acts not subject to referendum are undertaken by resolution and are effective upon passage according to the usual rule.midway orchards,supra,d at.the determinative question then,is whether resolution amending the transportation code and enacting the pilot program was a legislative act and so subject to referendum as claimed by sfmta or was an administrative action as claimed by yesson.
legislative act 
a referendum may review only legislative decisions,but not matters that are strictly executive or administrative.citation.empire waste,supra,th at,fn.see lindelli,supra,th at pp.see sacks city of oakland th.under the most frequently stated description of the line between legislative and acts,a cts constituting a declaration of public purpose,and making provisions for ways and means of its accomplishment,may be generally classified as calling for the exercise of legislative power.acts which are to be deemed as acts of administration,and classed among those governmental powers properly assigned to the executive department,are those which are necessary to be done to carry out legislative policies and purposes already declared by the legislative body,or such as are devolved upon it by the organic law of its existence.again it has been said the power to be exercised is legislative in its nature if it prescribes a new policy or plan whereas,it is administrative in its nature if it merely pursues a plan already adopted by the legislative body itself,or some power superior to it.citation.citation.lindelli,supra,th at see sacks city of oakland,supra,th at pettye city and county of san francisco th.
sfmta adoption of the pilot program has the earmarks of a legislative act,as the resolution declared its public purpose and outlined the ways and means of its accomplishment.we agree with sfmta that the pilot program prescribed a new policy or plan for regulating the system of permitting taxi service in the city.the newly enacted provisions of the transportation code enacted by resolution,set out a new course for the legal treatment of taxi medallions.for the first time in decades,sfmta would allow certain medallions to be sold.in the trial court,yesson herself characterized the sfmta board as having created a in the longstanding proposition k assumption that taxi medallions were city property.on appeal,she asserts that medallion ownership changed dramatically with the adoption of resolution,amending the city transportation code by adding section,subdivision e creating the pilot program.
in determining whether resolution was a legislative act by sfmta,we refer to the above description of the line between legislative and administrative acts and to the following 
it is well established that t he amendment of a legislative act is itself a legislative act.the power to legislate includes by necessary implication the power to amend existing legislation.city of sausalito county of marin d,d statutes.here,the initial adoption of proposition k through an initiative of the people of the city,was unquestionably a legislative act.see superior court d,upholding proposition k as an initiative ordinance against constitutional challenges.sfmta amendment of the transportation code,the codification of proposition k,as it was empowered to do by proposition a,is a strong indication that the amendment was a legislative act according to this rule.
a dministrative agencies may have executive,administrative,investigative,legislative or adjudicative powers.traub board of retirement cal d,fn,italics added.pettye city and county of san francisco,supra,th at san francisco proposition that required city to replace general assistance with benefits for housing,utilities,and meals was a legislative act.sfmta exercises both legislative and administrative powers.
nor does the interim or temporary nature of a program change the legislative character of the decision to enact it.lindelli,supra,th at legislative body approval of interim contract was a legislative act,subject to referendum,as it involved the decision in the first instance of which private entity was best suited to provide services for the duration of the contract.in this case,the decision to adopt the pilot program involved the same initial policy decision that would qualify a taxi medallion reform program as a legislative act,subject to the referendum process.see ibid.
any doubts about whether resolution,authorizing the medallion sales pilot program was a legislative act,would be set to rest by the rules of order adopted by the sfmta board in january,more than a year before the resolution amending the transportation code and enacting the pilot program was adopted.article,section of the rules of order provides article legislative process section.effective date.resolutions that adopt provisions of the city transportation code relating to parking,traffic,and taxi service shall go into effect at the beginning of the day after approval if no referendum petition is filed.the foregoing rule shall not affect actions of the board to approve contracts,budgets,departmental policies and other matters that do not amend the san francisco transportation code.added january.
by adopting this section of its rules of order,the board affirmatively recognized and made clear its obligation with respect to the reserved referendum power of local voters.even though the sfmta board can not enact ordinances that power being reserved to the board of supervisors under the city charter,the sfmta board was empowered by proposition a,codified at section,subdivision b of the city charter,to enact measures that override previous city ordinances concerning taxi service when exercised,such powers are legislative in nature.
yesson arguments 
yesson contends the action taken by the sfmta board in adopting resolution was wholly administrative and,therefore,was effective immediately upon its adoption she points out that resolutions ordinarily become effective immediately midway orchards,supra d at pp.and asserts that the resolution merely implemented several san francisco charter provisions.those provisions are identified by yesson as found in article viiia the municipal transportation agency and are set forth in the margin yesson contends that the goals and objectives identified by the sfmta staff report proposing the pilot program describe the stated goals and objectives in language similar to that found in the charter article viiia preamble and in its article viiia transit first policy 
it is not surprising that the general goals and objectives of the pilot program,such as providing safe,environmentally sustainable and economically feasible alternatives to individual automobile transportation,would mirror the even more general and lofty goals and policies of the municipal transit agency article of the city charter.it is not simply the statement of goals and objectives of a resolution that determines whether it was the product of a legislative act.rather,it is what the resolution actually does.the transit first policy contained in the city charter mentions taxis only in the context of including them as public transit and an economically and environmentally sound alternative to transportation by individual automobiles.it does not mention permits or medallions at all.yesson can not point to any resolution or ordinance before sfmta resolution that enacted a policy of allowing medallion sales.through this resolution and subsequent ones,sfmta made new law.this resolution did not merely implement previously adopted policies,but created a wholly new policy and plan of allowing qualified medallion holders to sell their medallions.as sfmta points out,there are many very different,and in some cases diametrically opposed,ways in which sfmta might try to further these general goals.for instance,it could make medallions entirely it could allow all medallions to be sold in a free market it could,as it did,allow specified taxi medallions held by eligible persons to be sold for consideration to qualified purchasers.the choice among these alternatives was a significant policy choice.acts declaring such new public policy are the essence of the exercise of legislative power.pettye city and county of san francisco,supra,th at.the adoption of a dramatically different and wholly new policy of allowing limited medallion sales was a legislative act and,therefore,was subject to the people right of referendum.
yesson contends that only where a resolution is passed with all the formalities of an ordinance does it become a legislative act subject to referendum and the day waiting period,rather than an administrative act.however,her sole authority,city of sausalito county of marin,supra,d at pp.holding that although a resolution adopting a master plan was legislative in substance,it was invalid in form where it was not executed by ordinance,did not address the circumstances under which resolutions are subject to referendum.moreover,her argument is counter to established authority holding,any legislative act may be subject to referendum,regardless of whether that act is denominated an ordinance or resolution.devita county of napa,supra,cal th,fn.accord,midway orchards,supra,d at.nor could a legislative body insulate its enactments from referendum by clothing them as less formal resolutions.midway orchards,supra,d at.
yesson maintains that the language of the resolution itself indicates it was intended to be effective immediately,as it stated,the board adopts the taxi medallion sales pilot program,and that any medallion offered to an applicant on the waiting list after february,shall be counted toward the number of medallions offered to waiting list applicants pursuant to the pilot program.she urges we may infer from this language that sfmta staff anticipated the pilot program commenced upon i
