in this probate case,a trust provided that the surviving trustor could exercise a limited power of appointment over specified property in three ways by a will duly admitted to probate,by a codicil duly admitted to probate,or by a written acknowledged instrument delivered to the trustee.the trust then stated,i f no will or codicil purporting to be that of the survivor is filed for probate within sixty days of his or her death,it shall be conclusively presumed that the survivor did not exercise this limited power of appointment.italics added.
the survivor attempted to appoint the entirety of the subject property by delivering an acknowledged instrument to the trustee,intending to give the property primarily to her daughter and grandchildren.after the survivor death,no will or codicil was filed for probate within days,raising the question of whether the conclusive presumption provision renders the acknowledged instrument ineffective and giving rise to this litigation.
the daughter intends to argue at trial that the ambiguous language of the limited power of appointment may be reformed or interpreted to give effect to the acknowledged instrument notwithstanding the conclusive presumption.she applied for declaratory relief,requesting a declaration that this argument would not violate the trust no contest clauses,which disinherit a beneficiary who seeks to nullify a provision of the trust.the survivor stepson,also a beneficiary under the trust,opposed the application,asserting that the daughter argument,if successful,would nullify the conclusive presumption provision.the trial court granted the application.the stepson appealed.
we affirm for two independent reasons.first,the daughter relies on other provisions of the trust and extrinsic evidence,contending that the ambiguous language is the result of a scrivener error.if she prevails on this theory,the trial court may reform the ambiguous language to implement the trustors intent.second,the trial court may excuse compliance with the conclusive presumption condition that a will or codicil be filed within days of the survivor the survivor exercised the limited power of appointment in a way that approximated the manner prescribed by the trust and that did not defeat a significant purpose of the trustors.see,all statutory references are to that code unless otherwise indicated.
background 
the following allegations,facts,and evidence are taken from the papers filed in connection with the daughter application for declaratory relief,our prior unpublished opinion in this case simon giammarrusco may,wl simon,and the record in simon.
howard olesky and maxine olesky,as trustors and trustees,created the olesky family family trust on or about february.they restated or amended the family trust several times.howard died on october.maxine died on november.
plaintiff,cynthia giammarrusco,is howard and maxine daughter.mark simon,defendant,is howard son by a prior marriage.
the family trust provided that upon the death of the first trust was to be divided into three shares a decedent trust,containing the maximum amount that could be placed in a trust not qualifying for the marital deduction without requiring payment of federal estate taxes a marital trust,containing assets qualifying for the marital deduction and a survivor trust,containing the survivor maxine share of the community property and any portion of the decedent share of the community property not allocated to the decedent trust or the marital trust.the decedent trust and marital trust would become irrevocable upon howard death,but the survivor would have power of revocation or appointment over the survivor trust.simon,supra.the survivor trust would become irrevocable upon maxine death to the extent it held any assets she had not appointed.
as amended by howard and maxine in october and december,the family trust stated that upon howard death,mark would receive and mark children would each receive.if howard were the first trustor to die the decedent,these gifts would be made from the decedent trust if howard were the survivor,the gifts would come from the survivor trust.
in addition,the family trust,as amended in october,set forth the actions the survivor could take.during his or her lifetime,the survivor had a general power of power to dispose of the survivor trust and a limited power of appointment over property in the decedent and the marital trust.a power of appointment is general if it is exercisable in favor of anyone at all,including oneself or one own estate.black law dict.ed,see,subd.a.if a power of appointment is not general,it is limited.see cory ward d,subd.d.a limited power of appointment is exercisable only in favor of the person or class specified in the instrument creating the power.black law,supra,at.under the family trust,the survivor general and limited powers of appointment,respectively,were described as follows.
distribution of survivor trust.upon the death of the survivor,the trustee shall distribute the balance then remaining,if any,of the survivor trust including any undistributed income to such one or more persons and entities,on such terms and conditions,either outright or in trust,as the survivor may appoint.this power of appointment may be exercised only by a will or codicil duly admitted to probate,or by a written,acknowledged instrument delivered to the trustee,which will,codicil or written,acknowledged instrument expressly refers to and exercises this power of appointment and such will,codicil or written,acknowledged instrument may be executed before or after the death of the decedent.if no will or codicil purporting to be that of the survivor is filed for probate within sixty days of his or her death,and if no written,acknowledged instrument is filed with the trustee prior to the end of such period,then it shall be conclusively presumed that the survivor did not exercise this power of appointment.
distribution of decedent and marital trusts.
a upon the death of the survivor,the trustee shall distribute to his or her estate all of the then accrued and undistributed income of the marital trust,and shall add the balance of the marital trust to the decedent trust,to be held,administered and distributed as a part of that trust,as set forth below.
b limited power of appointment.the trustee shall distribute all or any part of the decedent trust to such one or more of the trustors issue,and on such terms and conditions,either outright or in trust,as the survivor may appoint.this limited power of appointment may be exercised only by a will or codicil duly admitted to probate or by a written acknowledged instrument delivered to the trustee,which will,codicil or written acknowledged instrument expressly refers to and exercises this limited power of appointment.if no will or codicil purporting to be that of the survivor is filed for probate within sixty days of his or her death,it shall be conclusively presumed that the survivor did not exercise this limited power of appointment.the survivor may appoint more to some beneficiaries than others,or to the exclusion of others.italics and boldface added.
the lack of symmetry between the conclusive presumption provisions in the general and limited powers of clause that appears only in the former and if no written,acknowledged instrument is filed with the trustee prior to the end of such period is at the heart of the dispute in this case.if that clause also appeared in the conclusive presumption provision for the limited power,there would be no basis for this litigation.
upon howard death in,the decedent trust was not funded because howard had used his unified credit during his lifetime.two marital exempt marital trust and a nonexempt marital the survivor trust were created.see simon,supra.for clarity,we will refer to the decedent trust and the two marital trusts as howard trusts.upon the survivor death,the balance of the marital trusts,if any,would be transferred to the decedent trust.the survivor trust was maxine we will refer to it as the survivor trust.
after howard death,maxine took several steps.she attempted to exercise the limited power of appointment over howard trusts by executing a written acknowledged instrument and delivering it to the trustee.the instrument purported to leave all of the property in howard trusts to cynthia,maxine grandchildren,and other relatives to the exclusion of mark and his children.the record does not contain the acknowledged instrument,so we do not know its entire contents or date of execution.maxine also amended the survivor trust,appointing cynthia as her successor trustee and leaving specific gifts of to mark and to each of his children.
howard trusts are governed by a no contest clause,executed by howard and maxine on march,which states in the event that any beneficiary under this instrument shall,singly or in conjunction with any other person or persons,contest in any court the validity of this trust or shall seek to obtain an adjudication in any proceeding in any court that this trust or any of its provisions is void,or seek otherwise to void,nullify or set aside this trust or any of its provisions,then the right of that person to take any interest which is given to him or her by this instrument shall be determined as it would have been determined if he or she had predeceased the execution of this instrument without surviving issue.italics added.
the survivor trust contains a no contest clause added by maxine on october,seven years after howard death.it provides if any beneficiary under this trust shall,singly or in conjunction with any other person or persons,initiate or support a contest,directly or indirectly whether or not it is pursued to its completion,then the right of that person to take any interest which is given to him or her by this trust shall be determined as though he or she had predeceased the execution of this trust without surviving descendants.italics added.contest includes c ontesting the validity of any of maxine estate planning documents or s eeking to obtain an adjudication that any part of maxine estate planning documents is void or seeking otherwise to void,nullify or set aside any part of maxine estate planning documents.italics added.estate planning documents refers to any will,codicil or trust executed by maxine as well as any other document she executed affecting the disposition of her assets after her death.it also refers to a ny document executed by maxine which exercises a power of appointment vested in her.
after maxine died on november,no will or codicil purporting to be hers was filed for probate within days.
on october,mark filed an application for declaratory relief in the trial court under section.that statute provides if an instrument containing a no contest clause is or has become irrevocable,a beneficiary may apply to the court for a determination of whether a particular motion,petition,or other act by the beneficiary would be a contest within the terms of the no contest clause.subd.a.
mark position was that if maxine did not exercise her power of appointment over howard trusts through her will or codicil,mark was entitled to receive and his children each under howard trusts.this would be in addition to the given to him and the each given to his children by maxine under the survivor trust.he sought interpretation of the inconsistent language in the limited power of appointment one sentence allowing the power of appointment to be exercised by written instrument delivered to the trustee during the survivor lifetime,and the other sentence providing a conclusive presumption that the power was not exercised unless exercised in the survivor will or codicil filed for probate within sixty days following the survivor death.he therefore sought a declaration that his proposed action to interpret the clause granting the limited power of appointment would not violate the no contest clause of either howard trusts or the survivor trust.simon,supra.
mark proposed action sought various determinations by the probate court,specifically.the court interpret the olesky family such that the conclusive presumption set forth therein may not be controverted by contrary evidence.the court determine that,because no will or codicil of maxine was filed for probate within sixty days of her death,maxine limited power of appointment was not effectively exercised and.the court determine that,because maxine is conclusively presumed to have not exercised the limited power of appointment,mark is entitled to receive the sum of two hundred thousand dollars from howard trusts and that each of mark two children is entitled to receive the sum of one hundred thousand dollars from howard trusts.the probate court found that the proposed action would not violate the no contest clause of either howard trusts or the survivor trust.simon,supra.
cynthia filed an appeal.we affirmed simon,supra.thus,under mark interpretation of the disputed language,he and his two children are collectively entitled to under howard trusts and to under the survivor trust.
on march,in response to mark application and our decision,cynthia filed her own application under section.cynthia sought a determination that she would not violate the no contest clause in howard or the survivor trusts by requesting that the trial court reform the language of the limited power of appointment so that an acknowledged instrument would be effective as long as it was filed with the trustee within days of maxine death.in short,cynthia wanted the conclusive presumption provision for the limited power of appointment to read like the comparable provision for the general power of appointment.to that end,she requested that the trial court insert the additional clause found in the conclusive presumption provision for the general power of appointment and if no written,acknowledged instrument is filed with the trustee prior to the end of such period into the conclusive presumption provision for the limited power of appointment.
in the alternative,cynthia requested that the trial court excuse compliance with the filing of a will or codicil within days of maxine death and thereby validate the exercise of the limited power of appointment through an acknowledged instrument delivered to the trustee.that request was based on section,subdivision a,which permits a trial court to excuse compliance with the formal requirements of exercising a power of appointment if certain conditions are satisfied.
cynthia relied in part on extrinsic evidence.the estate planning attorney for howard and maxine stated in a declaration that the conflict between the sentence establishing the three methods of exercising the power of appointment and the sentence containing the conclusive presumption was,in essence,a scrivener error.the attorney explained that howard and maxine initially did not want to leave any gift for mark howard did not feel that mark was his son howard was worried that mark would attack his estate plan after he died and howard main concern was the of maxine and cynthia.according to the attorney,howard and maxine eventually decided,after consultation with counsel,that if they left a gift for mark,it would serve as a disincentive for him to challenge the estate plan in light of the no contest clause howard decided to leave to mark and to each of mark two children.the attorney declaration further stated that,after howard death,the changes made in maxine estate planning documents were intended to maintain the same gifts for mark and his children,not increase them.
other evidence indicated that maxine will expressly stated that no power of appointment was intended to be exercised therein.also,substantially all of maxine assets were held in the survivor trust.maxine believed she had exercised her limited power of appointment over howard trusts by an acknowledged instrument delivered to the trustee.consequently,there was no reason to file a will or codicil.
in opposition to cynthia application,mark argued that her effort to reform the language of the conclusive presumption provision would violate the no contest clause in howard and the survivor trusts because it would void,nullify,or set aside the conclusive presumption created by maxine failure to comply with the filing deadline for a will or codicil.further,he asserted that the reformation of a trust to correct a scrivener error,as opposed to the interpretation of a trust,was a contest per se cynthia proposed reformation of the disputed language would invalidate the conclusive presumption based on an alleged mistake in drafting.that,mark argued,would be nothing short of rewriting howard trusts.in mark view,the provision containing the conclusive presumption was unambiguous.
by order dated june,the trial court ruled that cynthia proposed actions would not violate the no contest clauses.the order recited it would not be a contest of either howard trusts or the survivor trust for cynthia giammarrusco to seek to either modify howard trusts or in the alternative to request relief from the formal requirements of filing maxine olesky will or codicil,and thereby deem the limited power of appointment validly exercised by maxine.mark appealed.
discussion 
in reviewing the trial court order that a beneficiary proposed action will not violate a no contest clause,we apply a de novo standard of review.betts city national bank th,d.
under section,a beneficiary may,without violating a no contest clause,apply to the court for a determination whether a particular act would be a contest provided that no determination of the merits of the petition is required.s ection provides a safe harbor for beneficiaries who seek an advance judicial determination of whether a proposed legal challenge would be a contest under a particular no contest clause.if a court determines that a proposed action would constitute a contest,the beneficiary will then be able to make an informed decision whether to pursue the contest and forfeit his or her rights under a will or to forgo that contest and accede to the trust provisions.betts city national bank,supra,th at,d,citation and fn.omitted.
a ruling on whether the beneficiary proposed action would be a contest may not involve a determination on the merits of the action itself this makes sense.otherwise,the summary procedure provided by section could be used to allow the very form of challenge and protracted litigation the trustor sought to prevent.estate of ferber th,d accord,estate of davies th,d davies estate of kaila th,d.
no contest clauses 
an in terrorem or no contest clause in a will or trust instrument creates a condition upon gifts and dispositions provided therein a no contest clause conditions a beneficiary right to take the share provided to that beneficiary under such an instrument upon the beneficiary agreement to acquiesce to the terms of the instrument 
no contest clauses are valid in california and are favored by the public policies of discouraging litigation and giving effect to the purposes expressed by the trustor because a no contest clause results in a forfeiture,however,a court is required to strictly construe it and may not extend it beyond what was plainly the trustor intent 
whether there has been a contest within the meaning of a particular clause depends upon the circumstances of the particular case and the language used.t he answer can not be sought in a vacuum,but must be gleaned from a consideration of the purposes that the trustor sought to attain by the provisions of his trust.therefore,even though a no contest clause is strictly construed to avoid forfeiture,it is the trustor intentions that control,and a court must not rewrite the trust in such a way as to immunize legal proceedings plainly intended to frustrate the trustor unequivocally expressed intent from the reach of the clause.burch george cal th,d,citations omitted,italics added.
in determining whether a no contest clause would be violated,the courts consider the language of the clause,other terms of the trust,and extrinsic evidence of the trustor intent,which may include the testimony of the attorney who drafted the estate plan.see burch george,supra,cal th at,d,estate of kaila,supra,th at,d davies,supra,th at,d.in general,if the beneficiary proposed action would effectively nullify or thwart a provision in the trust instrument or result in the nullification of the trustor clearly stated intent,the proposal would constitute a contest within the meaning of the no contest clause.burch george,supra,cal th at,d,italics added.
the no contest clause in howard trusts precludes a challenge to the validity of the trusts or an attempt to void,nullify or set aside any of their provisions.the no contest clause in the survivor expressly applicable to any document executed by maxine which exercises a power of appointment contains the same language.
for simplicity,we sometimes use nullify to include words of similar import,such as invalidate,void,set aside,thwart,and frustrate.
cynthia proposed action 
the provision in howard trusts establishing three methods of exercising the limited power of appointment is ambiguous.it is immediately followed by a provision creating a conclusive presumption that one of the acknowledged instrument delivered to the ineffective if a filing deadline is not satisfied with respect to the other two will or codicil.
in pursuing his application for declaratory relief with the trial court under section,mark admitted that these provisions were inconsistent and conflicting.we agreed in affirming the order granting his application.simon,supra.but now mark maintains that the provisions are unambiguous.he can not have it both ways.the methods of exercising the limited power of appointment and the conclusive presumption provision could not be contradictory and conflicting for purposes of mark application but unambiguous when cynthia applies for declaratory relief.in lay terms,what is good for the gander is good for the goose.
cynthia argues that if the conclusive presumption applies to the acknowledged instrument method,then that provision of howard trusts would be rendered trap for the survivor.she posits that howard and maxine could not have intended to authorize a specific method of exercising the limited power of appointment,only to take it away in the very next sentence.
given the ambiguity between the provision establishing three methods of exercising the limited power of appointment and the conclusive presumption provision,we can not say that cynthia proposed action would nullify howard trusts or attempt to nullify any of the trusts provisions.here,the trustors intent is not so clearly or unequivocally expressed that it would be frustrated by the beneficiary proposed action.cynthia may offer extrinsic evidence of their intent,and mark does not contend otherwise.she may be able to convince the trial court that howard and maxine had no reason to use different conclusive presumptions for the limited and general powers of appointment.in that event,if the trial court reforms the conclusive presumption provision for the limited power of inserting the additional clause found in the conclusive presumption provision for the general power of provision of the trusts would be nullified.
mark offers several reasons to support the requirement that the survivor will or codicil be filed within days after death,such as determining whether all of the survivor property is in the trust,aiding the trustee in the proper distribution of assets,and ensuring that a will or codicil has not superseded or modified a prior exercise of appointment made through an acknowledged instrument delivered to the trustee.nevertheless,these are reasons that go to the merits of the parties dispute and should be saved for trial.see estate of ferber,supra,th at,d davies,supra,th at,d estate of kaila,supra,th at,d.
in sum,cynthia contention that the ambiguous language is the result of a scrivener error and that the error should therefore be remedied in accordance with the grantors intent does not violate the no contest clauses in the trusts.
appropriate remedies 
in his opening brief,mark asserts that the reformation of a trust constitutes a contest because cynthia is seeking to modify or change the language of the trust in response to a drafting mistake.but there is no such rule.the reformation of a trust language does not necessarily frustrate the trustor intent or seek to nullify a provision of the trust.it may,in fact,clarify an ambiguity or resolve a conflict within the document so as to state the trustor intent more clearly or unequivocally.similarly,under section,an interpretation excusing cynthia from having to file a will or giving effect to the acknowledged instrument not run afoul of the no contest clauses given that cynthia would have to prove she substantially complied with the manner of appointment prescribed by the trusts and the failure to comply with all of the pertinent formalities did not defeat a significant purpose of the trustors.in these circumstances,no provision of the trusts would be nullified.
reformation 
in her application for declaratory relief,cynthia requested that the trial court reform the conflicting provisions of the limited power of appointment by inserting the following italicized clause into the conclusive presumption provision if no will or codicil purporting to be that of the survivor is filed for probate within sixty days of his or her death,and if no written,acknowledged instrument is filed with the trustee prior to the end of such period,it shall be conclusively presumed that the survivor did not exercise this limited power of appointment.the conclusive presumption provision for the limited power of appointment would then read like the comparable provision governing the general power of appointment.
if,due to a mistake,the trust does not contain the terms that were intended by the settlor,the settlor or other interested party may maintain a suit in equity to have the instrument reformed so that it will contain the terms that were actually agreed upon or that reflect the testator actual intent.the more common type of error,which may be made by the settlor or the scrivener,is a drafting error that is referred to as a mistake in expression.radford et,the law of trusts and trustees ed,italics added,fns.omitted,followed in bilafer bilafer th,d see id.at,d.
equity may intervene to correct a mistake in a trust whether it is an inter vivos trust or a testamentary trust,and may reform an inter vivos trust even after the settlor is dead.but the traditional presumption against reforming mistakes in wills may present an additional challenge for a petitioner who seeks the reformation of a testamentary trust.radford et,the law of trusts and trustees,supra,at,fns.omitted,italics added and omitted.under california law,ambiguities in names and descriptions in a will may be resolved by considering extrinsic evidence of decedent intent but t here is older authority holding that drafting errors of omission omitting a beneficiary name or a residuary clause may not be corrected by reformation hence,extrinsic evidence of the testator intent in drafting the will is inadmissible.the theory is that correction would require the addition of a new provision and courts may not add anything to a will.ross,cal.practice guide probate the rutter group to,to,italics added and omitted.in light of more recent changes in the probate code,however,the continuing validity of the older cases is doubtful.see,citing,subd.c.
regardless of any distinctions made in the reformation of a will,they need not detain us.at common law,a trial court had the equitable power to reform an irrevocable trust where a drafting error defeats the trustor intentions case law confirms that this authority remains today.bilafer bilafer,supra,th at,d,italics added.
in ike doolittle th,d ike,after the death of the trustors,the trial court addressed three ambiguities in a trust and a related property agreement.first,upon its creation,the trust was funded with the separate and community property of the trustors.the trust provided that the property would retain its separate or community nature.yet,the same day the trust was executed,the trustors signed a separate property agreement that appeared to indicate they had agreed to transmute all of their separate property into community property.second,the trust contained an intestacy clause with respect to any property not distributed through its other provisions but also named several beneficiaries of the trustors.in a subsequent amendment to the trust,the trustors retained the names of several beneficiaries but did not make clear whether the intestacy clause had been revoked.as a consequence of these two ambiguities,upon the survivor death,the trustee could not determine whether the property should go to the beneficiaries named in the trust or to the heirs of the survivor,thereby giving rise to a third ambiguity.see id.at,d.after considering extrinsic evidence,the trial court reformed the trust,changing its language in several respects,such that the property would be distributed to the named beneficiaries.see id.at,d.
the court of appeal affirmed.as a preliminary matter,it independently concluded that the trust documents contained the same three ambiguities identified by the trial court.see ike,supra,th at,d.the court of appeal also commented an ambiguity in a written instrument exists when,in light of the circumstances surrounding the execution of the instrument,the written language is fairly susceptible of two or more constructions.
where a trust instrument contains some expression of the trustor intention,but as a result of a drafting error that expression is made ambiguous,a trial court may admit and consider extrinsic evidence,including the drafter testimony,to resolve the ambiguity and give effect to the trustor intention as expressed in the trust instrument.ike,supra,th at,d,citations omitted.
after reviewing the case law on the reformation of trusts,the court in ike continued we reject the assertion that a trial court can not modify a trust to remedy a drafting error.in california,the common law equitable power of a trial court to modify or reform a trust extends to situations where,as here,the trust instrument contains some expression of the trustor intention,but a drafting error renders that expression ambiguous 
we thus conclude the court below had equitable power,founded in common law,to modify the trust provided a peculiar or exceptional circumstance made modification necessary to accomplish the purpose of the trustors,and there was some expression in the trust instrument of the purpose of the trustors.we conclude that a drafting error in a trust instrument which renders ambiguous an expression contained therein regarding the administrative or distributive intentions of the trustor s constitutes a peculiar or exceptional circumstance which may justify an equitable modification of a trust instrument to accomplish the purpose of the trustor s.ike,supra,th at,d,citations omitted.
the court in ike also rejected an argument mark makes here,namely,sections to,entitled modification and termination of trusts,do not permit the reformation of a trust due to a scrivener error.yet,as ike points out section,subdivision a,allows a trustee or beneficiary to petition the court concerning the internal affairs of the trust subdivision b sets forth a nonexclusive list of examples of proceedings which concern the internal affairs of the trust within the meaning of section,subdivision a.among the examples relevant herein are a scertaining beneficiaries and determining to whom the property shall pass or be delivered upon final termination of the trust,to the extent the determination is not made by the trust instrument,subd.b and a pproving or directing the modification of the trust,subd.b.we note these statutory provisions are broadly worded.
it is true the law revision commission comment to section states in part that a s to modification of trusts,see sections however,none of the provisions in these sections state that these various provisions set forth the exclusive grounds for modification of a trust.
absent such an express statutory provision limiting the grounds for modification of a trust to those set forth in section et,we conclude the broader equitable power of trial courts to modify or reform a trust is preserved by operation of section,which expressly provides except to the extent that the common law rules governing trusts are modified by statute,the common law as to trusts is the law of this state.ike,supra,th at,d,citation and fn.omitted accord,bilafer bilafer,supra,th at,d.
finally,ike noted that a provision of the civil code provides the basis for reforming a trust in its statement of decision,the trial court reasoned that a declaration of trust,like any other contract,may be reformed and revised under california civil code section to correct a drafting error which,if left intact,would conflict with the actual expressed intent of the contracting parties.
civil code section provides when contract may be revised.when,through fraud or a mutual mistake of the parties,or a mistake of one party,which the other at the time knew or suspected,a written contract does not truly express the intention of the parties,it may be revised on the application of a party aggrieved,so as to express that intention,so far as it can be done without prejudice to rights acquired by third persons,in good faith and for value.
in getty getty d,the court of appeal held that an intended trust beneficiary had standing to seek reformation of a trust agreement under civil code section.in so holding,the getty court noted that civil code section is a codification of the equitable action for reformation of a written instrument,and the sole purpose of the reformation doctrine is to correct a written instrument in order to effectuate a common intention of the parties which was incorrectly reduced to writing however,the getty court also noted that a court can not create a new agreement for the parties under a theory of reformation 
we thus conclude that civil code section recognizes the equitable common law power of a trial court to reform a trust agreement based on mistake,but not to create a new trust agreement under the theory of reformation.ike,supra,th at,d,citations omitted accord,witkin,summary of cal.law ed.trusts,discussing ike witkin,summary of cal.law,supra,contracts,at civil code section permits reformation of trusts.here,cynthia seeks to reform the limited power of appointment based on a drafting mistake and to implement the trustors intent,not create a new agreement the trustors never considered or intended.
nor does the reformation of a trust necessarily violate a no contest clause,as made clear in the restatement third of property,which california courts often find persuasive.see,villa de las palmas homeowners terifaj cal th,d,peak investments south peak homeowners,th,d.the restatement provides a suit to construe,reform,or modify the language of a donative document is not a contest of the document and hence is not a violation of a clause,unless the construction,reformation,or modification advocated by the person bringing the suit would invalidate the donative document or any of its provisions a proceeding brought by a beneficiary for the purpose of resolving an ambiguity,or for reforming or modifying the document,valid under all possible constructions or valid under the construction advocated by the beneficiary,is not a contest in such a case,the beneficiary is seeking merely to determine and to protect the donor intention and is not seeking to circumvent it rest d property,com.d,italics added.cynthia proposed action is based on an ambiguity in howard trusts,and her construction of the conflicting language would not invalidate the trusts or any of their provisions but would implement the trustors intention.
as the california law revision commission has explained in discussing no contest clauses to effectuate the trustor true intentions,it may be necessary to seek judicial construction of an ambiguous provision or the modification,reformation,or termination of an instrument that has become incompatible with the trustor intentions.the need to determine the trustor actual intentions may trump his or her desire to avoid litigation.recommendation revision of no contest clause statute cal.law revision com,italics added hereafter no contest recommendation.a beneficiary should not be punished for bringing an action to ensure the proper interpretation,reformation,or administration of an estate plan.such actions serve the public policy of facilitating the fair and efficient administration of estates and help to effectuate the trustor intentions,which might otherwise be undone by mistake,ambiguity,or changed circumstances.id.at,italics added.
we disagree with the notion that the mere name of the remedy,reformation,or whether a no contest clause would be violated.a no contest clause usually focuses on a beneficiary attempt to invalidate the trust,to void,nullify,or set aside or thwart a provision therein,or to frustrate the trustor intent.such clauses do not,in general,bar particular remedies by appellation.effect of the beneficiary proposed form,is controlling.see.for instance,in armijo,a will contained conflicting property designations,with one lot to be sold by the personal representative and the other to remain the property of the testator daughter.but,as the testator knew,part of the daughter house rested on the lot to be sold.the personal representative resolved the problem by obtaining a variance from the city settling the encroachment infrequent remedy where testamentary provisions are in conflict.in separate litigation,the personal representative sought to disinherit the daughter under a no contest clause,alleging she resisted his efforts to resolve the property issue.the trial court agreed.the new mexico court of appeals reversed,concluding that the daughter had sought to clarify an ambiguity in the will,not to nullify or invalidate any of its provisions.id.at.
mark reliance on our decision in davies,supra,th,d,is misplaced.we did not hold there that the reformation of a trust is always,or typically,a contest.in davies,the trustor amended the trust twice after he was placed under a conservatorship.the second amendment provided that if one of the beneficiaries,douglas,died within days of the trustor,his share was to be divided equally among the remaining beneficiaries.after the trustor died,a dispute arose as to whether douglas had lived the requisite days.douglas widow brought an application under section,seeking a declaration that douglas had satisfied the provision.she also sought to reform the same provision on the grounds that the trust could not be amended after the first conservator was appointed and douglas had not received proper notice of a prior proceeding in which the probate court had confirmed the amendments in part.the no contest clause stated that it revoked the bequest to any beneficiary who challenge d any amendment to the trust or contest ed the capacity of the trustor to amend the trust.davies,at,d.the trial court granted the widow application in full.
we affirmed in part,agreeing that a determination of whether douglas died within days of the trustor was not a contest.that question,we said,is an unequivocal acquiescence in the condition the trustor imposed on the bequest to douglas and,as such,plainly not a challenge to the trust or either of its amendments.davies,supra,th at,d.
and we reversed in part.with respect to the widow remaining contentions,we explained one of the surviving beneficiaries contends the widow proposed challenges to the notice given at the time the amendments were confirmed by the probate court,and to the validity of the amendments on the ground that the trustor was the subject of a conservatorship at the time the first amendment was made,are tantamount to indirect attacks on the amendments.we agree.
the widow challenge to the validity of the order approving the first and second amendments on either of these grounds,if successful,would either unravel the trustor estate plan completely by destroying the amendments in their entirety,or require a reformation of the second amendment to delete the days survivorship clause which would,by definition,constitute a contest a contest is not confined to a direct attack on a will or trust instrument,but may include a separate legal proceeding that would thwart or nullify or unravel the testator expressed wishes.davies,supra,th at,d,boldface and some italics added,fn.omitted.
unlike the challenges in davies,cynthia application for declaratory relief does not question the validity of the trusts or any of their provisions.nor does she seek to destroy or d
