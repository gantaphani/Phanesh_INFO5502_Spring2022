albert lissoy,a creditor of the estate of roberta myers,deceased,appeals from a summary judgment disposing of his petition for an order pursuant to probate code section.lissoy petition sought to recover profits from the sale of real property for the benefit of the estate creditors,based upon a claim the property had previously been fraudulently conveyed by myers.the probate court determined lissoy petition failed as a matter of law because he lacked standing to pursue an order under section he failed to exhaust his right to require the executor of the estate to pursue the claim under section and his claim was barred by the applicable statutes of limitations.we disagree with each of these conclusions,and therefore must reverse.
as this case was decided on summary judgment,and our review is de novo,we will recite the evidence in the light most favorable to lissoy.schooler state of california th,d.
most of the facts are undisputed.lissoy is a creditor of the estate of roberta myers,deceased.the estate is insolvent.lissoy claim against the estate was approved in the amount of,but has been satisfied only to the extent of.myers debt to lissoy stems from a business transaction in which myers and her daughter,diana sheppard,had purchased a bar and restaurant business from lissoy.when the venture proved unsuccessful,myers and sheppard defaulted.
lissoy subsequently filed a lawsuit,seeking money damages from both myers and sheppard.both of them later declared bankruptcy,and lissoy lawsuit was stayed.meanwhile,respondent joe leach became romantically involved with sheppard in,and they began living together in.
myers was denied a discharge of the lissoy debt in her bankruptcy proceeding.shortly after that order was affirmed on appeal,in october of,she sold her residence,located on wellington avenue in santa ana,to leach.however,myers continued to reside in the home,and there is evidence she reimbursed leach for his down payment and continued to pay the mortgage and all expenses associated with the wellington residence.in may of,myers executed a holographic will,in which she directed that my house on wellington,santa ana,ca in the name of joe leach is to be sold and any profits are to be divided among my four children 
myers died in september of,while her bankruptcy was still pending.sheppard was appointed as personal representative of the probate estate.at the time of her death,myers continued to reside in the wellington property.in january of,leach entered into an agreement to sell the wellington property,and the transaction was completed in march of.
however,myers bankruptcy case remained active,despite her death,and lissoy received a disbursement from the bankruptcy in november of.the bankruptcy case was finally closed in january of.after lissoy learned that myers bankruptcy had terminated,and that she was deceased,he reactivated his civil lawsuit against her,and filed a creditor claim in the probate matter.
lissoy creditor claim was eventually settled,and his claim approved by the probate court in the reduced amount of.as part of that settlement,the claim was satisfied in part,leaving an outstanding balance of,which was entered as a judgment in the civil case in february of.sheppard acknowledged in the settlement agreement that lissoy claimed to have standing,as an unsatisfied creditor,to file certain actions,either within the probate proceeding or independently of it,against third parties.sheppard expressly declared,however,that she does not believe these other actions have legal merit are not economically feasible to pursue.
on december,lissoy filed his verified petition against leach pursuant to section,seeking an order requiring leach to account for,and disgorge to the estate,the profits he had realized from his subsequent resale of the wellington residence.that petition alleges most of the undisputed facts recited above,and additionally alleges that myers sale of the wellington residence to leach had been a intentional fraudulent scheme designed to hide that asset from myers creditors.it specifically alleges that leach was to hold the property as a straw for myers,in an intentional attempt to hinder,defraud and delay lissoy in the collection of his claims against myers.it characterizes the transaction as a fraudulent transfer to leach of bare legal title to the wellington avenue property the petition also alleges that daughter,the representative of her estate,and leach love,was an active participant and coconspirator in the scheme.
leach expressly denied the fraud claims,and insisted that his purchase of the wellington property was entirely aboveboard,unconditional and legitimate.he then moved for summary judgment,arguing that lissoy claims which he characterized as being for enforcement of secret trust,breach of secret trust and constructive trust were barred by the applicable statutes of limitations.
in opposition to the summary judgment motion,lissoy offered to support his fraudulent transfer and conspiracy allegations,consisting primarily of a lengthy declaration from another of myers daughters.that daughter,a mortgage broker,declared that she had personally arranged the sale of the wellington property to leach,at the request of both myers and sheppard,and that all parties,including leach,treated the transaction as one in name only.that daughter also arranged to subsequent sale of the wellington property from leach to a third party,and explained that leach acted as essentially a straw man in that transaction as well,with his involvement limited to merely signing the documents.
the daughter also declared that all three of sheppard siblings,herself included,had demanded in writing that sheppard pursue leach on behalf of myers estate for the profits he had realized from the sale of the wellington property.sheppard ignored them.
in reply,leach argued,for the first time,that lissoy had no remedy at all under section,and that his only remedy was to make a demand under section that sheppard pursue a claim against leach on behalf of the probate estate.
on the date scheduled for the hearing,lissoy objected to leach introduction of a new legal argument in the reply brief,and requested additional time to respond.the court granted the request,and gave both sides an additional opportunity to brief the issues raised in the reply brief.
on the continued oral argument date,lissoy offered the court newly discovered evidence suggesting that sheppard and leach were actually married,and were holding title to their own residence as husband and wife.after hearing oral argument,the court took the matter under submission,and subsequently granted judgment in favor of leach.
in its decision,the court reasoned that without regard to the merits of lissoy claim,it had accrued no later than december,when lissoy learned that leach had repudiated any supposed obligation to hold the wellington property or its proceeds in trust for the benefit of myers.since lissoy did not file his petition until december,his claim was barred under either a breach of oral trust agreement or a fraudulent conveyance statute of limitations.
the court further concluded that lissoy was precluded from bringing any direct claims against leach until he had exhaust ed his remedy under section to seek an order directing the personal representative of the estate of roberta myers,deceased,to pursue an alleged claim of a fraudulent conveyance made by the decedent.finally,the court concluded that lissoy lacked standing to seek an order under section in any event,as he was not claiming any direct ownership interest in the wellington property.
in the course of its ruling,the court dismissed as not relevant all evidence suggesting that sheppard was a coconspirator in the fraudulent scheme to deprive myers creditors of the proceeds of the wellington property and sheppard had a conflict of interest which precluded her,in her capacity as estate representative,from pursuing a claim for fraudulent conveyance against leach.the court said none of that evidence created a triable issue of fact regarding the applicable statutes of limitations,and requiring lissoy to make a demand of the personal representative of the myers estate to pursue a claim against leach would be an idle act only if leach himself were the personal representative.
first,we conclude lissoy petition asserted a claim for fraudulent conveyance,and nothing else.leach attempt to characterize it as a petition for enforcement of a secret trust or as seeking damages of breach of secret trust is unpersuasive.although lissoy did allege that myers and leach had entered into an agreement under which leach would hold the wellington property in secret trust for myers,he was hardly seeking to enforce that agreement.the petition clearly establishes that the purpose of that trust was to defraud myers creditors,and in particular lissoy himself.consequently,the alleged secret trust was the sine qua non of the fraudulent scheme.lissoy was a victim of that alleged scheme,not its beneficiary.
rather than seeking to enforce the alleged agreement between myers and lissoy expressly characterized as a fraud designed to hinder defraud and delay myers sought instead to unravel its effects and force leach to disgorge the illegal profits he had obtained through his direct participation in for the benefit of myers creditors.that is a classic fraudulent conveyance claim.
moreover,as leach essentially concedes,the statute of limitations on that common law fraudulent conveyance claim did not commence running until lissoy had obtained a final judgment against myers in the underlying action.adams bell cal d,cortez vogt th,d macedo bosio th,d.that did not occur until april.lissoy claim,then,could be filed any time within three years of that date.consequently,his petition,if otherwise sufficient to state that claim,was timely.
the second question we face is whether lissoy had standing to pursue that claim via a petition for order under section.the answer is yes.
section provides in pertinent part that the personal representative or any interested person is permitted to file a petition requesting that the court make an order in certain cases,including where the decedent died in possession of,or holding title to,real or personal property,and the property or some interest therein is claimed to belong to another and where the decedent died having a claim to real or personal property,title to or possession of which is held by another,subds.a c a d.this provision is intended to operate as a mechanism for pursuing claims,causes of action,or matters that are normally raised in a civil action to the extent that the matters are related factually to the subject matter of a petition filed under this part.
on its face,section certainly appears to apply to the type of dispute presented in lissoy petition.lissoy offered substantial evidence demonstrating that at the time of myers death,she was in possession of the wellington property,which leach claims to own.moreover,there was also evidence that myers,who purported to direct the disposition of the wellington property in her will after acknowledging that title was held by leach,claimed at least a beneficial interest in the property,title to which was held by leach,at the time of her death.for purposes of summary judgment,we must presume those facts to be true,and they bring this dispute squarely within both of the quoted provisions of section.
additionally,the probate code defines an interested person as including a n heir,devisee,child,spouse,creditor,beneficiary,and any other person having a property right in or claim against a trust estate or the estate of a decedent which may be affected by the proceeding.thus lissoy,as a creditor of myers estate,presumptively qualifies to initiate a proceeding under section 
and finally,the authorities cited by leach,concluding that only one who claims an ownership interest in the disputed property would have standing under section,are inapposite,as they are based upon former section,the predecessor to section.
former section,provided in pertinent part if a person dies in possession of,or holding title to,real or personal property which,or some interest in which,is claimed to belong to another,or dies having a claim to real or personal property,title to or possession of which is held by another,the executor,administrator,or any claimant may file with the clerk of the court a verified petition setting forth the facts upon which the claim is predicated as amended by stats,ch,and repealed by stats,ch,italics added see estate of baumann d.hence,under that provision,standing was expressly limited to the estate representative or a claimant.as explained in estate of scott d,a case relied upon by leach,section thus provides a vehicle for the executrix to recover property that belongs in the estate,or for a claimant to recover from the estate property that rightfully belongs to the claimant.id.at.that is no longer true,however,since the current incarnation of section is not limited to estate representatives and property claimants.it has a broader standing provision,allowing any sufficiently interested person,presumptively including a creditor,to also independently pursue such an order within the probate proceeding.estate of scott is consequently inapposite.
estate of sayles d,was likewise decided pursuant to former section,and thus of little persuasive effect in ascertaining the parameters of standing under current section.but sayles is inapposite for another reason,as well.in that case,the petitioner was claiming she personally had an interest in the property at issue,because she held an unrecorded deed of trust.she was not challenging the validity of any claim of title.the court noted that in cases arising under former section,the claimant in each instance sought a declaration of title,ownership,or possession of the property at stake id.at,and concluded petitioner mere claim of an unrecorded security interest did not,in and of itself,rise to that level.the purpose of section is to allow parties to try the question of title to property as between a representative of the estate and strangers to the estate.ibid.
in this case,by contrast to sayles,the dispute at the center of the section petition is about title to the wellington,whether title passed from myers to leach properly and unconditionally,as leach contends or was merely held by leach pursuant to a plan to thwart myers creditors,as myers own will and her apparent reimbursement of leach investment in the purchase suggests may have been the case.consequently,we conclude this case falls within the parameters of section.
the final basis of the court summary judgment in favor of leach was the determination that lissoy sole means,within the probate proceeding,of attacking myers transfer of the wellington property to leach,was a demand that sheppard pursue a claim on the estate behalf pursuant to section.
section states in pertinent part a on application of a creditor of the decedent or the estate,the personal representative shall commence and prosecute an action for the recovery of real or personal property of the decedent for the benefit of creditors if the personal representative has insufficient assets to pay creditors and the decedent during lifetime did any of the following with respect to the property made a conveyance of the property,or any right or interest in the property,that is fraudulent as to creditors under the uniform fraudulent transfer act b a creditor making application under this section shall pay such part of the costs and expenses of the suit and attorney fees,or give an undertaking to the personal representative for that purpose,as the personal representative and the creditor agree,or,absent an agreement,as the court or judge orders.
nothing in the language of section suggests it is intended to be an exclusive remedy.however,leach relies upon katz driscoll d,for the proposition that i t has been held,however,that a creditor may not maintain an action to set aside a fraudulent conveyance,at least until the creditor has exhausted all means of procuring such an action to be brought by the executor or administrator.id.at.leach also points to emmons barton cal,liuzza bell d,and silva superior court d.
based upon these cases,leach asserts that lissoy is precluded from pursuing a
