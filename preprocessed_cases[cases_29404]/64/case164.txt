introduction 
this opinion addresses two appellate proceedings a writ petition and an appeal that arise from the same juvenile dependency cases in the san francisco superior court the juvenile court,and were consolidated in this court.the person seeking appellate review in both matters is the paternal grandmother grandmother of a group of siblings who are the subject of the dependency proceedings.grandmother was appointed guardian of the sibling group by the probate department of the san mateo superior court the probate court in,more than five years before the initial petition was filed in the dependency proceedings.
grandmother appeal was taken from a juvenile court order granting two petitions filed jointly by the two youngest members collectively minors of the sibling group one under welfare and institutions code section seeking to terminate grandmother predependency probate guardianship,and another under section,seeking to change minors placement by removing them from grandmother custody,and placing them in the home of an aunt and uncle aunt and uncle.grandmother writ petition challenges the juvenile court subsequent order setting a permanency planning hearing under section.
grandmother contends that the juvenile court could not terminate her probate guardianship in the absence of a recommendation from the san francisco human services agency the agency.she also argues that the termination could not take effect in the absence of an order from the probate court.we reject both of these contentions,and hold that under the governing statutes,a juvenile court has the authority to terminate a predependency probate guardianship in response to a motion filed by counsel for the dependent minors,whether or not the social services agency that initiated the dependency proceedings so recommends,and even if the probate guardianship was established in a different county.
grandmother also argues the juvenile court erred in changing minors placement without finding by clear and convincing evidence that her continued custody of minors would be detrimental to them removing minors from her custody without offering her reunification services and setting a permanency planning hearing under section without first offering her an opportunity to reunify with minors.all of these contentions rest on the premise that grandmother probate guardianship was improperly terminated.as we reject that premise,we also reject grandmother additional arguments.
facts and procedural background 
in december,the probate court appointed grandmother to be the legal guardian of minors,their two older full siblings siblings,and their mother oldest child,their.at the time,minors father was serving an extended prison sentence,and their mother could not be located from december until the spring of,minors and siblings,as well as the older,lived with grandmother in san francisco.
the agency initiated the dependency proceedings in march,after siblings complained that grandmother was physically abusing them.in august,the juvenile court placed siblings with aunt and uncle,and returned minors to grandmother custody.in june,minors counsel filed a section petition seeking to change minors placement to the home of aunt and uncle,and to terminate grandmother probate guardianship.the juvenile court denied the petition,and minors appealed the prior appeal.
in june,this court affirmed the denial of minors section petition.in re june,nonpub.opn.in re we held that a section petition is not the appropriate procedural vehicle for terminating a predependency probate guardianship.in re,supra.we also held that because grandmother was a predependency probate guardian rather than a dependency guardian id.at,minors could not be removed from her custody in the absence of clear and convincing evidence of one of the grounds for removal specified in section,subdivision c.id,fn.omitted.
while the prior appeal was pending,in february,minors filed another section petition,and a petition under section for termination of grandmother probate guardianship the february petitions on april,the juvenile court denied the february section petition,and set the february section petition for hearing on june.on that date,however,the hearing was continued to august.
on august,after our opinion on the prior appeal became final,minors filed another section petition and another section petition the august petitions.hearings on the august petitions were conducted during portions of four nonconsecutive days,starting on august,and ending on november.at the conclusion of the hearings,the juvenile court entered an order granting both of the august petitions,terminating grandmother probate guardianship,and placing minors with aunt and uncle.the court ordered that grandmother be afforded visitation with minors,but did not order any reunification services for her.grandmother filed a timely notice of appeal from that order.
in the meantime,the agency twice recommended to the juvenile court that the dependency proceedings regarding minors be dismissed,based on its view that minors were no longer in a situation that called for juvenile court intervention.at a hearing on january,the juvenile court entered an order setting a permanency planning hearing under section.grandmother filed a timely notice of intent to file a writ petition seeking review of that order.we consolidated the proceedings in this court,appointed counsel to represent minors and issued a stay of the section hearing pending resolution of grandmother appeal and writ petition.
discussiona.termination of probate guardianship 
grandmother principal contention is that the juvenile court erred in terminating her probate guardianship of minors under subdivision a of section.her arguments raise questions of law regarding the interpretation of the statute,as to which our review is de novo.in re th,krug maschmeier th.w hen construing any statute,o ur task is to discern the legislature intent.the statutory language itself is the most reliable indicator,so we start with the statute words,assigning them their usual and ordinary meanings,and construing them in context.if the words themselves are not ambiguous,we presume the legislature meant what it said,and the statute plain meaning governs.on the other hand,if the language allows more than one reasonable construction,we may look to such aids as the legislative history of the measure and maxims of statutory construction.in cases of uncertain meaning,we may also consider the consequences of a particular interpretation,including its impact on public policy.citation.krug maschmeier,supra,th at,quoting wells learning foundation cal th.
section was enacted in.stats,ch.as relevant to the issues presented in this appellate proceeding,subdivision a of the statute provides as follows the juvenile court may terminate or modify a guardianship of the person of a minor previously established under the probate code,if the minor is the subject of a petition filed under section,or.if the probation officer supervising the minor provides information to the court regarding the minor present circumstances and makes a recommendation to the court regarding a motion to terminate or modify a guardianship established in any county under the probate code,of the person of a minor who is before the juvenile court under a petition filed under section,or,the court shall order the appropriate county department,or the district attorney or county counsel,to file the recommended motion.the motion may also be made by the guardian or the minor attorney.italics added.
we held in in re,supra,that under the plain language of section,counsel for minors in a dependency proceeding has the authority to file a motion in the juvenile court to terminate a predependency probate guardianship,without first obtaining an order from the juvenile court ordering or authorizing counsel to do so.id.that holding is the law of the case in this matter.see generally people boyer cal th.grandmother has neither argued otherwise,nor attempted to persuade us that the law has changed in the interim.in any event,we adhere to our prior reading of the statute plain language.
grandmother argues,however,that the minors counsel may not file a motion under section unless and until the social services agency that initiated the dependency the responsible agency has recommended termination of the probate guardianship.similarly,grandmother contends that the juvenile court order terminating the guardianship is not effective unless it rests on a recommendation from the responsible agency.as authority for these arguments,grandmother cites in re angel th angel,arguing that a careful reading of that opinion reveals the need for a recommendation from the responsible agency before a predependency probate guardianship can be terminated by a juvenile court.
in angel,supra,th,as here,a minor relative was appointed by a probate court as the minor guardian.the minor was injured while in the guardian custody,and dependency proceedings were initiated.the minor was placed in foster care.after the probate guardian failed to reunify with the minor,the responsible agency recommended that the probate guardianship be terminated.based on that recommendation,the juvenile court ordered the responsible agency to file a motion to terminate the probate guardianship.id.at.in response,the agency filed a petition under section,rather than a motion under section.id.at.the juvenile court terminated the probate guardianship,and the guardian appealed.the third district held that the agency motion should have been filed under section,but that the error did not deprive the juvenile court of jurisdiction to terminate the probate guardianship,and the procedural issues had been waived by the guardian failure to object in the juvenile court proceedings.accordingly,the court affirmed the order terminating the probate guardianship.id.at.
in the course of its discussion of these issues,the court in angel described the section procedure as contemplat ing two steps.citations.first,the probation officer or social worker makes a recommendation to the court to terminate the probate guardianship.citation.upon receiving the recommendation,the court must order the appropriate agency or county counsel to file a motion pursuant to section.citations.once the motion is before the juvenile court,the juvenile court then makes a determination whether to enter an order terminating the probate guardianship.angel,supra,th at.
we agree with the angel court that this is the procedure to be followed when the social worker is the one taking the initiative the situation described in the second sentence of section,subdivision a,which provides if the probation officer,social worker supervising the minor makes a recommendation to the court regarding a motion to terminate a guardianship established under the probate code,the court shall order the responsible agency to file the recommended motion,subd.a,italics added.however,the angel court was not dealing with a case in which the initiative to terminate the probate guardianship came from the minor.this situation is governed by the last sentence of section,subdivision a,which allows the minor counsel to file the motion,and makes no mention of any precondition to counsel authority to do so.
essentially,grandmother argument is that the qualifying clause at the beginning of the second sentence of the statute if the probation officer makes a recommendation also governs the succeeding sentence authorizing the minor counsel to file the motion.this argument is contrary to the rule of statutory interpretation that qualifying words,phrases and clauses are to be applied to the words or phrases immediately adjacent to them,and are not to be construed as extending to or including others more remote.see generally renee superior court cal th,superseded by statute on another ground as stated in in re angelique th,people franklin th.accordingly,we decline to construe the statute in this fashion.thus,minors section petition was properly brought by their counsel in this case.
grandmother apparently concedes that when a minor who is a ward under an existing probate guardianship becomes the subject of dependency proceedings,the juvenile court has statutory jurisdiction under section to terminate the probate guardianship.angel,supra,th at.indeed,under section,the juvenile court has exclusive jurisdiction over custody and guardianship issues regarding a minor who is the subject of dependency proceedings.
section provides after a juvenile dependency petition has been filed,and until the time that the petition is dismissed or dependency is terminated,no other division of any superior court may hear proceedings under the family code regarding the custody of the child or proceedings under the probate code,except as otherwise authorized in this code,regarding the establishment of a guardianship for the child.while the child is under the jurisdiction of the juvenile court all issues regarding his or her custody shall be heard by the juvenile court.similarly,rule a of the california rules of court provides once a petition has been filed in juvenile court alleging that a child is described by a subsection of section,and until the petition is dismissed or dependency is terminated,the juvenile court has sole and exclusive jurisdiction over matters relating to the custody of the child and visitation with the child.
minors cite in re william d for the proposition that while dependency proceedings are pending,juvenile courts have exclusive jurisdiction over custody,visitation,and guardianship of the minors who are the subject of the dependency petition.grandmother disputes the authoritativeness of this decision.whether or not in re william was correctly decided has no bearing the issue involved in the present proceedings,however.the statutory scheme has changed since in re william was decided in.
section was not enacted until.stats,ch.under the law in effect at the time in re william was decided,former section expressly gave family law courts concurrent jurisdiction over custody matters involving minors who were also the subject of dependency proceedings in juvenile court.see in re william,supra,d at.that statute,however,was repealed by the very same legislative enactment that added section.stats,ch.this history serves to underscore that the legislature intent in enacting section was to vest the juvenile court with exclusive jurisdiction over dependent minors.thus,grandmother challenge to the continuing validity of in re william,supra,does not affect our reading of the statutory scheme as it now exists.
in addition to her general challenge to the exclusivity of the juvenile court jurisdiction over minors who are the subject of dependency proceedings,grandmother appeal briefs specifically argue that section does not permit a juvenile court to modify an order issued by a probate court in another county.this argument relies on a misconstruction of the record.the juvenile court in the present case did not modify grandmother probate guardianship in response to minors petition under section.rather,the juvenile court terminated grandmother probate guardianship in response to minors motion under section.that statute expressly authorizes a juvenile court with dependency jurisdiction over a minor to terminate a predependency probate guardianship of that minor,and does not limit that authority to probate guardianships established in the same county.
grandmother also argues that the termination of a predependency probate guardianship by a juvenile court is not effective unless and until it is confirmed by an equivalent order from the probate court.this argument is belied by the plain language of section,subdivisions a and b,and the implementing court rules,california rules of court,rules a and e.section,subdivision a provides unambiguously that a juvenile court may terminate a probate guardianship.italics added.grandmother interpretation of the statute would render that language meaningless.an interpretation that renders statutory language a nullity is obviously to be avoided.citation.citation.in re,supra,th at,quoting williams superior court cal th.
moreover,when the statutory scheme does refer to the probate court,it does so in a way that makes clear grandmother position is incorrect.section,subdivision b,as
