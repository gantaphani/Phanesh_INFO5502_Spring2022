introduction 
there were disputes,including threats of litigation,between a brother and sister concerning the distribution of their deceased father assets.during the period of the disputes,the attorney for the brother became dissatisfied when the proposed listing agent for one of the father real property assets,allegedly at the sister direction,failed to send the attorney a listing agreement for the property and a proposal from a potential buyer.the attorney left voicemail messages that accused the listing agent of conspiring with the sister to defraud the brother and that threatened to take appropriate action.the sister sued the brother attorney for defamation based on those messages.the attorney filed a motion to strike the sister complaint under the of civil procedure section section.the trial court denied the motion,and the attorney appeals.in reversing,we hold that the messages,under these circumstances,are covered by the statute and the litigation privilege in civil code section,subdivision b section,and that the lawyer motion should have been granted.
background 
peter metsos died on march.he left a will,the metsos family trust,and the peter metsos trust.george metsos metsos,peter metsos son,was appointed executor of the peter metsos trust.the metsos family trust included a number of corporations that managed and operated individual restaurants the metsos family trust also owned real estate related to at least some of these restaurants.among the corporations in the metsos family trust was,which managed and operated the lamplighter restaurant.
from at least january,metsos and his sister,plaintiff and respondent sophia metsos rohde plaintiff,had a dispute concerning the distribution of their father assets.defendant and appellant michael wolf defendant,an attorney,and his law firm,wolf,rifkin,shapiro schulman,llp,represented metsos in that dispute.
on february,defendant wrote a letter to randolph catanese,plaintiff attorney,addressing a number of issues in the dispute.by letter dated that same day,catanese responded,generally,when i receive letters of this type i do not respond with a letter,but rather with a lawsuit.it is readily apparent that you and your client have no desire to resolve the issues between our respective clients absent court intervention.accordingly,the intended purpose of this letter is to apprise you and your client of what will be contained in a lawsuit,in part,when one is filed.
thereafter,on april,catanese,plaintiff,plaintiff husband,and defendant met and agreed that certain real property located in chatsworth the real estate related to the lamplighter restaurant would be sold and the net proceeds divided equally between plaintiff and metsos.steve weiss of nai capital was to be the listing agent and to prepare a listing agreement.each of the sides was to keep the other informed of any developments concerning the listing and sale of the property.nothing was to proceed with respect to the sale of the property without the mutual consent of metsos and plaintiff.
on april,defendant spoke with weiss and advised him that he was to be included in all communications regarding the listing and sale of the property.weiss informed defendant that he would be putting together a proposal for plaintiff and metsos that week.defendant asked weiss to prepare a listing agreement for our review presumably for the review by defendant and catanese.
on may,defendant had not heard from weiss.he called weiss and,apparently,left a message.in a responding voice mail message,weiss indicated that he had prepared a listing agreement and had sent the listing agreement to plaintiff along with a proposal from a potential buyer for the property.weiss stated that plaintiff had specifically instructed him not to send the listing agreement and proposal to defendant.
later that day,defendant attempted,unsuccessfully,to reach weiss.defendant left a voice mail message for weiss demanding the listing agreement and proposal,expressing his dissatisfaction with not having been sent these documents,and stating,i believe you are obviously engaged in a conspiracy to defraud my client with sophia rohde and i plan on taking appropriate action.shortly thereafter,defendant left weiss a second voice mail message stating,since you are obviously avoiding my calls,i can only assume that you are engaged in some kind of conspiracy with sophia rohde to deprive george metsos of his interest in his property.in his declaration in support of his motion,defendant states,i know that,had my client and i continued to be excluded from communications concerning the listing and sale of the chatsworth property,an action would have been filed to protect my client interests.
on may,plaintiff and her husband filed an action alleging various causes of action against metsos and a corporation of which he is allegedly the controlling shareholder and sole officer and director.plaintiff and her husband alleged that through defendant statements,metsos attempted to interfere with the negotiations for the sale of the real estate in question.
on may,plaintiff filed a separate one against that defendant voice mail messages to weiss defamed plaintiff and constituted slander per se.according to plaintiff complaint,defendant stated words actually or to the effect sophia rohde is engaged in a conspiracy with you to defraud my client george metsos of his real estate or personal property.
on july,defendant filed his motion to strike plaintiff complaint in her slander per se action.the trial court denied the motion.defendant appealed.
