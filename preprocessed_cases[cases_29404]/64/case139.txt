an ethical estate planning attorney will plan for his client,not for himself.see estate of moore th.a license to practice law is not a license to take advantage of an elderly and mentally infirm client.as we shall explain,the factual findings of the trial court compel the conclusion that appellant used his license to take advantage of an elderly and mentally infirm person to enrich himself.the trial court factual findings are disturbing,fatal to appellant contentions,and suggest criminal culpability.
john lebouef,an attorney,appeals a probate judgment invalidating a will and living trust purportedly executed by john patton on december.probate code section formerly provides in pertinent part a provision of an instrument making a donative transfer to any of the following persons is presumed to be the product of fraud or undue influence the person who drafted the instrument a person in a fiduciary relationship with the transferor who transcribed the instrument or caused it to be transcribed.patton will and trust name appellant as the principal beneficiary to a million estate.after five weeks of testimony,the trial court factually found that appellant,acting as patton attorney and fiduciary,drafted or transcribed the will and trust.see rice clark cal th,discussing former section,subd.a graham lenzi th.in a supplemental statement of decision,the trial court factually found that appellant caused the loss of the original trust instrument,which made it impossible for the court to determine the true terms of the trust.the trial court declared the will and trust invalid and removed appellant as trustee.appellant was ordered to turn over the trust assets and pay attorney fees pursuant to section,subdivision d.we affirm this judgment.
in a postjudgment order,the trial court approved appellant trust accounting but denied his request for trustee fees,attorney fees,and reimbursement for expenses and property management services.it ruled that an award for fees,costs,services,and expenses would be inequitable and reward appellant for his misconduct.we affirm this order.
facts and procedural history 
kim butler and julie butler black are the nieces and last known of john a patton.after patton passed away in,butler,black,and carol archer filed a petition to invalidate a million donative transfer to appellant,and remove appellant as trustee of the john patton revocable trust,dated december.respondents claimed that appellant,an attorney,drafted or transcribed patton will and trust to enrich himself.
john patton,a renowned interior designer,died in santa barbara on june.he was years old,in poor health,and suffering from depression,alcohol abuse,hepatitis,diabetes,high blood pressure,gout,and incontinence.patton housekeeper testified that he was more often drunk than sober during the last six months of his life.he would drink heavily,howl like a dog,and fall down and injure himself.neighbors had to pick him off the floor,help him out of his car,and shower him.patton grieved the death of his domestic partner,leo duval,and,by the end of his life,was often emotionally out of control.
appellant was patton social acquaintance.after duval died,appellant took an active interest in patton and frequently drove up from los angeles to visit and stay the night.appellant life partner,mark krajewski,accompanied appellant on many of the visits.krajewski was also appellant business partner.they owned property in los angeles and buenos aires,maintained joint checking and investment accounts,shared a cell phone plan,and used the same post office box.
as patton health deteriorated,appellant and krajewski visited more frequently.patton complained that appellant was overbearing and visited too often.in,patton told his assistant,neely bermant,that he was losing control of his finances and that appellant had moved his money around.
on december,patton allegedly changed his will and created a trust naming appellant principal beneficiary.he gifted a vintage car to donald pooler,appellant friend.it was a radical change in patton estate plan.in and patton executed wills gifting his estate to his nieces and wendy greenstein,patton friend for years.
prior questionable estate plans and administrations 
respondents argued that it was not the first time that appellant befriended an elderly person and drafted a will or trust naming himself or his partner,krajewski,principal beneficiary.respondents claimed there were eight prior incidents.pursuant to evidence code section,subdivision b,the trial court exercised its discretion and limited the prior acts evidence to two trust matters the irene grant trust and audrey cook trust.appellant drafted both trust instruments.
in,appellant helped irene grant inherit million from walter pick.grant was pick caretaker.pick will,which was drafted by appellant,gifted the estate to grant.after pick died,appellant married grant who was years older and managed the inheritance.before grant passed away in,appellant drafted grant trust naming himself principal beneficiary.appellant received the bulk of the estate on grant death and gave to million to grant niece in buenos aires.the niece was told that grant wanted her to receive the entire estate but appellant kept some estate assets.appellant also collected grant social security benefits for the next seven years.
in,appellant befriended audrey cook,an elderly widow,and wrote four amendments to the audrey cook trust.the fourth trust amendment,written in august,left most of cook estate to krajewski and named appellant friend,donald pooler,as successor trustee.when year old cook passed away in,pooler sold the house and distributed the million sale proceeds to krajewski.family members sued,contending that the house was not a trust asset.krajewski settled,paying more than million to the family.
rick jong,cook friend and accountant,testified that cook did not know krajewski and would have never gifted million to a stranger.jong was cook trustee and learned about the trust amendment removing him as trustee after cook died.appellant told cook that pooler was a retired judge who specialized in trustee work.pooler was actually an insurance investigator and good friends with appellant and krajewski.pooler lived next door to appellant for a number of years and before that,lived in an apartment building owned by krajewski.the building was gifted to krajewski pursuant to the james gravett trust that was drafted by appellant.
sandra homewood,a forensic document examiner,testified that the same idiosyncrasies misspelled words,unusual sentence structure,grammatical and punctuation errors,font irregularities were in the cook and patton trust instruments.homewood opined that it was virtually certain that the patton trust was produced by the same entity that produced the cook trust.
staged burglary loss of original trust document 
appellant defended on the theory that patton will and trust were drafted by an attorney whose identity was unknown.alice bennett,an attorney and los angeles superior court mental health referee,was a friend of both appellant and patton.patton asked her to prepare estate planning documents but bennett recommended that he use a santa barbara attorney.in,patton mailed bennett some estate planning documents for safekeeping.bennett received the will,abstract of trust,and original trust instrument and was surprised that the trust named bennett as successor trustee.after patton died,bennett turned the documents over to appellant and received a check drawn on patton bank account.appellant claimed that the original trust document was lost in a burglary just before his deposition.but the trial court rejected this theory.
trial court findings 
in a page statement of decision,the trial court rejected the defense theory at trial based upon appellant testimony.it factually found.appellant participated in the trust instrument physical preparation by either drafting or transcribing it within the meaning of probate code section.that the donative transfers were drafted by appellant or subject to some form of tampering,and that section disqualified appellant as a beneficiary.that the loss of the original trust instrument was intentional,making it impossible for the court to determine the true terms of the trust,and.that the december,trust,to the extent it otherwise exists,was invalid.
as to the missing trust document,the trial court said that it was key evidence and instrumental in understanding appellant involvement in patton estate plan.examination of the original trust could have laid considerable concerns to rest,including one of particular importance whether a single page containing the disposition of the assets in the trust,had at some point been substituted.it said that the trust document and appellant laptop went missing in the course of a very peculiar burglary from a house filled with valuable objects,wherein only a handful of random items were taken,including said laptop,and an unsecured plastic box of random documents,that just happened to include the items necessary to a full understanding of the facts of this matter.
prior bad acts evidence 
appellant contends that the trial court erred in receiving evidence concerning the grant and cook trusts to show common plan or scheme,subd.b.in each trust matter,appellant befriended an elderly person and drafted or helped draft a trust that benefited himself or his associates.prior bad acts evidence is admissible to show a common plan or scheme if the probative value of the evidence outweighs the potential for prejudice,subd.b people hovarter cal th,hassoldt patrick media group,th,fn.rule applies in civil and criminal cases.
in estate of zalud d zalud,a will contest,defendant was named as the principal beneficiary on a printed will executed by an elderly woman,pearle zalud.although defendant was not related to zalud,the will was witnessed by defendant brother and nephew,at.none of zalud prior wills were written on a printed form or named defendant as a beneficiary,at.over defendant objection,evidence was received that defendant and his brother were principal beneficiaries in wills executed by two other elderly women,winifred wells and florence sammons,at.defendant denied knowing how the wills were prepared even though they were typed on the same wolcott form used by zalud.one will was actually typed on defendant typewriter.the trial court found we have got preparation,plan,knowledge.i think this is admissible both on the question of credibility of the witness and also under section of the evidence code,at.the court of appeal held that the prior wills were admissible to impeach defendant testimony that he had no knowledge about the preparation of zalud will.ibid.irrespective of whether defendant had committed any wrong insofar as either the wells will or the sammons will was concerned,his connection with each will supported the inference that he had knowledge of the availability of the wolcott forms which could readily be used in the preparation of a will without recourse to the services of a lawyer.it was an unusual circumstance that in three instances he would have some relationship to a will which was prepared on such a form,the named testator in each instance not being related to the principal beneficiary and provisions having been inserted in each form which contain striking similarities to provisions so inserted in one or both of the other will forms,at.
like zalud,the pick and cook trusts were admissible to show a common plan or scheme and to impeach appellant testimony that he did not know who drafted patton will and trust.the patton trust,like the grant and cook trusts,named appellant or krajewski primary beneficiary.pick will,which was drafted by appellant,named grant pick caregiver as the beneficiary and appellant as executor.appellant married grant,managed her finances,and drafted grant trust naming himself beneficiary.appellant long time friend,donald pooler,assisted in the administration of the pick estate and received grant mercedes benz after grant passed away.
pooler and krajewski were key players in the cook trust.the fourth trust amendment,which was drafted by appellant,named krajewski as principal beneficiary and pooler as successor trustee.before pooler and krajewski were sued by the family,pooler sold the cook family residence and distributed the sale proceeds million to krajewski.
appellant used other friends to witness and safe keep patton will and trust.appellant friend,miriam olivares,stated that she just happened to drive up from los angeles and witness patton will on december.the trial court found that olivares testimony had a rehearsed quality and the whole scenario of olivares making a spontaneous trip to santa barbara to witness the will was rather improbable 
appellant continued to utilize friends and associates in his estate planning.patton allegedly signed the trust the same day december,but his signature was not acknowledged by a notary until july,months later.alice bennett,another of appellant associates,purportedly kept the original will and trust until patton died.the trial court found this case paints a picture of a group of people whose paths crossed an unusual number of times in matters concerning the testamentary estates of others.while the prior estate incidents occurred over a year or more period,they do represent an unusual confluence of estate activity in this group t he two most recent incidents,concerning the estates of irene grant and audrey cook,offered probative information.
the trial court reasonably concluded that the probative value of the prior acts evidence substantially outweighed the potential for prejudice.the weighing process under evidence code section depends upon the trial court consideration of the unique facts and issues of each case,rather than upon the mechanical application of automatic rules.citations.we will not overturn or disturb a trial court exercise of its discretion under section in the absence of manifest abuse,upon a finding that its decision was palpably arbitrary,capricious and patently absurd.citations.people jennings th,see also estate of gilkison th,abuse of discretion standard on appeal.appellant makes no showing that the prior acts evidence,as a matter of law,were remote in time,or inflammatory,or denied him a fair trial.see,estate of zalud,supra,d at similar wills dating back nine years.
was a busy year for appellant marked by an unusual confluence of estate planning.the grant trust came to fruition in when grant died and appellant was gifted the trust money.appellant also drafted cook fourth trust amendment in,naming krajewski as principal beneficiary.patton will and trust were written and purportedly signed in,gifting the bulk of the estate to appellant.the physical similarities between the cook trust and patton trust were striking.the trial court found that the patton trust was drafted much in the image of the audrey cook trust.
even without the admission of the facts relating to the grant and cook prior acts evidence,it is not reasonably probable that appellant would have received a more favorable result.taylor nabors drilling usa,lp th.this is so because the forensic document examiner,homewood,considered,without objection,the cook trust as an exemplar of appellant work.homewood was virtually certain that the cook and patton trusts were prepared by the same person.homewood explained that the degree of certainty was equivalent to the beyond a reasonable doubt standard used in criminal cases.because it was uncontroverted appellant drafted the cook trust,it took no leap in logic for the trial court to factually find that appellant drafted or transcribed the patton trust.we are bound by this adverse factual finding.in re marriage of greenberg th.
substantial evidence 
appellant argues that the evidence does not support the finding that patton will and trust was the product of fraud or undue influence.the power of the appellate court begins and ends with a determination as to whether there is any substantial evidence,contradicted or uncontradicted,that supports the judgment.bowers bernards d,see also in re marriage of martin d.
section prohibits donative transfers to broad categories of persons who,because of their relationship with the,might exercise undue influence.undue influence is presumed where the donative transfer is in favor of the person who drafted the instrument or where the person who transcribed it or caused it to be transcribed had a fiduciary relationship with the,subd.a.the presumption may be rebutted by clear and convincing evidence that the donative transfer was not the product of fraud or undue influence,subd.b.where the donative transfer is to the person who drafted the donative instrument,the presumption is conclusive,subd.c see rice clark,supra,cal th at discussing former section if an attorney drafted a client will so as to benefit himself,he would be conclusively disqualified.
substantial evidence supports the finding that appellant drafted or transcribed patton trust even though the original trust document was lost in a burglary respondents argued that appellant switched a trust page to make himself trustee and residuary beneficiary.the trial court drew the inference that the burglary was staged to thwart a forensic document examination.appellant denied it but the trial court found that appellant credibility is seriously tainted t he court concludes that yes,appellant worked with patton on the december,trust,tampered with the document at some point,which necessitated the burglary.
the trial court credited homewood expert testimony that it was virtually certain that the cook and patton trusts were prepared by the same entity.homewood was absolutely certain appellant wrote the certificate of trust and was positive that appellant filled out patton fidelity account application and the american express beneficiary designation form.homewood was virtually certain that the cook and patton abstracts of trust were produced by the same source,as was patton will.homewood opined that the signature on patton will was and that the staple holes in the upper left corner of the document were caused by someone stapling and unstapling the will numerous times.homewood stated that the witness page,the page signed by appellant friend,miriam olivares had an extra set of staple holes and was added to the will but was not originally with those first three pages.
expert testimony also linked appellant to the grant deeds used to fund the trust.see ante,this was strong circumstantial evidence that appellant drafted or transcribed the trust to enrich himself.appellant had a fiduciary relationship with patton and represented him in a felony dui case in.patton told his housecleaner that appellant was his lawyer.
before his death,patton told friends and neighbors who was getting what when he died.wendy greenstein,a close friend,telephoned patton daily.patton said that he was leaving one of his santa barbara homes to greenstein.patton made similar statements to his assistant,neely bermant,who worked for patton in and.in,patton told bermant that he had just signed documents gifting his home to appellant and everything else to bermant,butler,and greenstein.everything else included two other homes,bank and stock accounts,and valuable jewelry and art.in march,patton asked bermant to make a list of all the property in the house and told her who would get what.bermant prepared the list and patton signed it.
patton june,death was unexpected.appellant spent hours in patton house before calling to report the death.the trial court drew the inference that appellant looked for and tampered with the will and trust before making the call.see ante,fn.more suspect,was the purported theft of the original trust document and appellant laptop computer after patton death.nothing else was taken even though expensive art and watches were in open sight.the trial court found that the loss of the original trust document was intentional and that appellant testimony was obstructive.t he aroma of mendacity permeated this matter i t was the testimony of lebouef that created the greatest concern.
appellant claim that another attorney drafted patton will and trust was refuted in other ways.like sherlock holmes dog in the night that failed to bark doyle,silver blaze,the annotated sherlock holmes baring gould,ed,the absence of estate planning documents showed that something was amiss.see,gentry city of murrieta th.assuming that patton hired another lawyer to draft the will and trust,one would expect to see billings,correspondence,a check for legal services,an estate planning questionnaire,and the lawyer name on the estate planning documents.lawyers who draft trusts typically put page numbers on the trust instrument.patton trust,like the cook trust amendment,was not paginated and contained the same misspellings and punctuation errors.
because the gift to appellant would have been disallowed under the probate code,any competent attorney drafting the trust would have had a second attorney review the trust and talk to patton,and sign a certificate of independent review,subd.a see jenkins teegarden th.appellant probate expert,attorney marilyn anticouni,testified that a certificate of independent review is a simple solution to a problem with big consequences.
appellant testified at his deposition that he did not know what a certificate of independent review was.this bolstered respondents claim that appellant drafted patton trust.at trial,appellant altered his testimony and said he was familiar with certificates of independent review.the trial court found the testimony disingenuous and concluded that appellant had a significant hand in the preparation of patton will and trust.if appellant was aware of the concept,why would he be filling out beneficiary designation forms,direct testamentary documents,without independent review if appellant was aware,it bolsters the likelihood that the clumsy jumble that is the patton trust needed to appear by patton.
implied express findings 
appellant complains that the statement of decision contains no express findings that respondents made a prima facie showing to shift the burden of proof under section.see bernard foley cal th,statutory presumption of influence shifts the burden of proof.appellant did not object and is precluded from raising the issue for the first time on appeal.code civ,golden eagle ins.foremost ins.th.code of civil procedure s ection clearly refers to a party need to point out deficiencies in the trial court statement of decision as a condition of avoiding such implied findings citation.fladeboe american isuzu motors th.waiver aside,the substantial evidence standard of review applies to express and implied findings of fact in a statement of decision.citizens business bank gevorgian th.
attorney fees 
appellant argues that the trial court erred in awarding respondents attorney fees.section,subdivision d provides that i f a beneficiary is unsuccessful in rebutting the presumption,the beneficiary shall bear all costs of the proceeding,including reasonable attorney fees.subdivision c provides that the presumption of fraud or undue influence is conclusive where the donative transfer is to the person who drafted the will or trust.
appellant argues that he is not liable for fees because the presumption is conclusive for drafters and he had no opportunity,as a matter of law,to rebut the presumption,subd.c.the argument fails because a presumption is not evidence and is not operative until basic facts are established that give rise to the presumption,subd.a.a conclusive presumption is in actuality a substantive rule of law.citation.people dillon cal d.
the trial court found that appellant either drafted or transcribed the estate planning documents and beneficiary forms appellant could have negated or rebutted the presumption of undue influence a number of ways.he could have produced a certificate of independent review which trumps the section presumption,subd.a jenkins teegarden,supra,th at.in the alternative,appellant could have presented evidence that he did not draft or transcribe the will and trust or beneficiary forms.the fact that the trial court discredited appellant testimony that some other attorney drafted patton will and trust does not mean that appellant was denied the opportunity to rebut the presumption of undue influence.
appellant contends that drafters are not liable for attorney fees but that would undermine section,subdivision d.the dra
