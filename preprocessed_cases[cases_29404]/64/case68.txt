angela and denise brady brady daughters appeal the district court judgment affirming the bankruptcy court declaration that the debtor kenneth allen knight trust trust is a business trust and therefore entitled to bankruptcy protection.brady daughters argue that the bankruptcy court applied the wrong law and should instead have used either kentucky definition of business trust,or an alternate definition taken from federal case law.finding no merit to their claims,we affirm.
statement of facts 
on june,the trust filed a voluntary petition under chapter of the bankruptcy code.after reviewing the background of the case,the bankruptcy court converted it into a chapter case the court also consolidated it with three other related cases and appointed as trustee the appellee baxter schilling.the bankruptcy court subsequently issued a memorandum opinion in which it made a number of factual findings and,on the basis of these findings,concluded that the trust was a business trust.this conclusion was important because it meant that the trust qualified as a debtor under the code,since family the trust here would otherwise not eligible for bankruptcy treatment,but business trusts are only a person can be a debtor under the bankruptcy code,the term person includes individuals,partnerships,and corporations,id.and the definition of corporation includes business trusts,id.a v.the bankruptcy code does not define business trust,however,and federal courts have generally either looked to state law for a definition,or have created their own.
brady daughters wanted the litigation between the trust and its potential creditors to take place outside the bankruptcy court,so they appealed the decision.on appeal,the district court initially found the trust to be a family trust and consequently not entitled to bankruptcy protection,but upon the trustee motion to reconsider,the court made independent factual those of the bankruptcy concluded that the trust was in substance brady personal property and hence subject to the bankruptcy code.
brady daughters again appealed,and we reversed in a per curiam unpublished opinion brady schilling in re kenneth allen knight trust,wl cir.july.we found,first,that the district court had exceeded its scope of review when it made independent factual findings,and that if the bankruptcy court factual findings had been indeterminate,the district court should have remanded for further factual findings,at.we next considered the merits of the bankruptcy court conclusion that the trust was a business trust.because,as we noted,c ourts have not adopted a uniform definition of business trust for purposes of the bankruptcy code,and this circuit had not spoken on the issue,we had to choose which of several available definitions we would adopt.id.we chose a version of the test articulated in in re treasure island land trust,quoting several sentences from the case,and restating the definition in a slightly altered form.brady,wl,at.but because that definition required a finding about the primary purpose of the trust,and because the bankruptcy court had not made such a finding,we remanded the case to the bankruptcy court for further findings of fact.id.on remand the bankruptcy court added new findings to those it had previously made,and found as follows.
the trust was created in by james brady brady,who named it after his nephew kenneth allen knight and designated that nephew as the trust settlor.knight purportedly paid a token into the trust for which he was reimbursed by brady,and thus began and ended knight personal involvement in the trust.the trust beneficiaries were brady and,secondarily,his daughters,angela and michele appellants here.brady,however,was also the trustee with one,at first,and he had virtually total control of the trust,including the authority to manage its assets.
the trust owned two principal assets brady personal residence residence,and of the stock of kak holdings.the residence was acquired by the trust in two stages.the first of the legal title to the residence was transferred to the trust by deed dated april.the second was deeded to the trust in april of from brady former wife,anna brady brady had acquired her interest for,under the terms of their divorce decree.
kak holdings,the trust other principal asset,owned four subsidiary corporations subsidiaries kak real estate,investment advisors,ralliana,and direct participation.kak real estate,in turn,owned various real estate investments,including brady vacation home in beaver creek,colorado.investment advisors owned a condominium in the same city.ralliana,was the general partner of a limited partnership that owned and operated various rally fast food franchises.direct participation owned interests in restaurants and other corporations.
the trust incomplete checking records indicated that most if not all of the subsidiaries financial activities were conducted through the trust and its bank accounts.occasionally,the trust would obtain financing for the subsidiaries from a maryland bank,via an illegal method the trust would claim to own assets that in fact belonged to an entirely different trust,owned by one richard thurman.when thurman found out what brady was doing,he filed suit against brady,the trust,and other related entities.brady subsequently filed the voluntary chapter petition for bankruptcy that led to the present litigation.
after making these supplemented factual findings on remand,the bankruptcy court applied the test we had adopted in the first appeal and found the trust to be a business trust brady was the principal beneficiary he was the primary trustee along with a trust company and,later,one of his daughters he alone directed the trust business activities he alone could remove other trustees the other residual beneficiaries would forfeit their interest under the trust if they sued brady over how he operated the trust though both of the transfers of the residence were ostensibly gifts to the trust,there was no evidence that brady filed any gift tax returns,or that the trust did anything with the residence,and t he record clearly shows that brady treated these transfers,at best,as contributions of capital to his kak trust business entity brady did not disclose to his original the first transfer of the residence the residence was the only asset the trust ever owned brady gift of the residence was no indication of a purpose,because he routinely titled real estate,which he used personally,in his business entities for example,kak real estate owned his vacation home in colorado most,if not all financial activities of the trust subsidiaries were conducted through kak trust and its bank accounts and brady treated the trust just as he treated his other business entities.the bankruptcy court concluded that it is clear that james brady created this trust solely for his benefit and was in actuality the of the kak trust,and that it is beyond dispute that the kak trust was intended to operate as a holding company for james brady various business enterprises thus the bankruptcy court found that the sole purpose of the kak trust,from its inception,was to be an entity through which james brady could conduct his business affairs.
brady daughters again appealed to the district court,which affirmed the bankruptcy court.this time the facts were no longer in dispute,and the issue was whether the bankruptcy court had applied the correct definition of business trust.brady daughters asserted that the bankruptcy court erred because it should have adopted a definition of business trust from kentucky law or from morrissey commissioner of internal revenue,and argued that under these alternate definitions the trust was not a business trust.the district court chose not to evaluate the merits of their claim and instead held fast to our earlier definition.in the district court words,
f ortunately for the bankruptcy court and this reviewing perhaps unfortunately for the brady court of appeals provided clear and specific guidance to accompany its remand of this case.accepting the arguments presented by the brady daughters would require that we disregard that guidance,and we must decline the invitati
