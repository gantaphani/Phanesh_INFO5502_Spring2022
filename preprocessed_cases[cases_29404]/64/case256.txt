probate code section provides that when the named beneficiary of a life insurance policy feloniously and intentionally kills the person whose life is insured,the beneficiary is not entitled to any benefit under the policy,and it becomes payable as though the killer had predeceased the decedent.ibid.appellant is the named beneficiary of a life insurance policy insuring the life of his late wife,laci peterson.on november,a jury found appellant guilty of the first degree murder of laci peterson,and on march,the san mateo county superior court entered a commitment judgment of death in appellant criminal trial.that judgment is presently on appeal in the california supreme court.
the present appeal is from a judgment in a civil action awarding the life insurance proceeds to the estate of laci peterson the estate the insurer,principal life insurance company principal,brought an interpleader action see code civ,alleging that both appellant and the estate claimed to be entitled to the life insurance proceeds.principal asked for an order discharging it from any liability to appellant or to the administrator of the estate,and directing appellant and the administrator to litigate between themselves their claims to the proceeds of the life insurance policy.principal,appellant and the administrator stipulated to the entry of such an order.the insurance policy proceeds were deposited with the clerk of the superior court of stanislaus county,and principal was dismissed from the action.
the administrator then moved for summary judgment.she asked the court to take judicial notice of appellant criminal conviction.the court did so,without objection.appellant opposed the motion by arguing that t he evidence in the request for judicial notice presented by the estate utterly fails to meet the requisite burden of proof.appellant relied on subdivision b of probate code section,which states in the absence of a final judgment of conviction of felonious and intentional killing,the court may determine by a preponderance of the evidence whether the killing was felonious and intentional for purposes of this part.the burden of proof is on the party seeking to establish that the killing was felonious and intentional for the purposes of this part,subd.b.the only additional evidence presented by appellant was a declaration from his attorney stating that appellant criminal conviction was on appeal.
the superior court granted the administrator motion for summary judgment.its order granting the motion stated that the administrator has established,by a preponderance of the evidence,that appellant did feloniously and intentionally murder his wife,laci peterson,and as such he is not entitled to collect the benefits of her life insurance policy.the court then entered a judgment directing the clerk of the stanislaus county superior court to pay to the administrator the life insurance proceeds principal had deposited with the clerk.
appellant contention 
on his appeal from this judgment appellant again argues that the administrator failed to meet her burden under probate code section,subdivision b to show that appellant feloniously and intentionally killed the decedent.as we shall explain,we agree with the trial court that in the absence of any conflicting evidence,appellant criminal conviction for the first degree murder of his wife was substantial and uncontradicted evidence that he feloniously and intentionally killed her.summary judgment was therefore properly granted in favor of the administrator.
the administrator motion presented the following facts,which were not disputed by appellant.principal life insurance company issued a flexible premium variable universal life insurance policy dated june,in the face amount of.the policy named laci peterson as the insured and appellant as the beneficiary.in november of a jury found appellant guilty of murdering laci peterson.
appellant opposition to motion presented a september,declaration of his attorney mark geragos stating that appellant criminal conviction was on appeal.
in support of the motion the administrator filed a request for judicial notice asking the court to take judicial notice of certain documents from appellant criminal case san mateo superior court case no.these were certified copies of the jury december,penalty verdict fixing appellant penalty at death the jury november,verdict finding appellant guilty of the first degree murder of laci peterson the jury november,verdict finding to be true the special circumstance that appellant has in this case been convicted of at least one crime of murder of the first degree and one or more crimes of murder of the first or second degree the jury november,verdict finding appellant guilty of the murder of baby conner peterson the court clerk minutes of the march,proceedings at which appellant was sentenced to death and the court march,commitment judgment of death.as we have already mentioned,the court did take judicial notice of these documents,without any objection from appellant.

interpleader 
this action is an interpleader action brought by principal.any person,firm,corporation,association or other entity against whom double or multiple claims are made,or may be made,by two or more persons which are such that they may give rise to double or multiple liability,may bring an action against the claimants to compel them to interplead and litigate their several claims.code civ,subd.b.when a person may be subject to conflicting claims for money or property,the person may bring an interpleader action to compel the claimants to litigate their claims among themselves.ibid.once the person admits liability and deposits the money with the court,he or she is discharged from liability and freed from the obligation of participating in the litigation between the claimants.citations.the purpose of interpleader is to prevent a multiplicity of suits and double vexation.citation.city of morgan hill brown th,d,fn.omitted.in an interpleader action,the court initially determines the right of the plaintiff to interplead the funds if that right is sustained,an interlocutory decree is entered which requires the defendants to interplead and litigate their claims to the funds.upon an admission of liability and deposit of monies with the court,the plaintiff may then be discharged from liability and dismissed from the interpleader action.citations.the effect of such an order is to preserve the fund,discharge the stakeholder from further liability,and to keep the fund in the court custody until the rights of potential claimants of the monies can be adjudicated.citations.thus,the interpleader proceeding is traditionally viewed as two lawsuits in one.the first dispute is between the stakeholder and the claimants to determine the right to interplead the funds.the second dispute to be resolved is who is to receive the interpleaded funds.citations.dial fesbinder th,d see also witkin cal.procedure ed.pleading,weil brown,cal.practice guide civil procedure before trial the rutter group.
the first phase of this interpleader action was resolved by an order,stipulated to by all parties,that principal be discharged from any liability to either of the defendants and dismissed from the action,and that appellant and the administrator will settle or litigate amongst themselves the sic respective rights and claims to proceeds under the policy see also union mutual life ins.broderick cal,interpleader action brought by insurance company when both widow and sister of decedent claimed entitlement to life insurance proceeds.

the second sentence of subdivision b of probate code section states the burden of proof is on the party seeking to establish that the killing was felonious and intentional for the purposes of this part.the parties are in agreement that the administrator bears the burden of proving that appellant feloniously and intentionally killed laci peterson.meeting that burden would entitle the administrator to the life insurance proceeds.here the administrator attempted to demonstrate,on a motion for summary judgment,that undisputed evidence showed a felonious and intentional killing of laci peterson by appellant.see also city of morgan hill brown,supra,th,d summary judgment procedure utilized by one of two claimants on second phase of interpleader action.
a conviction on appeal is not a final judgment of conviction for purposes of probate code section 
probate code section states in its entirety 
a named beneficiary of a bond,life insurance policy,or other contractual arrangement who feloniously and intentionally kills the principal oblige or the person upon whose life the policy is issued is not entitled to any benefit under the bond,policy,or other contractual arrangement,and it becomes payable as though the killer had predeceased the decedent.
probate code section states in its entirety 
a a final judgment of conviction of felonious and intentional killing is conclusive for purposes of this part.
b in the absence of a final judgment of conviction of felonious and intentional killing,the court may determine by a preponderance of evidence whether the killing was felonious and intentional for purposes of this part.the burden of proof is on the party seeking to establish that the killing was felonious and intentional for the purposes of this part.
the administrator contended in the superior court,and contends again on this appeal,that there was a final judgment of conviction of felonious and intentional killing within the meaning of subdivision a of probate code section,and if there was no such final judgment,the nonfinal judgment of conviction was undisputed evidence showing by a preponderance of evidence,subd.b a felonious and intentional killing of laci peterson by appellant.the superior court rejected the administrator first argument,but accepted the second.in our view,the superior court correctly interpreted subdivision a and,on the evidence presented to it,correctly applied subdivision b.
as to the meaning of the phrase final judgment of conviction in probate code section,we apply rules of statutory construction.the objective of statutory construction is to ascertain the intent of the legislature so as to effectuate the purpose of the law.citations.dubois workers comp.appeals bd.cal th,d.the words of the statute are the starting point.wilcox birtwhistle cal th,d.words used in a statute should be given the meaning they bear in ordinary use.citation.if the language is clear and unambiguous there is no need for construction,nor is it necessary to resort to indicia of the intent of the legislature lungren deukmejian cal d.if the language permits more than one reasonable interpretation,the court looks to a variety of extrinsic aids,including the ostensible objects to be achieved,the evils to be remedied,the legislative history,public policy,contemporaneous administrative construction,and the statutory scheme of which the statute is a part.citation.wilcox birtwhistle,supra,cal th at,d.we must select the construction that comports most closely with the apparent intent of the legislature,with a view to promoting rather than defeating the general purpose of the statute,and avoid an interpretation that would lead to absurd consequences.people jenkins cal th,d.
application of these rules leads us to the conclusion that the phrase final judgment of conviction in probate code section does not include a judgment that is on appeal.the language of the phrase permits more than one reasonable interpretation.the words could be read to mean a judgment which has been affirmed on appeal see,agarwal johnson cal d,fn,disapproved on another ground in white ultramar,cal th,fn,d,a judgment is not final for purposes of res judicata during the pendency of and until the resolution of the appeal,or a judgment which is final in the trial court and from which an appeal is pending.in the legislature enacted as probate code section the statute that now appears as probate code section,except that in the legislation subdivision b of the statute began with the words i n the absence of a conviction of instead of i n the absence of a final judgment of conviction of.stats,ch.amendments to the probate code in renumbered the section as section,but left the language unchanged.stats,ch.in subdivision b of section was amended to add the reference to a final judgment of conviction of felonious and intentional killing.stats,ch.in the entire probate code was repealed and a new probate code was enacted.stats,ch.this was done upon the recommendation of the california law revision commission.see recommendation new probate code cal.law revision com.the new probate code made no change to section.stats,ch.the california law revision commission comment to probate code section of the legislation states in pertinent part section was amended by.ch.to add the words a final judgment of in subdivision b.this made clear that the civil court may determine the issue by the civil standard of proof during the pendency of an appeal from a criminal conviction of felonious and intentional killing.cal.law revision com,west ann.ed.foll.the california law revision commission comment to section thus appears to leave no doubt that the phrase a final judgment of conviction was intended to exclude a criminal conviction that is on appeal.
the california law revision commission comment to section also states that t his section is the same in substance as section e of the uniform probate code.cal.law revision com,west ann,supra,foll.probate code section,subdivision b,states that a provision of this code,insofar as it is the same in substance as a provision of a uniform act,shall be so construed as to effectuate the general purpose to make uniform the law in those states which enact that provision.in johnson gray,minnesota version of uniform probate code section stated in pertinent part that a final judgment of conviction of felonious and intentional killing is conclusive for purposes of this section.johnson gray,supra,at.thomas gray was convicted and sentenced for the second degree murder of his wife.he was the primary beneficiary of his wife life insurance policy.the wife father,wayne johnson,was appointed personal representative of her estate.johnson sought a declaratory judgment that gray was divested of gray right to the life insurance proceeds because gray had feloniously and intentionally killed the wife.johnson brought a summary judgment motion,arguing gray conviction for second degree murder was conclusive evidence that he had feloniously and intentionally killed his wife.gray argued his murder conviction was not final because he had appealed and his appeal was still pending.johnson gray,supra,at.the minnesota district court granted the summary judgment motion.the appellate court reversed.the statute does not define final judgment of conviction.generally,a judgment becomes final when the appellate process is terminated or the time for appeal has expired.citation.under this general rule,gray conviction would be final only when the direct appeal from his conviction has been terminated or the time for appeal has expired.because gray direct appeal from the judgment of conviction was pending when the summary judgment motion was heard,gray conviction was not final and the district court erred in granting summary judgment on the issue of whether gray feloniously and intentionally killed his wife.id.at,fn.omitted.the phrase final judgment of conviction has thus been construed in minnesota as not including a judgment that is on appeal.we are aware of no contrary construction of this uniform probate code language.we therefore agree with the superior court,and with appellant,that the administrator did not here demonstrate the existence of a final judgment of conviction as the term final judgment is used in probate code section.
a conviction on appeal may constitute substantial evidence of a felonious and intentional killing for purposes of probate code sections and 
this brings us to the second issue whether the nonfinal judgment of first degree murder,not rebutted by any evidence that appellant did not feloniously and intentionally murder his wife,constitutes sufficient evidence to warrant the granting of the administrator summary judgment motion under subdivision b of probate code section.
as we have already discussed,subdivision b of probate code section placed on the administrator the burden of proving,by a preponderance of evidence,that appellant feloniously and intentionally killed laci peterson.for summary judgment purposes,the administrator on this interpleader action was thus the functional equivalent of a plaintiff moving for summary judgment.i f a plaintiff who would bear the burden of proof by a preponderance of evidence at trial moves for summary judgment,he must present evidence that would require a reasonable trier of fact to find any underlying material fact more likely than,he would not be entitled to judgment as a matter of law,aguilar atlantic richfield,supra,cal th at,d,see also code civ,subd.p.if the judgment of first degree murder meets this test,then we have a situation in which appellant would be required to present some evidence that he did not feloniously and intentionally kill laci peterson.absent such evidence,there would be no factual dispute to take to a trial.if a party moving for summary judgment carries his burden of production,he causes a shift,and the opposing party is then subjected to a burden of production of his own to make a prima facie showing of the existence of a triable issue of material fact.aguilar atlantic richfield,supra,cal th at,d.
evidence code section 
what is the evidentiary significance,then,of a judgment of conviction in a criminal case evidence code section states evidence of a final judgment adjudging a person guilty of a crime punishable as a felony is not made inadmissible by the hearsay rule when offered in a civil action to prove any fact essential to the judgment whether or not the judgment was based on a plea of nolo contendere.we have already concluded that a final judgment of conviction of felonious and intentional killing within the meaning of probate code section does not include a judgment of conviction from which an appeal is pending.we reached this conclusion by applying settled rules of statutory construction to ascertain the intent of the legislature so as to effectuate the purpose of the law.dubois workers comp.appeals,supra,cal th at,d.but does a final judgment adjudging a person guilty of a crime punishable as a felony,within the meaning of evidence code section,similarly exclude a judgment of conviction from which an appeal is pending application of these same rules of statutory construction leads us to the conclusion that it does not.in other words,the evidence code section phrase final judgment adjudging a person guilty of a crime punishable as a felony includes a judgment adjudging a person guilty of a crime punishable as a felony even when an appeal from that judgment is pending.
once again,the term final judgment is susceptible of more than one reasonable interpretation.w hile it is pending on appeal a judgment is both final in the sense that it is appealable and not final in the sense that the appeal remains unresolved.sullivan delta air lines,cal th,d.indeed,since its enactment penal code section has stated that a n appeal may be taken by the defendant f rom a final judgment of conviction evidence code section was enacted in when the legislature enacted the california evidence code.stats,ch,operative.the california law revision commission was directed by the legislature in to make a study to determine whether the law of evidence should be revised to conform to the uniform rules of evidence drafted by the national conference of commissioners on uniform state laws and approved by it at its annual conference.recommendation proposing an evidence code,cal.law revision com,rec.studies,hereinafter cal.com.the legislation recommended by the commission consisted of a proposed evidence code that includes the best features of the uniform rules and of the existing california law and the necessary conforming adjustments in existing statutory law.ibid.
for each recommended evidence code section,the commission provided a comment which explained the section purpose and its relation to other sections and discussed some potential problems of its meaning or application.cal,at.the legislature made some changes to the proposed evidence code,and then enacted the code.cal.for those sections of the recommended evidence code changed by the legislature,the law revision commission comment was modified accordingly and relabeled as a comment by the legislative committee that authored the comment.cal,at.see,the committee on judiciary accompanying,pt,west ann.ed.foll.the end result was that the comment accompanying any given evidence code section was intended to reflect legislative intent in enacting the section.
as originally enacted in,evidence code section stated evidence of a final judgment adjudging a person guilty of a crime punishable as a felony is not made inadmissible by the hearsay rule when offered in a civil action to prove any fact essential to the judgment unless the judgment was based on a plea of nolo contendere.cal.law.this language was recommended by the law revision commission and was not changed prior to its enactment into law.id.at.the law revision commission comment to evidence code section pointed out that this section effected a change in california law 
section will change the california law.under existing law,a conviction of a crime is inadmissible as evidence in a subsequent action.marceau travelers ins,cal,pac.evidence of a murder conviction held inadmissible to prove the insured was intentionally killed burke wells,fargo,cal.wl evidence of a robbery conviction held inadmissible to prove the identity of robber in an action to recover reward.the change,however,is desirable,for the evidence involved is peculiarly reliable.the seriousness of the charge assures that the facts will be thoroughly litigated,and the fact that the judgment must be based upon a determination that there was no reasonable doubt concerning the defendant guilt assures that the question of guilt will be thoroughly considered.cal.law revision com,pt,west ann.ed.foll.
this change essentially adopted the view of rule of the uniform rules of evidence,but with an accommodation for the language in penal code section that a nolo contendere plea may not be used against the defendant as an admission in any civil suit based upon or growing out of the act upon which the criminal prosecution is based.stats,ch.rule of the uniform rules of evidence approved in by national conference of commissioners on uniform state laws stated

judgment of previous conviction.evidence of a final judgment adjudging a person guilty of a felony,to prove any fact essential to sustain the judgment.
the differences we see between uniform rule and the original evidence code section are the uniform rule used the phrase guilty of a felony whereas evidence code section used the phrase guilty of a crime punishable as a felony the uniform rule used the phrase to prove any fact essential to sustain the judgment whereas evidence code section used the phrase to prove any fact essential to the judgment evidence code section added the phrase unless the judgment was based on a plea of nolo contendere and the uniform rule appears to have applied to the use of the described final judgment in any subsequent court proceeding civil or criminal,whereas evidence code section limited its application to use of the described final judgment when offered in a civil action and stylistically,the uniform rules of evidence placed the hearsay rule and its exceptions in one rule with many subsections,whereas in the evidence code the hearsay rule see,and its many exceptions see,et are placed in separate statutes.
the first difference was explained in the law revision commission comment to evidence code section as follows section applies to any crime punishable as a felony.the fact that a misdemeanor sentence is imposed does not affect the admissibility of the judgment of a conviction under this section.cal.law revision com,pt,west ann,supra,foll.witkin explained this difference between the uniform rule and evidence code section a bit more clearly.only felony convictions come within evidence code,section t he evidence code followed the uniform rule,with this difference the test is whether the crime was punishable as a felony,whether it comes within the class of felonies or.certain crimes are punishable either as felonies or misdemeanors,and as to those crimes the judgment of conviction is admissible even though the sentence is for the misdemeanor.witkin,cal.evidence ed.hearsay.the second difference appears to be one of style and not of substance.the third,as we have explained,harmonized evidence code section with california penal code section.the fourth appears to have been an accommodation to concerns about protecting the sixth amendment right of an accused in a criminal case to be confronted with the witnesses against him,amend.see witkin,cal.evidence,supra,hearsay.the fifth was a result of the law revision commission expressed desire to improve upon what it deemed to be the cumbersome and defective draftsmanship of the uniform rules of evidence.t he draftsmanship of the uniform rules is in some respects defective by california standards.the uniform rules contain several rules of extreme length that are reminiscent of several of the cumbersome sections in part iv of the code of civil procedure pertaining to the law of evidence.for example,the hearsay rule and all of its exceptions are stated in one rule that has subdivisions.cal.law,supra,see also ibid.
b.a felony conviction on appeal is a final judgment adjudging a person guilty of a crime punishable as a felony for purposes of evidence code section 
in sum,and in general,evidence code section changed the previous california rule of inadmissibility of prior convictions to a rule of admissibility of prior felony convictions in civil cases,in accordance with uniform rule but with the changes just noted above.the language evidence of a final judgment adjudging a person guilty,however,was adopted unchanged from uniform rule.we see no reasonable conclusion other than that this language was intended to have the same meaning in evidence code section that it had in uniform rule.and as we shall explain,we see several indicia that this language was intended to refer to a judgment that was final in the trial court even if the judgment was on appeal,and not merely to a judgment that has been affirmed on appeal or a judgment from which a timely appeal may still be taken.
first,the drafters comment to uniform rule contains no hint that a judgment on appeal would not qualify for admission.that comment states in pertinent part analytically a judgment of conviction is hearsay and for that reason rejected by majority of courts when offered to prove the defendant guilt in another action in which the issue of guilt is material.where a person has had an opportunity to defend himself and has entered a plea of guilty or has been found guilty beyond a reasonable doubt,the judgment entered on the plea or verdict would seem to have sufficient value to be worth consideration by a trier of fact,and necessarily includes a finding of all facts essential to sustain the judgment in the case in which rendered.uniform rules of evidence,comment to rule,italics added.
second,and most importantly,when the uniform rules were updated in,the hearsay exception for a final judgment adjudging a person guilty of a felony was redesignated as uniform rule and added a sentence expressly providing that t he pendency of an appeal may be shown but does not affect admissibility.uniform rules of evidence,rule,vol.if the term final judgment in the uniform rule had been meant to include only a judgment affirmed on appeal or no longer subject to a timely appeal,and if the new last sentence in uniform rule expressly applying this hearsay exception to felony convictions with pending appeals had been intended to be an expansion of the uniform rule hearsay exception,then the drafters of the uniform rule presumably would have removed the word final from the phrase final judgment adjudging a person guilty in the first sentence of subpart.they did not.apparently this is because the term final judgment in uniform rule was intended all along to mean a judgment that was final in the trial court.the california law revision commission and later the california legislature presumably meant the same thing when they took the words evidence of a final judgment adjudging a person guilty from uniform rule and placed them in california evidence code section.
third,the california law revision commission comment to evidence code section contains no suggestion that the commission or the legislature intended the words final judgment adjudging a person guilty in evidence code section to mean only a judgment that has been affirmed on appeal or that is no longer subject to a timely appeal.the comment states in part i f a plaintiff sues to recover a reward offered by the defendant for the arrest and conviction of a person who committed a particular crime,section permits the plaintiff to use a judgment of conviction as evidence that the person convicted committed the crime.cal.law revision com,pt.west ann,supra,foll.the comment contains no suggestion that the plaintiff must wait until the criminal conviction is affirmed on appeal before that judgment of conviction may be admitted in the civil action to recover the reward.the comment also states,as we have already pointed out section will change the california law.under existing law,a conviction of a crime is inadmissible as evidence in a subsequent action the change,however,is desirable,for the evidence involved is particularly reliable.the seriousness of the charge assures that the facts will be thoroughly litigated,and the fact that the judgment must be based upon
