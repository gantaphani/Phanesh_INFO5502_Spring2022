in estate of wilson d,the court held that a surviving spouse who did not consent to transfers of community property into bank accounts for third persons may enforce his or her community property interest on an basis,even though he or she is already receiving more than of the total community property.in this case,we hold as a matter of first impression that in enacting probate code section,the legislature intended to codify,rather than nullify,the estate of wilson rule.accordingly,we reverse orders denying evangelina miramontes evangelina petition under section to set aside the transfers of her community property interest in certain accounts,and remand the matter to the trial court with directions.
factual and procedural background 
evangelina and raul raul married in mexico in.according to evangelina petition,they entered into an express community property marriage.they were married until raul death in october in san diego,california.
beginning in june,without evangelina consent,raul transferred a total of in community property funds into nine bank accounts payable on death to persons other than evangelina.he transferred into each of two money market accounts payable to,respectively,the minor children of silvia lizarraga preciado silvia,silvia miramontes lizarraga young silvia and adolfo miramontes lizarraga adolfo,and transferred into a deposit certificate payable to young silvia in addition,raul created six other accounts payable to third persons not involved in this appeal,consisting of deposited in a money market account and placed in five certificate of deposit accounts.
raul had arranged to transfer all the community property by multiple nontestamentary means.evangelina received community property having a total value of approximately million,more than of the value of the community property estate.
evangelina petitioned the court under section for an order setting aside the transfer of of the funds in each of the accounts.citing estate of wilson,supra,d,she argued section requires the court to set aside her community interest separately as to each account,regardless of any other community property she received outside probate.the lizarragas opposed the petition on the ground evangelina had already received nonprobate transfers of community property exceeding her interest in the community estate.they argued that in enacting section,the legislature intended to abrogate the holding in estate of wilson.
the court issued a letter ruling denying the petition insofar as a blanket set aside of the transfers is concerned.the court determined section empowers it to impose such terms,conditions and remedies as appear equitable under the circumstances of this case,and it will hear evidence and will exercise its equitable powers to make such an order that insures that each and the decedent,have or have the right to dispose of of their community property.the court also ruled that t o the extent the evidence shows that petitioner has received half or more of the community property she owned with decedent,none of the transfers will be set aside.
after the interim order was issued,evangelina conceded she received assets exceeding of the community estate,including houses in california and mexico,a condominium in florida and one of the california pod accounts.accordingly,no evidentiary hearing was held.the court issued an order adopting and making final its previous findings and denying the petition as to all accounts.
discussion 
request for dismissal 
preliminarily,we dispose of the lizarragas contention the orders under section are not appealable under the probate code,and because evangelina did not file a timely petition for writ relief,we should dismiss the appeal.
a ppeals that may be taken from orders in probate proceedings are set forth in the probate code,and its provisions are exclusive.citation.there is no right to appeal from any orders in probate except those specified in the probate code.citation.appeals in general probate matters are limited.citation.if there were a free appeal in every probate matter,estates could be unreasonably delayed.estate of stoddart th,d.
the probate code does not specifically list as appealable orders denying petitions to set aside nonconsensual nonprobate transfers of community property.however,it is well established that a probate order appealability is determined not from its form,but from its legal effect.estate of west cal,estate of estrem cal d,estate of warner d,estate of hart d,estate of friedman d,fn.estate of effron d,fn.estate of richter th,d estate of martin th,d.an order is appealable,even if not mentioned in the probate code as appealable,if it has the same effect as an order the probate code expressly makes appealable.estate of martin,at,d.section,subdivision f makes appealable the grant of or refusal to grant an order determining heirship,succession,entitlement,or the persons to whom distribution should be made.the orders here determine the distribution of the accounts,and thus fall within the statutorily defined class of appealable orders.estate of richter,at,d.
the lizarragas rely on estate of stoddart,supra,th,d,in which this court held that orders denying motions for reconsideration of probate orders under sections to determine entitlement to distribution of estate and to ascertain trust beneficiaries are not appealable orders.we stated that in the absence of specific statutory authority authorizing such appeals,the court orders denying wilson motions for reconsideration are not appealable.stoddart at,d.however,there the parties did not raise,and we did not address,the significant body of law,including this court opinion in estate of effron,supra,d at page,footnote,holding that an order legal effect,rather than its form,determines its appealability.it is axiomatic that cases are not authority for propositions not considered.in re marriage of cornejo cal th,d.
the lizarragas correctly point out that under the one final judgment rule an appeal is available only from a final judgment code civ,subd.a,and no final judgment was entered.however,we may consider orders a final judgment for purposes of appeal when as here,they have all the earmarks of a final judgment.nothing remains for judicial consideration concerning the accounts,the orders are the only judicial rulings regarding the accounts,and there is no other avenue for appellate review.under these circumstances,the orders are appealable as a final judgment.bank of california pacific,th,d see also sjoberg hastorf cal d,an appeal is allowed if the order is a final judgment against a party in a collateral proceeding growing out of the action.
the lizarragas also contend we should dismiss the appeal because service of evangelina opening brief was defective.they assert the brief was not served upon all parties,and in particular upon specifically interested and affected parties,and reversal of the order would materially affect the rights of parties who did not receive notice.the lizarragas note that five of the beneficiaries of accounts that are subject to the final order,representing nearly in interests,have not been served.however,nothing in the clerk transcript indicates that anyone except evangelina and the lizarragas ever appeared below.briefs must be served only on adverse parties who appeared separately.see cal.rules of court,rule e.
we also reject the lizarragas contention we should dismiss the appeal because the record does not establish a material element of evangelina marital status and property rights.according to the lizarragas,as evidence of her marital status evangelina relied on lodged documents not a part of the record on appeal.however,the record is sufficient to permit us to evaluate the arguments presented and we therefore decline to dismiss the appeal on this ground.
