background 
william hugill died in.his wife,janice,had passed away in in,the couple created an inter vivos trust appointing william as trustee.that instrument provided for the establishment of two separate trusts as soon as one spouse died the decedent irrevocable trust,and the survivor amendable and revocable trust.the trust further provided that,upon the death of the surviving spouse,both trusts would terminate.after disbursement of certain personal property,percent of the remainder of the survivor trust would be distributed in equal shares to william four children,michael,patrick,marjorie,and holly.the other percent would be set aside in a grandchildren trust for college educations,with the remainder of that subtrust to be divided among william children percent and grandchildren percent after the youngest grandchild turned.the document contained a no contest provision.
in,william amended the survivor trust,designating a fixed to fund the grandchildren trust,to be distributed as stated in the trust instrument.he allocated the estate residue among his four children,with percent to be disbursed to patrick,percent to be disbursed to marjorie,five percent to be disbursed to michael,and percent to be disbursed to holly.
in,william amended the survivor trust by eliminating michael five percent residual share and increasing patrick share to percent.in,william removed michael children kathleen and cameron as beneficiaries of the grandchildren trust,but he restored their status one year later.in william again removed cameron as a grandchildren trust beneficiary.he also divided the grandchildren trust into equal shares for his six other grandchildren,to be distributed half to the grandchild and half to the grandchild parent who is william child when each grandchild turned.as a result,under the amendment each named grandchild would receive one half of.the trustee was vested with discretion to disburse sums from each grandchild share to pay for that grandchild higher education before age.
william designated marjorie as first successor trustee in,with michael,holly,and patrick in that order designated as successor trustees in the event marjorie was unable to serve.william never changed marjorie designation as first successor trustee,but he removed michael from the list of successor trustees in.
william executed a final amendment to the survivor trust on june,two weeks after he underwent surgery to remove a subdural hematoma.the amendment restored michael as a trust beneficiary on equal footing with his siblings,and it restored cameron as a grandchildren trust beneficiary on equal footing with his sister and cousins.under the amendment,michael was designated to succeed william as trustee,with marjorie,holly,and patrick in that order designated as successor trustees.by adding cameron as a grandchildren trust beneficiary,the amendment reduced each grandchild fixed disbursement under the amendment from to,a difference of.
in late,william resigned as trustee and michael became successor trustee.according to michael first account and report filed may,when william died in the survivor trust held assets exceeding million.
ii.trial court proceeding 
following michael first accounting,holly son bennett filed a petition under probate code section to determine the validity of the june,amendment to the survivor trust.bennett alleged that william lacked testamentary capacity and was unduly influenced by michael in executing the amendment,and that michael unduly benefited from the disposition of the trust estate and from his appointment as successor trustee.the petition alleged further that michael had deprived william of proper medical care after william fell in,and in when william contracted pneumonia.the petition sought a determination that the amendment was void due to lack of testamentary capacity and undue influence.
in preparation for trial,michael moved in limine to exclude all evidence supporting a challenge to the residue of the survivor trust estate.michael argued that bennett,as a grandchild,was not a beneficiary to the trust residue,and thus had no standing to challenge the residue.bennett argued that as a beneficiary of the trust,he was entitled to challenge the validity of the amendment in its entirety under section.
at argument held on the first day of trial,michael identified bennett interest in the amendment as.he argued that bennett interest was not an interest in the residuary estate so it did not provide him with standing to challenge the residue,and that if is what would be holding up the court in terms of a full dismissal,he was certain the residuary beneficiaries who had formally objected to bennett petition would pay the difference to bennett to end the litigation,subject to the right to recover their attorney fees.citing section,which authorizes a court to dismiss a section petition if it appears that the proceeding is not reasonably necessary for the protection of the interests of the trustee or beneficiary,michael argued that bennett should not be allowed to burden the residue with litigation.
the court expressed its view that bennett could contest the amendment because that instrument reduced his interest in the grandchildren subtrust.the court was uncertain whether,if bennett were to prevail,the remedy would be to invalidate only the grandchildren subtrust in which bennett held an interest resulting in cameron losing his interest in that subtrust or the entire instrument.at that point michael told the court that cameron will waive his interest in the grandchildren trust to dispose of the case in its entirety.bennett rejoined that michael should not be able to manipulate standing at the time of trial,and that the challenge to the amendment affected not only bennett own pecuniary interest in the grandchildren trust,but the validity of the entire instrument.
emphasizing that the law disfavors will contests,the trial court stated its intention to dismiss the petition under section if cameron would agree to relinquish his interest in the grandchildren trust,because that relinquishment would eliminate bennett standing by restoring his interest to what it was before the amendment.the court explained i f cameron gave up his share because he wants to save his family not just the expense but so everybody can get along because that the most important thing in a family and i think that why will contests are disfavored,correct,in probate then there is no harm to vet it and everybody can live in harmony so is that what the policy of the law is,if will contests are disfavored 
bennett disagreed,arguing when there undue influence and when there lack of testamentary capacity,when there is elder abuse,will contests,trust contests and elder abuse complaints are very much favored by the courts and the l egislature.the court countered except that none of the other beneficiaries believe that that is what happened,if they did themselves raise the issue in a petition.to which bennett responded and you do need more than one beneficiary to raise an issue.if you have four beneficiaries y ou do need two,three or four of four.you do need a majority to do a trust or will contest.you nee
