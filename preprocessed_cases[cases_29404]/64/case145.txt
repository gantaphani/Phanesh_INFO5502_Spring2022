susan doolittle appeals from orders of the probate court authorizing exchange bank,the trustee for her mother trust,to use trust assets to defend against two actions susan has filed challenging the disposition of the trust estate under an amendment to the trust.susan contends the provision of the amendment that authorizes these expenditures is,in effect,a clause that under current provisions of the probate code may not be enforced without a determination that her challenges lack merit and were brought without probable cause and,in all events,may not be enforced until the validity of the amendment containing the authorization has been adjudicated.we find no merit in these contentions and thus shall affirm the orders.
factual and procedural history 
on november,constance doolittle connie established an inter vivos trust.connie was both the trustor and the initial trustee of the trust and she retained the right to amend and revoke it during her lifetime.connie named various persons as beneficiaries of gifts from the trust estate and designated her two daughters,susan and carolyn,as remainder beneficiaries of her approximately million estate.
on june,connie amended the trust by executing the first amendment to the constance doolittle trust utd november.the amendment,among other things,included two gifts,one to a friend and the other to a caregiver.
in,connie hired juan amador as her gardener.a few months later,on september,connie amended and restated her trust in its entirety by executing the first amended and restated trust agreement of the constance doolittle trust utd november.among other changes,the revised trust included a large gift of real property to juan,and added six additional residual beneficiaries,including juan and five other friends and caregivers.
beginning in,connie began paying attorney fees out of trust funds to defend against what she perceived as attacks by susan and carolyn on the validity of her designated gifts to juan.the record does not reveal the details of these attacks or of the steps taken for which the attorney fees were paid.
on january,connie amended and restated the trust in what would be its final form,by executing the second amended and restated trust agreement of the constance doolittle trust utd november,hereafter trust.in the trust,connie made gifts upon her death to various beneficiaries,including to susan,to carolyn,and to each of her grandchildren.she named seven persons,not including susan or carolyn,as remainder beneficiaries,giving of the remainder to juan and of the remainder to each of six beneficiaries who were connie friends and caregivers.
in the trust instrument connie declared that various powers belonged to her as trustee and to any successor trustee,including the power to litigate and employ and reasonably compensate attorneys.connie designated exchange bank trustee as her successor trustee.under the heading no contest provisions,the trust instrument included the following two provisions 
no contest.if any beneficiary hereunder or any other person shall,singly or in conjunction with any other person s,in any manner,directly or indirectly,contest in any court the validity of this agreement or of trustor will or any codicil thereto collectively,will seek to obtain an adjudication in any proceeding or court that this agreement,such will or any provisions thereof are void or otherwise seek to void,nullify or set aside this agreement,trustor will,or any provisions thereof,then the right of that person to take any interest given to him or her by this agreement or by trustor will shall be determined as it would have been determined had such person predeceased trustor,without issue.any proceedings that thwart the specific intentions and directives expressed in this agreement or in trustor will,or which frustrate trustor testamentary or other intentions,including actions for constructive trust,heirship proceedings,petitions to construe this agreement trustor will,creditor claims and the like shall be considered a direct or indirect contest of this agreement.any attempt by any person to obtain more than is provided for him or her in this agreement or in trustor will shall be considered a contest to this agreement and to trustor will.trustor hereby affirmatively states that she has no obligations,contractual or otherwise,to her daughters or to any of her daughters family members,including,without limitation,a spouse if any,companion if any a daughter issue.therefore,any attempt by any of trustor children issue to obtain more than is provided for any of them in this agreement or under trustor will shall be construed as a contest to this agreement and to trustor will.the trustee is hereby directed to defend,at the expense of any trust estate governed by this agreement,any contest or other attack of any nature on this agreement,on any of its provisions and any amendments hereto,and on trustor will,an attack of any nature on trustor estate planning and the inter vivos disposition,or disposition at death,of her assets and estate.
expenses of contest.notwithstanding the foregoing provisions of this section,if the trustee should be unsuccessful in defending any matter described in that section and does not settle such action and if,for any reason,the gifts to and interests of the contestant under this agreement trustor will are not forfeited,all of the costs of such defense shall be charged against the gifts to and interests of such contestant under this agreement trustor will,and all gifts to and interests of the contestant under this agreement trustor will shall be reduced on a basis by the aggregate net value,as determined by the trustee,of all real and personal property passing or distributable to or for the benefit of the contestant as a result of such matter or action,including,without limitation,assets of the trust estate or trustor probate estate,insurance proceeds,employee benefits and deferred compensation.accordingly,in making any settlement hereunder,the trustee is directed to abide by these provisions to the extent possible.
on january,the same day she executed the trust,connie also executed a document entitled instructions to successor trustee and to agent which provided that if any of her representatives my attorney,my accountant,my investment counsel,my trustee,my agent,any doctor or psychologist,or any other representative of mine was called upon to testify to her intentions or her circumstances with respect to the inter vivos gifts and estate planning documents,the representative should be compensated at his or her regular,usual and customary rate.
at about the same time connie was examined by stephen francis,a licensed psychologist with a specialty in neuropsychology,who signed an affidavit in which he attested that,on the date she executed the trust instrument and related documents,she had sufficient capacity to do so.connie also obtained six certificates of independent review from eliot lippman,an independent estate planning attorney.lippman counseled connie regarding the nature and consequences of each of the bequests connie had made,including the gift to juan,and attested that none was the product of fraud or undue influence.
on july,connie resigned as trustee and exchange bank accepted the position of successor trustee.
connie died on january.
on may,in the marin county superior court,susan filed an action against juan for financial elder abuse,charging he had systematically manipulated connie by unduly influencing and fraudulently inducing her to execute the and trust documents.susan complaint seeks a determination that those instruments are invalid a determination that the no contest clause of the trust is unenforceable and an order directing the trustee to distribute the trust estate in accordance with the trust as amended by the trust amendment.
on may,susan petitioned the sonoma county superior court,sitting in probate,for a determination that connie lacked testamentary capacity when she executed the and trust documents.again,she charged that juan had systematically manipulated connie and sought the same relief as in the marin county action.
on june,exchange bank,as trustee,petitioned the probate court in sonoma county for instructions.citing the provision of the trust that imposes a duty to defend at the trust expense against any contest or other attack on connie estate plan,trustee requested an order confirming its authority to use funds in the trust estate to retain counsel to defend against susan two actions and to compensate connie representatives for all time spent in connection with their testimony in the two proceedings.
the following day,susan filed her own petition for instructions in the sonoma county probate court.she admitted that each of her two actions is a contest against connie estate plan,but argued that the provision in the trust is a clause and that the trustee is prohibited from defending against either action until the courts resolve the two contests on their merits.on september,susan filed a first amended petition seeking,among other things,an order determining that the instructions is not a trust instrument.
on october,following a hearing,the probate court granted trustee petition and in a separate order denied susan petition.the court found that the defense provision is not a clause and that the trustee is authorized to use trust funds to defend against susan action to invalidate the trust and her related action for financial abuse of an elder.the court found further that the instructions are part of the trust agreement.
susan timely appealed from the two orders.on march,trustee petitioned the probate court under probate code section,subdivision b for authority to comply with the october orders,notwithstanding the automatic stay in effect under section,subdivision a.on june,the probate court issued an order granting trustee petition.thereafter,susan filed a petition for writ of supersedes mandate seeking review of the march order.this court summarily denied susan writ petition.
discussion 
susan principal contention is that the instructions to the trustee to defend her claims at the expense of the trust are in effect a clause that can not be enforced unless and until it is ultimately determined that her claims lack merit and were brought without probable cause.in response to this court request for additional briefing,the parties have also addressed whether the instructions to defend,included in the trust amendment the validity of which is disputed,can in any event be enforced prior to a judicial determination of the validity of the disputed trust instrument.finally,susan challenges the trial court ruling that the instructions,which authorize payment to the trust attorney and other trust representatives at their regular,usual and customary rate are enforceable.
the provision in the trust instructing the trustee to defend against contests is not a no contest clause.
the provision in the trust directing the trustee to defend against contests at the expense of the trust changes what the trustee obligations would be in the absence of such a provision.unless the language of a trust provides otherwise,a trustee is bound to deal impartially with all beneficiaries.hence,when a dispute arises as to who is the rightful beneficiary under a trust,involving no attack upon the validity or assets of the trust itself,the trustee ordinarily must remain impartial,and may not use trust assets to defend the claim of one party against the other.in whittlesey aiello th,the court rejected a request for attorney fees from an attorney who represented the trustee,who was also a beneficiary,in a challenge to the validity of a trust amendment that changed the beneficiaries of the trust.the court held that there was no basis for the recovery of expenses out of the trust assets because the dispute was between the competing beneficiaries and did not stand to benefit the trust itself.id.at.the court held that it would be inequitable to use trust assets to defend against the undue influence claim of the beneficiary named in the original trust document against those beneficiaries named in the amendment because if the former beneficiary prevailed she would be required to finance her own trust litigation and that of her opponent,despite the fact she prevailed.ibid.even assuming the existence of facts that would have led the trustee to believe the trust amendment was valid id.at,the court held,does not establish the objective reasonableness of the trustee defense of the trust amendment.while it would not have been proper for the trustee to have allowed a default in the litigation,there was no basis for the trustee to have taken other than a neutral position in the contest t he parties primarily interested in the outcome of the litigation were the beneficiary under the original trust document on the one hand and the beneficiaries under the amendment on the other.to the extent the attorney for the trustee defended the amendment,he was not representing the interests of the trust or the trustee.in situations such that presented here,counsel must seek compensation from the parties who stand to gain from the litigation,not the trust.id.at.
the decision and reasoning of whittlesey were approved and followed in terry conlan th under similar circumstances.there,the trustee under a trust amendment,who was one of the beneficiaries named in the amendment,was not permitted to recover attorney fees incurred in defending against the claim of the beneficiary named in the original trust agreement.the court held that the trustee has not participated in this litigation as a neutral trustee to defend the trust and protect its assets rather,she has consistently pursued her own interests and those of her siblings beneficiaries under the trust amendment,to the detriment of the beneficiary under the original trust instrument.as such,she must bear her own costs in this litigation,rather than be reimbursed from the trust.id.at.
the trust agreements in whittlesey and terrydid not contain an explicit directive to the trustee to defend claims challenging the validity of the amendment at the trust expense,as does the trust instrument in the present case to avoid application of the holding in whittlesey,such a provision has been recommended in authoritative form books.see drafting cal.revocable trusts ed.no contest clause and miscellaneous trust provisions,cal.will drafting,ed b.these sources suggest inclusion in a trust or will of an optional provision reading,in the case of a trust the trustee is authorized to defend,at the expense of the trust estate,any contest or other attack of any nature on this trust or any of its provisions.drafting cal.revocable trusts,supra.according to the continuing education of the bar ceb book on drafting revocable trusts,drafters may want to authorize the trustee to defend a contest or an attack on the trust without such a clause,the trustee might be hesitant to defend the trust because a court may rule that an attorney who represents the trustee in an unsuccessful defense of a trust contest is not entitled to have fees paid from the trust.drafting cal.revocable trusts,supra,citing whittlesey aiello,supra,th.the authorization to defend in the documents before us is even more expansive than the provision suggested by the ceb,leaving no doubt as to the intention of the amendment drafters.
the optional provision in the ceb form books is recommended as an addition to a standard clause.susan contends that the authorization to defend her claim at the trust expense is in fact part of a clause and therefore subject to the restrictions that now apply to the enforcement of such a provision,specifically the prohibition against enforcing such a provision unless it is determined that the contest was brought without probable cause.while susan is correct that the defense directive is included in the same paragraph of the trust instrument as the forfeiture provision,under the heading no contest,and in that sense is part of the clause,as it is in the ceb form books,that fact does not resolve the issue.the question is not whether that directive is part of the clause,but whether the california statute prohibits enforcement of this directive without a determination that susan claims have been asserted without probable cause.under the governing probate code provisions,the determination of this issue turns on whether the defense directive penalizes susan within the meaning of section,subdivision c.
the evolution of california law governing the enforcement of clauses in a trust instrument is summarized by our supreme court in donkin donkin cal th.under the current statutory scheme,applicable to trust instruments that became irrevocable on or after january,a no contest clause may not be enforced in response to a direct contest to a trust absent a determination that the contest was brought without probable cause,subd.a.a no contest clause is defined as a provision in an otherwise valid instrument that,if enforced,would penalize a beneficiary if the beneficiary files a contest with the court,subd.c.a contest is defined as a pleading filed with the court by a beneficiary that would result in a penalty under a no contest clause,if the no contest clause is enforced,subd.a.a direct contest is a contest that alleges the invalidity of an instrument such as a trust or will,or any of the terms of such an instrument,based on any of specified grounds including lack of capacity or undue influence,subd.b.
susan does not dispute that her lawsuits are direct contests within the meaning of the statute.as indicated,she contends that the directive to defend against her contests is part of the trust clause and is unenforceable unless and until a determination has been made that she filed the contests without probable cause.
the interpretation of a will or a trust presents a question of law subject to our independent review unless interpretation turns on the credibility of extrinsic evidence or a conflict therein.burch george cal th.the interpretation of section is also subject to de novo review.bradley gilbert th.
susan argues that the instruction to defend at the trust expense comes within the statutory definition of a clause because it penalizes her for contesting the terms of the trust.she asserts that the provision does so by reversing the otherwise applicable law requiring the competing beneficiaries to bear their own legal expenses in a contest of this nature.she continues,the law is clear that absent the no contest directive,the trustee could not assume the contests defense at the trust expense.plainly,the no contest directive is intended to reverse this law and disadvantage susan by requiring her to prosecute the case,when juan and the other proponent beneficiaries need not expend anything on their defense.this litigation posture indisputably disadvantages susan as the contestant no contesting beneficiary would ever prefer it,every defending beneficiary would.
trustee disputes that the directive that the trustee defend at the trust expense is a penalty within the meaning of section,subdivision a,or that penalize as used in subdivision c includes any provision that in any way disadvantages a beneficiary.trustee argues that these terms must be interpreted in the context in which clauses have been understood historically.prior to,the probate code did not generally deal with no contest clauses.see legis.counsel digest,assem.bill,stats,ch.reg.sess.summary.neither the common law nor prior california case law provides an explicit uniform definition of a clause,but in the context of deciding other issues frequently whether a particular application to the court constituted a contest violating the clause the cases uniformly assumed that a clause is,as trustee contends,one that takes away or reduces or results in a forfeiture of a beneficiary share under a trust or will as a result of the contest,estate of black d,a no contest clause impos es a penalty of forfeiture against beneficiaries who challenge the instrument.in burch,the court explained,an in terrorem or no contest clause in a will or trust instrument creates a condition upon gifts and dispositions provided therein.citation.in essence,a no contest clause conditions a beneficiary right to take the share provided to that beneficiary under such an instrument upon the beneficiary agreement to acquiesce to the terms of the instrument.burch george,supra,th at.the condition results in a forfeiture if not satisfied.ibid.what these clauses generally provide is that a beneficiary under the will must take exactly as the testator provided or not at all.directed against beneficiaries who are also heirs,the forfeiture penalties are used to induce disappointed survivors to take a lesser benefit under the will rather than risk an all or nothing gamble by contesting probate leavitt,scope and effectiveness of no contest clauses in last wills and testaments hastings.
probate code provisions first adopted in were intended to codify much of the law governing enforcement of no contest clauses.burch george,supra,cal th at,fn.the definition of a clause as a provision that penalizes a beneficiary for filing a contest first appeared in the probate code in former section,subdivision b stats,ch,then moved a year later to former section,subdivision d stats,ch,and finally moved,unchanged,in,to section,subdivision c stats,ch,the legislative history of these provisions contains no explicit discussion of the intended scope of the terms penalty and penalize.however,the recommendation of the california law revision commission that preceded adoption of the legislation began with the statement,a will,trust,or other instrument may contain a no contest,or in terrorem,clause to the effect that a person who contests or attacks the instrument or any of its provisions takes nothing under the instrument or takes a reduced share.recommendation relating to no contest clauses cal.revision com.the commission recommended the definition of a clause in substantially the same form as in the current statute a provision in an otherwise valid instrument that,if enforced,would penalize a beneficiary if the beneficiary brings a contest with the comment that the definition section is intended for drafting convenience.id.at.the term no contest clause,the comment states,has been used in the literature,as well as the term in terrorem clause,to describe a provision of the type defined in this section.ibid.more tellingly,the comment also states that this definition of a clause supersedes a portion of former subdivision d of section a provision in a will that a person who contests or attacks the will or any of its provisions takes nothing under the will or takes a reduced share.id.at.the comment points out that the new provision,unlike former section,governs trusts and other donative transfers as well as wills.ibid.but the comment says nothing to suggest that the new definition expands the reach of a clause beyond providing that one who contests a donative instrument takes nothing or takes a reduced share.id.at.
numerous legislative analyses of the provisions as they were adopted in and amended in refer to a clause as a provision that provides that a person who contests the will shall take nothing or a reduced share,legis.counsel,assem.bill,supra,summary,com.on judiciary on assem bill,as amended,rules com.on assem.bill,recommendation proposing new probate code cal.law revision com.there is nothing in this history that suggests an intention to treat anything other than the forfeiture of all or a portion of a gift as a penalty to which section refers.when in the law revision commission suggested further revisions to the clause statute,to simplify and clarify those provisions and extend the probable cause provision to all direct contests,no change in the statutory definition of a clause was recommended.yet the commission report again begins with the statement,a no contest clause also called an in terrorem clause is a provision inserted in a will,trust,or other instrument to the effect that a person who contests or attacks the instrument or any of its provisions takes nothing under the instrument or takes a reduced share.recommendation on revision of no contest clause cal.law revision com.see also.
susan has not cited any authority applying section in the broad manner she suggests.to the contrary,numerous decisions rendered after adoption of the current statutory definition continue to reflect the same understanding of a no contest clause as one that takes away or reduces a beneficiary interest.estate of katleman,fn.the statutory definition of a no contest clause as a penalty implies that a no contest clause takes away or reduces the gifts of persons provided for in the will if they contest it.see also burch george,supra,cal th at.in the most recent supreme court pronouncement dealing with the enforcement of a clause,the court has again reaffirmed that a n in terrorem or no contest clause in a trust instrument essentially acts as a disinheritance device,if a beneficiary contests or seeks to impair or invalidate the trust instrument or its provisions,the beneficiary will be disinherited and thus may not take the gift or devise provided under the instrument.donkin donkin,supra,cal th at.
susan argues that if the defense directive is not considered a part of the clause,her share in the estate will be reduced even if she prevails in the litigation.she explains that if she is successful in striking the later amendments,she and her sister will be reinstated as the sole residual beneficiaries and the cost of the defense will have reduced the trust residue to which they are entitled.the same is true,however,for the beneficiaries named in the disputed trust amendment.if the trustee prevails against susan contest,they will remain the residual beneficiaries and their share of the residue will also have been reduced by the cost of the defense.in short,assuming probable cause for susan claims,whoever prevails ultimately bears the costs of the defense.while susan is required to bear her costs,that would be the case regardless of whether the trust assumes the cost of defense.the fact that the adverse parties in interest are not similarly burdened is not a penalty imposed on susan but an unavoidable consequence of the situation if anything,a benefit to the other parties.if the rule were otherwise and the beneficiaries named in the amendment were unable to assume the costs of defense,there would be no means to defend implementation of the trustor intentions in amending the trust even if the challenger attack on the amendment were entirely unfounded.
indeed,the unavoidable realities of the situation provide an additional reason why the defense directive to the trustee can not be construed as a clause.a provision eliminating or reducing a gift to a beneficiary who without probable cause attacks the validity of a trust or other donative instrument can sensibly be applied after the merits of the underlying challenge have been determined.under the conventional understanding of a clause as a provision removing or reducing what is otherwise given to the contesting party the provision need not and can not be enforced until it is known whether the contest has merit.if,on the other hand,the directive to the trustee to defend the challenge were construed as a clause,which could be enforced only after it was determined that the underlying challenge lacked merit and was brought without probable cause,the trustee would have no means of knowing whether the instruction should be observed prior to resolution of the merits of the underlying controversy.the trustee would be unable to comply with the directive until after the litigation had been concluded,rendering the directive meaningless.as a fundamental matter of statutory interpretation,such an absurdity is to be avoided,california school employees governing board cal th.
it should be noted that this conclusion does not imply that all of the provisions of sections and of the trust instrument may be enforced.the portion of section that directs the trustee to defend the underlying contest at the expense of the trust estate was properly determined by the trial court not to be a clause within the meaning of section,subdivision c.however,the provisions of sections and that purport to reduce or eliminate the amounts otherwise distributable to a beneficiary filing a contest appear to come squarely within the definition of a clause.although the issue is not presented in this appeal,those provisions appear unenforceable unless it is determined that susan challenges have been brought without probable cause.
in summary,we agree with the trial court conclusion that the defense directive is not an element of the clause.
the provision in the trust instructing the trustee to defend against contests is enforceable prior to the determination of the merits of susan challenges.
on acceptance of the trust,the trustee has a duty to administer the trust according to the trust instrument and,except to the extent the trust instrument provides otherwise,according to this division.a trustee has the following powers without the need to obtain court authorization a the powers conferred by the trust instrument.b except as limited in the trust instrument,the powers conferred by statute.c except as limited in the trust instrument,the power to perform any act that a trustee would perform for the purposes of the trust under the applicable standard of care.the grant of a power to a trustee,whether by the trust instrument,by statute,or by the court,does not in itself require or permit the exercise of the power.the exercise of a power by a trustee is subject to the trustee fiduciary duties.these powers and corresponding duties of the trustee remain in effect until the trust is terminated.witkin,summary of cal.law ed.trusts.as a power conferred by the instrument,the power to defend against contests remains in effect until the trust,or as in this case the trust amendment,is judicially invalidated or otherwise terminated.
there is some logic to susan contention that since the validity of the amendment conferring the trustee with the authority to defend her claims is the very subject of the litigation and has not yet been adjudicated,enforcement of the defense directive should await the outcome of the litigation.susan analogizes the situation to a contest to the probate of a will,in which the executor named in the proffered will may not use estate assets for the costs of defending the challenge until the contest has been resolved and the will admitted to probate.henry superior court cal.estate of pereira d.however,an executor has neither authority nor responsibility to carry out the terms of a will until the will has been admitted to probate see,subd.b person named as executor in a will under no duty to defend a contest until appointed personal representative,whereas,as pointed out above,the trustee under an inter vivos trust has such authority once assuming the position of trustee.
a person challenging the validity of a trust instrument on the grounds that the trustor lacked capacity to execute the document or did so under the undue influence of another carries the heavy burden of proving such allegations.section,subdivision a creates a rebuttable presumption affecting the burden of proof that all persons have the capacity to make decisions and to be responsible for their acts or decisions.under section,a determination that a person lacks the capacity to execute a trust must be supported by evidence of a deficit in at least one of specified mental functions that by itself or in combination with one or more other mental function deficits significantly impairs the person ability to understand and appreciate the consequences of his or her actions with regard to the type of act or decision in question,subds.a,b.and in determining capacity to execute a trust amendment that in its content and complexity,closely resembles a will or codicil,such as the amendment in this case,the courts have held that the lower mental capacity standard for the making of a will should apply.andersen hunt th,lentz lentz cal th.t he standard for testamentary capacity is exceptionally low.in re marriage of greenway th.similarly,the party contesting a testamentary disposition bears the burden of proving undue influence and u ndue influence must be proven by clear and convincing evidence.conservatorship of davidson th,disapproved on other grounds in bernard foley cal th,fn,subd.a.it is entirely consistent with these principles that the trust should ordinarily be administered according to
