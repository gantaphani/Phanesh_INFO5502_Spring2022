appellant mary lou sanders,cotrustee of the marion sanders trust the trust,appeals from the probate court order denying her petition and finding that her adopted son,andrew wallace,is not a beneficiary of the trust.mary is the income beneficiary of the trust.the trust provides that,upon mary death,mary issue will receive the trust assets,and it defines issue to include adopted children.however,the probate court concluded that andrew did not fall within this definition of issue because he had been adopted as an adult under texas adoption statutes.the probate court believed that a texas relationship did not encompass the same rights and duties as a california relationship.we conclude that the probate court decision is not supported by the law.hence,we reverse its order and remand with directions to grant mary petition.
background 
mary is the only child of the marriage of marion sanders and herbert sanders.mary half brother,george,is herbert son and marion stepson.respondent jody lynn sanders yanez is george eldest daughter.
in,marion executed a will prepared by a california attorney and executed in california.marion will placed most of her separate property assets in the trust and provided that mary would receive the income from the trust during her lifetime.it further provided that,if mary needed additional funds,the corporate cotrustee of the trust,bank of america,was authorized to provide her and any issue with payments from the principal of the trust.upon mary death,the remainder of the trust assets was to be distributed for the benefit of the then living issue of mary the will provided the word issue as used in this will shall refer to lawful lineal descendants of all degrees and shall include legally adopted children.if mary had no living issue surviving her,jody was to become the income beneficiary of the trust.upon jody death,any remaining trust assets were to be used to establish a scholarship fund at san jose state university in herbert name.
when marion executed her will in,mary was years old,living in arizona,and intending to marry and move to minnesota with her husband.marion was aware of mary plans.marion died in.herbert was the original cotrustee of the trust he died in.mary succeeded herbert as the cotrustee of the trust.bank of america resigned as cotrustee of the trust at some point and was replaced with an attorney.in,the trust assets apparently consisted of two condos in texas.by the time this action was litigated,the trust assets apparently had dwindled to just a single condo valued at.
andrew is the biological son of mary close friend,and mary has known him since he was a child.in,mary,who resides in texas,adopted andrew,who was then an adult.the texas adoption order provided that andrew j wallace is henceforth the son of mary for all purposes.
in,mary,as cotrustee of the trust,filed a petition seeking a determination that andrew was the successor beneficiary of the trust.jody opposed mary petition.jody claimed that the texas adoption did not make andrew mary issue because a texas adoption did not impose the same mutual obligations that exist under california law.she argued that texas law does not require a parent to support an adult child and does not require a child to support a parent.
the court denied mary petition and found that andrew did not qualify as mary issue under marion will.although the court found adopted children was not ambiguous on the face of the will,it found that there was a latent ambiguity.the court acknowledged that no extrinsic evidence was offered surrounding the circumstances of testator executing her will other than the fact that mary was unmarried at that time it made its decision based solely on statutes,case law,and public policy.the court agreed with mary that marion use of the words adopted children included adopted adults and that a texas adoption of an adult creates a relationship.however,the court found that a texas adoption of an adult was not the equivalent of a california adoption of an adult because a texas adult adoption does not sever the relationship between the adopted adult and his or her biological parents as california law does and does not require an adult child to support a parent as california law does.the court concluded that a texas adult adoption appears in substance to convey nothing more than heirship rights.the court found that testator did not intend the term issue in her will to include adopted adults whose adoptive status lacked essential elements of what such status would entail under california law.mary timely filed a notice of appeal.
ii.discussion 
the interpretation of a written instrument,even though it involves what might properly be called questions of fact citation,is essentially a judicial function to be exercised according to the generally accepted canons of interpretation so that the purposes of the instrument may be given effect.citations.extrinsic evidence is admissible to interpret the instrument,but not to give it a meaning to which it is not reasonably susceptible citations,and it is the instrument itself that must be given effect.citations.it is therefore solely a judicial function to interpret a written instrument unless the interpretation turns upon the credibility of extrinsic evidence.parsons bristol development cal d.
mary contends that we should exercise independent review jody claims that our review is not independent because there was extrinsic evidence before the probate court in the form of declarations.the probate court expressly found that there was no extrinsic evidence of marion intent,and its interpretation of marion will did not turn on the credibility of any extrinsic evidence.hence,we exercise independent review.
marion will expressly included adopted children in the trust definition of issue.as the probate court correctly noted,there was no ambiguity on the face of the will as to marion intent that mary adopted children would be considered mary issue for purposes of succeeding to the trust assets.the latent ambiguity identified by the probate court was what exactly marion meant by adopted children.the court looked to statutes,case authority,and public policy to resolve this latent ambiguity.
the probate court did not find that the fact that andrew was adopted as an adult meant that he did not come within the meaning of adopted children in marion will.it found that andrew did not come within the meaning of adopted children because his adoption under texas law did not create a relationship that was the equivalent of the relationship that would have been created by a california adoption at the time of marion will and to which marion was presumed to be referring.
the status of an adopted child is determined by the laws of the state in which the adoption was effected in re estate of hebert d.texas law provides that,upon adoption of an adult,t he adopted adult is the son or daughter of the adoptive parents for all purposes,is entitled to inherit from and through the adopted adult adoptive parents as though the adopted adult were the biological child of the adoptive parents,and may not inherit from or through the adult biological parent,and a biological parent may not inherit from or through an adopted adult.texas case law unambiguously holds that an adopted adult is for every purpose,the child of his parent or parents by adoption as fully as though born of them in lawful wedlock.lehman corpus christi bank,italics added.
despite the clarity of texas law establishing that an adopted adult has the same status as the biological child of the adoptive parents for all purposes,the probate court concluded that a texas adult adoption established nothing more than heirship rights.it based this conclusion on its belief that a texas adult adoption does not sever the relationship between the adopted adult and his or her biological parents as california law does and does not require an adult child to support a parent as california law does.
the probate court relied heavily on the fourth district court of appeal decision in ehrenclou macdonald th ehrenclou.the trust in ehrenclou was created in.it provided that,upon the trustor death,the trust
