the issue in this appeal is whether a trust beneficiary may avoid a no contest clause in a trust instrument by utilizing a statutory procedure under california probate law to reallocate trust principal and income.we conclude that the statutory procedure does not insulate the beneficiary from the impact of the no contest clause,which is broad enough to encompass the relief she ultimately seeks.we affirm the order of the trial court denying plaintiff application for an order determining that her proposed action would not violate the clause.

union bank of california has served as the trustee since creation of the trust and is given broad powers,including the discretion to determine what is principal or income of the trust estate.the trust is to be governed by california law and provides except insofar as the trustee shall exercise the discretion herein conferred,matters relating to principal and income shall be governed by the provisions of the principal and income law from time to time existing.
as of,only one first tier beneficiary was alive helen richardson,then years old.at the time,the trust estate was worth over and generated an annual income over.the only distribution from the trust was the fixed monthly payment to richardson.all remaining income was added to principal.the second tier beneficiaries sought to modify the trust to begin receiving trust income in excess of richardson share.this effort failed because the beneficiaries could not obtain a favorable ruling from the internal revenue service irs concerning transfer tax.
by,the trust estate had grown to over and was generating more than income annually.the second tier beneficiaries obtained the favorable irs ruling that year.together with all the third tier beneficiaries,they reached a settlement and brought a petition to modify the trust.in may,the probate court issued an order approving the settlement.the trustee was instructed to purchase an annuity to secure the monthly payments to first tier beneficiary richardson.under the terms of the order,the second tier beneficiaries are to receive equal shares of the net income from the trust.third tier beneficiaries are to receive annual payments for the remainder of richardson life,plus to be set aside in a further trust for the benefit of the issue of the third tier beneficiaries.no one raised an issue that this petition violated the no contest clause.
pursuant to the order,the trust estate was divided into three equal shares held for the benefit of the second tier beneficiaries.by the end of,plaintiff had a separate trust interest worth over.together with the equal shares of the other second tier beneficiaries,the total value of the original trust exceeded.
in early,an attorney for plaintiff contacted the trustee and requested an adjustment between the principal and income of plaintiff share of the trust for that year.this was to be accomplished by transferring a portion of the principal of that share into income,thus increasing the annual distribution to plaintiff.the trustee wrote to plaintiff and all known beneficiaries advising them that he proposed to transfer from principal cash to income cash in plaintiff trust.the letter explained the procedure for filing an objection to this proposal.
a number of beneficiaries objected to the proposal,and as a result,the trustee decided not to implement the proposed adjustment.plaintiff filed an application under probate code section to obtain a judicial determination as to whether a petition to modify her share of the trust by adjusting principal and income would violate the no contest clause.she attached a copy of her petition for instructions to direct the adjustment of principal and income.to avoid confusion,we refer to the application under section as the safe harbor application and to the petition for instructions as the adjustment petition.in the adjustment petition,plaintiff relied upon the california uniform principal and income act cupia,section et and section.
plaintiff explained why she wanted an adjustment of income and principal the trustee has concluded that as a result of having invested the trust assets in accordance with a total return objective and the prudent investor rule,ava trust is generating insufficient accounting income to provide the income beneficiary,the petitioner herein,with that degree of beneficial enjoyment that she would ordinarily expect to receive as the sole income beneficiary of a separate trust for her benefit.she provided a chart demonstrating that the annual income distributed to her had dropped from to over the previous period.
plaintiff asked the court to make not only the single adjustment initially proposed by the trustee in,but also to make additional adjustments between principal and income on an annual basis,sufficient to give her a guaranteed minimum yield of percent of her trust share.at the end of each calendar year,the trustee would determine the amount of gross income generated by plaintiff trust for the year.if the accounting gross income generated by plaintiff trust for such year is less than four percent of the market value of the principal assets of the plaintiff trust at the close of business on the last day of such year,as determined by the trustee in the trustee discretion,the trustee shall adjust the principal and income accounts of plaintiff trust by allocating to income for such year from principal an amount equal to the resulting shortfall.plaintiff wanted this adjustment to continue from year to year unless and until modified by the trustee or further order of the court.
plaintiff argued that the adjustment petition would not trigger the no contest clause because she does not seek to impair,object to or invalidate any provisions contained in the trust.she claimed,instead,that she only sought to enforce her statutory right under section,subdivision d to petition the court.she argued that her request involved only the fiduciary power of the trustee.she speculated that the settlor could not possibly have specifically intended the no contest clause which was prepared in to prevent her from exercising a statutory right that became available to her by legislation in the year.
the potter third tier beneficiaries and the astaire beneficiaries opposed plaintiff safe harbor application on the ground that the adjustment petition would impair the trust provisions directing that plaintiff only receive net income and that the principal be preserved for the third tier beneficiaries.they argued this would constitute a contest under the no contest clause.they also argued the invasion of principal to provide the guaranteed higher yield sought by plaintiff would further frustrate the settlor intent by reducing the principal available to meet plaintiff guaranteed income.
plaintiff replied to the oppositions and argued the adjustment petition would not violate the no contest clause because she is merely complying with the statutory procedure provided in cupia seeking an adjustment between principal and income is not an action identified as a violation of the no contest clause under section and the no contest clause is to be strictly construed,and as so interpreted,the adjustment petition is not a contest.
the potter third tier beneficiaries submitted a declaration by michael cutshall,a vice president of union bank of california and administrator of the trust.he explained currently,the trustee takes no position regarding whether an adjustment to the allocation of principal and income of the ava astaire mckenzie share should or should not be implemented.further,the trustee does not intend to either support or oppose the application by mckenzie for an order determining that her proposed petition seeking to implement an adjustment does not constitute a contest within the terms of the no contest clause of the trust,and the trustee does not intend to support or oppose mckenzie proposed petition if it is filed.
after taking the matter under submission,the probate court issued the following ruling court determines that filing of the proposed petition will be a contest within the meaning of the no contest clause of the trust.court finds that proposed petition would change the characterization of property from principal to interest thereby changing the intent of the settlor.estate of pittman th,d.the court denied all requests for attorney fees.this appeal followed.the astaire beneficiaries join in the brief filed by the potter third tier beneficiaries.
discussion 
plaintiff argues her adjustment petition would not violate the no contest clause in the trust instrument because the trust instrument expressly permits the trustee to make the proposed adjustment under cupia the proposed petition complies with the statutory procedures set forth in cupia and seeking an adjustment between principal and income is not an action identified in the no contest clause as a violation of the clause under section.
section provides in pertinent part a if an instrument containing a no contest clause is or has become irrevocable,a beneficiary may apply to the court for a determination of whether a particular motion,petition,or other act by the beneficiary,would be a contest within the terms of the no contest clause.it provides a safe harbor for beneficiaries who seek a judicial determination whether a proposed legal challenge would be a contest,and that is the only issue to be decided when such an application is made.citation.as a general rule,the decision about whether the beneficiary proposed action would be a will contest may not involve a determination of the merits of the action itself hearst ganzi,supra,th,d hearst,quoting estate of davies,supra,th at,d.our standard of review is de novo because the petition presents a legal question with respect to the applicability of the no contest clause.hearst,supra,th at,d.
section,subdivision a defines contest as any action identified in a no contest clause as a violation of the clause.the term includes both direct and indirect contests.the issue here is whether plaintiff proposal to adjust income and principal would constitute an indirect contest,which is defined as a pleading in a proceeding in any court that indirectly challenges the validity of an instrument or one or more of its terms based on any other ground not contained in subdivision b direct contests,and that does not contain any of those grounds,subd.c.
the principles governing interpretation and enforcement of no contest clauses are well established on the one hand,they are favored since they discourage litigation and give effect to the testator intent.citations.on the other hand,clauses are disfavored because they work a forfeiture.citation.resolution of these competing policies requires clauses be strictly construed and not extended beyond what was plainly the testator intent.citation.however,a court may not rewrite a will so as to exempt contests or legal proceedings from the scope of the clause which would frustrate the testator purpose as expressed in his or her will.citation.whether there has been a contest within the meaning of a particular clause depends upon the circumstances of the particular case and the language used.citation.hearst,supra,th at,d,quoting estate of watson d.
here the no contest clause applies to any beneficiary who contested or sought to impair,object to or invalidate this declaration of trust as we have discussed,the trust creates three tiers of beneficiaries.the fixed monthly income to be paid to the first tier beneficiaries was guaranteed by a provision allowing the trustee to invade the trust principal for that purpose.unlike the first tier,the second tier beneficiaries,including plaintiff,were to receive net income rather than a fixed amount or percentage.the trustee was not given a similar power to invade the principal to ensure any particular income flow to the second tier beneficiaries.principal was to be preserved for the third tier residuary beneficiaries.
the intent of the settlor is plain first tier beneficiaries were guaranteed a fixed income second tier beneficiaries were to receive whatever net income was generated and the principal was to be reserved for the third tier beneficiaries.we turn to plaintiff arguments.
the principal thrust of plaintiff argument is that she is merely invoking the statutory cupia procedure for requesting a reallocation of trust principal and income and therefore has not violated the no contest clause.she points out that the trust expressly provides that matters relating to principal and income shall be governed by the provisions of the principal and income law from time to time existing.at oral argument,counsel for plaintiff acknowledged that if her adjustment petition violates the trustor intent,then it also would violate the no contest clause.but she contends that by incorporating cupia,the trustor intended to allow the change sought by plaintiff.
