although a lawyer retained to provide testamentary legal services to a testator may also have a duty to act with due care for the interests of an intended third party beneficiary,the lawyer primary duty is owed to his client and his primary obligation is to serve and carry out the client intentions.where,as here,there is a question about whether the beneficiary was,in fact,the decedent intended beneficiary,and the beneficiary claim is that the lawyer failed to adequately ascertain the testator intent or capacity,the lawyer will not be held accountable to the any other conclusion would place the lawyer in an untenable position of divided loyalty.we reverse the judgment before us.
marlene farris,a widow,met placido chavez in,and chavez moved in with farris not long after that.farris told her daughter juanita boranian that she was lonely and needed a companion.
in,farris refinanced her house and used most of the proceeds to purchase a laundromat for.chavez operated the business but paid nothing toward its purchase or operation he had few assets of his own.farris did not tell her children about the laundromat until september,and then only because boranian had noticed that farris monthly mortgage had increased from about to,at which time farris said she had purchased the laundromat as an asset for her family.later,farris decided to give the laundromat to chavez.
by early,farris was terminally ill and receiving hospice care in her home.chavez who later testified he was acting at farris direction met with a lawyer,laurence clark,and asked him to prepare a will for farris,and documentation of a gift from farris to chavez.on march,chavez again met with clark,told him farris was pretty ill,and gave clark some documents,including a fictitious business name statement listing farris and chavez as of the laundromat,and an undated letter signed by farris in which she stated she was giving chavez the laundromat as a gift.
clark understood from chavez that farris wanted chavez to have the laundromat,and her children to have her house and all of her remaining assets an estate worth about at the time of farris death.chavez told clark he had no money,and the debt incurred to purchase the laundromat should remain as a lien against farris home.in drafting farris will and other documents,clark relied completely on information and directions from chavez,but clark nevertheless considered farris his client,and chavez merely as her agent.on march,clark prepared the requested documents a will,a confirmation of gift,and an assignment of lease,and chavez paid clark fee with farris money.
by the time the documents were prepared,farris condition was deteriorating rapidly.she had trouble breathing,her blood pressure was dropping,her kidneys were failing,and she was taking morphine for pain.she was sometimes confused,very sleepy she would drift off,and sometimes hallucinated.on the morning of march,she was lethargic,hallucinating,and in great pain.she was given additional morphine.farris nurses,who knew chavez as farris significant other,observed mutual affection between the two,and the vocational nurse vickie barela was present when,at,chavez ushered clark and clark secretary jane quintana into farris bedroom.clark did not inquire about farris medication.barela stepped out and the door was locked behind her.
barela immediately called farris son,john farris,who had earlier told barela that he had a power of attorney and should be called if anything suspicious happened.john was upset and told barela to knock on farris door and demand entry.barela complied but was told,she fine.barela overheard comments from inside the room,including,what your name,she asleep,you doing fine,and write your name,marlene farris.
according to clark,he paraphrased the contents of the will for farris she did not read it.he told farris that,as drafted,the laundromat would go to chavez and everything else would go to her children.farris said,that what i want.clark secretary then read the will to farris verbatim,with a copy available for farris to follow along.clark did not tell farris that her children would be financially responsible for the debt incurred to purchase the laundromat.
after some time,farris registered nurse susan yamamoto arrived to find barela still on the phone with john farris.yamamoto spoke to him,then entered farris room finding the door unlocked and chavez absent from the room,observed papers all over the bed,and a pen in farris hand.she told clark and quintana to leave,counted to three,then went to call the police when they did not move.they left,but did not leave copies of any of the documents with farris.yamamoto immediately examined farris and found her extremely sleepy.when the police arrived,farris knew her name but not the exact day or date.medical notes from that morning show that farris was sleepy,confused,and hallucinating.
farris died three days later,on march.farris daughter boranian offered a will for probate,and chavez offered the will prepared by clark in march.a will contest ensued,but chavez ultimately agreed to settle the matter and give up all claim to the laundromat in exchange for.the laundromat was sold in may for.
boranian and john farris collectively boranian then sued clark for professional negligence and breach of fiduciary duty.clark answered,discovery ensued,and the case was tried to the court in.clark asked the court to first consider whether,as a matter of law,he owed a duty to boranian,but the court declined to do so until after boranian presented her evidence.boranian then presented evidence of the facts summarized above,plus the testimony of an expert who opined that clark performance fell below the standard of care.clark motion for nonsuit,made at the close of boranian case,was first tentatively denied,then denied again at the conclusion of the trial.
the trial court found in favor of boranian,determined that clark was negligent,and that his joint representation of both farris and chavez constituted a conflict of interest.the court also found that farris lacked testamentary capacity,but never addressed the issue of duty.a judgment was entered in favor of boranian in which clark was ordered to pay in damages.clark appeals from that judgment.
discussion 
clark contends he did not owe a duty of care to boranian.we agree and therefore do not reach his other claims of error.
it is an elementary proposition that an attorney,by accepting employment to give legal advice or to render legal services,impliedly agrees to use ordinary judgment,care,skill and diligence in the performance of the tasks he undertakes citation.in elaborating on this duty,the cases have repeatedly held that an attorney who assumes preparation of a will incurs a duty not only to the testator client,but also to his intended beneficiaries,and lack of privity does not preclude the testamentary beneficiary from maintaining an action against the attorney based on either the contractual theory of third party beneficiary or the tort theory of negligence.ventura county humane society holloway d.lucas hamm cal d,heyer flaig cal d,moore anderson zeigler disharoon gallagher gray th,d.
but the lawyer liability to the intended beneficiary is not automatic or absolute,and there is no automatic liability where the testator intent or capacity is placed in issue by the allegedly intended beneficiary.whether liability exists in a specific case is a matter of policy and involves the balancing of various factors,including the extent to which the transaction was intended to affect the plaintiff,the foreseeability of harm to the plaintiff,the degree of certainty that the plaintiff suffered injury,the closeness of the connection between the lawyer conduct and the injury suffered,the moral blame attached to the lawyer conduct,the policy of preventing future harm,the likelihood that imposition of liability might interfere with the attorney ethical duties to the client,and whether the imposition of liability would impose an undue burden on the profession.moore anderson zeigler disharoon gallagher gray,supra,th at,d lucas hamm,supra,cal d at.
