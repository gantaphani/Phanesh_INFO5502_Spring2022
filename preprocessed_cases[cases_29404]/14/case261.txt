murdock sons construction,murdock was the subcontractor in a construction contract.murdock was to perform all of the masonry work for a maximum security prison for the state of indiana the state.unfortunately for murdock,its union masons did not work nearly as fast as was projected in the original bid,for reasons that were never determined.this resulted in serious delays and cost overruns however,the state was unwilling to provide murdock with an extension of time in which to complete the project.murdock eventually walked off the job and filed the rarely seen constructive acceleration claim against the general contractor and the state,as well as two other claims we need not address.following a bench trial,the district court ruled against murdock on all claims including a counterclaim by the general contractor not at issue here.murdock appeals,and we affirm.
the state,acting through its department of administration,decided to build a prison near terre haute.goheen general construction,goheen contracted with the state to be the general contractor for the construction of level vi housing for the prison,to be named the wabash valley correctional institution.the prison was to cost the state.goheen and the state entered into a standard agreement for construction projects which also contained an index entitled state of conditions collectively,the contract.
at the state suggestion,murdock submitted a bid to goheen on the masonry subcontract.goheen only received three bids,even though it usually would receive between four and eight.murdock was awarded the subcontract with a bid of.the other two bids were around and,and they did not include rebar.calvin murdock murdock was murdock chairman and ceo.he gave final approval for the bid.the bid was originally calculated by and experienced experts in both engineering and construction.
the prison was to be a maximum security facility.not surprisingly,level vi housing is very dense with masonry.the plan called for cells,feet by feet,and involved small,short walls.each wall,arranged in a large honeycomb fashion,consisted of individual cement blocks.the blocks were reinforced with both horizontal and vertical rebar every eight inches.the specifications called for continuous grouting with cement,as opposed to the usual mortar.the specifications also required the extensive placement of embeds,which required a significant number of cuts be made in the blocks.murdock,although experienced,had no previous experience with masonry projects that were reinforced as much as this prison.
murdock was required to use union masons.it entered into a working agreement with the local union in terre haute.the masons would be employees of murdock,and murdock could not set any minimum level of productivity.murdock had worked on four construction projects in terre haute in the past,although it never dealt directly with the local union.these projects were not as extensive as the prison.
murdock began work in january and almost immediately encountered a serious problem.typically,a mason can lay blocks a day.because of the difficulty of this particular project,murdock had estimated that each mason could lay blocks a day.from the beginning,however,murdock masons were only laying blocks a day.murdock tried to increase productivity.without going into detail,murdock reviewed its plans,fired slow workers,provided additional equipment,and modified the construction process.murdock also hired more masons,increasing its crew to,up from the planned when more were hired,productivity increased,but not for very long.ultimately,murdock refused to add more manpower because the increased productivity was only temporary.both goheen and the state were well aware that construction was progressing slower than planned they requested,and then demanded,that murdock pick up the pace to meet the construction deadline.
in august,murdock formally notified goheen that it wanted more money and more time.the notice was made pursuant to terms contained in the contract.goheen forwarded murdock request to the state.in december,the state denied the request,stating any such request must come directly from goheen.almost immediately thereafter,murdock stopped work and left.the masonry work was not done,and the project was ultimately completed days late.
murdock filed suit,claiming it was entitled to the extension pursuant to the terms of the contract.murdock argued the delay was due to either a labor dispute or a cause beyond its control.the district court conducted a bench trial and thereafter ruled in favor of goheen and the state.

murdock claim in diversity is based on constructive acceleration.the parties represent that there is no indiana case law recognizing or applying a constructive acceleration claim.however,constructive acceleration is recognized in many jurisdictions,and we are of the opinion that such a claim is viable under indiana law.see,stephan rocky mountain chocolate factory,cir citations omitted.a claim of constructive acceleration ordinarily arises when the owner requires the contractor to adhere to the original performance deadline set forth in the contract even though the contract provides the contractor with periods of excusable delay that entitle the contractor to a longer performance period.fraser constr.united states.a constructive acceleration claim has five elements 
the contractor experienced an excusable delay entitling it to a time extension,the contractor properly requested the extension,the project owner failed or refused to grant the requested extension,the project owner demanded that the project be completed by the original completion date despite the excusable delay,and the contractor actually accelerated the work in order to complete the project by the original completion date and incurred added costs as a result.

the parties initially dispute whether murdock properly requested an extension.section of the contract provided that any extension of time shall be made in writing to the designer not more than twenty days after commencement of the delay.the district court found murdock did not provide a written notice in a timely manner therefore,murdock claim was waived,according to the district court.for purposes of our analysis,we will simply assume goheen waived the formal notice requirement,as it was well aware of the problems murdock was having in getting the masons to work as fast as originally projected.a dispositive shortcoming in murdock case,as correctly found by the district court,was the fact that murdock was not experiencing an excusable delay.such a showing is required,as it comprises the first element in a constructive acceleration claim.
section of the contract provided if the contractor is delayed at any time in the progress of the work by labor disputes or any causes beyond the contractor control,the contract time shall be extended by change order of such reasonable time as the designer may determine.murdock did not establish that the pace of the masons was due to either a labor dispute or a cause beyond its control.
