b.the district court determination 
anchor brought an action against rockwood,who markets and manufactures a competing line of concrete blocks for use in the construction of retaining walls,alleging that rockwood wall,classic block infringed certain claims of the patent family and that rockwood wall,cottage stones ii,iii,and iv infringed certain claims of the patent family.with respect to the patent family,the district court first construed the claim terms back surface,protrusion,and mate.the district court construed back surface to include the special characteristic of spanning the full width of the block.anchor,d at.the district court construed protrusion to include the limitation of having a central narrow portion.id.the district court construed mate to require three limitations a close confinement of the protrusion within the inset s of one or more blocks an ability to secure the blocks in place in a forwards and backwards direction and an interlocking of the protrusion with the insets.id.at.
the district court determined that the classic block did not literally infringe the patent family.specifically,the district court determined that the classic block does not have a back surface spanning the full width of the block,but rather a partial back side portion with pointed side extensions that do not abut each other when placed adjacently in a course of blocks.id.at.the district court also determined that the protrusion on the classic block is not a protrusion having a central narrow portion as claimed by anchor,but rather a square extension extending from the bottom surface of the block.id.at.finally,the district court determined that the square extension and inset of the classic block do not mate because they do not cooperate to restrain the block setback in both a forward and backward direction.id.at.
additionally,with respect to the patent family,the district court construed generally parallel as parallel per se,that is,everywhere equally distant.id.at citing collegiate dictionary ed.the district court declined to construe the disputed claim term substantially horizontal.the district court determined that cottage stones ii,iii,and iv did not literally infringe the patent family,because the district court found the cottage stones to have a concave bottom surface.furthermore,with respect to infringement of the patent under the doctrine of equivalents,the district court concluded that,because anchor had amended the asserted claims of the patent during prosecution,there was a complete bar to application of the doctrine of equivalents pursuant to this court ruling in festo,at.
the district court proceeded to grant rockwood motion for partial summary judgment of noninfringement of the and patent families.the district found that there was no genuine issue of material fact,in part,because it granted motions to strike the expert testimony of peter janopaul for being untimely,and alternatively,for being contradictory to previous sworn testimony.anchor timely appealed,and we have jurisdiction pursuant to a.
ii.standard of review 
our review of a district court grant of a motion for summary judgment of patent infringement or noninfringement is without deference.prima tek ii,polypap.summary judgment is appropriate if the pleadings,depositions,answers to interrogatories,and admissions on file,together with the affidavits,if any,show that there is no genuine issue as to any material fact and that the moving party is entitled to a judgment as a matter of law.c.the evidence of the nonmovant is to be believed,and all justifiable inferences are to be drawn in his favor.anderson liberty lobby,d.
a patent infringement analysis entails two steps.first,determining the meaning and scope of the patent claims asserted to be infringed is a question of law,markman westview instruments,en banc,aff,d,that we review de novo,cybor fas,en banc.second,comparing the properly construed claims to the device accused of infringing is a question of fact,bai l l wings.
we generally apply the law of the pertinent regional circuit when the precise issue to be addressed involves an interpretation of the federal rules of civil procedure.see bose jbl.the eighth circuit reviews the district court imposition of discovery sanctions under.for an abuse of discretion.savola webster,cir.
iii.discussion 
interpretation of the claims 
generally,the words used in a claim are deemed to have their ordinary and customary meaning in their normal usage in the field of the invention.toro white consol.to help inform the court of the ordinary meaning of the words,a court may consult a dictionary,encyclopedia,or treatise.digital,telegenix.nevertheless,the presumption in favor of the ordinary meaning of claim language as understood by one of ordinary skill in the art may be overcome where the patentee chooses to be his or her own lexicographer by clearly setting forth a definition for a claim term in the specification.johnson worldwide,zebco.
similarly,the examination of the written description and drawings is necessary to determine whether the patentee has disclaimed subject matter or has otherwise limited the scope of the claims.apex raritan computer.notwithstanding the fact that the claim language must be examined in light of the written description,limitations may not be read into the claims from the written description.prima tek,at.similarly,the mere fact that the patent drawings depict a particular embodiment of the patent does not operate to limit the claims to that specific configuration,avia group int l.we have recognized that there is sometimes a fine line between reading a claim in light of the specification,and reading a limitation into the claim from the specification.comark communications,harris.
we have also noted that a fter examining the written description and the drawings,the same confirmatory measure must be taken with the prosecution history,since statements made during the prosecution of a patent may affect the scope of the invention.rexnord laitram.during prosecution,an inventor may surrender coverage of material that would otherwise be covered by a claim however,the surrender must be clear and unmistakable.omega eng g,raytek.
in short,to determine the proper scope and meaning of the patent claims asserted,this court primarily consults the intrinsic evidence,that is,the claims,the written description,and,if in evidence,the prosecution history.vitronics conceptronic.
the back surface,protrusion,and mate limitations in the patent family 
with respect to the patent family,anchor argues that the district court erred in its construction of the terms back surface,protrusion,and mate,and that under the correct claim construction there is a genuine issue of material fact as to literal infringement by the classic block so as to preclude the entry of summary judgment on that issue.rockwood responds that the district court,relying on the claim language and the written description in conjunction with the drawings,properly attributed special limited meanings,anchor,at,to the disputed claim terms.
back surface 
the independent claims of the patent family require a masonry block comprising a front surface,a back surface,a top surface,and bottom surface,and first and second sides.see,patent,ll.emphasis added.the district court construed the back surface limitation to require a back surface spanning the full width of the block.anchor,d at.this was error.
the ordinary meaning of the claim term back surface is a surface at the back of the block.see webster third new international dictionary defining back as the side or surface of something that is opposite to the side that is regarded as its front or face id.at defining surface as the exterior or outside of an object or body.the written description does not compel a construction different from the plain meaning of back surface.in departing from the ordinary meaning of back surface,the district court relied on the written description,which stated if the desired structure is to be inwardly curving,blocks of the invention may be completed by striking leg or with a chisel adjacent deflection,see and.anchor,d at citing patent,ll.the district court concluded that t he specification would not address the necessity of chiseling off a portion of that back surface if it did not inhere in the meaning of the term that the back surface spanned the full width.id.contrary to the district court analysis,we do not read this excerpt to conclude that back surface is necessarily limited to a back surface spanning the full width of the block.id.for us to do so here would be to impermissibly read a limitation into the claims from the written description.comark,at w hile claims are to be interpreted in light of the specification and with a view to ascertaining the invention,it does not follow that limitations from the specification may be read into the claims.internal quotation marks and citation omitted.furthermore,the parties point to nothing in the prosecution history that clearly and unmistakably disclaims a back surface that does not extend the full width of the block.accordingly,we hold that the proper construction of back surface is a surface at the back of the block.
protrusion 
the claims of the patent family require a protrusion on one of said top or bottom surfaces of the claimed block.see,patent,ll.emphasis added.the district court construed protrusion to include the limitation of having a central narrow portion.this was error.
the ordinary meaning of the claim term protrusion is something that protrudes.see webster third new international dictionary.the district court relied on the written description,which states that,t he central narrow portion in protrusion figs allows for orientation of the blocks to provide inner curving and outer curving walls by the aligned seating and the relative rotation of the protrusion within,and in relationship to,any block inset or,patent,ll,to conclude that this statement attaches the characteristic of having a central narrow portion to the term protrusion.anchor,d at.contrary to the district court claim construction,the written description does not describe with reasonable clarity,deliberateness,and precision,in re paulsen,that protrusion requires a central narrow portion.indeed,the many uses of the term in the written description are consistent with the ordinary meaning of protrusion,one encompassing protrusions of any number of shapes.see,patent,ll.while the protrusions may take any number of shapes,they preferably have a kidney or dogbone shape.emphases added.the general rule,of course,is that claims of a patent are not limited to a preferred embodiment,unless by their own language.see.panel mac panel,i t is well settled that device claims are not limited to devices which operate precisely as the embodiments described in detail in the patent.there is nothing in this case that warrants departing from the general rule.
moreover,it is axiomatic that a claim construction that excludes a preferred embodiment such as the circular protrusions disclosed in figure is rarely,if ever correct and would require highly persuasive evidentiary support.vitronics,at see,patent.contrary to the district court conclusion,varied use of a disputed term in the written description attests to the breadth of a term rather than providing a limiting definition.see,enercon gmbh int l trade comm n,refusing to limit a term used interchangeably in the written description to only one of the uses of the term.that the term protrusion is used at various points in the written description to refer to protrusions that may take any number of shapes is simply not a special and particular definition created by the patent applicant,renishaw plc marposs societa per azioni,and is thus an insufficient reason to limit the scope of the claim.furthermore,the parties point to nothing in the prosecution history compelling us to deviate from the ordinary meaning of protrusion.accordingly,we hold that the proper construction of protrusion is something that protrudes.
the claims of the patent family require that the protrusion be configured to mate with an inset of one or more adjacently positioned blocks.see,patent,ll.emphasis added.the district court construed mate to require the following three limitations a close confinement of the protrusion within the inset s of one or more blocks an ability to secure the blocks in place in a forwards and backwards direction and an interlocking of the protrusion with the insets.anchor,at.anchor does not dispute the district court third limitation that mate is interchangeable with interlock in the patent specification.however,we hold that the first and second limitations of the district court construction of mate are erroneous.
the ordinary meaning of mate,as the district court found,is to join or fit together.id.at citing new collegiate dictionary.contrary to the district court narrow construction,the written description does not define mate as requiring a close confinement of the protrusion within the inset s of one or more blocks.id.at.in describing one preferred design,the written description only states that the area of the inset should be not must be approximately the same area as,or only slightly larger than,protrusion with which it will mate.patent,ll.the written description makes quite clear that the examples of mating are merely illustrative that is,they do not exhaustively delineate the scope of the term mate whose ordinary meaning is clear from the claims.id.at,ll.the area of the insets adjacent the block to surface is preferably larger than the protrusion by a factor of or more and preferably about to or more.emphases added.moreover,the general rule,of course,is that claims of a patent are not limited to the preferred embodiment,unless by their own language.see.panel,at.that the term mate is used in a nonlimiting way in the written description with respect to preferred degrees of confinement is simply not a special and particular definition created by the patent applicant,renishaw,at,and is thus an insufficient reason to limit the scope of mate to require close confinement.
furthermore,the prosecution history does not attribute a special meaning to the term mate as requiring an ability to secure the blocks in place in a forwards and backwards direction.anchor,d at.during prosecution of the common parent application of the patent family,the applicant distinguished features of its invention over prior art by admitting that the insets extend into side surfaces of the blocks and are for mating with a protrusion from a second,similarly configured block.the applicant also argued during prosecution that the prior art references require some form of additional engagement structure,pins in forsberg,and mortar in italy to secure each of the blocks in place emphasis in original.as these statements show,the patentee did not clearly and unmistakably relinquish any claim to a block in which the mating does not include the district court functional limitation of restricting the movement of the block in a forwards and backwards direction.omega,at f or prosecution disclaimer to attach,our precedent requires that the alleged disavowing actions or statements made during prosecution be both clear and unmistakable.rather,the applicant statements distinguish the prior art primarily in structural terms by emphasizing that the invention of the patent family does not require an additional engagement structure such as pins or mortar to secure the blocks in place.we therefore do not consider the applicant remarks to be a clear and unmistakable disavowal of claim scope as required to depart from the ordinary meaning of the term provided by the specification and therefore hold that the proper construction of mate is to join or fit together.
the generally parallel and substantially horizontal limitations in the patent family 
with respect to the patent family,anchor argues that the district court erred in its construction of the phrase generally parallel by effectively reading out the adverb generally and in its lack of construction of the term substantially horizontal.anchor also argues that the district court erred as a matter of law in concluding that prosecution history estoppel barred anchor claims of infringement of the patent under the doctrine of equivalents.
rockwood defends the district court claim construction of generally parallel on the ground that the district court properly reasoned that modifiers,no matter how strong,can not alter the meaning of a claim term describing a mathematical concept so that the concept would be false if read to describe an accused device.anchor,d at.rockwood also argues that the district court did not err by declining to construe substantially horizontal,because the district court already interpreted the term substantially planar and the interpretation of horizontal with respect to a surface presumes that the surface is planar.
generally parallel 
claims and of the patent as well as claims and of the patent require a bottom face which is generally parallel to the top face.patent,ll.id.at,ll.patent,ll.id.at,ll.emphasis added.because parallelism is a mathematical concept that is either true or false,anchor,d at,the district court interpreted generally parallel to be limited to the ordinary meaning of parallel.id.at.this was error.
while the term generally parallel,as the district court noted,is mathematically imprecise,we note that words of approximation,such as generally and substantially,are descriptive terms commonly used in patent claims to avoid a strict numerical boundary to the specified parameter.ecolab,envirochem,quoting pall micron separations,see,andrew corp gabriel elecs,noting that terms such as approach each other,close to,substantially equal,and closely approximate are ubiquitously used in patent claims and that such usages,when serving reasonably to describe the claimed subject matter to those of skill in the field of the invention and to distinguish the claimed subject matter from the prior art,have been accepted in patent examination and upheld by the courts.and,while ideally,all terms in a disputed claim would be definitively bounded and clear,such is rarely the case in the art of claim drafting.in this case,exact parallelism is sufficient,but not necessary,to meet the limitation of the claim term generally parallel.
it is undisputed in this case that ordinarily,parallel means everywhere equal distant.anchor,d at citing collegiate dictionary ed.additionally,the relevant definition of generally is in disregard of specific instances and with regard to an overall picture on the whole,as a rule.webster third new international dictionary.because the claim language itself expressly ties the adverb generally to the adjective parallel,the ordinary meaning of the phrase generally parallel envisions some amount of deviation from exactly parallel.it is the claim limitation,as a whole,that must be considered in claim construction.apex,at.
the written description does not specify any special definition for the terms generally,parallel,or the phrase generally parallel.see,patent,ll.the top surface generally lies parallel to the bottom surface.patent,ll.same.moreover,nothing in the prosecution history of the patent family clearly limits the scope of generally parallel such that the adverb generally does not broaden the meaning of parallel.accordingly,we hold that the phrase generally parallel envisions some amount of deviation from exactly parallel.
substantially horizontal 
anchor also argues that,by not interpreting the only disputed term,substantially horizontal,in claim of the patent,the district court erred as a matter of law.we agree.in order to review the court finding of noninfringement,we must know what meaning and scope the district court gave to the asserted claims.graco binks.from the district court opinion,there is no basis for concluding that the district court performed either of the two steps required for a proper infringement analysis with respect to the substantially horizontal limitation before it granted partial summary judgment of noninfringement.as in graco,a case on all fours with the situation here,the entire omission of a claim interpretation analysis from the opinion,and the conclusory factual findings on infringement,each provide an independent basis for remand.id.the district court therefore erred in two respects which preclude a proper grant of partial summary judgment of noninfringement.
application of the claims to the accused products 
literal infringement 
the district court concluded that there is no literal infringement of the patent family based on its construction of the claim terms.anchor,d at.first,the district court determined that the classic block does not mate as defined by the patents at issue because t he extension does not mate with the sidewalls by any definition and the protrusion and sidewall of defendants blocks do not cooperate to restrain the block setback in both a forward and backward direction.id.at.the district court also determined that the classic block does not have a back surface matching the construed definition,id.at,because the classic block has a partial back side portion with pointed side extensions that do not abut each other when placed adjacently in a course of blocks,id at.finally,the district court determined that the classic block lacks the characteristic of a protrusion having a central narrow portion,id.at,because t he protrusion on the classic block is a square extension extending from the bottom surface of the block.the district court also concluded that cottage stones ii,iii,and iv did not literally infringe the patent family,because a bottom face with a concave portion is not parallel to a top face that is perfectly planar.id.at.
as discussed above,part,supra,the district court findings with respect to no literal infringement of the and patent families are premised on erroneous or omitted constructions of the claim limitations back surface,protrusion,mate,generally parallel,and substantially horizontal.we can not determine with certainty,based on the factual record before us,whether there are any genuine issues of material fact regarding infringement by the accused products in light of our revised claim construction.accordingly,we remand the portion of the district court judgment of noninfringement pertaining to the and patent families for further proceedings consistent with this opinion.
infringement under the doctrine of equivalents 
additionally,with respect to infringement of claims and of the patent under the doctrine of equivalents,the district court held that this court en banc holding in festo,which was under consideration by the supreme court at the time the district court decision was rendered,required an absolute bar to the application of the doctrine of equivalents in this case,because the applicant made a narrowing amendment to claims and of the patent during prosecution.because the supreme court rejected the absolute bar approach to prosecution history estoppel,festo,d,that analysis is now incorrect,and we vacate that portion of the district court judgment.we agree with anchor that the case should be remanded to the district court to determine,in the first instance,whether anchor can rebut the festo presumption.see schwing gmbh putzmeister aktiengesellschaft,remanding rebuttal of presumptive bar to district court for determination in first instance.accordingly,we vacate the portion of the district court judgment of noninfringement of the asserted claims of the patent under the doctrine of equivalents and remand for further proceedings consistent with this opinion.
finally,with respect to claim of the patent,the parties dispute whether the district court properly granted partial summary judgment on the issue of noninfringement by equivalents.anchor contends that the district court only established that cottage stone iii and iv do not literally infringe claim of the patent,but that genuine issues of material fact remain with respect to infringement of this claim by equivalents.rockwood,in contrast,responds that anchor failed to show a fact issue remains for infringement of claim of the patent under the doctrine of eq
