this original proceeding presents the issue of whether the purchasers of a manufactured home must arbitrate their claims against both the retailer and manufacturer of the home pursuant to a written arbitration agreement between the purchasers and the retailer.the agreement specified that it inured to the benefit of the manufacturer and gave the manufacturer a period during which it could opt out of arbitration.we conclude that the manufacturer right did not render the arbitration agreement unenforceable and that the purchasers must arbitrate their claims against both parties.
background 
raymond and crystal ripple contracted with palm harbor village the retailer to purchase a manufactured home which was to be,and subsequently was,manufactured by palm harbor homes.during the process of contracting for and purchasing the home,the ripples and the retailer entered into several separate agreements.two of the agreements were arbitration agreements.the first was dated october,and the second was dated december.the ripples urge that the second agreement is applicable to the issues in this appeal.relators do not contend otherwise.we will assume,without deciding,that the second agreement governs the issues presented and reference it as the agreement.
the agreement provided that all disputes between the ripples and the retailer arising out of or relating in any way to the sale,purchase,or occupancy of the home would be resolved through binding arbitration.the agreement is one page long is labeled arbitration agreement at the top of the page in large capital letters sets out in the first paragraph that it inures to the benefit of the manufacturer as well as binds the purchasers and retailer and provides that it does not constitute a waiver of any substantive rights or remedies available under applicable law,but is an election to resolve claims,disputes and controversies by arbitration rather than the judicial process.the sentence provides,in all capital letters,that the parties knowingly waive any right to a jury trial.the agreement also provides that the manufacturer in its sole discretion,may opt out of,and elect not to be bound by,the arbitration by giving written notice of the election to all parties within twenty days after receipt of notice that another party intended to arbitrate a dispute.
after the manufactured home was purchased by the ripples,they began experiencing problems with it and lodged a series of complaints.they eventually sued both the retailer and the manufacturer,alleging breach of contract,breach of warranty,and statutory liability under the residential construction liability act.
the retailer and manufacturer moved to compel arbitration under the federal arbitration act faa.see.the trial court denied the motion as to both.a divided court of appeals denied mandamus relief.
both the retailer and manufacturer seek a writ of mandamus directing the trial court to order the ripples to arbitrate.the ripples do not dispute applicability of the faa,but oppose arbitrating any claims because relators have not carried their burden to establish a valid agreement to arbitrate the signed arbitration agreement lacks consideration the agreement is substantively and procedurally unconscionable and the manufacturer was not a signatory to the agreement and has not shown itself to be a beneficiary entitled to enforce the agreement.
ii.agreement to arbitrate 
the ripples contend that the retailer and manufacturer have not met their burden to establish an agreement to arbitrate because they have not presented complete records of the three hearings held by the trial court en route to its final order denying arbitration.they assert that absent such records,the trial court ruling can not be determined to have been an abuse of discretion.they do not contend,however,that any evidence contesting validity of the agreement was introduced at any of the three hearings.
relators original answer to the ripples suit included a plea in abatement seeking dismissal or abatement of the suit based on the arbitration agreement.the arbitration agreement,along with other documents signed by the ripples,was attached to the pleading.the ripples do not claim to have at any point disputed that they signed the arbitration agreement as part of the process by which they purchased their manufactured home.their position as to the arbitration agreement is encapsulated by their response to relators second motion for reconsideration of the motion to compel arbitration and their affidavits attached to that response in the course of contracting for the purchase of the home they signed several documents,including two documents purporting to be arbitration agreements the documents were not explained to them they were told that the documents were necessary to complete the purchase they were unaware that they had signed arbitration agreements they never were in contact with the manufacturer during the purchase process the manufacturer did not sign the arbitration agreements and they were unaware of what arbitration entailed and did not voluntarily waive their right to a jury trial.
the ripples have not asserted that there was fraud,deceit,or misrepresentation involved in their signing of the agreement.accordingly,they are bound by the agreement.see in re mckinney,per curiam holding that absent fraud,misrepresentation,or deceit,parties are bound by the terms of the contract signed,regardless of whether they read it.
given the ripples concession at oral argument that records of the hearings in the trial court would not show that evidence was introduced,and their consistent position taken before the trial court as reflected by the record which is before us,the failure of relators to present transcripts of the hearings does not create a presumption that matters occurring during the hearings would support an implied finding that an arbitration agreement did not exist.see michiana easy livin country,holten,rejecting a claim that we must presume evidence that supported the trial court order was presented at a pretrial hearing when there was no indication evidence was presented at that hearing.because the relators presented a signed arbitration agreement to the court along with other documents the ripples signed,and the ripples have presented no evidence that they did not sign the agreement,we conclude that,as a matter of law,the existence of an arbitration agreement among the parties was established.
iii.consideration 
next,the ripples claim the arbitration provision lacks consideration.in determining validity of agreements to arbitrate which are subject to the faa,we generally apply principles governing the formation of contracts.see first options of chicago,kaplan,d.arbitration agreements,like other contracts,must be supported by consideration.see in re advancepcs health,per curiam in re halliburton.such consideration may take the form of bilateral promises to arbitrate.see in re advancepcs,at.further,when an arbitration clause is part of a larger,underlying contract,the remainder of the contract may suffice as consideration for the arbitration clause.see also in re firstmerit bank.
a.the retailer 
the arbitration agreement was part of a larger contractual relationship between the ripples and the retailer.the underlying contract between the ripples and the retailer constituted valid consideration for the arbitration agreement as between them,as did their mutual promises to arbitrate disputes involving the manufactured home or its sale.see in re advancepcs,at holding there was a valid arbitration agreement,as the underlying contract provided adequate consideration.the agreement provision extending to the manufacturer a right to opt out of arbitration,even if it were illusory because it did not bind the manufacturer to arbitrate,did not make either the consideration of the underlying contract or the promises to arbitrate any disagreements between themselves illusory as between the retailer and the ripples.light centel cellular,noting that a promise is illusory if it fails to bind the promisor.
b.the manufacturer 
a beneficiary may enforce a contract to which it is not a party if the parties t
