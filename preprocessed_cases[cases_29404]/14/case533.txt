here we conclude that a newly incorporated city had discretion to disapprove a final subdivision map when the vesting tentative subdivision map had been approved by the county.we also conclude that actions taken by the city did not divest it of this discretion or subject it to estoppel.
facts and procedural background 
the city of goleta goleta or city was created from unincorporated territory within the county of santa barbara county.after the incorporation process began,oly chadmar sandpiper general partnership sandpiper submitted a vesting tentative subdivision map to the county for a multiunit residential project within goleta proposed boundaries.the county approved the vesting tentative map after goleta incorporation was approved by the electorate on november.the sequence of these events is significant because it bears on whether sandpiper qualified for the safe harbor provision of government code section,subdivision f see post,d at,at.
when the incorporation became effective on february,the newly empowered city council of goleta adopted the county ordinances.a newly created city is required to adopt an ordinance providing that all county ordinances previously applicable shall remain in full force and effect as city ordinances for a period of days after incorporation,or until the city council has enacted ordinances superseding the county ordinances,whichever occurs first,subd.a.
the manner in which the city council undertook its action is central to this litigation.the resolution adopting the county ordinances replaced references to the county and its board of supervisors with references to the city and its city council.goleta ord.the parties disagree as to whether,in taking this action,the city bound itself to approve sandpiper final map.the gist of sandpiper argument is that,while goleta would otherwise have had discretion under section to reject sandpiper final map application,it divested itself of that discretion by adopting the county ordinances in a way that placed the council in the shoes of the board of supervisors.thus,sandpiper argues,the city was bound to give its ministerial approval,just as the county would have been.
the following facts bear on the estoppel claim.on november,three weeks after the incorporation election,goleta wrote to the county board of supervisors expressing the concerns about the sandpiper project.on january,the board of supervisors approved the vesting tentative map.on march,a city consultant notified a county planning staff member that the city council wished to be consulted before the county made any other decisions affecting the project.on june,the interim city attorney informed the same county staff member that the city concerns were both jurisdictional and substantive.the city states,and sandpiper does not deny,that sandpiper was informed of these communications.
on may,the county approved a coastal development permit for the project.three weeks later the city challenged that approval before the california coastal commission.in its letter of appeal,the city stated it had discretion under section to deny sandpiper final map 
at several regularly scheduled meetings between august and november,the city council reviewed sandpiper plan and identified a significant number of concerns.
on november,the city surveyor wrote the city engineer that sandpiper final map was technically correct.the city does not dispute that the final map was in substantial compliance with the vesting tentative map.however,on january,the city council denied approval of sandpiper final map,concluding that the project design and improvements would be inconsistent in specified respects with the general plan being prepared by the city 
the trial court granted sandpiper writ petition and ordered the city to approve the final map.the court of appeal reversed the order by writ of mandate.

ii.discussion 
the subdivision map act act gives local agencies authority to regulate subdivision development within their boundaries.the agencies exercise their authority by reviewing maps of a proposed subdivision.a tentative map must,among other things,be consistent with either the general local plan or an existing specific plan.generally,a final map must be approved if it substantially complies with a previously approved tentative map and meets the requirements applicable to the subdivision when the tentative map was approved.
the subdivision map act act permits a subdivider to file a vesting tentative map whenever the act requires a tentative map.this procedure is intended to provide greater statutory protection to subdividers than was afforded under the common law vested rights doctrine.citations.bright development city of tracy th,d.this case does not turn on the fact that sandpiper filed a vesting tentative map.
before enactment of section stats,ch,it was unclear whether a newly incorporated city had discretion to disapprove a final map when the tentative map had been approved by the county.the attorney general found no case law squarely on point,but concluded a city did not have such discretion.approval of tentative subdivision map.the legislative counsel reached the same conclusion.ops.cal.legis.counsel,july,vesting tentative maps incorporation or annexation.
by enacting subdivision a of section the legislature specifically provided that a newly incorporated city must approve a final map where the tentative map has been approved by the county and the final map meets all of the conditions of the tentative map and the requirements of the act 
however,subdivision a of section is qualified by subdivision f of the same section.under subdivision f,the new city is only compelled to approve a final map if two temporal conditions are met the application for the tentative map or vesting tentative map was submitted before the first signature was placed on the incorporation petition and the county approved the tentative map before the incorporation election 
the original legislation had no time constraints.bill reg.sess.as introduced.however,the legislature came to recognize that the prospect of an incorporation often resulted in a run on development rights.to prevent such runs,the bill was amended to incorporate the temporal conditions set out in section,subdivision f.see,com.on local,reading analysis of bill reg.sess.as amended.
the trial court correctly found that the vesting tentative map here did not satisfy either of section,subdivision f temporal conditions.therefore,as sandpiper concedes,the mandatory approval obligation of subdivision a does not apply.
the court of appeal agreed with the city that,under these circumstances,the plain language of section gives the city discretion to deny sandpiper final map.sandpiper does not dispute that conclusion however,it contends that goleta was,nevertheless,required to approve its final map.it argues the city surrendered its statutory discretion by adopting a county ordinance that provided for ministerial approval of a final map that conforms with an approved tentative map.
b.the effect of goleta ordinances 
as noted ante,d at,at,in compliance with section,subdivision a,the goleta city council adopted the county subdivision ordinances.the resolution adopting the county ordinances substituted references to the city and its city council for references to the county and its board of supervisors.goleta ord.the parties disagree on the substitutions legal effect.
sandpiper contends goleta was obliged by section of its adopted ordinances to give ministerial approval to the final map.goleta municipal code section read in pertinent part when the city surveyor is satisfied that the map is technically correct,conforms to the approved tentative map or any approved alterations thereof and complies with all applicable laws and regulations,the city surveyor will notify in writing the licensed land surveyor who prepared the map and request delivery of the original tracing of the final or parcel map in the case of a final map the city surveyor will transmit the same to the clerk of the city council for filing and approval.the city council shall approve the map at its next regular meeting if it conforms with all the requirements of applicable laws and regulations made thereunder.emphasis added.
goleta responds that when section of its municipal code is read in light of section,it is clear that the city was obligated to grant ministerial approval to final maps only when it,not the county,had given initial approval to the tentative map.section,subdivision b identifies the city council as the decision maker for all tentative maps submitted to the city for land use projects within the city jurisdiction section,subdivision m provides that the decision maker,the city council,shall approve,conditionally approve,or disapprove all tentative and final maps 
sandpiper labels goleta position nonsensical.it states its argument as follows.the city theory would require a finding that after february,when the city adopted all of the county ordinances and inserted the name change,there no longer was a vesting tentative map as defined in the city subdivision map act ordinances.the city own actions belie its reasoning.the city resolution concerning the project states,the city surveyor notified the city engineer of the city of goleta by letter dated november,that the proposed final map for the sandpiper project was technically correct,consistent with the requirements of the subdivision map act,and ready for filing with the city council.if the vesting tentative map had never been approved by an authorized entity,then the final map arising from it was not consistent with the subdivision map act and not ready for filing with the city.
sandpiper characterization of the city position is overbroad.sections and can be reconciled as stating the city intention to retain discretion over final maps when the county approved the tentative maps,but to defer to the general rule of ministerial approval for final maps when the city,itself,has approved the tentative maps.
we conclude the city had discretion under section to disapprove the final map because it had not approved the tentative map.
sandpiper contends in the alternative that the city was estopped from disapproving the final map.
the doctrine of equitable estoppel is founded on concepts of equity and fair dealing.it provides that a person may not deny the existence of a state of facts if he intentionally led another to believe a particular circumstance to be true and to rely upon such belief to his detriment.the elements of the doctrine are that the party to be estopped must be apprised of the facts he must intend that his conduct shall be acted upon,or must so act that the party asserting the estoppel has a right to believe it was so intended the other party must be ignorant of the true state of facts and he must rely upon the conduct to his injury.city of long beach mansell cal d.strong county of santa cruz cal d,see hughes board of architectural examiners cal th,d,hughes.
equitable estoppel will not apply against a governmental body except in unusual instances when necessary to avoid grave injustice and when the result will not defeat a strong public policy.bib le committee of bar examiners cal d,hock investment city and county of san francisco d.hughes,supra,cal th at,d.
sandpiper has not established the elements of estoppel against a private party,much less against a governmental body.as the court of appeal observed,there is no evidence in the record that any official,employee or agent of the city made any express representation that the city would approve the map.to the contrary,the undisputed evidence shows that city officials publicly voiced their concerns about the project both before and after the incorporation became effective.
city authorities began voicing concerns about the project from virtually the moment of the city creation.the informed the county board of supervisors of its reservations in november of.after the county approved the vesting tentative map,city representatives continued to voice concerns in march and june of.the city appealed the county grant of a coastal development permit,and during the appellate process,asserted the city discretion to withhold final map approval the city council continued to identify problems with sandpiper plan at its meetings in august through november of.in light of this history,the city decision to disapprove the final map should not have come as a surprise to sandpiper.
sandpiper contends that goleta adoption of the county subdivision ordinances created a reasonable expectation on sandpiper part that its final map would receive ministerial approval.we conclude above that the city action did not entail this result.ante,d at,at.therefore,this lynchpin of sandpiper estoppel argument fails.
sandpiper also claims it relied on the fact that goleta exempted its project when it extended a moratorium on development.on february,goleta adopted an ordinance placing a moratorium on approval of development proposals.on march,the city extended the moratorium for the months and days permitted under section,subdivision a.as a multifamily housing project,the sandpiper proposal was exempted from the moratorium extension by operation of law.the city did not make the finding required by section,subdivision c that continued approval of the project would have a specific,adverse impact upon the public health or safety.exempting the project from the extended moratorium in this fashion could not reasonably be understood to imply that it would eventually receive approval.
finally,sandpiper claims it relied on the fact that the city worked extensively with sandpiper to clear the conditions from the vesting tentative map at considerable expense to sandpiper.however,as the court of appeal held,estoppel may not be based on expenditures made before a building permit or its functional equivalent has issued.shea homes limited partnership county of alameda th,d.
iii.disposition 
we affirm the judgment of the court of appeal 
i dissent for the reasons given below.
the majority opinion has three holdings first,it concludes that under government code section the developer here was not entitled to approval of its final subdivision map because its application for a vesting tentative subdivision map was not made within the statutory time constraints.the developer,however,conceded this point in its opening brief to this court,as it did below.accordingly,the majority holding pertaining to section is irrelevant to a resolution of this case.
second,the majority holds that the city in question is not equitably estopped by its in and encouragement of the developer efforts to clear conditions imposed on the tentative withholding final subdivision map approval.because of my conclusion that the city was required under section to approve the developer final map,i need not reach the estoppel issue.
third,the majority concludes that the city,after its incorporation and notwithstanding its adoption and readoption of the county land use regulations,retained discretion to withhold ministerial approval of the developer final subdivision map.i disagree.in my view,the city lacked such discretion.
the property in dispute consists of acres within the coastal zone of the county of santa barbara county.in,the county adopted the goleta community plan,which designated the parcel as lying within an affordable housing zone.two years later,the county approved development of the site with residential units,half of them affordable housing.the county prepared and certified a final environmental impact report for the proposed development.the proposed development,however,was never built.
in june,oly chadmar sandpiper general partnership sandpiper bought the parcel.on july,a petition to incorporate goleta as a city received its first signature.
