the city of lodi issued a notice of preparation of a draft environmental impact report deir on the project in april and filed a notice of completion of the deir in august.the city invited and received written comment on the deir and set a public meeting for september,before the planning commission to receive oral comments on the deir.ann cerney,a spokesperson for citizens,attended the public hearing before the planning commission and raised a number of issues regarding the deir.cerney also timely sent a letter asserting five areas of inadequacy of the deir.a law firm representing a second group of lodi residents,later referred to as lodi first,also sent in extensive written comments on the deir.the issues raised by citizens and lodi first were not identical,although there were areas of overlap.responses to both cerney written and oral comments and lodi first comments were included in the feir completed by the city in november.
on december,the planning commission held a public hearing on the feir and the resolution to approve browman application for use permit and tentative parcel map.cerney appeared on behalf of citizens and objected to the certification of the feir on the basis that it failed to comply with the requirements of ceqa.a representative of lodi first also appeared in opposition to the project.the planning commission certified the feir and approved the resolution approving browman application for a use permit and tentative parcel map.
the chairman of the planning commission reminded the people present at the hearing that there was an applicable appeal process if they disagreed with the decision of the commission.specifically,persons who participated in the review process by submitting written or oral testimony or by attending the public hearing could appeal.the appeal must be filed within five days with the city clerk.there was an appeal fee of.notice of this appeal right also had been included on the agenda for the hearing.
the notice and comments regarding an appeal from the planning commission decision were consistent with the project review process required by ceqa,subd.c,tit,subd.b guidelines,as outlined in the deir.the deir,which was incorporated in the feir,included then current lodi municipal code section city code section regarding the appeal process of any action regarding use permits the deir provided that once the feir was certified by the planning commission,the planning commission could consider the project for approval.the deir stated since the project will not require a general plan amendment or rezoning which would require city council approval,the project will require approval only by the planning commission,unless the approval is appealed to the city council.if appealed,the city council will be the final body on the eir certification and the project approval.italics added.with respect to use permits,city code section,as it read in,provided,in pertinent part any applicant or person claiming to be directly and adversely affected by any action of the planning commission on matters referred to in this chapter may,within five days after the action,file a written appeal with the city clerk for transmittal to the city council.
two days after the planning commission action,lodi first filed a letter of appeal requesting de novo review by the city council of the planning commission decisions.the letter stated the appeal generally was filed on the basis that the project conflicts with the lodi zoning code,is inconsistent with the lodi general plan,and does not satisfy the minimum requirements of ceqa.also filed an appeal challenging two of the conditions on the project adopted by the planning commission.citizens did not file a separate appeal.
the city set a public hearing before the city council for january,to consider the appeals of the planning commission decisions.notice was provided to the public of the hearing.such notice invited all interested persons to present their views and comments on this matter.written statements may be filed with the city clerk at any time prior to the hearing scheduled herein,and oral statements may be made at said hearing.the notice also advised if you challenge the subject matter in court,you may be limited to raising only those issues you or someone else raised at the public hearing described in this notice or in written correspondence delivered to the city clerk,at or prior to the public hearing.
at the january hearing,a representative of lodi first presented a range of comments on the feir.before other comments were received,however,the mayor of lodi recused himself and declared that a new public hearing would have to be set and held.
the city set a new hearing for february.the notice included the same invitation for all interested persons to present their views and the same advice regarding any subsequent challenge in court.
on february,citizens faxed a letter of written comments to the city regarding alleged inadequacies of the feir and in support of the lodi first appeal.
citizens appeared at the february public hearing of the city council through its attorney.counsel made comments in support of the appeal filed by lodi first,but also stated citizens objected to the project and to the approval of the feir.citizens focused its comments on the issues of mitigation of the loss of prime farmland and an alleged failure of the feir to analyze a reasonable range of alternatives to the proposed project because of a project definition too narrowly drawn.such issues differed from the issues discussed by lodi first in its comments to the city council 
after the close of the public discussion,the city attorney advised the city council that if the members decided they were in favor of the project,their vote should not just affirm the findings of the planning commission.rather,the city council should affirmatively make findings certifying the feir and approving the project because it had a duty to affirmatively make such decisions as the city council.the city council passed a resolution to certify the feir.the city council turned its attention to the appeal of the conditions on the use permit filed by,eventually continuing the public hearing to february.citizens appeared and participated at the continued hearing on february at the close of which the city council approved browman application for use permit and tentative parcel map.
the city filed a notice of determination of its approval of the lodi shopping center project on february.lodi first and citizens then filed separate lawsuits alleging the city actions violated ceqa.
the city moved to dismiss citizens petition for writ of mandate on the basis of a failure to exhaust administrative remedies,citizens failure to file its own appeal from the planning commission to the city council.the trial court granted the city motion and entered a judgment of dismissal.
discussion 
petition is not moot 
as a preliminary issue,the city claims citizens petition for writ of mandate is moot and this appeal should,therefore,be dismissed.the city claims a trial court ruling in this case could no longer have any practical impact or provide effectual relief because the trial court has already set aside the project approvals as a result of a partial grant of lodi first petition for writ of mandate downtown palo alto com.for fair assessment city council d.we disagree.
the trial court granted lodi first petition for writ of mandate only on the issues of inadequate analysis of urban decay and impacts and failure to analyze potential energy impacts.the trial court denied the petition on issues of air quality impacts analysis,loss of agricultural land and land use conflicts and inconsistency with general plan and zoning.while the trial court has directed the city to vacate approval of the resolutions certifying the feir and the application for a use permit and tentative parcel map,its judgment and order require the city to refrain from further approvals until full compliance with ceqa and state law is demonstrated in accordance with the trial court order.thus,the trial court granted lodi first petition only in part.there is no evidence before this court that the city and browman have abandoned the lodi shopping center project or that the city does not intend to comply with the trial court judgment in accordance with the order,addressing the two deficiencies identified by the court.the trial court has continued jurisdiction over the city proceedings in this matter by way of a return to the peremptory writ,subd.b.
citizens petition for writ of mandate raises issues regarding the feir project description,inclusion of legally adequate alternatives,failure to adopt reasonable mitigation measures for loss of prime farmland,sufficiency of the evidence to support claimed economic benefits and beneficial infrastructure improvement,and the city alleged use of compliance with land use plans to offset environmental harms.these claims appear to include at least some additional issues to the matters considered in the lodi first proceeding.if the trial court finds an additional issue or issues meritorious it can direct the city to address the additional deficiency or deficiencies in the feir in the city proceedings undertaken in response to the court order arising from lodi first petition.effective relief would be possible in this case.therefore,this appeal is not moot.
citizens has exhausted its administrative remedies 
the trial court concluded citizens had failed to exhaust its administrative remedies because it did not appeal the final decision of the planning commission to the city council pursuant to the requirements of the city municipal code.the trial court found the mere fact other parties appealed the planning commission decision did not exhaust citizens administrative remedies.
we apply a de novo standard of review to the legal question of whether the doctrine of exhaustion of administrative remedies applies in a given case.evans city of san jose th,d anthony snyder th,d.applying such standard,we conclude the trial court conclusion was in error.
the exhaustion of administrative remedies doctrine bars the pursuit of a judicial remedy by a person to whom administrative action was available for the purpose of enforcing the right he seeks to assert in court,but who has failed to commence such action and is attempting to obtain judicial redress where no administrative proceeding has occurred at all it also operates as a defense to litigation commenced by persons who have been aggrieved by action taken in an administrative proceeding which has in fact occurred but who have failed to exhaust the remedy available to them in the course of the proceeding itself.california aviation council county of amador d.california aviation.as our supreme court has stated it in brief,the rule is that where an administrative remedy is provided by statute,relief must be sought from the administrative body and this remedy exhausted before the courts will act.abelleira dist.court of appeal cal d.the rule is a jurisdictional prerequisite in the sense that it is not a matter of judicial discretion,but is a fundamental rule of procedure laid down by courts of last resort,followed under the doctrine of stare decisis,and binding upon all courts.id.at,see azusa land reclamation main san gabriel basin watermaster th,d.
there are several rationales for the exhaustion of administrative remedies doctrine.the primary purpose of the doctrine is to afford administrative tribunals the opportunity to decide in a final way matters within their area of expertise prior to judicial review.san bernardino valley audubon society,county of san bernardino d.the essence of the exhaustion doctrine is the public agency opportunity to receive and respond to articulated factual issues and legal theories before its actions are subjected to judicial review.coalition for student action city of fullerton d.park area neighbors town of fairfax th,d.the doctrine prevents courts from interfering with the subject matter of another tribunal.california aviation,supra,d at.
another basic purpose of the doctrine is to lighten the burden of overworked courts in cases where administrative remedies are available and are as likely as the judicial remedy to provide the wanted relief.citation.even where the administrative remedy may not resolve all issues or provide the precise relief requested by a plaintiff,the exhaustion doctrine is still viewed with favor because it facilitates the development of a complete record that draws on administrative expertise and promotes judicial efficiency.citation.it can serve as a preliminary administrative sifting process citation,unearthing the relevant evidence and providing a record which the court may review.citation.sierra club san joaquin local agency formation com.cal th,d,quoting yamaha motor superior court d.
section codifies the doctrine of exhaustion of administrative remedies for ceqa.stats,ch,tahoe vista concerned citizens county of placer th,d tahoe vista.section provides,in relevant part,as follows a no action or proceeding may be brought pursuant to section unless the alleged grounds for noncompliance with this division were presented to the public agency orally or in writing by any person during the public comment period provided by this division or prior to the close of the public hearing on the project before the issuance of the notice of determination.that is,the issues raised before a court must first have been raised during the administrative process,although not necessarily by the person who subsequently seeks judicial review.galante vineyards monterey peninsula water management dist.th,d galante vineyards.subdivision b of section then provides no person shall maintain an action or proceeding unless that person objected to the approval of the project orally or in writing during the public comment period provided by this division or prior to the close of the public hearing on the project before the issuance of the notice of determination.that is,the availability of judicial review is restricted to parties who have objected to the agency approval of the project.galante vineyards,supra,at,d.in other words,a petitioner need not have articulated every basis for objecting to the project,but must have participated in the administrative process.ibid.
there is no dispute citizens appeared,participated,and objected to the city environmental review under ceqa of the lodi shopping center through its spokesperson or counsel at each and every hearing held by the planning commission and the city council on the project citizens claims no more is required.the city contends citizens was still required to file its own appeal pursuant to city code section.
consideration of whether exhaustion of administrative remedies has occurred depends upon the procedures applicab
