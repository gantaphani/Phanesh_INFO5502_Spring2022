plaintiffs,raintree homes,and raintree builders,filed a amended complaint against defendant,the village of long grove the village,seeking a declaratory judgment as to the validity of a village ordinance requiring the payment of impact fees to the village to obtain building permits and a refund of those fees paid by plaintiffs.the circuit court of lake county dismissed the complaint with prejudice.the appellate court reversed and remanded,holding that the statute of limitations contained in section of the local governmental and governmental employees tort immunity act the tort immunity act or act ilcs west did not apply to the present cause of action.d.the village argues for reversal of the appellate court because the statute of limitation of the act ilcs west bars all but one of plaintiffs claims,plaintiffs lack standing to assert the sole claim that is not,and the appellate court erred in remanding the matter to a different trial judge.for the following reasons,we affirm in part and reverse in part.
background 
plaintiffs filed their initial complaint on march,and their amended complaint on july.the amended complaint alleged that plaintiffs entered into several contracts to build homes in the village from february to august.as a condition of these contracts,plaintiffs were required to apply for and obtain building permits from the village and were required to pay all impact fees for the issuance of the building permits.from june,through february,section b of the village code required the payment of impact fees,setting forth that as a condition of the issuance of a building permit for the construction of a dwelling unit,the building permit applicant shall be required to donate monies to the village.long grove municipal code b amended june.the impact fees,which totaled for each building permit,were for the benefit of the school district and for the acquisition,maintenance,preservation,and operation of open space in the village.long grove municipal code b amended june.between june,and february,plaintiffs paid the required impact fees to obtain building permits for lots.on february,plaintiffs applied for and obtained a twelfth permit for an additional lot,designated lot.
the amended complaint sought a declaration that the required impact fees exceeded the village statutory and constitutional authority and a refund of all monies plaintiffs paid to the village as impact fees.the village filed a motion to dismiss pursuant to section a of the code of civil procedure code ilcs a west,asserting that plaintiffs claims were barred by the statute of limitations contained in section of the tort immunity act ilcs west with respect to lot,the village alleged that plaintiffs had no standing to assert a claim for that lot because the lot owner,not plaintiffs,paid the impact fees.
the trial court dismissed plaintiffs amended complaint with prejudice.the appellate court reversed the dismissal of the complaint,holding that the act applied only to actions sounding in tort,and remanded the matter to a different judge.d at.the appellate court did not address the village argument regarding standing.see d at.we allowed the village petition for leave to appeal a,and also allowed the village of kildeer,the city of chicago and the illinois municipal league to file amicus curiae briefs in support of the village.
the village first requests this court to reverse the appellate court and uphold the dismissal of plaintiffs complaint under section a of the code.under section a,a defendant is entitled to a dismissal if the action was not commenced within the time limited by law.ilcs a west.an appeal from a section dismissal is similar to an appeal following a grant of summary judgment,and both are subject to de novo review.carroll paddock,kedzie currency exchange,hodge.in both cases,the reviewing court must determine whether the existence of a genuine issue of material fact should have precluded the dismissal or,absent such an issue of fact,whether the dismissal is proper as a matter of law.carroll,at,kedzie currency exchange,at.
the village argues that section of the tort immunity act unambiguously provides that any civil action filed against a municipality,other than those actions specifically excluded by section of the act ilcs west,must be filed within one year from the date the cause of action accrues.as a civil action for damages,the village asserts,plaintiffs cause of action is barred by the act.section provides as follows 
no civil action may be commenced in any court against a local entity or any of its employees for any injury unless it is commenced within one year from the date that the injury was received or the cause of action accrued.for purposes of this article,the term civil action includes any action,whether based upon the common law or statutes or constitution of this state.ilcs west.
the enumerated exceptions to which the village refers are listed in section,which provides 
nothing in this act affects the right to obtain relief other than damages against a local public entity or public employee.nothing in this act affects the liability,if any,of a local public entity or public employee,based on 
a.contract 
b.operation as a common carrier and this act does not apply to any entity organized under or subject to the metropolitan transit authority act,approved april,as amended 
c.the worker compensation act,approved july,as heretofore or hereafter amended 
d.the workers occupational diseases act,approved july,as heretofore or hereafter amended 
e.section of the illinois municipal code,approved may,as heretofore or hereafter amended 
f.the illinois uniform conviction information act,enacted by the general assembly,as heretofore or hereafter amended.ilcs west.
if the act were interpreted to apply only to torts,the village argues,it would render section meaningless,as there would be no need for that section to carve out exceptions to the act for liability based on nontort actions such as contract actions.
plaintiffs respond that the village argument mischaracterizes the relief they seek.plaintiffs maintain that they request a declaration that the village does not have the statutory authority to require plaintiffs to pay the impact fees,and they also seek a refund of those fees.the amended complaint does not seek damages,and,as such,plaintiffs argue,their cause of action is excluded by the plain meaning of the act.we agree with plaintiffs that section of the tort immunity act does not bar plaintiffs cause of action.
in construing section of the tort immunity act,our primary objective is to ascertain and give effect to the intention of the legislature.michigan avenue national bank county of cook.when the language of a statute is clear and unambiguous,a court must give effect to the plain and ordinary meaning of the language without resort to other tools of statutory construction.michigan avenue national bank,at.one of the fundamental principles of statutory construction is to view all provisions of an enactment as a whole.words and phrases should not be construed in isolation,but must be interpreted in light of other relevant provisions of the statute.michigan avenue national bank,at.we must construe the statute so that each word,clause or sentence is given reasonable meaning and not deemed superfluous or void.people glisson.
plaintiffs claim is an action which seeks relief other than damages,as set forth in the first sentence of section,and is,therefore,excluded from the act.ilcs west see also in re consolidated objections to tax levies of school district,stating that the act includes actions seeking damages remedies while excluding actions seeking injunctive remedies.plaintiffs request nothing more than a declaration that the ordinance is unlawful and a return of the impact fees collected pursuant to the ordinance.we therefore reject the village mislabeling of plaintiffs relief as compensation for a wrong done,or damages due from a duty,breach,and causation.see,black law dictionary ed defining damages as m oney claimed by,or ordered to be paid to,a person as compensation for loss or injury webster third new international dictionary defining damages as the esti
