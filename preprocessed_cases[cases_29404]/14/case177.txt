this is a policy coverage dispute between lowry development,llc and great american insurance company of new york.the damages creating the dispute were caused by hurricane katrina.lowry sought recovery under its policy.we find that lowry policy did not include wind coverage.accordingly,we reverse the district court contrary determination.
background 
lowry,the insured,is the real estate developer of tuscan villas.the villas are a project located in gulfport,mississippi.in early,great american issued lowry a builder risk policy for the construction of tuscan i.that first phase of the project has been completed.construction of tuscan ii commenced.great american issued lowry a builder risk policy in early for it.hurricane katrina struck prior to the completion of tuscan ii.substantial damage resulted.
a business relationship between these parties began as early as.at that time,lowry told its procuring agent,groves and associates insurance,that builder risk coverage was needed during the construction of tuscan groves contacted crump insurance services of memphis,which served as great american selling broker.the resulting policy covered many construction risks,but no wind coverage was obtained.instead,protection against damages from wind was purchased from the mississippi wind pool the policy terminated in when construction was completed.
in january,lowry informed groves that coverage was now needed for the construction of tuscan ii.groves contacted crump.groves and crump disagreed in the district court about the details of their negotiations.crump contended that the negotiations excluded wind coverage,while groves alleged that negotiations included it.undisputed is that,on january,great american sent to crump a confirmation that it would issue a builder risk policy that excluded coverage for wind,hail,flood,and earthquake.crump then sent to groves a quotation confirmation.in crump transmittal,the coverage type was said to be all risk excl.earthquake flood.a separate section,labeled policy conditions,excluded wind,hail,flood,and earthquake.
following receipt of the confirmation of the price quote,great american authorized crump to issue a binder extending coverage for tuscan ii the binder,dated january,had the same dichotomy as the earlier price quote.the coverage type was all risk excl.earthquake flood.the policy conditions excluded wind,hail,flood,and earthquake.
great american thereafter issued the insurance policy.contrary to its prior communications with crump,the policy did not contain a wind exclusion.great american attributes this to a clerical mistake that occurred when the policy information was entered into its record system.it contends that the error was caught two and a half months after the original policy was issued,and in april,a wind exclusion endorsement was added.the endorsement was sent to crump,who forwarded it to groves.
the april wind exclusion endorsement stated that there was no change in premium but that the exclusion was added per quote.a cover letter accompanying the endorsement also asked groves to review the attached documents and advise if there are any changes or corrections to be made.groves did not respond with any concerns.
the policy was scheduled to expire in january,but tuscan ii was not complete by then.groves requested a coverage extension.the first was for six months.at the time of the first extension,crump sent groves a renewal policy containing a wind exclusion endorsement.groves faxed it to lowry.a later extension,granted via an endorsement,provided ninety additional days of coverage.that final extension took coverage into the time that hurricane katrina damaged the property.
after katrina,lowry sought recovery under its policy.great american filed a suit based on diversity in the district court for the southern district of mississippi.it sought a declaratory judgment that the policy did not cover wind damage.lowry responded with counterclaims against great american,groves,and crump lowry also filed a suit in state court that was later removed.the district court consolidated the cases.both great american and lowry moved for summary judgment.
great american argument was twofold.either it had validly added a wind exclusion prior to katrina,or the policy should be reformed under the doctrine of mutual mistake.because we agree with great american that the policy did not contain wind coverage at the time of hurricane katrina,we will not address the mutual mistake issue.the district court found that the april endorsement was ineffective.it also held that great american failed to comply with the provisions of a mississippi notice statute when it sought to add the wind exclusion to the policy.partial summary judgment was granted.a professional negligence claim against groves was never resolved.
the mutual mistake question was submitted to a jury.jurors found no mistake.the parties stipulated to damages in the amount of.judgment was entered for lowry.great american appealed.
ii.discussion 
on this appeal,we review a summary judgment on the effect of the april endorsement.we consider the factual submissions and legal analysis on which the judgment was based de novo.cain transocean offshore usa,cir.we resolve the case on that sole issue.
there are two central facts in the case.the first is that the builder risk policy as first issued included wind coverage.the second is that great american sought later to add a wind exclusion.
as to the exclusion,there were two relevant events.in april,an endorsement was sent to groves that added the wind exclusion.the april date was two and a half months after the issuance of the original policy.groves never sent the change to lowry.the second relevant event was the issuance of a renewal policy in january.the renewal occurred after the parties agreed to extend insurance coverage for an additional six months.groves faxed the renewal to lowry.by its terms,the renewal policy excluded wind coverage.
we start with the april wind exclusion endorsement.its efficacy is governed by mississippi law.importantly,consideration is required when insurance policies are modified by the insurer.jackson,supra.absent proof of mistake,the consideration paid must be taken to have been in exchange for the benefits reflected in the terms of the initial policy.that included coverage for wind damage.we do not need to reach whether there was a mistake in the initial policy.the jury said there was not.
great american sought to modify the policy in april through the issuance of the wind exclusion.we note that there was no new consideration such as a premium rebate or great american suffering a legal detriment in exchange for the decrease in coverage.see krebs ex rel.krebs strange,so d,holding that an insurer offer that it might renew the insurance contract if the insured agreed to the modification was not supported by adequate consideration.nonetheless,for reasons that will become apparent later,it is unnecessary to therefore we do not the april endorsement was an ineffective unilateral modification.
the district court observed that,but for lowry failure to comply with a mississippi notice statute that we will discuss,the january renewal might have been deemed sufficient notice of the reduction in coverage to bind lowry to the terms of the policy.we therefore turn to two questions what was the effect of the state statute on the renewal policy,and if the notice statute is not a bar,do the terms of the renewal policy excluding wind coverage apply 
the first question concerns a statute that makes ineffective a nonrenewal or certain identified changes to a policy unless proper notice is first given 
a cancellation,reduction in coverage or nonrenewal of liability insurance coverage,fire insurance coverage or single premium multiperil insurance coverage is not effective as to any coverage issued or renewed after june,unless notice is mailed or delivered to the insured and to any named creditor loss payee by the insurer not less than thirty days prior to the effective date of such cancellation,reduction or nonrenewal.
the district court found no mississippi precedents relevantly interpreting this statute.the op
