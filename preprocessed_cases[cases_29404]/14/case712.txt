in this civil action,the appellant challenges an order denying his motion to set aside a summary judgment.for reasons explained below,we affirm.
background 
this litigation grew out of a home remodel.plaintiff and appellant joe huh,doing business as omega construction,entered into a contract with defendant and respondent guanyin wang to remodel respondent residence.
after disputes arose,appellant filed this action in december for breach of contract and to enforce a mechanic lien.the complaint names respondent as well as several other individuals all defendants answered,and respondent wang.
discovery order april 
in february,respondent propounded discovery,including requests for admissions.when appellant failed to respond within the time allowed,respondent moved for an order deeming the matters admitted.that motion was granted in april.
appellant made two unsuccessful attempts to seek reconsideration of the discovery order a motion presented in april,which the clerk rejected for filing,and a motion filed in february,which appellant later took off calendar.
summary judgment march 
armed with the deemed admissions,respondent brought a motion for summary judgment in november regarding both the complaint and the.hearing on the motion was scheduled for february.
appellant filed no written opposition.but on the day before the hearing,he applied ex parte for a continuance and for relief from his default in failing to oppose the motion,which he blamed on attorney calendaring error.he renewed that application on the day of the hearing.the court denied the applications.
the motion went forward with no appearance by appellant,and summary judgment was granted on both the complaint and the,establishing the amounts owed.respondent was found to be the prevailing party he was later awarded fees and costs.
judgment was entered in march.consistent with the order granting summary judgment,the judgment resolved the complaint,the,and the mechanic lien.it established the amount due appellant,which was far less than he had claimed.
respondent served notice of entry of the judgment in april.
attacks on the judgment 
appellant attempted to overturn the judgment in several different ways.
in early june,he filed a motion for new trial and for relief from judgment.several days later,he filed a notice of appeal.in supplemental opposition papers,respondent asserted that the appeal divested the trial court of jurisdiction to act on appellant motion for new trial.in late june,appellant abandoned the appeal.as for the new trial motion,the hearing was continued to july,then taken off calendar.
in late july,appellant brought a motion to set aside the judgment under section,subdivision b,of the code of civil procedure the court denied the motion in september.
this appeal from the september order ensued.
contentions 
appellant contends that the trial court was required to grant him relief under section b.because his failure to oppose summary judgment was the result of attorney error,he asserts,the mandatory relief provisions of the statute apply.alternatively,appellant argues,even under the discretionary provisions of the statute,the court abused its discretion in denying relief.
respondent disputes both contentions on the merits.in addition,respondent characterizes the motion at issue here as a defective attempt at reconsideration and he asks us to dismiss this appeal as an impermissible bid for review of its denial.we consider that issue at the threshold.
appealability 
we first address the threshold question of whether the challenged order is appealable,since the question of appealability goes to our jurisdiction olson cory cal d,accord,jennings marralle cal th,d.
appealability depends on the nature of the motion and order below.if this appeal is in fact taken from the denial of a motion for reconsideration,as respondent contends,there is a split of authority concerning appealability.see annette sharon th,d in re marriage of burgard th,d.but if the appeal is from the denial of a motion for relief under section,as it purports to be,the order is appealable.leader health industries of america,th,d accord,sjp.partnership city of los angeles th,fn,d.
according to respondent,the motion should be treated on appeal as a motion for reconsideration or renewal of a previously denied application,within the meaning of ccp.in effect,respondent is asking us to look beyond the motion label,both as given by appellant and as treated by the trial court.we decline to do so.see passavanti williams d.we therefore accept the challenged order at face value,as the denial of a motion under section.as such,it is appealable.leader health industries of america,supra,th at,d.
discussion 
having concluded that the challenged order is appealable,we turn to the substantive issues.at issue here is the application of section b,which empowers a court to grant relief in appropriate cases from attorney error.the statute contains both mandatory and discretionary provisions.
mandatory relief 
in certain cases of attorney fault,section b requires the trial court to grant relief.the mandatory relief provision states in pertinent part notwithstanding any other requirements of this section,the court shall,whenever an application for relief is made no more than six months after entry of judgment,is in proper form,and is accompanied by an attorney sworn affidavit attesting to his or her mistake,inadvertence,surprise,or neglect,vacate any resulting default entered by the clerk against his or her client,and which will result in entry of a default judgment,or resulting default judgment or dismissal entered against his or her client,unless the court finds that the default or dismissal was not in fact caused by the attorney mistake,inadvertence,surprise,or neglect.b.
requirements 
procedurally,an application for mandatory relief must be filed within six months of entry of judgment vandermoon sanwong th,d,citing b.in addition,the application must be in proper form,and be accompanied by an attorney sworn affidavit attesting to his or her mistake,inadvertence,surprise,or neglect.ibid.furthermore,the defaulting party must submit sufficient admissible evidence that the default was actually caused by the attorney error.todd thrifty th,d.if the prerequisites for the application of the mandatory relief provision of section,subdivision b exist,the trial court does not have discretion to refuse relief.sjp.partnership city of los angeles,supra,th at,d.
b.the provision reach 
in providing for mandatory relief,the legislature created a narrow exception to the discretionary relief provision for default judgments and dismissals.zamora clayborn contracting group,cal th,d,zamora.by its express terms,the mandatory relief provision applies only to defaults,default judgments,and dismissals.vandermoon sanwong,supra,th at,d.but some courts have construed the provision to reach other circumstances deemed to be procedural equivalents.see,in re marriage of hock th,d.the rationale of these cases is that,where there is no hearing on the merits,an attorney neglect should not prevent the party from having his or her day in court.ibid.other courts have rejected that rationale,characterizing such decisions as understandable,yet ultimately misguided quests to salvage cases lost by inept attorneys,which have applied the mandatory provision far beyond the limited confines the legislature intended.english ikon business solutions,th,d english.
as more specifically relevant here,there is a split of authority on whether the mandatory provisions of section b can provide relief from an order granting summary judgment.witkin,cal.procedure supp.attack on judgment.at least one case allowed statutory relief in this context,avila chua th,d.other cases have rejected that view,declining to extend the mandatory provisions to the summary judgment context.see,prieto loyola marymount university th,d failure to oppose summary judgment motion garcia hejmadi th,d defective opposition to summary judgment motion.
according to appellant on closer inspection,there is no split of authority.in his view,the cases can be reconciled based on their procedural posture where the attorney failed to oppose the summary judgment motion at all,relief is mandatory.where opposition is filed that does not dispute the merits,relief is not mandatory.
we disagree with appellant interpretation of the case law.a careful reading of the relevant decisions reflects a more fundamental disagreement about the reach of the mandatory relief provision,a point made clear in the english case.english,supra,th,d.
english is among the cases refusing to extend the statute beyond its explicit terms.english,supra,th at,d.there,the plaintiff opposed a defense summary judgment motion based solely on a requested continuance to conduct discovery.id.at,d see,subd.h.after refusing to continue the hearing,the trial court granted summary judgment.english,at,d.the plaintiff sought relief under the mandatory relief provision of section b,submitting her attorney declaration of fault for failing to oppose summary judgment on the merits.english,at,d.the trial court denied relief,and the denial was affirmed on appeal.id.at,d.
the english court thoroughly reviewed both the legislative history of the mandatory relief provision and the case law interpreting it.english,supra,th at,d.ultimately,the court concluded,the mandatory relief provision does not apply to summary judgments.id.at,d.as the court explained,a summary judgment is neither a default,nor a default judgment,nor a dismissal.ibid.a summary judgment is not a default under the mandatory relief provision,because that statutory term refers only a default entered by the clerk or the court when a defendant fails to answer a complaint,not to every omission or failure in the course of an action,fn.omitted.a summary judgment likewise is not a default judgment,which is a judgment entered after the defendant has failed to answer the complaint and the defendant default has been entered.ibid.finally,a summary judgment is not a dismissal,which is defined as the withdrawal of an application for judicial relief by the party seeking such relief,or the removal of the application by a court.id.at,d,quoting justice epstein dissent in yeap leake th,d yeap.a defense summary judgment can not be considered a dismissal since it does not constitute a removal of the plaintiff application for judicial relief,but rather an adjudication based on undisputed facts before the court.english,at,d.
in explaining its reasons for refusing to extend the mandatory relief provisions to summary judgments,the english court not only discussed the relevant statutory language in great detail,it also tethered the statute key terms to legislative policy.english,supra,th at,d.the court explained that its narrow construction furthers the legislative goal of achieving parity between defendants and plaintiffs in their entitlement to relief under the mandatory provision of section b.id.at,d.the court decried other courts expansive interpretation of the statute under which the dispositive test,largely detached from the language of the statute itself,is whether the ruling from which relief is sought was in the nature of a default and whether the party seeking relief had her day in court.id.at,d.the english court instead deferred to the express dictates of the mandatory relief provision,saying no court is at liberty to substitute its judgment for that of the legislature in determining how far the statute should reach,no matter what good intentions may urge such an action.id.at,d.in doing so,it embraced the rationale expressed in justice epstein dissent in yeap.id.at,d.subsequent cases have also endorsed that reasoning.see,prieto loyola marymount university,supra,th at,d vandermoon sanwong,supra,th at,d.
we agree with the cogent analysis in english,which is faithful to legislative intent and consistent with established principles of statutory construction.as the english court said it is not an appellate court task,nor,indeed,its prerogative,when interpreting a statute,to extend the scope of the statute to encompass situations analogous to those the statute explicitly addresses.rather,an appellate court task is simply to determine what the legislature meant by the words it used,relying first and foremost on the words themselves.english,supra,th at,d.where the statutory language is unambiguous,its plain meaning controls.id.at,d see kavanaugh west sonoma county union high school dist.cal th,d.here,the statutory language is unequivocal.as expressly worded,section b applies only to relief sought in response to defaults,default judgments or dismissals.vandermoon sanwong,supra,th at,d,italics added.summary judgments are neither defaults,nor default judgments,nor dismissals.english,at,d.the explicit statutory language of section b thus provides no basis for extending the mandatory provision to such judgments.prieto loyola marymount university,supra,th at,d.in the words of justice epstein,to read the mandatory provision of section to apply whenever a party loses his or her day in court due to attorney error goes far beyond anything the legislature has done.yeap,supra,th at,d dis.opn.of epstein.
appellate review 
the determination of whether the mandatory provision of section b applies to summary judgments is a task of statutory construction.english,supra,th at,d.statutory interpretation is a question of law,which appellate courts review de novo.kavanaugh west sonoma county union high school,supra,cal th at,d.where an appeal involves factual determinations that affect entitlement to mandatory relief,such as whether attorney fault caused the default,we examine the record for substantial evidence in support of the trial court exercise of discretion.todd thrifty,supra,th at,d.here,the issue turns on construction of the statute.our review thus is de novo.
as thoroughly explained above,we agree with the english court narrow construction of the mandatory portion of section b.english,supra,th at,d.as english and its progeny recognize,the mandatory provision applies only to relief sought in response to defaults,default judgments or dismissals.vandermoon sanwong,supra,th at,d.summary judgments thus are not within the purview of the mandatory relief provision.english,at,d.
since appellant sought to set aside a summary judgment,his case offers no basis for mandatory statutory relief and the trial court did not err in refusing it.that brings us to appellant alternative argument that discretionary relief should have been granted.
ii.discretionary relief 
the first portion of section,providing that the court may relieve a party from a dismissal,vests the trial court with the discretion to vacate a dismissal based on a party or attorney excusable neglect.todd thrifty,supra,th at,d.it states in pertinent part the court may,upon any terms as may be just,relieve a party or his or her legal representative from a judgment,dismissal,order,or other proceeding taken against him or her through his or her mistake,inadvertence,surprise,or excusable neglect.application for this relief shall be accompanied by a copy of the answer or other pleading proposed to be filed therein,otherwise the application shall not be granted,and shall be made within a reasonable time,in no case exceeding six months,after the judgment,dismissal,order,or proceeding was taken.b.
a.the provision reach 
in contrast to the mandatory portion of section b,discretionary relief under the statute is not limited to defaults,default judgments,and dismissals english,supra,th at,d.as the california supreme court recently observed the discretionary relief provision of section,subdivision b applies to any judgment,dismissal,order,or other proceeding.zamora,supra,cal th at,d.thus,for example,the failure of counsel to meet a procedural deadline is a proper subject for section relief.lee wells fargo bank th,d.so,too,is failure to timely respond to a request for admissions.elston city of turlock cal d,elston.
requirements 
in order to qualify for discretionary relief under section,the moving party must act diligently in seeking relief and must submit affidavits or testimony demonstrating a reasonable cause for the default.elston,supra,cal d at.in other words,the court discretion may be exercised only after the party seeking relief has shown that there is a proper ground for relief,and that the party has raised that ground in a procedurally proper manner,within any applicable time limits.cruz fagor america,th,d.
a party seeking discretionary relief on the ground of attorney error must demonstrate that the error was excusable,since the attorney negligence is imputed to the client.zamora,supra,cal th at,d.the inexcusable neglect of an attorney is usually not a proper basis for granting the client motion under section.elston,supra,cal d at,fn.excusable neglect is that neglect which might have been the act of a reasonably prudent person under the same circumstances.alderman jacobs d,see zamora,at,d.
appellate review 
generally speaking,the trial court ruling on a discretionary motion for relief is reviewed for an abuse of discretion.zamora,supra,cal th at,d.but because the law strongly favors trial and disposition on the merits,any doubts in applying section must be resolved in favor of the party seeking relief from default citations.elston,supra,cal d at,see also zamora,at,d.for that reason,a trial court order denying relief is scrutinized more carefully than an order permitting trial on the merits.elston,at.
in denying appellant motion here,the trial court implicitly determined that he failed to establish entitlement to relief.the record supports that implicit finding on either of two grounds unexplained delay or inexcusable neglect.
as noted above,a threshold requirement for relief is the moving party diligence.elston,supra,cal d at.as the statute itself provides,application for relief shall be made within a reasonable time,in no case exceeding six months,after the judgment,dismissal,order,or proceeding was taken.b,italics added.section is often applied liberally where the party in default moves promptly to seek relief,and the party opposing the motion will not suffer prejudice if relief is granted.elston,at,see zamora,supra,cal th at,d.but relief is not warranted unless the moving party demonstrates diligence in seeking it.kendall barker d.the moving party has a double burden he must show a satisfactory excuse for his default,and he must show diligence in making the motion after discovery of the default.id.at.whether a party has acted diligently is a factual question for the trial court.benjamin dalmo cal d,benjamin.
here,the trial court impliedly determined that appellant did not act diligently in seeking determination that is amply supported in fact and law.
length of the delay 
as the record in this case demonstrates,the following pertinent events took place all in by early february,appellant counsel was aware of his failure to oppose the summary judgment motion,as demonstrated by his ex parte applications in march,summary judgment was entered in april,notice of entry of judgment was given in early june,appellant filed a motion for new trial and for relief from the judgment,which he took off calendar the following month also in early june,appellant filed a notice of appeal challenging the judgment,but he abandoned that appeal on june.finally,on july,appellant filed the motion for relief at issue here 
although the parties do not dispute the above chronology,they disagree on the length of the delay preceding appellant motion for relief.focusing on the first and last events described above,respondent argues that nearly six months elapsed between counsel demonstrated awareness of his error in early february and his filing of the motion for relief in late july.asserting diligence,appellant instead claims a shorter time lag,commencing with the abandonment of his first appeal.as appellant puts it,his counsel abandoned a prior appeal after learning that the appeal would effectively deprive the trial court of jurisdiction to hear the motion.as soon as the appeal was abandoned,counsel promptly filed the motion.appellant contention does not withstand scrutiny.in the first place,he offers no explanation for his counsel ignorance of the effect of an appeal on the trial court jurisdiction.furthermore,we would question appellant claim that he acted promptly after abandoning his appeal on june,since he waited a full calendar month thereafter before applying for relief from judgment.in any event,we do not share appellant view that abandonment of his appeal commenced the period.but neither do we agree with respondent starting point for calculating the delay.
in our view,the critical triggering event for seeking relief from the judgment was notice of its entry,which was given on april.appellant waited to file his motion until more than three months later,on july.
that time lag puts this case in the same league as benjamin,supra,cal d.there,our high court noted,no action was taken to open the default for a period of more than three months.id.at.as the court observed defendant has not cited,nor has independent research disclosed,any case in which a court has set aside a default where,in making application therefor,there has been an unexplained delay of anything approaching three months after full knowledge of the entry of the default.id.at.under those circumstances,the court concluded,the trial court abused its discretion in granting relief under authority of section id.at.key to that conclusion was the lack of evidence explaining the delay.id.at.
lack of explanation 
according to benjamin,the proper procedure for motions under section b first contemplates the moving party presentation of some explanation,by affidavit or testimony,of any extended delay,and the court then determines whether such explanation may be deemed sufficient to justify the granting of the relief sought.benjamin,supra,cal d at.while six longest time the outside limit of the court jurisdiction to grant relief in any event,the reasonable time test stands as an independent consideration and in any given situation,its determination,within the maximum period,depends upon the circumstances of that particular case.id.at.for that reason,there must be some evidence of the relevant circumstances.id.at.here,appellant offered no evidence explaining the delay in seeking relief given the absolute failure of proof on this point,there is no basis for granting relief.as settled by our high court long ago in benjamin,the circumstances occasioning the attorney delay of more than three months before the institution of these proceedings should have been presented in support of the motion for relief.benjamin,supra,cal d at.to hold in the absence of any explanation a delay of more than three months in undertaking to open a default can be empower the trial court to dispense with the reasonable time requirement of the statute.ibid.
in sum,this record amply supports an implied finding that appellant failed to act diligently in seeking discretionary relief under section b.the court order may be affirmed on that basis alone.moreover,as we now explain,the order may be upheld on another ground,failure to demonstrate excusable neglect.
grounds for relief 
as the moving party,appellant had the burden of establishing entitlement to relief from the judgment.parage couedel th,d.he was required to establish his position by a preponderance of the evidence.price hibbs d.where a party fails to show that a judgment has been taken against him through his mistake,inadvertence,surprise or excusable neglect the court may not grant relief.it has no discretion.parage couedel,at,d.in this case,the record supports an implied finding that appellant failed to carry his burden.
excusable neglect 
to warrant discretionary relief here,the proffered evidence must show that the attorney error was excusable.see zamora,supra,cal th at,d,superior court th,d.neglect is excusable only if a reasonably prudent person in similar circumstances might have made the same error.bettencourt los rios community college dist.cal d,garcia hejmadi,supra,th at,d alderman jacobs,supra,d at.relevant factors in assessing counsel error include the nature of the mistake or neglect and whether counsel was otherwise diligent in investigating and pursuing the claim.bettencourt los rios community college,at.conduct falling below the professional standard of care,such as failure to timely object
