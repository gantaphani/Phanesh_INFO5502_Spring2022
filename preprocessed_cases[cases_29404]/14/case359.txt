buyers of houses in the boise,idaho area claim that various realtors representing developers tied the sale of undeveloped lots to services and commissions for developed property in violation of the federal and state laws.applying the doctrine of zero foreclosure,the district court granted summary judgment to the realtors because there is no market for listing and referral services among potential buyers of houses,thus no competition in the tied market to be harmed.we agree,and affirm.
curtis blough and his wife were in the market for a house.they liked an existing home built by trademark homes in baldwin park,a subdivision developed by capital development,but desired some modifications.trademark had optioned other lots in this subdivision and agreed to build a house to the bloughs specifications.capital development had a deal with holland realty,to be the exclusive broker for the sale of lots in baldwin park.holland received a flat fee from the developer for sale of lots,and trademark agreed to pay holland a three percent referral fee upon the sale of new homes.the bloughs entered an agreement with trademark to purchase the home on a lot within baldwin park holland referral fee came out of funds trademark received from the bloughs.
gary and shawna yasuda were interested in a home in a subdivision called sedona creek.sedona creek was being developed by great sky development,company was the marketing agent,and zach evans construction was the builder.the yasudas entered into an agreement with zach evans to build a home on a lot that zach evans obtained from great sky for a price that included a three percent marketing fee for.the marketing fee for was based upon the price for the lot and home in the contract between zach evans and the yasudas.
dave and emily merrithew were impressed with a home design by aspen homes,with whom they contracted to build a house in the bear creek subdivision.the price included the lot and house,as well as a six percent fee based on the contract price that aspen had agreed to pay its exclusive listing agent,park pointe reality.park pointe split the fee with the merrithews agent,century first place.
robert and renae bafus thought they would buy an empty lot in the chaumont subdivision and get a construction loan to pay walker building for the home,but walker contract included the price of the lot and the house.the developer had retained aspen realty as a marketing agent,and aspen realty also served as walker building agent.the cost walker charged for the lot and finished home included a six percent commission that was paid at the closing.
the bloughs,yasudas,merrithews,and bafuses to whom we refer collectively as buyers brought this suit as a class action against the agents representing the subdivision developers whose commissions were involved in their purchases to whom we refer collectively as realtors.buyers seek damages and declaratory relief for a per se unlawful tying arrangement in violation of of the sherman act,they claim that realtors tied services,commissions with regard to sale of developed lots the tied product to the sales of undeveloped lots the tying product.
the district court certified a class for adjudication of the tying claim.it identified the tying product as sales of undeveloped lots and the tied product as realtors services,commissions,with regard to sale of developed lots.the class consists of those who bought undeveloped lots in subdivisions where realtors had the exclusive right to market lots on behalf of the developer were required to build a house on the lot in order to buy the lot and were required to pay realtors a commission based on the cost of the lot plus the actual or estimated cost of the house in order to buy the lot.
realtors moved for summary judgment.buyers filed an application under federal rule of civil procedure f seeking further discovery into other members of the class to determine whether any of them wanted to buy the services of a listing agent from someone other than realtors.the district court denied buyers request on the ground that they had shown no plausible reason to believe that other members of the class unlike themselves would want to purchase the tied product from anyone else.it then ruled on the merits in realtors favor,concluding that buyers failed to show that the alleged tying practice affects a not insubstantial volume of commerce in the tied product market.paladin.power,cir internal quotation marks omitted.
buyers timely appealed.
we treat all four cases together,as the district court did,because they present the same legal issue and are factually indistinguishable.in sum,buyers entered into agreements with homebuilders to purchase developed lots an undeveloped lot with a home in different subdivisions in the boise,idaho area.realtors represented the developers of the subdivisions in allocating lots to the homebuilders.the price of the developed lot that buyers paid to the homebuilders included a commission or referral fee for realtors,typically calculated as a percentage of the total price of the developed lot.it is apparently the custom in idaho for the seller,rather than the buyer,to pay the commission owed to the listing agent and to the selling agent the agent assisting the buyer search for a property when a transaction closes.buyers claim the realtors engaged in a per se unlawful tying arrangement when they tied the sale of undeveloped lots the tying product to their services and commissions on the sale of developed lots the tied product.

that the defendant tied together the sale of two distinct products or services that the defendant possesses enough economic power in the tying product market to coerce its customers into purchasing the tied product and that the tying arrangement affects a not insubstantial volume of commerce in the tied product market.
the third prong of the test is at issue in this case.the injury caused by an unlawful tying arrangement is reduced competition in the market for the tied product,equilon enters.llc,cir citing jefferson parish hosp.dist.hyde,d see also.tool works indep.ink,d.thus,the inquiry is whether a total amount of business,substantial enough in terms of so as not to be merely de minimis,is foreclosed to competitors by the tie.fortner,steel,d datagate,cir.
we considered the third prong in datagate.there the question was whether the test could be met even though only a single purchaser of the tied product was affected.we held that it could be,so long as the of competition foreclosed on account of the tying arrangement was not insubstantial.at.here,there is no evidence that any purchaser was affected or that any competition was foreclosed.in these circumstances there is zero foreclosure and the third prong is not satisfied.
zero foreclosure exists where the tied product is completely unwanted by the buyer.see reifert cent.mls,cir wells real estate,greater lowell bd.of realtors,cir ix phillip areeda herbert hovenkamp,antitrust law supp.in such a case,there is no unlawful tying arrangement because there is no adverse effect on competition in the tied product market.w hen a purchaser is forced to buy a product he would not have otherwise bought even from another seller in the tied product market,there can be no adverse impact on competition because no portion of the market which would otherwise have been available to other sellers has been foreclosed.jefferson par
