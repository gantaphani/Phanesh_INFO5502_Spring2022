mat leasing,challenges an order entered by the district court during collection proceedings.those proceedings stemmed from a money judgment against pavement maintenance,pmi,on pmi default,in favor of the three plaintiffs in the litigation laborers pension fund,laborers welfare fund,and james jorgenson,the funds administrator.we refer to the plaintiffs as the funds collectively,they make up the first set of appellees before us.the other appellee,mb financial bank,entered the proceedings in the district court as an adverse claimant.mb financial has a perfected security interest in pmi assets its interest has priority over the funds interest in those assets.
but the appellees are not at least now pursuing pmi,which is not even a party to this appeal.instead,they would like to collect from mat leasing,a respondent in the district court and the appellant here.according to the funds and mb financial,mat leasing was indebted to pmi at the time judgment was entered against pmi.following traditional principles of garnishment,the creditors to whom pmi owes money are attempting to collect that debt from mat leasing.
on march,the district court entered an order finding that mat leasing did owe money to pmi and,after incorporating a few offsets,it calculated the amount of debt at.on april,the court ordered mat leasing to turn over that amount to mb financial,the adverse claimant and priority creditor.mat leasing has appealed judgments in favor of the funds and of mb financial we affirm.
on april,mb financial extended credit to pmi in the principal sum of.mb financial filed the documents required to secure its interest and then,on august,properly perfected it by filing a financing statement.as we have noted,mb financial priority over the funds interest in pmi assets is undisputed.
in the meantime,from to,mat leasing was toiling away on a job it had obtained to perform repairs on certain chicago streets by replacing asphalt.mat leasing removed the original asphalt and subcontracted to pmi the replacement paving work.pmi replaced the asphalt using its own equipment and crew of unionized laborers.pmi did not own any trucks,however,and so it purchased the trucking services required to pick up fresh asphalt from a supplier and transport it to the job site from a company called transit.mat leasing and transit were owned in part by michael tadin,and his son,michael tadin.at pmi job sites,joseph haughey supervised pmi work.haughey was a partner in pmi and the primary contact person between pmi and its contractors,mat leasing and transit.
while the repaving project was going on,pmi experienced myriad financial difficulties.its records were a mess,its invoices were inaccurate,and it had trouble making payments to transit for its trucking services.it failed to make timely payments on its loans from mb financial or to make timely contributions to the funds,which provided coverage to pmi employees.despite these problems and its awareness of them,mat leasing continued to deal with pmi.those dealings occurred primarily in the form of handshake agreements between mat leasing head of operations,mike tadin,and haughey,pmi owner and head of operations.when asked at an evidentiary hearing about these agreements,tadin could not recall the details,but he affirmed that they were entirely verbal no written documents exist to memorialize them.
on august,the funds filed the complaint that started the present case.they began by suing pmi in the northern district of illinois for delinquent contributions and an audit.an amended complaint followed on july,adding pmi owner haughey as a defendant.four months later,on november,the district court entered a default judgment against pmi and haughey and in favor of the funds,in the amount of.thereafter,the funds initiated proceedings pursuant to.a,which instructs district courts to follow the law of supplementary proceedings of the state in which they sit.the parties and district court accordingly proceeded under the illinois statute governing supplementary proceedings,ilcs.
the funds sent citations to discover assets to several companies,seeking to find out if any of those third parties owed money to if they did,rule a and illinois law would entitle the funds to recover the amounts owed.with those citations still pending,mb financial appeared in the district court on march,to assert its own interest in pmi assets.it claimed,and the funds did not dispute,that it held a secured,perfected interest in pmi assets with priority over that of the funds.two months later,on may,the district court entered an agreed order providing that mb financial secured interest was perfected,valid,and enforceable,with first priority over pmi assets the funds rights were valid and enforceable but subordinate to mb financial and the citations filed by the funds,and any additional citations that third parties might file,would remain in full force and effect under illinois supreme court rule f,supplementary proceedings,and any recoveries obtained from those citations would apply first to the debt owed to mb financial,and then to the debt due to the funds.
two weeks later,on june,attorneys for mb financial wrote a letter to mat leasing,seeking to collect on accounts receivable that mb financial believed were owed from mat leasing to pmi.a letter also went to transit,but because the matters relating to transit are not pertinent to this appeal,we do not discuss them further.the letter noted that while pmi records of invoices are complete,records of payments made to pmi are not,and therefore we are unsure of the actual balance outstanding.the letter requested copies of mat leasing payments on these outstanding accounts receivable,but mat leasing did not oblige.the following month,on july,the funds issued a citation to discover assets to mat leasing mat leasing did not respond to the citation nor did it comply,and so on october,the funds filed a motion for rule to show cause why the citation respondent mat leasing and its president,michael tadin,should not be held in contempt for the failure to comply.the motion also asked the court to order the citation respondents to pay the attorneys fees and costs that the funds incurred in bringing the motion.
the district court granted the funds motion on january,and set a rule to show cause hearing for january.the hearing was conducted as a status hearing,and as it concluded,another status hearing was set for april.counsel for mat leasing entered his appearance on april.four days later,the funds filed a motion for turnover of mat leasing assets,along with a notice for presentment of that motion at the hearing scheduled for april.when that hearing convened,the district judge entered the funds motion for turnover of mat leasing assets.several additional postponements took place over the next few months,until on july the court set an evidentiary hearing for september.
at the hearing,the parties focused on the question whether mat leasing owed money to pmi and,if so,how much.two witnesses testified thomas murray president and the other owner of pmi and michael tadin,head of operations for mat leasing.the district court took the issue under advisement,and on march,it granted the funds motion for turnover of mat leasing assets and found that the amount of the debt was.mat leasing filed its notice of appeal from that order on april,this appeal was docketed as.then on april,mb financial moved in the district court for an order requiring mat leasing to pay the amount of money specified in the court march order.the court granted that motion three days later,on april.mat leasing filed a second notice of appeal from that decision it was docketed as and we consolidated the two appeals for our review.
mat leasing offers three reasons for reversing the district court rulings.first,mat leasing argues that the district court lost its jurisdiction over these collection proceedings on june,because the funds and mb financial failed to comply with the requirements of illinois supreme court rule f,which provides for automatic termination of collection proceedings after six months unless the trial court grants an extension.second,assuming the distric
