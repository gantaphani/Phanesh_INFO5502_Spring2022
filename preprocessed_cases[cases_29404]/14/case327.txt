ruzicka electric and sons,ruzicka electric sued local of the international brotherhood of electrical workers local under section of the labor management relations act lmra,alleging local engaged in unlawful secondary activity,in violation of b ii b.ruzicka electric also brought state law defamation claims against local for statements made by its agents questioning the quality of ruzicka electric work.thomas ruzicka ruzicka,ruzicka electric president and founder,individually brought a state law invasion of privacy claim against local based on the conduct of private investigators hired by local to surveil ruzicka.after ruzicka electric and ruzicka presented their claims to a jury,the district court granted judgment as a matter of law to local on all claims.ruzicka electric and ruzicka appeal,claiming the district court erred in dismissing ruzicka electric section claims dismissing ruzicka electric defamation claims dismissing ruzicka invasion of privacy claim not allowing ruzicka electric to present evidence about its claim that local engaged in secondary activity at a job site not listed in ruzicka electric complaint and admitting local evidence about administrative proceedings involving ruzicka electric.we affirm in part and reverse in part.specifically,we remand for a new trial on ruzicka electric section claims and ruzicka invasion of privacy claim,and we affirm the district court in all other respects.
background 
because we are reviewing the district court grant of judgment as a matter of law to local,we do not make credibility determinations or weigh the evidence instead,we draw all reasonable inferences in favor of ruzicka electric and ruzicka.dossett first state bank,cir.therefore,we will summarize the evidence adduced at trial under that standard.
ruzicka electric,a missouri corporation founded and headed by ruzicka,provides commercial electrical services.local is a labor union representing electricians in eastern missouri.ruzicka electric and local do not have a history of friendly relations.over the years,local has publicized its area standards dispute with ruzicka electric by using pickets and handbills.this case addresses whether local conduct in its dispute with ruzicka electric violated federal or state laws.
lindenwood university project 
in february,lindenwood university lindenwood hired ruzicka electric to perform electrical work on a student center.on april,local sent letters to lindenwood and ruzicka electric notifying them of local area standards dispute with ruzicka electric,and that local intended to engage in area standards picketing at the lindenwood job site to publicize local belief that ruzicka electric pays its employees substandard wages and fringe benefits.local assured lindenwood and ruzicka electric it did not have a dispute with lindenwood it did not seek to remove ruzicka electric from the job or have work reassigned it did not seek to cause anyone to cease doing business with anyone else it would not interfere with work conducted at the job site and the picket would be legal and peaceful.lindenwood later established a dual gate system at the job site,with a reserved gate to be used by ruzicka electric and its suppliers,and a neutral gate to be used by neutral contractors who were not part of the area standards dispute.from june to october,local picketed and distributed handbills at the lindenwood job site.
on july,local received information that led it to believe ruzicka electric had tainted the neutral gate by accepting deliveries through that gate rather than the reserve gate.in response,local decided to go ahead and put a picket at the neutral gate because we felt that the deliveries were for ruzicka electric and they had in our opinion violated the neutral gate.local picketed the neutral gate on july and.picketing the neutral gate resulted in other trades deciding not to enter the project.
also on july,julie mueller mueller,lindenwood chief operations officer,faxed a letter to local advising local no electrical deliveries had been made to ruzicka electric through the neutral gate,informing local another electrical contractor besides ruzicka electric was conducting business on the premises,and urg ing local to cease picketing against ruzicka electric at the neutral gate.the letter also informed local that failure to cease picketing would result in lindenwood taking all appropriate measures to stop your illegal activity.local claims it was not aware of mueller letter at the time.
on the morning of july,the general contractor for the lindenwood project informed local the electrical deliveries made through the neutral gate were going to another electrical contractor,and not to ruzicka electric.after briefly investigating,local discovered another electrical contractor was,and decided to remove the picket from the neutral gate.local acknowledged it could have mistakenly believed the neutral gate had been tainted,noted it did not know another electrical contractor was,and stated it did not ask lindenwood about the electrical deliveries through the neutral gate before it decided to set up a picket.local did not ask lindenwood about the possibility that ruzicka electric had tainted the neutral gate before it picketed the gate because lindenwood was not real happy with local at the time based on past experience and local picketing activities.
at trial,mueller testified,in a confusing fashion,that ironworkers left their jobs because of local picket.without mentioning a specific date,mueller also testified she saw at least one local agent wearing an observer vest at the neutral gate talking to ironworkers.specifically,she stated,the conversation that i personally witnessed was the local individuals stating to the ironworker individuals,hey,do cross the line,stick with us,do go in there those particular individuals did not cross through the neutral gate.during,mueller stated the ironworkers told her on multiple occasions that local had told them to leave the job.mueller also said she saw observers at the neutral gate talking to ironworkers and other tradesmen several times on multiple days from july to october.mueller stated she saw observers and picketers at the neutral gate standing in the right of way,standing on lindenwood property,standing within the median of lindenwood property,sometimes standing on the side,sometimes flagging cars down versus just standing there.mueller also testified she saw a local member wear an observer vest one moment,and then,within minutes,switch to being a picketer.
john campbell campbell,a ruzicka electric employee,testified that,during the summer and fall of,he saw a local observer at a neutral gate actually stop a concrete truck and ha ve a conversation with the driver,and immediately afterwards the concrete truck left.campbell also testified that,in late august or early september,he saw local agents wearing picket vests at the neutral gate in the morning until the ironworkers would leave the job site,at which time the picketers would change their vests to observer vests.campbell estimated this activity occurred about three or four times a week for two weeks.anthony giuliani giuliani,another ruzicka electric employee,also testified he saw local agents wear vests which he could not read until the ironworkers,plumbers and carpenters did not cross the picket,at which time the local agents changed into other vests.
larry davis davis,who worked for the general contractor as project manager in and now consults for lindenwood,testified he saw local agents without observer vests while at the neutral gate,and he also saw them cross their arms while wearing vests in a manner that would cover up observer.davis himself could not read what the vests said.ruzicka testified he saw a specific instance once where the local observer was talking with employees,ironworkers and plumbers and craftsmen for the job site,before they were going to enter the project,and then that was one of the days that nobody showed up.
on august,local handbillers distributed leaflets at the lindenwood job site to publicize its labor dispute with ruzicka electric and to counter public comments that local was violating the law in its picketing.the leaflets explained local labor dispute was with ruzicka electric,local was not asking any employee to stop working,and local was not seeking to stop any deliveries.the leaflet also explained local had charged ruzicka electric with violating federal labor law,and ruzicka electric settled those charges with the national labor relations board nlrb.local attached a copy of ruzicka electric settlement to the leaflets.
at the beginning of the school year at lindenwood,local distributed leaflets to the students and parents of lindenwood.local also sent a letter to lindenwood president and board of directors advising them of the steps that local one is taking in our publicity campaign arising from our labor dispute with lindenwood college.in addition to detailing local planned publicity campaign,the letter stated local one is always ready to resolve this labor dispute with lindenwood in a good faith manner.
davis testified the lindenwood project was scheduled to be completed by august,but was not completed until late october.davis testified the schedule got off track for several reasons,but noted local picketing partially caused the delay when this situation happened with ibew local,people started walking off the job.well,when they walk off the job,other trades go off the job,then that sort of throws everybody behind.
according to ruzicka,the lindenwood project involved a highly complex structure because you have multiple grade entrances to the building.ruzicka testified numerous contractors work on a critical path in these types of projects,and the critical path requires certain contractors to complete their work before other contractors can complete their portions of the project.because the ironworkers,who numbered between thirty and forty workers,refused to work,the front portion of the critical path was delayed,which compressed ruzicka electric portion of the schedule.specifically,ruzicka stated,well,the ironworkers are totally critical path for the first third of the project,and everybody is waiting and waiting and waiting for the ironworkers to get done with their work so everybody else can get started.ruzicka testified local picketing delayed the overall schedule,causing compression of the time to finish the project the original schedule where we had an orderly progressive schedule to complete the project was not able to be done.it turned into chaos where everybody was working in the same places.ruzicka testified the total cost overruns that were caused because of the schedule conflicts and the chaos and the interference from local with their illegal picketing on the project totaled.to calculate that number,ruzicka took the cost overrun on the project,extra hours and multiplied it by our hourly rate,and i said that is the cost overrun attributed to local ibew.when asked on if the cost overruns could have been caused by erroneous cost estimates before the project began,ruzicka responded,our estimates almost always come in right on the money.
school district project 
also in,the school district school district built a new elementary school.the school district hired ruzicka electric to perform the electrical work on the school.on march,local sent letters to the school district,ruzicka electric and the general contractor for the project,informing them of local area standards dispute with ruzicka electric and that local would exercise its rights to engage in area standards picketing of ruzicka electric.the letter advised all parties local dispute was with ruzicka electric only the area standards picketing would be legal and peaceful local did not seek to cause anyone to cease doing business with anyone else and local would make no effort to interfere with the activities of any employee on the job site or having business at or near the site.the school district established a system at the job site.
ruzicka testified that,on ten or fifteen occasions between march and april,local agents left observer vests on a chair at the neutral gate without having an observer present.according to ruzicka,the ironworkers simply did not come on the job for at least six weeks after the unattended observer vests were left at the neutral gate.local agents testified an observer vest was left unattended only once at the neutral gate.another local agent testified he advised all picketers and observers how to conduct themselves.
on april,local officials met with school district board members,informing them of local concerns about the quality of ruzicka electric work,and telling them ruzicka electric used apprentices who were not properly trained.at the meeting,local officials asked the school district to use local contractors,and also asked the school district to dismiss ruzicka electric from the project if ruzicka electric violated prevailing wage laws.
ruzicka electric contends local engaged in unlawful picketing by leaving the observer vests unattended at the neutral gate to signal secondary employees to observe a picket.similar to the testimony relating to the lindenwood project,ruzicka testified the ironworkers absence from the project compressed the work schedule and delayed ruzicka electric ability to finish its portion of the project.according to ruzicka,local unlawful signal picketing caused ruzicka electric man hours to double from the estimated hours to complete the project to hours.thus,ruzicka electric seeks compensation for the additional man hours to complete the project.
defamation claims 
in october,joseph cousin cousin,a local business representative,talked to an employee of the city of louis in charge of a housing project who was preparing to bid out electrical work.cousin alerted the city employee to some pictures of some unfinished work done by ruzicka electric from a high school project that cousin thought was shoddy work.cousin argued shoddy work means substandard and clarified shoddy as n ot in a manner,sloppy,ugly,not level.
in a separate incident,lawrence hepburn hepburn,a local business agent,told the school district board he felt ruzicka electric work on a school project was dangerous,improper,and not up to code.hepburn never told the school board that inspectors had found ruzicka electric guilty of violating the electrical code.at trial,hepburn testified he had forty years in the electrical business and he knew the code,and that,it was my opinion s ome of ruzicka electric work was dangerous and some of it was against the code.
privacy claim 
in april,local hired a private investigator to investigate ruzicka electric and ruzicka.the private investigator,in turn,hired four additional investigators to conduct surveillance.the investigators surveilled ruzicka private residence with the purpose to establish a daily routine and to see what time ruzicka got home.the written surveillance reports detailed when ruzicka left and returned to his residence,as well as times in the morning and at night when lights were turned on or off.at trial,the private investigator was unable to answer numerous questions,including exactly where he and his investigators were located when they surveilled ruzicka residence.however,the investigator said neither he nor his investigators went on ruzicka property.the investigators made videotapes of the surveillance and mailed the tapes to local.ruzicka testified he subpoenaed the surveillance videotapes from local,but local never produced the videotapes,saying the tapes were lost.
when asked specific questions about the surveillance notes,ruzicka testified the investigators could not have conducted their surveillance from public streets or the like.for example,when asked whether an investigator could see certain lights in ruzicka home from the street,ruzicka responded,it would be impossible.i had a enjoy my privacy a lot,and it was a private address,and from public property there is absolutely no way to see my house because of the tree lines.there is two reasons.one is that the house was elevated about,feet above the street line or the level of the street,and it is about to feet back,and you have to go through driveway kind of winds around,and it is just impossible to see.ruzicka also explained his property is lined with about feet of trees,including evergreen trees,stating,you simply can not see through there.it is not possible.based on his knowledge of his property,ruzicka testified a person would have to be on his property to see the things the surveillance notes depict.
ruzicka maintains he was appalled,amazed,shocked,and angered when he discovered somebody had been lurking around on my property taking videotapes of me and my family and had been on my property until at night on a saturday.ruzicka testified the surveillance activities forced him to be concerned about his and his family safety,noting he felt violated because he bought a house that he thought was private,posted no trespassing signs,and apparently that does do any good.because of the investigators surveillance activities,ruzicka purchased a home security video surveillance cost.he also bought remote starters and security systems for his automobiles.feeling violated by the surveillance activities,ruzicka said he and his family suffered heightened anxiety.
ruzicka electric sued local under section of the lmra,a,alleging local violated section b ii b of the national labor relations act by conducting illegal picketing and secondary boycotts of ruzicka electric at the lindenwood project,the school district project,and the webster university webster project count i ruzicka electric also asserted two counts of defamation against local counts.ruzicka alleged local invaded his privacy count v 
from august to,ruzicka electric and ruzicka tried their claims to a jury.at trial,ruzicka electric attempted to present evidence to the jury regarding local picketing in on a project at the hilton garden inn hilton.ruzicka electric claims local engaged in unlawful secondary activity at the hilton job site,causing ruzicka electric in damages.local moved to exclude this evidence,because it was unrelated in time and place to the alleged unlawful picketing identified in ruzicka electric complaint.the district court excluded the evidence regarding local conduct at the hilton job site,noting ruzicka electric specifically pled three sites,which did not include the hilton job site.
during trial,the district court allowed local evidence of its prevailing wage complaint against ruzicka electric with the missouri department of labor and industrial relations involving ruzicka electric work on the school district project.the evidence showed ruzicka electric owed in restitution to eight of its employees and in penalties to the school district.local sought to admit this evidence to show local pursued its prevailing wage claim against ruzicka electric after local officials met with school district officials.the district court also allowed local to enter into evidence a settlement agreement between ruzicka electric,local and the nlrb.this settlement agreement was attached to the handbill local distributed at the lindenwood project publicizing its area standards dispute with ruzicka electric.
at the close of ruzicka electric and ruzicka case,the district court entered judgment as a matter of law in favor of local on all claims.ruzicka electric and ruzicka appeal.
ii.discussion 
we review de novo the district court grant of judgment as a matter of law to local.dossett,at.the district court appropriately granted judgment as a matter of law to local if ruzicka electric and ruzicka were fully heard and no legally sufficient evidentiary basis exists for a reasonable jury to find for them on their claims.a.
secondary activity 
section of the lmra provides a private cause of action for a person injured by a labor organization engaged in any activity or conduct defined as an unfair labor practice in section b.section b forbids secondary activity including secondary picketing 
it shall be an unfair labor practice for a labor organization or its agents to threaten,coerce,or restrain any person engaged in commerce or in an industry affecting commerce,where in either case an object thereof is forcing or requiring any person to cease using,selling,handling,transporting,or otherwise dealing in the products of any other producer,processor,or manufacturer,or to cease doing business with any other person,provided,that this clause shall not be construed to make unlawful,where not otherwise unlawful,any primary strike or primary picketing.
b ii b emphasis in original.congress enacted section b ii b because it was concerned with third parties getting involved with labor disputes not their own.nlrb local,int l union of operating eng rs,d.congress focused its concern on the secondary boycott,which was conceived of as pressure brought to bear,not upon the employer who alone is a party to a dispute,but upon some third party who has no concern in it with the objective of forcing the third party to bring pressure on the employer to agree to the union demands.id.at.quotations,citations and footnotes omitted.section b ii b also reflects a concern with protecting labor organizations right to exert legitimate pressure aimed at the employer with whom there is a primary dispute.id.at.thus,a labor organization primary activity is protected even though it may seriously affect neutral third parties.id.only when a labor organization intends to enmesh neutral secondary employers in primary labor disputes between the union and another employer does it violate federal labor law.nlrb constr.laborers union local,cir.
our task is not to scour the record for evidence of how local conduct impacted neutral employers at the job sites at the heart of this dispute,we have no interest in the consequences to neutral employers or to ruzicka electric,for that matter,of local legitimate,primary labor activity.instead,we review the record to determine whether evidence exists showing local engaged in prohibited secondary activity aimed at neutral employers.operating eng rs,at.if local engaged in secondary activity,then it violated federal labor law.although seemingly straightforward in its presentation,we understand our task is not mundane.according to the supreme court,the tapestry that has been woven in classifying such conduct as either primary or secondary is among the labor law most intricate.id.
ruzicka electric argues it presented sufficient evidence to prove local engaged in unlawful secondary activity,that its unlawful activity caused neutral employers at the job sites to stop working,and that the failure of those neutral employers to work compressed the work schedule such that ruzicka electric incurred greater costs to complete its work.local maintains ruzicka electric failed to prove local deliberately coerced neutral employers not to do business with ruzicka electric,and ruzicka electric failed to prove local picketing activity caused ruzicka electric alleged damages.we agree with local,the two main issues concerning the section claims are whether ruzicka electric established local picketing activity was focused on neutral employers and whether that activity,if any,damaged ruzicka electric.
lindenwood project 
ruzicka electric contends it presented sufficient evidence for a reasonable jury to find local engaged in unlawful secondary activity on the lindenwood project.we agree,because the evidence at trial could support a jury finding local encouraged employees of neutral employers not to work at the job sites.lane crane,int l of workers,local union,cir stating picketing will be considered unlawful if any object of the picketing is for an unlawful purpose.the picketing will be unlawful if there is an expectation or a hope or a desire that employees of the secondary employer will be induced or encouraged to take concerted action to quit working behind the picket line in order that a prohibitive secondary effect on the primary employer will occur.quotations and citations omitted.for example,mueller testified local agents asked ironworkers,employees of neutral employers,not to cross the picket line.in addition,ruzicka electric presented evidence that local agents,acting as observers at the neutral gate,engaged in picketing activity,asking neutral employees to refuse to work.if believed,this evidence establishes local engaged in unlawful secondary activity.
ruzicka electric evidence also allows a reasonable inference local picketed the neutral gate,with the resulting inference local engaged in unlawful secondary activity.local decision to picket the neutral gate created a rebuttable presumption it intended to ensnare neutral employers in its labor dispute with ruzicka electric.see kinney int l union of operating eng rs,local,cir see also nlrb int l union of elevator constructors,cir.although local may attempt to rebut this presumption at trial,it has not rebutted the presumption as a matter of law.for instance,the evidence at trial showed local decided to picket the neutral gate based on an arguably inadequate investigation of whether a neutral employer received electrical deliveries through the neutral gate.indeed,the evidence showed a neutral electrical contractor was,and no electrical deliveries were made to ruzicka electric through the neutral gate.in addition,lindenwood faxed a letter to local on july explaining the neutral gate had not been tainted and demanding local cease its unlawful picketing of the neutral gate.although local claims it was not aware of the letter,a jury is better equipped to resolve factual and credibility disputes like this.
finally,ruzicka electric presented evidence local agents actively interchanged observer and picket vests while at the neutral gate.for instance,local agents wore picket vests at the neutral gate until employees of neutral employers left the job site,at which time the agents changed into observer vests.a reasonable jury could decide the purpose for this activity was to force neutral employers off the job site in support of local primary dispute with ruzicka electric.if this conduct occurred,it is unlawful.
without any doubt,local primary labor dispute with ruzicka electric gave local the right to picket ruzicka electric and to place observers at the neutral gate to ensure ruzicka electric was not avoiding the effects of local lawful picket.see,local,int l union of,radio mach.workers nlrb,d nlrb local,a,b,c,d,int l union of operating eng rs,cir.by design,local established procedures to ensure its picketers and observers complied with federal labor law.for instance,local wrote to lindenwood and ruzicka electric about its intent to engage in lawful area standards picketing against ruzicka electric at the lindenwood job site.indeed,this notice allowed lindenwood to establish a system to protect innocent,neutral employers from local dispute with ruzicka electric.local properly promised not to enmesh neutral employers in the labor dispute,and provided written instructions to its picketers and observers on how to act.although local may have intended to comply fully with federal labor law by engaging only in primary activity,we conclude this case presents conflicting evidence about whether local engaged in unlawful secondary activity at lindenwood.thus,ruzicka electric is entitled to have a not whether local violated federal labor law by engaging in unlawful secondary activity at the lindenwood project.
local maintains that,even if ruzicka electric provided sufficient evidence to prove local engaged in unlawful secondary activity,ruzicka electric failed to prove the unlawful activity proximately caused damages.local is correct,ruzicka electric must prove local unlawful secondary activity proximately caused damages,as any damages caused by local lawful,primary activity are not compensable.see pickens bond constr.united of carpenters joiners of,local,cir.although proof of damages can not be speculative or conjectural,mathematical precision is not to a reasonable certainty is sufficient.lesueur creamery,haskon,cir.we conclude ruzicka electric presented sufficient evidence on damages such that a jury could decide the issue without resorting to rank speculation or conjecture.we also reiterate the longstanding and familiar principle that one whose wrongful conduct has rendered difficult the ascertainment of the precise damages suffered is not entitled to complain of the difficulty of exact computation.karlen ray friedman.commodities,cir see also eastman kodak of photo materials.explaining a defendant whose wrongful conduct has rendered difficult the ascertainment of the precise damages suffered by the plaintiff,is not entitled to complain that they can not be measured with the same exactness and precision as would otherwise be possible.thus,we will not accept local argument that its unlawful secondary activity,if any,did not cause ruzicka electric alleged damages.instead,a jury should determine the extent of ruzicka electric damages if the jury determines local violated federal labor law.
school district project 
we also conclude ruzicka electric presented sufficient evidence to prove local engaged in unlawful secondary activity at the school district project.because the same principles discussed above also control our resolution of this issue,we will not belabor our discussion.the evidence permitting this issue to go to a jury focuses on leaving unattended observer vests at the neutral gate.when conducted properly and not associated with a picket,the placement of observers is perfectly legal,such that we can determine no secondary activity exists as a matter of law.see local,at.local claims it left an observer vest unattended only once,but the evidence conflicts on this issue,as ruzicka electric presented evidence that local left observer vests unattended at the neutral gate on ten or fifteen different occasions.when a union engaged in picketing activity at a job site leaves observer vests sitting at a neutral gate ten to fifteen different times,we can not determine the union intent as a matter of law.instead,we leave to a jury the question of local intent in leaving the unattended vests at the neutral gate.
local also claims ruzicka electric failed to prove damages on this claim.as discussed above,we believe the question of damages is better left to a jury 
defamation 
ruzicka electric maintains the district court erred by dismissing its defamation claims,arguing cousin and hepburn statements were defamatory under missouri law.local contends cousin and hepburn statements were merely opinions which could not be defamatory.
to make a submissible claim of defamation in missouri,ruzicka electric must establish the following elements publication,of a defamatory statement,which identifies the plaintiff,that is false,that is published with a requisite degree of fault and damages the plaintiff reputation.sterling rust commc ns.outside of the labor context,we recently had the opportunity to discuss missouri defamation law.see hammer city of osage beach,cir.in hammer,we listed a test for reviewing allegedly defamatory statements to determine whether a plaintiff can survive summary judgment whether the statement is capable of having a defamatory meaning and,if so,whether one or more privileges shields the defendant from legal action.id.at.in addressing the first part of the test,we noted s tatements of opinion,even if made maliciously or insincerely,are afforded absolute privilege under the free speech clause of the first amendment.id.courts determine as a matter of law whether an alleged defamatory statement constitutes a protected opinion or an actionable assertion of fact.id.in making this determination,we ask whether a reasonable factfinder could conclude that the statement implies an assertion of objective fact or merely gives an opinion.id.at quoting ribaudo bauer.
however,within the context of a labor dispute,state defamation law is partially preempted by federal labor law.beverly hills foodland,united food commercial workers union,local,cir.when federal labor law principles are implicated,as they are in this case,a plaintiff asserting a defamation claim must satisfy an actual malice standard similar to that announced in new york times sullivan,d.id.thus,even in the labor context,malicious defamation enjoys no constitutional protection.id.at.consequently,s tate libel and slander actions may be maintained within the context of a labor dispute but only if the defamatory publication is shown by clear and convincing evidence to have been made w
