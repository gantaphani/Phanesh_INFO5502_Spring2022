plaintiff maintain our desert environment mode appeals from the denial of its petition for a writ of mandate seeking to compel defendant town of apple valley town to set aside actions that it took to approve a development project project proposed by real party in interest,pluto development,pluto.mode asserts that the trial court erred when it denied the writ because town did not comply with mandatory provisions of the california environmental quality act ceqa pub.resources code,et prior to approving the project.we disagree and affirm.
facts and procedural history 
after first conducting some preliminary investigations relative to the site,on october,pluto submitted applications to town for permits to construct the project,a million distribution center with related outbuildings,on a site on the southeast corner of dale evans parkway and johnson road in town.at that time,lilburn corporation submitted an initial environmental study for the project finding that it may have a significant effect on the environment and that an environmental impact report eir was required.
on october,town published notices of public hearing,one for consolidating parcels of land,one to amend the general plan and zoning designations for the project site,and another to approve a conditional use permit and a development permit for the project,indicating that no eir was required for these actions.however,within days town realized that the public hearing had been prematurely noticed and prepared a notice of preparation indicating that it would be the lead agency for the preparation of an eir for the project.at the time of the originally scheduled public hearing,it was announced that the items had been tabled and that they would be readvertised for a future hearing date.
lilburn corporation completed a draft eir.a notice of completion and environmental document transmittal form was prepared on march,and was forwarded to the state clearinghouse for distribution.a notice of public hearing was published on march,indicating that the town planning commission would consider the project on may,at in the town council chambers.the notice indicated that the project may have a significant impact on the environment,and that an eir had been prepared and could be reviewed at the town planning commission.another notice published on march,which appears to have been mailed to impacted property owners,further identified the environmental effects as being in the area of aesthetics,air quality,land use and noise,and indicated that comments regarding the development must be received by may.a public notice of availability of the draft eir was prepared on april.a revised public notice of availability was prepared the following day extending the comment period to may.that notice advised of the planning commission hearing on may,and a town council public hearing on june.an additional notice of public hearing for the june,hearing was prepared and published on may.
on may,the planning commission heard public comments and deferred action until may.at that time,after additional opportunity for public comment,the planning commission voted to recommend that the project be approved.
the final eir was prepared in june.on june,findings were prepared that included the adoption of a statement of overriding concerns with respect to seven environmental impacts that could not be reduced to less than significant levels,even with mitigation.
on june,the town council heard public comment and then voted to continue the public hearing to june.at that time the town council heard only positive comments from the public and voted to certify the eir,to adopt the statement of overriding concerns and to approve the project.a notice of determination was prepared for filing with the county of san bernardino on june,indicating that town had approved the project,had made findings,had required mitigation and had adopted a statement of overriding concerns.an ordinance amending the zoning for the project was adopted by the town council on july.
on july,mode filed a verified petition for writ of mandate.it sought to set aside town certification of the eir adoption of a statement of overriding considerations approval of the development permit approval of a general plan amendment and zone change approval of a tentative parcel map and approval of temporary and permanent conditional use permits,all based on town failure to first comply with ceqa.the petition identified nine causes of action including that the project description was inadequate because it did not disclose potential impacts of the project potential significant environmental impacts were not adequately considered or mitigated in the eir mitigation measures were improperly deferred feasible mitigation was not adopted mitigation adopted was uncertain to mitigate environmental impacts requirements for evaluating the adequacy of the water supply were not complied with environmentally superior project alternatives were rejected without substantial evidence the eir failed to consider cumulative and growth inducing impact of the project and the findings regarding significance of environmental impacts,feasibility of mitigation and alternatives,general plan consistency,and in support of the statement of overriding considerations were not supported by substantial evidence.
next,mode sought a temporary restraining order to halt the project pending the outcome of the writ petition.that motion was denied.mode thereafter sought to disqualify the trial court judge under code of civil procedure section.that motion was also denied.then mode filed a request for a preliminary injunction seeking to halt work on the project.the trial court heard argument on the preliminary injunction on december,but did not rule until march,enjoining construction,grading and landscaping until further order of the court.the order was signed on march.
in the meantime,the parties argued the merits of the petition for writ of mandate.however,to allow additional briefing,the trial court continued the hearing.it was at the continued hearing that the preliminary injunction was granted pending the trial court decision on the writ petition.that decision,denying the writ and vacating the injunction,was issued on may.judgment was entered on june.this appeal followed.
discussion 
exhaustion of administrative.mode members objected to the project 
town argues that mode has no standing to seek a writ because it has failed to demonstrate that it exhausted its administrative remedies by presenting its objections to the project during the comment period as required by public resources code section in response,mode first claims that town has failed to file a and therefore can not challenge the trial court ruling that mode had standing to file its petition.however,in order to obtain a reversal of the trial court judgment,mode must demonstrate that the trial court committed prejudicial error.cal,art.vi,code civ.a respondent may,without appealing,seek review of any trial court decision to show that the appellant was not prejudiced for the reasons claimed.code civ.thus,town may raise the issue of mode standing in order to demonstrate that mode was not prejudiced by any error that the trial court may have made in denying its writ on the grounds mode claims.
still,town argument is not persuasive.public resources code section recognizes that its exhaustion requirement is satisfied if a member of an organization formed after project approval objected to approval of the project during the public comment period.pub.resources code,subd.c.it also specifically does not apply if the public agency failed to give the notice required by law.pub.resources code,subd.e.mode invoked both of these exceptions.
in its verified petition,mode identified itself as an unincorporated association of local residents some of whom submitted comments opposing approval of the project.tony thomas,robin brussel,eydie brussel,felice asti and debra hutton were identified as members of mode.the first three presented objections to the project,while the others did not.still,only one member need have objected,and that has been demonstrated.therefore,mode is not precluded from seeking to set aside town approval of the project for failure to comply with ceqa.as this ground is sufficient,we need not discuss mode argument that town failed to give the notice required by law in conjunction with this argument.
grounds upon which mode may challenge certification of the eir 
town also points out that public resources code section,subdivision a allows its approval of the project to be challenged only on those alleged grounds for noncompliance with ceqa that were presented to it orally or in writing during the public comment period.this statute permits any person who objected to raise any ground asserted as an objection by any other objecting party.federation of hillside canyon associations city of los angeles th,d.in their writ petition,mode alleged nine deficiencies in town compliance with ceqa.prior to determining whether mode exhausted its administrative remedies as to these deficiencies,we must again consider one of the exceptions to the requirement that an issue have been raised during the public comment period prior to being raised in a subsequent court challenge.mode asserts that it may raise any issue because town failed to give the notice required by law.pub.resources code,subd.e.
public resources code section,subdivision a provides that any lead agency preparing an eir must notify the public of that fact within a reasonable period of time prior to certification of the eir the notice is required to include the period during which comments will be received on the draft eir the date,time and place of any public meetings or hearings on the project a brief description of the project and its location any anticipated significant environmental effects of the project and the address where the draft eir and its supporting documents may be reviewed.pub.resources code,subd.b.the notice is required to be given to those who have requested it and must be either published in a newspaper of general circulation in the area affected by the project or posted on and in the area where the project is to be located or directly mailed to contiguous property owners and occupants.pub.resources code,subd.b a c.in its opening brief,mode arguments mirror those that it raised below that town notices were deficient in that the project description was inadequate because it did not identify stores,as the end user of the project and in that it did not list the significant environmental impacts of the project.in its reply brief on appeal,mode for the first time claims that the notice was deficient in several other respects.
town notice listed significant environmental impacts 
first,mode failure to raise points below and failure to raise them on appeal prior to the reply brief result in a waiver of those claims.iliff dustrud th,d nemarnik los angeles kings hockey club th,fn,d.we need not discuss them.next,the record demonstrates that the notices town provided met the requirements of ceqa.on march,town prepared a notice of public hearing indicating that the public review period would be from march,through may,days that a public meeting would be held on wednesday,may,at at the town council chambers located at dale evans parkway in apple valley,ca that the project was an approximately square foot warehouse with expansion capabilities of an additional square feet support space to house administrative offices internal area and aerosol product storage.the proposed facility includes a truck maintenance yard,washing and fueling facility and parking and associated dock areas,as well as above and underground fuel,oil and water storage tanks,at the southeast corner of dale evans parkway and johnson road that the project may have a significant environmental impact in the areas of aesthetics,air quality,land use and noise and that the draft eir could be reviewed at any of three listed addresses.thus,the notice contains all of the information required by ceqa.further,despite mode assertions to the contrary,the record indicates that this notice was both published on march,and mailed to a long list of public agencies and property owners on april.this single notice therefore appears to have complied with all of the requirements of public resources code section the fact that it was titled a notice of public hearing and review rather than a notice of availability it appears that town used the former to notify the general public of the eir and the latter to notify government agencies is meaningless.ceqa does not require use of a certain title and the law does not place form above substance.
town also prepared and published a notice of the june,town council meeting.while that notice did not list the specific areas of significant environmental impact,it did indicate that such impacts may exist.it also failed to state the review period,but contained information on the project,the public hearing and the location where the draft eir could be reviewed.in essence,this notice was merely a supplement to the march,notice,informing of an additional hearing date as required by public resources code section,subdivision b.the two notices,in conjunction,appear to have provided all of the information that ceqa requires.
ceqa does not require listing a project end user in the project description required by public resources code section 
next,mode and the attorney general,in his amicus brief,claim that the notice was inadequate because it did not specifically identify as the end user of the project.there are actually two issues involved in this point.the first one deals with what is adequate for the brief description of the proposed project and its location required by public resources code section,subdivision b.the second issue involves the adequacy of the project description in the eir as required by california code of regulations,title,section we will discuss the first issue here and reserve analysis of the second issue for later in this opinion.
there is no case law interpreting the brief description of the proposed project language of public resources code section.therefore,we must determine the legislature intent by applying rules of statutory construction.code civ.that intent is exhibited by the ordinary and plain meaning of the words used.however,if the words are ambiguous,we may consider the ostensible aims to be achieved by the legislation and the legislative history.equilon enterprises consumer cause,cal th,d,allen contracting cal th,d.
the key word here is brief.this is not an ambiguous term.webster third new international dictionary at page defines brief as being short,concise or succinct.concise is defined as being marked by brevity in expression or by compact statement without elaboration or superfluous detail and succinct is similarly defined as marked by brief and compact expression or by extreme compression and lack of unnecessary words and details.id.at.brief is also defined as implying a summary.id.at.thus,in choosing to use that word,the legislature suggested that the project description contained in the public notice need not be as extensive as the description in the eir itself,but need only be a brief,compact summary without elaboration or detail.we can not presume that it intended that the project description do more than necessary to fulfill the purpose of the statute.ultimately,that aim is to alert the public of a project purpose and location so that interested persons may further review and comment upon its potential environmental impacts,if they so desire.it is not necessary then,to effectuate the purpose of the statute that the phrase brief description of the proposed project be defined to require disclosure of the end user of the project.we may not read into a statute more than what the legislature has plainly stated therein.code civ.
the attorney general has cited mcqueen board of directors d,for the proposition that an incomplete and misleading project description can result in a lack of notice so as to eliminate the need to exhaust administrative remedies.in that case,the public entity sought to acquire land that was owned by the federal government.although the public entity was aware that the property was likely contaminated with polychlorinated biphenyls pcb and other toxic substances,it determined that due to the nature of the transaction,it was categorically exempt from performing any environmental review.id.at.the court of appeal held that the public agency had impermissibly divided the project into segments one,the acquisition of the property and two,the investigation and decontamination of the property in order to avoid ceqa review.id.at.this division of the real project into segments was held to have resulted in the inadequate and misleading project description that the plaintiff relied on when interposing initial objections to the acquisition.id.at.no misleading division of the project has occurred here.the omission of a plan for inspection and decontamination of toxic wastes,an issue of clear environmental concern,can not be likened to the omission of an end user name,which of itself can have no possible environmental impact.
thus,we hold that mode has failed to establish that town did not provide the notice required by law.it therefore has not shown that it is excused from exhausting its administrative remedies.as a result,it may only forward those grounds for noncompliance with ceqa that were presented during the public comment period.pub.resources code,subd.a.
issues that mode has standing to address 
adequacy of the eir 
c.the adequacy of the project description 
while there is an issue with respect to mode ability to raise this point,since it never complained to town that the project end user had not been disclosed,the attorney general of california need not comply with the exhaustion of administrative remedies requirement.pub.resources code,subd.d.therefore,we now consider whether,in order to be adequate under ceqa,a project description must contain the identity of the end user of the proposed project.
an eir is an informational document that is meant to provide public agencies and the public in general with detailed information about the effect which a proposed project is likely to have on the environment to list ways in which the significant effects of such a project might be minimized and to indicate alternatives to such a project.citation.laurel heights,supra,cal d at.an adequate project description is important in that it ensures that ceqa goals of providing information about a project environmental impacts to government agencies and the public to allow consideration of mitigation measures and alternatives,will not be rendered useless.county of inyo city of los angeles d.in this way,a project description that is accurate,stable and finite is the sine qua non of an informative and legally sufficient eir.id.at.
the attorney general urges that the project description in this eir is inaccurate because it identifies pluto and not as the project proponent.the argument fails to note the difference between a project and a project.it is common knowledge that projects are often developed without any knowledge of who the will be.if ceqa was to be interpreted as the attorney general suggests,no such projects could ever proceed until all potential were identified and subsequently investigated by the lead agency.in addition to being completely impractical,this interpretation finds no support in the sphere of law and regulation encompassed by ceqa,as we now explain.
once a project has been approved and an eir has been certified,no further eir can be prepared unless substantial changes are made to the project or the circumstances under which it is undertaken,or new information that could not have been known at the time of certification becomes available.pub.resources code.friends of davis city of davis th,d friends of davis establishes that the fact that an end user is unknown at the time the eir for a project is certified does not meet the criteria established by public resources code section.it follows that the identification of an end user is not so significant under ceqa that it must be done in order to comply with the law.
in addition,land use entitlements such as conditional use permits and development approvals run with the land and do not belong to the permittee.malibu mountains recreation,county of los angeles th,d sounhein city of san dimas th,d.and,california code of regulations,title,section provides a categorical exemption from ceqa review for operation,maintenance,leasing,or minor alteration of existing public or private structures,or facilities,involving negligible or no expansion of use beyond that existing at the time of the lead agency determination.thus,had pluto developed the project and then held it out for sale to any interested buyer,no additional ceqa review would have been necessary for the new owner so long as the use was consistent with that that had already been approved.ceqa does not require review of previously approved uses.friends of davis,supra,th at,d.these facts strongly militate against interpreting ceqa to include a requirement that the end user of a project be identified.so long as the project is approved,ceqa has no concern about who uses it.if ceqa compliance required the identification of the project end user,a new eir would need to be considered every time property was sold or a different tenant moved into a building,regardless of the use to which the property was to be put.in addition to the problems listed above,such a requirement also violates the standard of efficiency required by ceqa.pub.resources code,subd.f,tit,subd.g.
perhaps most importantly,ceqa guidelines provide that t he description of the project in the eir shall contain the following information but should not supply extensive detail beyond that needed for evaluation and review of the environmental impact.a the precise location and boundaries of the proposed project shall be shown on a detailed map,preferably topographic.the location of the project shall also appear on a regional map.b a statement of the objectives sought by the proposed project.a clearly written statement of objectives will help the lead agency develop a reasonable range of alternatives to evaluate in the eir and will aid the decision makers in preparing findings or a statement of overriding considerations,if necessary.the statement of objectives should include the underlying purpose of the project.c a general description of the project technical,economic,and environmental characteristics,considering the principal engineering proposals if any and supporting public service facilities.d a statement briefly describing the intended uses of the eir.this statement shall include,to the extent that the information is known to the lead agency,a a list of the agencies that are expected to use the eir in their,and b a list of permits and other approvals required to implement the project.c a list of related environmental review and consultation requirements required by federal,state,or local laws,regulations,or policies.to the fullest extent possible,the lead agency should integrate ceqa review with these related environmental review and consultation requirements.if a public agency must make more than one decision on a project,all its decisions subject to ceqa should be listed,preferably in the order in which they will occur.on request,the office of planning and research will provide assistance in identifying state permits for a project,tit.the guidelines thus do not require that the end user of the project be named in the project description.
neither mode nor the attorney general has pointed us to any ceqa statute or guideline that requires that the end user of the proposed project be identified in order to achieve compliance.considering our standard of review,the fact that naming the end user of the project is not specifically required by law makes it difficult for us to conclude that town abused its discretion in certifying the eir without that information.county of inyo city of los angeles,supra,d at.further,public resources code section specifically states that courts shall not interpret ceqa or the state guidelines in a manner which imposes procedural or substantive requirements beyond those explicitly stated in ceqa or in the state guidelines.italics added.
