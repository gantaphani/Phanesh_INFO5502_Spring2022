in this writ proceeding we consider the validity of a contractual venue selection clause that purports to waive a party right to transfer to a neutral county an action brought by a county against a resident of another county.a construction contract between petitioner arntz builders arntz and real party in interest county of contra costa county provides that any action arising out of the contract would be brought in contra costa county,and expressly waives arntz right to remove the action to a neutral venue under section of the code of civil procedure despite authority holding contractual venue selection provisions to be void,county contends,and the superior court held,that the clause is valid because the contractually selected venue is one of several statutorily permissible counties for the filing of such an action.we conclude that the contractual provision purporting to waive arntz right to transfer the action to a neutral county is nonetheless invalid.accordingly,we shall issue a writ of mandate directing the trial court to transfer the action to a neutral county.
factual and procedural background 
arntz entered into a million contract with county to construct an addition to its juvenile hall.the contract contains a venue selection clause providing that any litigation involving the contract or relating to the work shall be brought in contra costa county.in addition,arntz expressly waive d the removal provisions of code of civil procedure section.county subsequently terminated the contract and filed an action for its breach against arntz in contra costa county superior court.
arntz filed a timely motion to change venue under sections and.arntz,a general partnership with its principal place of business in marin county,asserted that section requires the court,upon motion by either party,to transfer the action to a neutral county alternatively,arntz sought relief under section,subdivision b,which gives the trial court discretion to transfer an action when there is reason to believe that an impartial trial can not be had in the county in which venue is laid.
the trial court denied the motion,reasoning that contractual venue selection clauses are valid except to the extent they purport to fix venue in a location other than that allowed by section,the general venue provision for civil actions.the court concluded that general acceptance robinson cal,general acceptance and alexander superior court th,d alexander,both of which held contractual venue selection provisions to be void,are not controlling,as those cases hold only that contractual venue selection clauses which purport to fix venue in a location other than that allowed by ccp,are void and unenforceable in contrast,the contractual provision in this case,waiving ccp,does not purport to fix venue in a location other than that allowed by the l egislature.ccp is a removal statute and an exception to ccp.citation.there are cases holding that the provisions of ccp may be waived,albeit in the context of failure to timely assert a right of removal.citations.arntz has not presented any case law or statutory authority prohibiting voluntary contractual waiver of ccp venue removal.there is no showing that the contractual provision at issue is either unconscionable,or contrary to public policy.the trial court order does not address the alternative basis for the change of venue motion,section.
arntz filed a timely petition for a writ of mandate in this court,challenging the trial court denial of its motion for change of venue.we stayed all proceedings in the trial court and issued an order to show cause.
discussion 
the issue before us is whether to give effect to a contractual provision waiving the right of a party to transfer to a neutral county an action by a city,county,or local public agency against a nonresident defendant.because the issue involves a pure question of law,our review is de novo.consultants,superior court th,d.
over years ago,in general acceptance,our supreme court held that contractual venue selection clauses are void.general acceptance,supra,cal.at.the plaintiff in general acceptance filed a breach of contract action in san francisco,which was designated in the contract as the venue for any action arising out of the contract.id.at.the defendant moved to change venue to alameda county,where the defendant resided.ibid.under the version of section then in effect,the defendant residence was the only proper venue.see alexander,supra,th at,d.the supreme court affirmed an order granting the motion to change venue.general acceptance,supra,cal.at.in assessing the validity of venue selection clauses,the supreme court adopted the reasoning of the massachusetts supreme judicial court as follows the rules to determine in what courts and counties actions may be brought are fixed upon consideration of general convenience and expediency by general law to allow them to be changed by the agreement of the parties would disturb the symmetry of the law,and interfere with such convenience.such contracts might be induced by considerations tending to bring the administration of justice into disrepute.ibid.
after general acceptance,the validity of venue selection clauses does not appear to have been addressed in a reported california decision until the court of appeal for the sixth appellate district confronted the issue last year in alexander,supra.alexander involved a contractual dispute between private parties,in which the governing contract contained an express stipulation that venue would be in santa clara county,where the plaintiff headquarters were located.th at,d.plaintiff filed suit in santa clara county and,in opposing the defendants motion for a change of venue,relied in part on the contractual provision setting venue in that county.id.at,d.the plaintiff argued that intervening case law had effectively overruled general,that the supreme court had expressly rejected its holding in smith,valentino smith,superior court cal d,smith.in smith,the court held that forum selection clauses are not per se invalid.id.at.the alexander court disagreed that smith overruled general acceptance,concluding that general acceptance is still good law,and remanded the action for the trial court to determine whether venue was properly laid in santa clara county under section.alexander,supra,th at,d.
the court in alexander distinguished between forum selection clauses and venue selection clauses.forum is a place of jurisdiction,in contrast to venue,which is the place where the case will be heard and from which the jury will be selected.alexander,supra,th at,d.under state law therefore a venue selection clause is purely an intrastate issue involving the selection of a county in which to hold the trial.by contrast,a forum selection clause usually chooses a court from among different states or nations,fn.omitted.the court noted that one of the grounds for the holding in general acceptance is that venue selection clauses disrupt the legislature statutory venue scheme.alexander,supra,at,d.by contrast,forum selection clauses,as the court in smith acknowledged,violate no such carefully conceived statutory patterns.alexander,supra,at,d,quoting smith,supra,cal d at.the concern with selecting venue is that parties will disrupt the statutory scheme and bring the administration of justice into disrepute in order to have their cause heard where they believe it will be received most sympathetically.but it is not for the parties or the courts to set venue.that is the role of the legislature.alexander,supra,at,d.the court concluded that general acceptance held that to the extent a venue selection clause disrupts the statutory venue provisions it is void as against the legislatively declared public policy fixing the place for trial.nothing in smith affects that holding.we recognize that no case before or after smith has relied upon general acceptance to strike down a venue selection clause.by the same token,we are not aware of any case in this state that has held such a clause to be enforceable.general acceptance has survived this gap in the law and we are bound to follow it.alexander,supra,at,d.
here,county does not challenge the holding in alexander or ask that we reconsider the continuing validity of general acceptance.instead,county seeks to limit the holdings in those cases,arguing that general acceptance and alexander establish only that a venue selection clause is void if it fixes venue in a county other than one in which venue is proper under the general venue statute.according to county,nothing in general acceptance or alexander suggests that parties may not stipulate in advance as to which of several statutorily permissible venues will be the place for any subsequent litigation.alexander assertedly made this clear when it concluded that s ince the venue statutes themselves declare the public policy of this state with respect to the proper court for an action,agreements fixing venue in some location other than that allowed by statute are a violation of that policy.alexander,supra,th at,d.because contra costa county is one of several counties in which an action founded upon its contract with arntz may be brought county contends that the venue selection clause must be given effect.
we need not decide whether this qualification of general acceptance has any validity with respect to an action between private parties in which proper venue is governed solely by section acknowledging that under section this action was properly filed in contra costa county,the issue that is presented here is the validity of the contractual agreement to waive arntz right under section to transfer the action to a neutral county.as relevant here,section,subdivision a provides that,except for certain actions brought under the family code,any action brought by a county within that county against a resident of another county shall be,on motion of either party,transferred for trial to a county,other than that in which the defendant resides see also fn,ante.the statute is couched in mandatory language,requiring the trial court to transfer an action to a neutral county upon timely application.see delgado superior court d.
the purpose of this provision is to guard against local bias that may exist in favor of litigants within a county as against those from without the county,and to ensure that both parties have a trial on neutral territory.consultants,supra,th at,d.there is no need for a party seeking transfer to demonstrate actual prejudice because the statute is designed to obviate the appearance of prejudice as well as actual prejudice or bias.city of alameda superior court d.a s the statute is remedial in its purpose,it should receive a liberal construction which will promote rather than frustrate the policy behind the law.westinghouse electric superior court cal d.
section has been described as an exception to the general venue rules of section.county of orange superior court th,d.section also has been characterized as a removal statute rather than a venue statute because it does not control original venue.county of san bernardino superior court th,d.a county or other local agency must file an action against a nonresident defendant in a venue that is otherwise proper under the general venue rules.if that venue is in the county suing the nonresident defendant or within which the local agency is located,upon timely application of the nonresident defendant the court must designate a neutral county to which the action will be transferred.see id.at,d.this statutory framework prevents a county or local agency that files suit against a nonresident defendant from unilaterally selecting the neutral county that is most satisfactory to it.ibid.
whether section is characterized as an exception to general venue rules or as a removal statute,it is plainly part of the statutory venue scheme.see alexander,supra,th at,d.both sections and are among the numerous provisions in chapter,title of part ii of the code of civil procedure dealing with the place of trial.while general acceptance and alexander addressed venue selection clauses potentially at odds with section,nothing in either decision limits their application to provisions that contravene only that section.alexander pointed out that smith did not affect general acceptance holding that venue selection clauses are invalid.alexander,supra,at,d,italics added.section is every bit as much a part of the statutory venue scheme as is section.indeed,section applies only except as otherwise provided by law and section is not similarly qualified,so that section is expressly subject to the qualification contained in section.section is the dominant provision and section is the subordinate provision.central contra costa sanitary dist.superior court d.delgado superior court,supra,d at.
county argues that section may be waived,citing several cases in which the removal right granted by section was held to have been waived by failing to seek a timely transfer after the action had been filed.see newman county of sonoma cal d,ventura unified school district superior court th,d delgado superior court,supra,d at.adams superior court d.the argument proves far too much.the right of a party to obtain a change of venue on the ground that an action has not been brought in the proper court under any venue provision,including section,may be lost if the motion for such relief is not timely presented,subd.a hennigan boren d.despite the fact that a party may waive the right to transfer an action from an improper venue by failing to file a timely motion after the action has been instituted,a contractual provision entered before the action has been filed designating an improper venue is nonetheless against public policy and void.general acceptance,supra,cal.at,alexander,supra,th at,d.the fact that the removal provisions of section similarly may be waived by delay,therefore,does not mean that these provisions may be waived by an agreement entered before the filing of the action.
citing federal case law,county points out that the right to remove a case from state court to federal court may be waived by express agreement.see pelleport investors budco quality theatres cir.county argues that the right to remove a case to federal court is no less important than the right to transfer under section,so that waiver of the benefit of section should be equally permissible.the comparison fails,however,because the federal case cited by county involves a forum selection clause,not a venue selection clause.pelleport investors budco quality theatres,supra,at.as the court explained in alexander,the concerns underlying venue selection clauses differ from those underlying forum selection clauses.alexander,supra,th at,d.
county argues that another sentence deep within subdivision a of section contemplates that the parties may stipulate in writing to the place of trial.that sentence reads in that action or proceeding,the parties thereto may,by stipulation in writing,or made in open court,and entered in the minutes,agree upon any county,or city and county,for the place of trial thereof.ibid.in context,this provision of section appears to relate solely to the immediately preceding sentence,which establishes proper venue for personal injury actions against local agencies for injuries occurring within the county.moreover,even if the sentence were interpreted to apply to all actions described in section,it would not validate the clause in county contract.the sentence merely permits the parties to enter a written stipulation i n that action.it does not authorize contractual venue selection clauses entered before an action has been filed.
to support its conclusion that the benefits of section may be waived contractually,the trial court relied in part on subdivision c of section,which provides explicitly that a contract waiving the venue requirements of section,subdivision b,is void and unenforceable.there is no similar explicit provision in section,so that under the maxim expressio unius est exclusio expression of one thing is the exclusion of another the trial court apparently reasoned that the legislature express statement that one set of venue rules can not be contractually waived implies that other venue statutes may be waived by agreement.however,there is nothing in section that expressly prohibits cont
