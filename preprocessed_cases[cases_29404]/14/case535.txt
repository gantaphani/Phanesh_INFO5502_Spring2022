the mitigation fee act,the act was passed by the legislature in response to concerns among developers that local agencies were imposing development fees for purposes unrelated to development projects.ehrlich city of culver city cal th,d.although most of the act is concerned with development fees,it also addresses fees or charges that do not necessarily relate to a development project.utility cost management indian wells valley water dist.cal th,d,utility cost management.the various sections of the act cover fees for development projects,water or sewer connections,and zoning and building permits.this case involves legal challenges to building inspection and permit fees and appropriate remedies when excessive fees are imposed.
section,subdivision a,provides that local agency fees for building inspections and permits may not exceed the estimated reasonable cost of providing the service for which the fee is charged unless the excess amounts are submitted to and approved by a vote of the electorate.section,subdivision a,provides a prospective fee reduction remedy when fees or service charges exceed actual costs and create excess revenues.both sections specify that any judicial challenge to a fee thereunder is subject to the requirements of section,which states that the action or proceeding shall be commenced within days of the effective date of the ordinance,resolution,or motion,subd.a see also,subd.c,subd.e.
sections and,which authorize a refund of any unlawful part of the fees imposed on a development project,are subject to a different statute of limitations period.local agencies must give project applicants written notice of the fee amount,indicating that they have days to protest it,subd.d.any party who files a protest may then file an action attacking the imposition of the fees within days after delivery of the local agency notice,subd.d.
in this case,we determine whether a party who challenges a local agency fees for building inspections and permits under section can state a claim for remedies under both section prospective fee reduction and section refund whether the limitations period of section or section applies to a claim that the local agency building permit fees are excessive and whether a local agency reenactment of the same building permit and inspection fees is subject to challenge under section.in addition,we decide other issues whether local agencies that charge excessive building permit and plan review fees are subject to a penalty for collecting and retaining special taxes without voter approval within the meaning of section and whether local agencies are constitutionally required to conduct annual financial audits to assess whether their fees create excess revenues.we conclude that building permit fees are not fees imposed on a development project.therefore,the applicable remedy and limitations period for excessive building fees claims under section are found in sections and,not in sections and.also,we conclude that a reenactment of the same building permit fee is a modification or amendment of an existing fee or service charge under section,which triggers a new limitations period that local agencies that charge excessive building permit fees are not subject to a section penalty and that local agencies are not constitutionally required to conduct annual financial audits.
factual and procedural history 
because this case comes to us on a demurrer for failure to state a cause of action,we accept as true the facts alleged in plaintiff barratt american,barratt complaint.blank kirwan cal d.
in july,the city of rancho cucamonga city adopted resolution,setting forth a comprehensive fee schedule for various services the city provides.it included a fee schedule for building permits and plan reviews based on the total valuation of work.the charges for building permit fees started at for work valued up to and ended at for work valued up to.each additional in value incurred a fee of.plan review fees were a percentage of the building permit fees.the city building official was authorized to determine the total valuation of work.in december,the city adopted resolution,which modified certain fees set in.the resolution slightly increased,by cents,the building permit fee from for work valued at to.the resolution explained that the new fee was a correction of a previous typographical error.in january,the city adopted resolution,which modified certain fees set in.however,the building permit fee was not changed,except to the extent it was reset at for work valued at.the ordinance apparently reintroduced the typographical error that the ordinance had corrected.
in june,barratt,a real estate developer,began to construct a residential subdivision in the city.in may,barratt sued the city,alleging that the city building permit and plan review fees were excessive,that the city method of establishing those fees was arbitrary and unrelated to the actual cost of the service provided,that the fees were based improperly on the monetary value of the work,and that the building officials had unfettered authority to determine the final valuation component of the fee.the complaint further alleged that,beginning in june,barratt had paid more than in building permit and plan review fees for at least building permits for the construction of homes in the subdivision,that it intended to continue construction until it completed the project,and that the city collectively received more than million per year and more than million total in excess building permit and plan review fees.barratt sought a refund of for the allegedly excessive fees already paid or in the alternative,a refund in excess of,after crediting the city with the reasonable value of services it rendered in issuing the building permits and reviewing barratt plans a writ of mandate compelling the city to apply the excess fee revenues to reduce future fees,subd.a and to perform an annual audit to identify excess fee revenues cal,art.xiii b,subd.b a declaration that the fees imposed were invalid special taxes,resulting in the reduction or forfeiture of property tax revenues,and the invalidation of resolution,subd.e,subd.b.when it filed the action,barratt was midway through the development and sales of the homes in the subdivision.
the city demurred to barrett complaint.the trial court sustained its demurrer without leave to amend,ruling that barratt could not obtain a refund under section because building permit and plan review fees are not development fees within the meaning of that section a writ of mandamus to compel the city to comply with section and to perform an annual audit and fee adjustment was an inappropriate remedy because the timing of any fee review and adjustment is a matter of legislative discretion and declaratory relief under sections and was not an appropriate remedy.instead,the court found that the appropriate remedy for excessively high building permit fees was to challenge the ordinance in a validation action and obtain a prospective fee reduction,as specified in section.that remedy was unavailable to barratt,however,because the statute of limitations period had expired.in addition,the court determined that barratt could not attack the validity of resolution because the resolution only reenacted the fee previously set forth in the resolution and was not a new or increased fee under section.
the court of appeal agreed with the trial court reasoning and result and affirmed the judgment.we granted barratt petition for review.
ii.discussion 
barratt contends that payers of excess building permit fees in violation of sections and have several remedies for those overcharges individual refunds,subd.a application of excess fees to future costs,subd.a and forfeiture of property tax revenues.barratt also claims that to ensure that cities comply with sections,subdivision a,and,subdivision a,they must conduct annual audits.cal,art.xiii we discuss those claims below.
sections,and.
section,subdivision a,permits local agencies to impose building inspection and permit fees not to exceed the estimated reasonable cost of providing the service for which the fee is charged,unless a question regarding the amount of the fee charged in excess of the estimated reasonable cost of providing the services or materials is submitted to,and approved by,a popular vote of of those electors voting on the issue.
section,subdivision a,which also expressly applies to building inspection and permit fees,provides the remedy for unless there has been voter approval,as prescribed by section or,no local agency shall levy a new fee or service charge or increase an existing fee or service charge to an amount which exceeds the estimated amount required to provide the service for which the fee or service charge is levied.if,however,the fees or service charges create revenues in excess of actual cost,those revenues shall be used to reduce the fee or service charge creating the excess.
both sections and require that a ny judicial action or proceeding to attack,review,set aside,void,or annul the ordinance,resolution,or motion authorizing the charge of a fee subject to those sections shall be brought pursuant to section,subd.c,subd.e.
section,subdivision a,provides any judicial action or proceeding to attack,review,set aside,void,or annul an ordinance,resolution,or motion adopting a new fee or service charge,or modifying or amending an existing fee or service charge,adopted by a local agency,as defined in section,shall be commenced within days of the effective date of the ordinance,resolution,or motion.subdivision c of that same section states this section shall apply only to fees,capacity charges,and service charges described in and subject to sections and.
individual refund remedy and limitations period under sections and do not apply to the building permit fees barratt paid.
although barratt agrees that the charges at issue are fees for building inspections and building permits that are subject to sections and,it argues that it does not seek to attack,review,set aside,void,or annul the ordinances under section.instead,it claims that it is protesting the imposition of specific fees on a particular development project,which is governed by the separate protest and refund procedures and remedy and limitations scheme set forth in sections and.
section provides that any party may protest the imposition of any fees,dedications,reservations,or other exactions imposed on a development project,as defined in section,by a local agency by paying the fees and serving a written notice of protest,subd.a,italics added.a local agency must provide a development project applicant written notice of the amount of the fees when imposing them and must indicate that the applicant has days to protest the fees,subd.d.any party who files a protest pursuant to subdivision a may file an action to attack,review,set aside,void,or annul the imposition of the fees,dedications,reservations,or other exactions imposed on a development project by a local agency within days after the delivery of the notice,subd.d.
section provides that any party on whom a fee,tax,assessment,dedication,reservation,or other exaction has been imposed,the payment or performance of which is required to obtain governmental approval of a development,as defined by section,or development project,may protest the establishment or imposition of the fee,tax,assessment,dedication,reservation,or other exaction as provided in section,subd.a,italics added.
barratt argues that it complied with the statutory procedural requirements of sections and by paying the fees and submitting a letter of protest to the city,dated september.the city responds that those sections do not create a refund remedy for excess regulatory fees,such as building permit and plan review fees,because they are not fees imposed on a development project within the meaning of sections and.thus,those sections do not apply here.we agree that barratt refund claim fails because sections and do not apply to the building permit fees it paid.
f ees imposed on a development project,as used in section,refers to fees and a development project as defined in section.a development project is defined as any project undertaken for the purpose of development includ ing a project involving the issuance of a permit for construction or reconstruction,but not a permit to operate,subd.a.a fee is defined as a monetary exaction other than a tax or special assessment that is charged by a local agency to the applicant in connection with approval of a development project for the purpose of defraying all or a portion of the cost of public facilities related to the development project,but does not include fees for processing applications for governmental regulatory actions or approvals,subd.b,italics added.thus,section,by its own terms,applies only to development fees that alleviate the effects of development on the community and does not include fees for specific regulations or services.
on the other hand,government code section applies to a long list of local regulatory fees described in government code sections,and to building,planning,and zoning fees described in section to public facility capacity and connection charges described in section and to building permit fees described in health and safety code sections,and 
here,barratt paid building permit and plan review fees to cover the costs of regulating construction quality and ensuring public safety.see health,subds.c and e.although sections and govern these regulatory fees,they do not qualify as development project fees under section.in addition,the building permit and plan review fees were not made in connection with approval of a development project for the purpose of defraying all or a portion of the cost of public facilities related to the development project,subd.b.they were not fees imposed on development projects in order to finance public improvements or programs that bear a reasonable relationship to the development at issue.utility cost management,supra,cal th at,d.instead,the building permit and plan review fees were simply fees to defray the administrative and enforcement costs of a local regulatory program.see,subd.a,subd.a health,subd.c,fees may not exceed the reasonable cost of providing the regulatory service for which the fee is charged.
although the plain language of the statutes dictates the result here lungren deukmejian cal d,legislative history provides additional authority.the california legislative counsel has similarly concluded that section does not include fees associated with plan check or inspection fees.ops.cal.legis.counsel,development fees.the legislative counsel reasoned that building permit fees are separately authorized under the health and safety code and do not relate to fees in the nature of monetary exactions imposed for the purpose of defraying all or a portion of the cost of public facilities related to a development project as contemplated in the mitigation fee act.id.at.legislative counsel opinions have great persuasive weight,since they are prepared to assist the legislature in its consideration of pending legislation.cal.of psychology providers rank cal d.accordingly,we conclude that the legislature did not intend section to authorize a refund action for overcharges of building permit and plan review fees.
barratt claims that section expands the scope of section protest procedures to cover building permit fees.he argues that a fee paid to obtain approval of a building permit for construction of residential housing qualifies as a fee the payment or performance of which is required to obtain governmental approval of a development,as defined by section,subd.a.section defines development broadly to include the placement or erection of any solid material or structure.
however,section operates not to extend section protest procedures to regulatory fees,but to extend them to taxes and assessments.compare,subd.a any party may protest the imposition of any fees,dedications,reservations,or other exactions with,subd.a any party on whom a fee,tax,assessment,dedication,reservation,or other exaction has been imposed see also,subd.b excluding taxes and assessments from the act definition of fee.in addition,section limits its scope to those fees or taxes that are required to obtain governmental approval of a development,as defined by section,subd.a.
as the city notes,many cities require applicants to pay certain mitigation fees as a precondition to the issuance of a building permit.this building permit process might reasonably be characterized as being required to obtain governmental approval of a development,subd.a.see,trend homes,central unified sch.dist.d.noting that the city of fresno required certain homebuilders to pay school impact fees before becoming eligible for building permits.however,barratt challenges only the city charges for ministerial,regulatory building plan review and construction inspection activities that implement state and local building safety standards.these regulatory services the health and safety code not necessarily relate to a development project,fees imposed on a homeowner addition of a laundry room.they fund a program that supervises how,not whether,barratt may build.thus,the building permit fees in this case were not required to obtain governmental approval of a development,subd.a.
analogously,it has been held that water and sewer connection fees under section that are also included in section are not fees imposed on a development project for purposes of section and thus,are not subject to review under the payment and protest provisions of section.cal.psychiatric transitions,delhi county water dist.th,d cal.psychiatric transitions.the court of appeal reasoned as the supreme court pointed out in utility cost management indian wells valley water dist.cal th,d,the mere fact that fees are imposed in a particular instance in connection with development does not make them fees imposed on a development project for purposes of section.the court stated that development fees are fees imposed on development projects in order to finance public improvements or programs that bear a reasonable relationship to the development at issue.utility cost management,at,d.the fees and charges authorized by section may or may not involve development but the fees and charges are always tied directly to a benefit conferred on the property assessed id.at,d.accordingly,such charges are user fees in the case of connection fees.
by contrast,fees imposed on a development project,as used in section,refers to fees as defined in section,subdivision b.that definition states that a fee is a monetary exaction other than a tax or special assessment that is charged by a local agency to the applicant for the purpose of defraying all or a portion of the cost of public facilities related to the development project,subd.b,italics added.thus,definitionally,a fee subject to the procedure of section does not include a connection fee because it does not pay for public facilities,only for the private party connection to the system.cal.psychiatric transitions,supra,th at,d.
similarly,in capistrano beach water dist.taj development th,d capistrano water dist,the court of appeal held that sewer connection fees paid by a developer to connect its hotel to a sanitation district sewer system were not fees for a development project under section,subdivisions a and b.thus,fees imposed under section could not be refunded.the court noted that the district did not condition the approval of the hotel project on payment of the fee or impose the fee in connection with issuing or approving a permit for development and sections and do not include a refund remedy.capistrano water,supra,th at,d.
in short,a fee does not become a development fee simply because it is made in connection with a development project.cal.psychiatric transitions,supra,th at,d see also utility cost management,supra,cal th at,d.just as fees imposed under section can not be refunded capistrano water,supra,th at,d,fees imposed under sections and can not be refunded under sections and.
moreover,we must construe a statute in the context of the entire statutory scheme of which it is a part,in order to achieve harmony among the parts.devita county of napa cal th,d,people woodhead cal d.section applies specifically to building permit fees and states the remedy for any facial overcharges if however,the fees or service charges create revenues in excess of actual cost,those revenues shall be used to reduce the fee or service charge creating the excess,subd.a,italics added.surplus fees that have been refunded can not simultaneously be paid forward to reduce fees.in other words,permitting both retrospective refund and prospective reduction remedies would allow two different dispersions of the same funds and would create incongruous results.because section applies specifically to building permit fees,it prevails over the more general statutes that might otherwise seem to conflict with it.see san francisco taxpayers bd.of supervisors cal th,d.when read together,sections,and do not authorize a refund remedy for excessive regulatory fees.
barratt argues that depriving individual fee payers,such as itself,of a refund remedy is unfair because a prospective fee reduction remedy only benefits future fee payers collectively.by invoking the protest and refund procedure in section,barratt necessarily claims that such protests are timely up to days after imposition of the fees,subd.d.however,such fee challenges would subject cities to suits for building permit fee refunds at any time well beyond the limitations period set forth in section.this would undermine the purpose of that shortened limitations period,to give public agencies certainty with respect to the enforceability of their fee ordinances and resolutions.utility cost management,supra,cal th at,d.we must apply the statutory scheme as written.barratt concerns are more appropriately brought to the attention of the legislature 
penalty or offset for unauthorized special taxes under section is an inapplicable remedy 
barratt sought declaratory relief under section,asking the trial court to impose a penalty on the city for collecting and retaining special taxes without voter approval.section part of proposition provides that property tax revenues allocated to the local government be reduced by one dollar for each dollar of revenue attributable to an unauthorized special tax.special taxes those imposed for specific purposes must be approved by a vote of the voters.in general,taxes are imposed for revenue purposes,rather than in return for a specific benefit conferred or privilege granted.citations.sinclair paint state bd.of equalization cal th,d,sinclair paint.
barratt alleges that the surplus building permit and plan review fees are unauthorized special taxes,which subject the city to a property tax allocation reduction.however,it provides no authority for the claim that excess regulatory fees constitute taxes.simply because a fee exceeds the reasonable cost of providing the service or regulatory activity for which it is charged does not transform it into a tax.see alamo,board of supervisors d.reverse logic does not compel the conclusion that an allegedly excessive fee was a tax.the specific the exclusive remedy for overcharges.if actual revenues exceed actual costs,the city must make a prospective fee adjustment by using that surplus,in lieu of a fee revenue,to cover future expenses,subd.a.it can not refund the excess or transfer it to the city general fund to replace or augment tax revenue.see health,subd.c local permit fees shall not be levied for general revenue purposes,same.
accordingly,the penalty or offset allowed by section does not apply to barratt claims.see sinclair paint,supra,cal th at,d,special taxes in article xiii a,section,of the california constitution do not include regulatory fees that do not exceed the reasonable cost of providing services necessary to the activity for which the fee is charged and that are not levied for unrelated revenue purposes.
writ of mandate to compel an annual fee revision is not an available remedy under article xiii b of the california constitution.
barratt petitioned for a writ of mandate,alleging that the city caused ongoing injury to barratt,other builders,and consumers by failing to conduct an annual financial audit and adopt a subsequent fee reduction,in violation of article xiii b,section,of the california constitut
