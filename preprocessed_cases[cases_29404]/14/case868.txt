the subdivision map act is the primary regulatory control governing the division of property in california and generally requires that a subdivider of property design the subdivision in conformity with applicable general and specific plans and to construct public improvements in connection with the subdivision under the act,requirements of the subdivider are enumerated,as are the corresponding duties of the local governing body.in many portions of the act,specific time limits are set for action,and correlating consequences are established for failure to meet those time limits.citations.citation.time limits and consequences apply to the duration of tentative maps.the act requires a procedure to mapping a pproval of a tentative map followed by approval of a final subdivision map by the local agency.the tentative map process gives the staff and the approving body flexibility in suggesting acceptable changes to the subdivision before it is finally mapped.citation.the approving agency may grant or deny approval or conditionally approve a tentative map.once approval or conditional approval of a tentative map has been secured,the developer has a specific period of time within which to secure a final map.friends of westhaven trinidad county of humboldt th,d,fn.omitted.the expiration date of the tentative map may be extended by application to the county under section,subdivision e.upon the filing of a timely application for extension,the tentative map is automatically extended for days or until the application for the extension is approved,conditionally approved,or denied,whichever occurs first,subd.e.
in sonoma county the board is charged with the responsibility for approving,conditionally approving or denying tentative maps,requests for extension,and final maps.the board exercises significant discretion with regard to the initial application for approval of a tentative map.the decision of the advisory agency or the legislative body,as the case may be,may involve a total or partial approval,a conditional approval,or a disapproval of the map.the local agency can impose conditions that require the subdivider to construct specified public improvements and to post a bond to ensure their construction,or it can require the subdivider to dedicate a portion of his or her land for public purposes,or to pay a fee in lieu of dedication.it can control the design,construction,and location of streets and rights of way,and of drainage and sewerage facilities,and can require access to public natural resources.the local agency also can require the subdivider to modify the project to reduce adverse environmental effects caused by the development.miller starr,cal.real estate ed,fns.omitted.in the present case,the board held a number of public hearings on sunset application to approve the project and imposed conditions on its approval.

in the present case,in order to comply with the conditions of the tentative approval,sunset has expended over million dollars on the project.it has completed significant improvements to the subdivision,including installation of all roads,a sewer system,and water supply.according to the majority owner of sunset,the final map should have been ready for approval shortly before the trial
