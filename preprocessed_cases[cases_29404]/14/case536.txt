depending on the theory of recovery,a lawsuit alleging a latent defect in the construction of an improvement to real property must be brought within three or four years after the plaintiff discovers the defect,or should have done so.see code civ,subd,subds.b,c regents of university of california hartford acc.indem.cal d,regents.however,a statute established a further general rule that no action for latent construction defects may be commenced more than after substantial completion of the construction project.as enacted by stats,ch.this absolute limitations period applies regardless of when the defect was discovered.regents,supra,at.
cases held that the limitations period for a suit alleging breach of an express or implied warranty is tolled that is,halted and suspended in the defendant promises or attempts to honor the warranty by repairing the defect are pending.relying heavily on these earlier authorities,and in suits not confined to warranty theories,two court of appeal cases concluded that the alternate statute of limitations of section is also subject to tolling for repairs.grange debris box wrecking superior court th,d grange debris cascade gardens homeowners mckellar associates d.cascade gardens.a more recent court of appeal decision disagreed.fnb mortgage pacific general group th,d fnb mortgage.
here the trial court sustained a demurrer without leave to amend and dismissed the action,concluding that the limitations period could not be extended by a defendant promises or attempts to repair.the court of appeal reversed this judgment.the appellate court held that section is subject both to equitable tolling during periods of repair and to equitable estoppel if defendants engaged in conduct that delayed the filing of suit.we granted review to resolve the extent to which the doctrines of equitable tolling and equitable estoppel should apply to the statute of limitations set forth in section.
we agree with fnb mortgage,supra,th,d,that section statute of limitations for latent construction defects is not subject to a general rule of equitable tolling while promises or attempts to repair are pending.a broad rule would contravene the legislature clear intent,at the time it adopted section,to ensure a generous but firm cutoff date for suits.moreover,the extraordinary length of the limitations period set forth in section weighs strongly against the need for such a tolling rule as a matter of fair procedure.
though we thus find no basis for equitable tolling during any period in which the defendant promises or efforts to repair are pending,we do not foreclose application of the distinct doctrine of equitable estoppel.a defendant whose conduct induced plaintiffs to refrain from filing suit within the period might be equitably estopped to assert that the statute of limitations had expired.however,plaintiffs first amended complaint alleges no facts sufficient to establish such an estoppel,and we find no basis upon which to allow a further opportunity to amend.
we will therefore reverse the court of appeal judgment.we will also disapprove the grange debris and cascade gardens decisions insofar as they conflict with the views expressed in this memorandum.
plaintiffs filed their original complaint on august,and a first amended complaint on december,asserting both individual and class claims.the first amended complaint alleged as follows 
the eagles ridge project is a development of homes in antioch.homes and related entities collectively centex,american consolidated industries,and numerous designed,developed,built,sold the eagles ridge homes,or designed,manufactured,sold,installed the windows.the four individual plaintiffs,whose claims typify those of the other class members,are homeowners within the development who bought their houses directly from defendants.the eagles ridge homes suffer from design or manufacturing defects,including leaks in the windows and window systems,that have caused damage to each of the individual residences.these defects were discovered within three years before the lawsuit was filed.they may have developed earlier,but could not have been discovered sooner with reasonable diligence.a s problems resulting from unknown defects were discovered,defendants represented to plaintiffs that they would correct all problems,were experts in the construction field,and would take the steps required to ensure the quality and integrity of the residences.a t various times d efendants have attempted to make repairs or advised plaintiffs that the windows were not defective and not to file a lawsuit.despite their promises and attempts to repair,defendants have not properly completed,reconstructed,repaired restored the windows,interior waterproofing systems,and walls associated therewith.by their conduct,defendants are estopped to assert that the statute of limitations has expired.damages are recoverable on theories of implied warranty,strict liability,and negligence.
defendants demurred on two grounds.they urged the entire action was barred by section limitations period for latent construction defects.they also insisted the complaint class allegations were insufficient.in support of their statute of limitations argument,defendants asked the court to take judicial notice that the notices of completion on the four homes owned by the individual plaintiffs were recorded in november,some and months before plaintiffs filed their original complaint.
in response,plaintiffs urged that the first amended complaint properly pled a class action.with respect to the statute of limitations,plaintiffs argued that the complaint sufficiently alleged both equitable tolling for repairs and equitable estoppel to assert the statute by virtue of defendants conduct that forestalled a timely lawsuit.
on april,the trial court filed its order after hearing on demurrer.the order sustained the demurrer without leave to amend on grounds that the action was barred by the statute of limitations.the order reasoned the parties appear to agree that,unless tolled for about nine months,section limitations period had expired before the complaint was filed for two reasons,the allegations of the complaint are not specific enough to establish a estoppel.first,plaintiffs allege in the alternative that defendants either promised and attempted to repair or denied the defects and made demands not to sue the latter conduct is insufficient to create an estoppel.second,by alleging simply that repairs were attempted at various times,plaintiffs leave open the possibility this conduct occurred after november when the statute of limitations expired unless tolled,and thus was not timely to create a tolling.amendments might cure these factual deficiencies,but amendment would be futile here,because section is a statute of repose,and thus is not subject to equitable tolling for repairs.
plaintiffs appealed,and the court of appeal reversed.unlike the trial court,the court of appeal agreed with those decisions grange debris,supra,th,d cascade gardens,supra,d.that extended equitable tolling for repairs to section,and rejected the contrary reasoning of fnb mortgage,supra,th,d.moreover,the court of appeal concluded,just as section is subject to equitable tolling,the statute also is not immune from equitable estoppel.the court of appeal ruled that plaintiffs had pled grounds for an equitable estoppel,sufficient to survive demurrer,by alleging that defendants repeated promises to repair had caused them to delay filing suit.
we granted centex petition for review we now conclude that the court of appeal judgment must be reversed.
discussion 
equitable tolling.
section,enacted in,provides generally that n o action may be brought against those involved in the design,supervision,or construction of an improvement to real property,or their sureties,for latent defects in the design or construction,or for injury to property caused by such defects,unless the suit is filed within after substantial completion of the project,subd.a.the period begins to run no later than t he date of recordation of a valid notice of completion,subd.g.section shall not be construed as extending the period prescribed by the laws of this state for bringing any action,subd.d.
as we explained in regents,supra,cal d,a suit to recover for a construction defect generally is subject to limitations periods of three or four years,depending on whether the theory is breach of warranty,subd.four years action upon any contract,obligation or liability founded upon an instrument in writing or tortious injury to property,subds.b,c formerly subds,three years trespass or injury to real or personal property.however,these periods begin to run only when the defect would be discoverable by reasonable inspection.regents,supra,at.on the other hand,section imposed an absolute requirement that a suit to recover damages for a latent construction defect be brought within years of the date of substantial completion of construction,regardless of the date of discovery of the defect.regents,supra,at,fn.omitted.the interplay between these statutes sets up a process actions for a latent defect must be filed within three years or four years of discovery,but in any event must be filed within ten years of substantial completion.north coast business park nielsen construction th,d.
section states several situations in which the year limit shall not apply see text discussion,post,but it contains no provision for extension of the limitations period during periods of repair.nonetheless,plaintiffs urge that the statute is subject to equitable tolling while the defendant promises or attempts to remedy a defect are pending.
equitable tolling is a doctrine which operates independently of the literal wording of the code of civil procedure to suspend or extend a statute of limitations as necessary to ensure fundamental practicality and fairness.addison state of california cal d,addison see also bollinger national fire ins.cal d,bollinger.this court has applied equitable tolling in carefully considered situations to prevent the unjust technical forfeiture of causes of action,where the defendant would suffer no prejudice,lambert commonwealth land title ins.cal d,lambert claim against title insurer accrues upon insurer refusal to defend title,but limitations period is equitably tolled until underlying title action is resolved com.insurance superior court cal d,period to sue on casualty insurance policy begins upon inception of the loss,but is equitably tolled from timely notice of loss until insurer denies claim addison,supra,at,period for state court suit against public agency was equitably tolled during plaintiffs timely federal suit raising both federal and state claims elkins derby cal d,elkins period for personal injury action was tolled while plaintiff,acting in good faith,pursued worker compensation remedy against defendant bollinger,supra,at,period to sue on fire insurance policy was tolled while timely prior action,erroneously dismissed as premature,was pending.
as these cases illustrate,the effect of equitable tolling is that the limitations period stops running during the tolling event,and begins to run again only when the tolling event has concluded.as a consequence,the tolled interval,no matter when it took place,is tacked onto the end of the limitations period,thus extending the deadline for suit by the entire length of time during which the tolling event previously occurred 
the legislature may preclude equitable tolling by stating its intention to disallow tolling under any circumstances not enumerated in the statute.laird blacker cal th,d,laird attorney malpractice limitations statute providing that limitations period shall in no event be tolled except as specified,subd.a see also,battuello battuello th,d battuello special limitations statute for surviving action against deceased person,providing that period shall not be tolled or extended for any reason except as specified,subd.b.
moreover,equitable tolling should not apply if it is inconsistent with the text of the relevant statute united states beggerly,d quiet title action must commence within years after discovery of government title claim generous limitations period,beginning only upon discovery,already provides for equitable tolling,and further tolling not warranted see also lampf gilbertson,d where federal securities fraud action was subject to limitations of one year from discovery,or three years from violation,period was outside limit not subject to tolling or contravenes clear legislative policy abreu svenhard swedish bakery d.equitable tolling would violate policy of uniform federal statute of limitations for suits claiming violations of labor contracts.
as with other general equitable principles,application of the equitable tolling doctrine requires a balancing of the injustice to the plaintiff occasioned by the bar of his claim against the effect upon the important public interest or policy expressed by the limitations statute.addison,supra,cal d.
plaintiffs insist that in construction defect cases,the rule of tolling for repairs is well established.as they observe,two court of appeal decisions,grange debris,supra,th,d,and cascade gardens,supra,d,have concluded that the limitations period of section is tolled while the defendant promises or attempts to remedy the defect are pending.for this holding,grange debris relied solely on cascade gardens.cascade gardens,in turn,invoked the clear authority of several earlier decisions,aced plumbing cal d,aced,mack hugh comstock associates d.mack,and southern cal.enterprises walter d,southern cal.enterprises.cascade gardens,supra,at.
but aced,mack,and southern cal.enterprises are inapposite to the question before us.they predate the adoption of section,and were narrowly concerned with how to apply the limitations period for express or implied warranties.these cases simply confirmed that the statute of limitations for breach of warranty does not begin to run until discovery of the defect,and is thereafter tolled during periods the warrantor claims he can honor the warranty by repairing the defect,and attempts to do so.aced,supra,cal d,radiant heating system plaintiff stipulated he was relying solely on a theory of implied warranty mack,supra,d.radiant heating system plaintiff alleged breach of express warranty southern cal.enterprises,supra,d,installed carpet plaintiff alleged breach of express warranty.
aced,mack,and southern cal.enterprises did not consider how tolling should apply to an alternative,overarching limitations period later enacted specifically for suits alleging defects in the construction of improvements to real limitations period measured,regardless of discovery,from the date the work of construction was completed.contrary to the assumption of cascade gardens,supra,d,those earlier cases are not persuasive authority for extending a tolling for repairs rule to section 
in fnb mortgage,supra,th,d,the court of appeal properly discounted the precedents,rejected the holding of cascade gardens,and concluded that the limitations period of section is not equitably tolled for repairs.fnb mortgage reached the correct result 
at the outset,the plain language of section suggests that the limitations period is not subject to extension for reasons not stated in the statute itself.unlike subdivision a of section,the attorney malpractice limitations statute see laird,supra,cal th,d,see also,malpractice by health care provider,subd.b surviving action against deceased person,section does not ban nonstatutory tolling in so many literal words.but the structure and tone of section do differ markedly from california limitations statutes.the latter simply provide the various periods prescribed for the commencement of specified actions.see also.by contrast,section declares,in stentorian terms,that n o action for latent construction defects may be brought more than after the substantial completion of the development or improvement,subd.a,italics added.
section itself provides several clear exemptions from the limit.the limit does not apply to actions for personal injury,subd.a,subd.a limitation period for patent construction defects.it does not apply to suits based on willful misconduct or fraudulent concealment,subd.f,subd.a both permitting tolling for fraud or intentional concealment.it does not apply to a for indemnity by one participant in the project against another,if the himself was sued directly within the period,subd.c valley circle estates vtn consolidated,cal d,valley circle estates.it can not be asserted by any person in actual possession or control of the improvement at the time any deficiency therein constitutes the proximate cause of the damage for which recovery is sought,subd.e.an argument thus arises,under the maxim inclusio unius est exclusio alterius,that the legislature intended to omit other exceptions.
but if doubt remains from the language of section,it is dispelled by reference to the goal of this special limitations statute.t he purpose of section is to protect contractors and other professionals and tradespeople in the construction industry from perpetual exposure to liability for their work.regents,supra,cal d,fn,wagner state of california d.the statute reflects a legitimate concern that expanding concepts of liability could imperil the construction industry unless a statute of limitations was enacted.moseley abrams d.such concerns legitimately include the prohibitive cost of insurance against a perpetual and never ending risk.sandy superior court d.
the history of section confirms that the statute is the result of general legislative concern about the economic effects of indefinite long tail defect liability on the construction industry.section was a response to considerable expansion of california common law of construction liability.traditionally,a builder sole liability for his finished product was on an express or implied warranty,which required privity between plaintiff and defendant,and the builder thus owed no duty to third persons once the owner accepted the improvement.see,kolburn walker d.in the and,these limitations gave way to the principle that a builder may be liable to those foreseeably injured or damaged by construction defects under theories of negligence dow holly manufacturing cal d,oakes mccarthy d.oakes and,at least in the case of a mass home developer,strict tort liability kriegler eichler homes,d.
at the same time,courts increasingly recognized ways to extend the limitations periods for suits on construction defects.as indicated above,decisions confirmed that the time to sue on a construction warranty was tolled while promises or attempts to repair were pending.aced,supra,cal d,mack,supra,d.contemporaneous cases held that the statutes of limitations for the burgeoning theories of construction defect recovery did not begin to run until the defects were or should have been discovered see,aced,supra,at,warranty avner longridge estates d.strict liability oakes,supra,d.negligence see also regents,supra,cal d,or while they were fraudulently concealed,balfour,guthrie hansen d.
in,the legislature responded in part to these developments by adopting section.stats,ch.this statute provides that recovery for death,injury,or damage caused by a patent deficiency,subd.a,italics added in the design,supervision,or construction of an improvement to realty must be sought within four years after substantial completion of the improvement,subds.a,c.a patent deficiency is defined as one apparent by reasonable inspection,subd.e.notwithstanding the general rule,if an injury to person or property occurs in the fourth year after completion,suit may be brought within one year after the injury,but no more than five years after completion,subd.b.the limitations period provided by section can not be asserted by one who actually possesses or controls the property at the time the deficiency causes the actionable damage or injury,subd.d.single family residences are exempt from the limit,subd.f.
despite this legislation,members of the building industry still faced exposure to liability for all defects in their past projects so long as these defects remained undiscovered and undiscoverable by reasonable inspection.on april,assemblyman powers introduced assembly bill reg.sess,seeking to limit suits for latent construction defects to an period after substantial completion.after numerous amendments in committee,the bill was placed in the inactive file at the request of assemblyman powers,and it died there on august.see assem.final hist.reg.sess.
in october,the assembly interim committee on judiciary,chaired by assemblyman hayes,convened a public hearing to determine if a statute of limitations can be drafted in actions for hidden or latent construction defects.assem.judiciary interim com.hearing on application of the doctrine of strict tort liability to building construction,committee hearing.building industry representatives testified at length that the trend toward expanded and defect liability was producing a risk for which insurance was available only at prohibitive cost,if at all,thus threatening the industry economic health.com.hearing.
appended to the committee hearing transcript was a survey of construction defect limitations periods adopted in other states.according to this survey,the applicable statutes of limitations ranged from four to twelve years after substantial completion of the projects in question.com.hearing,appen.b.
on april,assemblyman hayes introduced assembly bill reg.sess.assembly bill,which,as amended,became section.see assem.final hist.reg.sess.as originally drafted,assembly bill provided that suits for latent construction defects,other than those based on willful misconduct or fraudulent concealment,would be subject to a limitations period of six years after substantial completion.assem.bill,as introduced.a subsequent assembly amendment removed personal injury actions from the limitations period,increased the period to,and provided for beyond the period by persons sued directly within that time.assem.amend.to assem.bill,july.
the survey of the laws of other states was made part of the legislative record of assembly bill in both the assembly and the senate.see assem.com.on judiciary,analysis of assem.bill,appen.b com.on judiciary,analysis of assem.bill as amended.analyses of the bill consistently described it as bar ring or p rohibit ing latent defect suits brought beyond the proposed limitations period.assem.com.on judiciary,analysis of assem.bill,com.on judiciary,analysis of assem.bill as amended,assemblyman james hayes,letter to governor reagan,requesting signature on assem.bill enrolled bill mem.to governor on assem.bill.
thus the legislature,faced with a developing body of common law on the subject,carefully considered how to provide a fair time to discover construction defects,and to sue upon such defects if necessary,while still protecting a vital industry from the damaging consequences of indefinite liability exposure.for latent deficiencies,the lawmakers rejected shorter periods in favor of a limit in the upper range of those previously adopted by other jurisdictions.moreover,by placing exemptions in the latent defect statute for personal injury,willful misconduct,and fraudulent concealment,the legislators demonstrated an intent to pick and choose the particular exceptions they wished to allow and those particular aspects of the prior case law they wished to embrace.the implication arises that except as stated,and for important policy reasons,the legislature meant the generous period set forth in section to be firm and final.
significantly,the adopters of both sections and knew that the case law had engrafted a tolling for repairs rule onto the limitations period for breach of a construction warranty.yet,despite the legislature careful attention to other issues raised by prior court decisions,it did not provide a repairs extension in either section or section.
on the contrary,the legislature specified in section that whatever limitations periods might otherwise apply,no action for injury to property arising from latent construction defects may be brought more than years after substantial completion of the project,subd.a see also,subd.d regents,supra,cal d.the inference arises that regardless of whatever tolling rules might otherwise apply within the period,the legislature intended no such extension of the absolute regents,supra,at,limit itself.the legislative failure to ratify tolling for repairs under these circumstances is another indication that a judicial doctrine extending the limitations period for this reason would contravene the intent of section.
in one common circumstance,an equitable tolling rule would directly undermine the statutory purpose.as we have seen,section allows one sued directly within the statutory period to for indemnity against another project participant,even if the statute of limitations for direct actions has by then expired,so long as the is filed before a trial date has been set,subd.c,subd.b,subd.b valley circle estates,supra,cal d.thus,potential indemnitors can never be entirely certain they are safe once the period passes.but they should generally be able to assume that any suit which may give rise to against them was filed within after substantial completion of the project.
a general rule that the limitations period is tolled for repairs would destroy such an assumption.as was emphasized in fnb mortgage,supra,th,d,such a rule would allow a n unsuspecting subcontractor to be sued for indemnity,long after the statute limitations period had passed,and despite the absence of any action alleging defects within the period,simply because the indemnitee the subsequent was deemed to have tolled the period by offering or attempting to repair and was thus subject to subsequent suit.id.at,d.the unsuspecting subcontractor s caught in this net might include architects and engineers who,as in the example provided during the committee hearing,had since retired,but were still forced to maintain expensive errors and omissions coverage to meet their potential long tail liability for alleged defects in projects completed many years in the past.
hence,the purpose of section,as revealed by its history,weighs against a judicially imposed rule that the limitations period set forth in this statute is tolled for repairs.on the other hand,countervailing policies of practicality and fairness do not compel such a rule.if the defendant acts or promises occurred well before expiration of the limit,an extension at the end of the limitations period is unnecessary to protect the plaintiff rights and because the limitations period provided by section is so exceptionally long aas,supra,cal th,d,it indicates the legislature effort to provide,within the strict statutory period itself,a reasonable time to discover,adjust,and,if necessary,sue upon latent defects.given the particular considerations that led the legislature in to seek a generous but firm cutoff date for construction defect lawsuits,further extension of the period by judicial fiat is not warranted.
this case contrasts starkly with those in which we found a special need for equitable tolling.in each prior instance,the brevity of the literal limitations period would otherwise have caused forfeiture of a cause of action,or other undue hardship,despite the plaintiff diligent efforts to pursue his claim in a correct and orderly way.in lambert,supra,cal d,absent equitable tolling,literal application of the statute of limitations for actions against a title insurer would have forced the insured to defend the underlying title action,at his own expense,and simultaneously to at his own separate action against the title company for failure to defend.id.at.in,supra,cal d,the insured had only one year after inception of the loss to sue his insurer for coverage,but that period could easily run out while the insurer,having received a timely notice of loss,conducted the investigation necessary to determine whether the claim should be paid or denied.id.at.
in bollinger,supra,cal d,the insured did sue within the months allowed by the policy,but that action was dismissed,after the limitations period had expired,on a false technicality urged by the insurer.id.at.similarly in addison,supra,cal d,the plaintiffs did sue in federal court within the period for actions against public agencies.just after this brief limitations period expired by its literal terms,the government defendant moved to dismiss the federal action,whereupon plaintiffs immediately filed their state court complaint.as plaintiffs feared,the federal court subsequently dismissed their federal causes of action and declined to retain their pendent state claims,leaving them without a remedy unless equitable tolling was applied.id.at.
finally,in elkins,supra,cal d,the plaintiff,acting in good faith,first pursued a timely worker compensation remedy against the defendants,thereby foreclosing resort to tort litigation.after the statute of limitations for personal injury actions had expired,the worker compensation referee found that the plaintiff was not the defendant employee within the meaning of the worker compensation statutes,and was thus not entitled to benefits.the plaintiff then promptly filed his court action.we applied the california principle that the running of the limitations period is tolled w hen an injured person has several legal remedies and,reasonably and in good faith,pursues one.citations.id.at.
no similar issues are presented here.because plaintiffs had three or four years after discovery,and up to ten years after the project completion,to bring their suits for latent construction defects,many of the concerns that might warrant equitable tolling are ameliorated.indeed,were we to conclude that the generous limitations period of section is equitably tolled for repairs,despite the absence of any specific indication that the legislature so intended,the implication would arise that all statutes of limitations are similarly tolled or suspended in progress while the parties make sincere efforts to adjust their differences short of litigation.we find no such general principle in california law.
plaintiffs and the dissent urge several reasons why section should be equitably tolled for repairs.none is persuasive.
first,it is urged that if the legislature had intended to disallow equitable tolling of section,it would have done so expressly,as in sections health care malpractice and,subdivision a attorney malpractice see laird,supra,cal th,d,see also battuello,supra,th,d limitations period for surviving action against deceased person.but an express legislative ban on equitable tolling is not the only circumstance in which courts will decline to apply this judicially developed doctrine.as is explained above,they will also do so where,as here,tolling would contravene the legislative purpose.of course,the result we reach under section is consistent with our construction of the similar but shorter statute of limitations one year from discovery or four years from wrongful act or omission,whichever occurs first for attorney malpractice,subd.a see laird,supra,cal th,d.
next,plaintiffs and the dissent assert that the legislative history of section focuses exclusively upon the problem of a statute of limitations that began only when the plaintiff discovered the defect.there is no indication,plaintiffs assert,that the legislature meant to preclude the defendant from tolling the limitations period,once begun,by his own voluntary action.
but while delayed discovery was an important issue,the legislators concerns,as indicated above,were broader.they sought to ensure ample time to discover and sue upon latent construction defects,while still establishing a predictable period within which the construction and insurance industries must make provision for such suits.and though a defendant who promises or undertakes repairs might be said to control the time for suit against him,his conduct,as we have noted,would have consequences for unsuspecting coparticipants in the project,whose exposure to indemnity liability would thereby be extended.
plaintiffs and the dissent emphasize our statement in regents,supra,cal d,that section is not a substantive limit upon the plaintiff cause of action regents,supra,at,but merely an ordinary,procedural statute of limitations id.at,to which,they assert,equitable tolling may thus properly apply.however,their reliance on regents is misplaced.the issue there was whether the surety on a contractor not among the persons specifically mentioned in the could claim the protection of section limitations period.the regents majority answered that question no.id.at.the dissenters argued that because section was a substantive limit on legal rights and duties,it precluded the plaintiff,in any suit brought after expiration of the period,from proving a contractor breach of duty which the surety must make good.regents,supra,at,conc.dis.opn.of clark,see id.at.the majority rejected that contention id.at,but nothing in the holding of regents compels a conclusion that where section does apply,it should be subject to equitable tolling 
plaintiffs and the dissent note that the legislature has not expressly disagreed with the equitable tolling rule set forth in cascade gardens,supra,d,and grange debris,supra,th,d but see fnb mortgage,supra,th,d.of course,the legislature has not revisited section at all since,well before these cases were decided there are many reasons why the legislature fails to address intervening judicial constructions of a statute,including inattention,press of other business,and trust in the courts to correct their own errors.people king cal th,d,county of los angeles workers comp.appeals bd.cal d.hence,legislative inaction is a weak reed upon which to lean.harris capital growth investors xiv cal d,quoting troy gold industries,occupational safety health appeals bd.d,fn.here,mere legislative silence fails to dissuade us from our conclusion that section is not subject to equitable tolling for repairs.
plaintiffs suggest that equitable tolling for repairs protects homeowners from unscrupulous builders who might otherwise make false promises or repairs in order to forestall suit until after the period had passed.tolling for repairs is also good policy,plaintiffs maintain,because it encourages resolution of construction defect disputes without resort to the courts.but a tolling rule seems just as likely to discourage a potential defendant from undertaking voluntary remedial efforts before the limitations period expires.if his efforts failed,he would only have prolonged the already lengthy period during which he was exposed to suit 
moreover,if a plaintiff can show,in a particular case,that the defendant promises or attempts to repair prevented a timely suit,the defendant may be equitably estopped from invoking the protection of the statute of limitations.see discussion,post.thus,an automatic rule of equitable tolling is not necessary to counteract fraudulent assurances of repair.
we therefore conclude that the limitations period set forth in section is not subject to tolling in progress while a potential defendant promises or attempts to repair the defect are pending.the distinct question remains whether a defendant may nonetheless be equitably estopped to assert this statute of limitations if he prevented a timely suit by his conduct upon which the plaintiffs reasonably relied 
equitable estoppel.
plaintiffs assert that even if equitable tolling does not apply,their first amended complaint states facts which should estop these particular defendants from relying on the limitations period of section.plaintiffs invoke the venerable principle that o ne can not justly or equitably lull his adversary into a false sense of security,and thereby cause his adversary to subject his claim to the bar of the statute of limitations,and then be permitted to plead the very delay caused by his course of conduct as a defense to the action when brought.carruth fritch cal d,quoting howard west jersey eq.
equitable tolling and equitable estoppel are distinct doctrines.tolling,strictly speaking,is concerned with the point at which the limitations period begins to run and with the circumstances in which the running of the limitations period may be suspended equitable estoppel,however,comes into play only after the limitations period has run and addresses the circumstances in which a party will be estopped from asserting the statute of limitations as a defense to an admittedly untimely action because his conduct has induced another into forbearing suit within the applicable limitations period.equitable estoppel is wholly independent of the limitations period itself and takes its life from the equitable principle that no man may profit from his own wrongdoing in a court of justice.battuello,supra,th,d,quoting bomba belvidere,cir.thus,equitable estoppel is available even where the limitations statute at issue expressly precludes equitable tolling.leasequip,dapeer th,d attorney malpractice statute of limitations battuello,supra special limitations period for surviving actions against deceased person.
one aspect of equitable estoppel is codified in evidence code section,which provides that w henever a party has,by his own statement or conduct,intentionally and deliberately led another to believe a particular thing true and to act upon such belief,he is not,in any litigation arising out of such statement or conduct,permitted to contradict it.see hills,chopstix dim sum cafe takeout iii,th,d.but a n estoppel may arise although there was no designed fraud on the part of the person sought to be estopped.citation.to create an equitable estoppel,it is enough if the party has been induced to refrain from using such means or taking such action as lay in his power,by which he might have retrieved his position and saved himself from loss.where the delay in commencing action is induced by the conduct of the defendant it can not be availed of by him as a defense.vu prudential property casualty ins.cal th,d,vu,quoting benner industrial acc.com.cal d,italics omitted see also ginns savage cal d.
accordingly,if one potentially liable for a construction defect represents,while the limitations period is still running,that all actionable damage has been or will be repaired,thus making it unnecessary to sue,the plaintiff reasonably relies on this representation to refrain from bringing a timely action,the representation proves false after the limitations period has expired,and the plaintiff proceeds diligently once the truth is discovered vu,supra,cal th,d,the defendant may be equitably estopped to assert the statute of limitations as a defense to the action 
the court of appeal concluded that plaintiffs first amended complaint adequately pled the prerequisites of equitable estoppel.according to the court of appeal,plaintiffs alleged in their complaint that centex had repeatedly promised to repair the damage to their homes.based on these allegations,plaintiffs argued centex was equitably estopped to assert the statute of limitations as a defense because centex promises caused them to delay filing suit t hese allegations were sufficient to overcome a demurrer based on the statute of limitations contained in section.
we disagree.the complaint sole allegation on this issue is that at various times defendants have attempted to make repairs or advised plaintiffs that the defective windows were not defective and not to file a lawsuit,but have not properly repaired the leaking windows and associated damage,and are therefore estopped to assert that plaintiffs have not commenced this action in a timely fashion.
this is insufficient.contrary to the court of appeal reasoning,the complaint is devoid of any indication that defendants conduct actually and reasonably induced plaintiffs to forbear suing within the period of section.there is no suggestion that the repair attempts alleged,if successful,would have obviated the need for suit.moreover,for all that appears,the various times at which defendants alleged conduct occurred were times well before the statute of limitations ran out,or even,as the trial court suggested,after it had expired.and there is no claim that the inadequacy of these repairs,or the falsity of defendants alleged no defect representations,remained hidden until after the limitations period had passed hence,plaintiffs have pled no facts indicating that defendants conduct directly prevented them from filing their suit on time.accordingly,the first amended complaint establishes no basis to estop defendants from asserting that plaintiffs causes of action are barred by the statute of limitations.
amendment of complaint.
as noted above,the trial court sustained defendants demurrer to plaintiffs first amended complaint without affording plaintiffs an opportunity to amend.the court found,among other things,that the complaint failed to state facts sufficient to estop defendants from asserting that the statute of limitations had expired.the court conceded that amendment might cure the purely factual deficiencies,but it ultimately reasoned that tolling for repairs was simply not available,as a matter of law,to extend the limitations period of section.
in reversing,the court of appeal determined that both tolling and estoppel were available,and that the first amended complaint was sufficient on both theories.we,on the other hand,have concluded that while section limitations period is not tolled for repairs,defendants might be estopped under particular circumstances to invoke this statute of limitations.however,we have agreed with the trial court that the current complaint fails to state sufficient facts to establish such an estoppel.
without stressing the point,plaintiffs have urged at all stages that if their complaint is deficient,but could be remedied by additional factual allegations,a chance should be afforded to assert such facts.the question thus arises whether plaintiffs should be allowed an opportunity to amend to state facts sufficient to set forth an equitable estoppel.in the specific circumstances of this case,we conclude the answer is no.
of course,i t is axiomatic that if there is a reasonable possibility that a defect in the complaint can be cured by amendment,a demurrer should not be sustained without leave to amend.citations.minsky city of los angeles cal d.but the particular history of this case persuades us there is no reasonable possibility plaintiffs can state credible facts to support an equitable estoppel.
we realize that after the trial court sustained defendants demurrer to the first amended ruling at issue did offer more specific estoppel allegations in a proposed second amended complaint.this proposed complaint made express claims that,from the time plaintiffs purchased their homes until expiration of the limitations period,defendants engaged in a pattern of falsely promising repairs,or making sham repairs they knew would fail,and then refused to respond further once the period had passed,all with the purpose and effect of inducing plaintiffs to forbear suing within the statutory time.the trial court rejected the proposed complaint,both as untimely and on the incorrect assumption that if section could not be tolled for repairs,equitable estoppel was equally unavailable.
but even if the new allegations of the proposed second amended complaint were technically sufficient to establish an estoppel,several circumstances negate any inference that these new assertions had a substantial basis in fact.in the first place,the gravamen of the new defendants promises and attempts to repair continued throughout the entire period,that plaintiffs were thereby induced to forbear suing until the period expired,and that defendants then abruptly refused further have been within plaintiffs personal knowledge at the time they filed their lawsuit.no reason appears why these assertions,if true,were not presented sooner.
doubt about the credibility of the new allegations is heightened by developments in this court.during oral argument,plaintiffs counsel was asked what additional facts,not included in the first amended complaint,could be asserted to support a theory of equitable estoppel.at a minimum,counsel could have referred us to the claims set forth in the proposed second amended complaint.he did not do so.instead,he responded only that repairs promised or attempted by defendants at any time during the period gave rise,as a matter of law,to a form of implicit reliance by plaintiffs that defects in the construction of plaintiffs homes would be remedied.this,counsel argued,should extend the statute of limitations by a time equivalent to the period during which repairs were pending.in short,counsel simply reiterated a theory of equitable tolling which we have rejected in this opinion.
under these circumstances,we are convinced there is no reasonable possibility plaintiffs can assert new,credible facts suggesting that defendants are equitably estopped to assert the statute of limitations for latent construction defects.accordingly,no basis appears to allow a remand for purposes of amendment 
conclusion 
equitable tolling does not apply to the statute of limitations set forth in section.the court of appeal decisions in grange debris box wrecking superior court,supra,th,d,and cascade gardens homeowners mckellar associates,supra,d,are disapproved to the extent they concluded otherwise.moreover,plaintiffs have failed to plead facts that would equitably estop defendants from asserting this limitations period,and there appears no reasonable possibility the deficiency can be remedied by credible amendment of the complaint.the trial court thus correctly sustained defendants demurrer to plaintiffs first amended complaint without leave to amend,and dismissed the action.the court of appeal erred by overturning the judgment of dismissal.the judgment of the court of appeal is therefore reversed.
i respectfully dissent.i can not join the majority in rejecting application of equitable tolling to the limitation on actions for latent construction defects code civ,accordingly,i would affirm the judgment of the court of appeal.second,while i agree with the majority that in an appropriate case a defendant may be equitably estopped to assert that section limitation has expired,i disagree that there is no reasonable possibility plaintiffs in this case can allege sufficient facts to establish such an estoppel.consequently,i would allow plaintiffs an opportunity to amend their complaint in order to correct any deficiencies the majority purports to identify.
statutes of limitations are not so rigid as they are sometimes regarded.bollinger national fire ins.cal d.it is well established that statutes of limitation are not to be applied inflexibly where equity and justice favor the application of equitable tolling,and suspension of the running of a particular statute will not frustrate its purpose of preventing surprise through the revival of stale claims.see elkins derby cal d.for instance,t he statute of limitations is tolled where one who has breached a warranty claims that the defect can be repaired and attempts to make repairs.aced plumbing cal d,aced.another established application of the general repudiated by the been that,i n cases involving construction defects the statute of limitations is tolled during each period the defendant attempts to repair the defect.witkin,cal.procedure ed.actions.
the majority argues that the purpose of section,as revealed by its history,weighs against a judicially imposed rule that the limitations period set forth in this statute is tolled for repairs.on the other hand,countervailing policies of practicality and fairness do not compel such a rule,ante,d at,at.i disagree.as justice richardson long ago explained in a unanimous opinion for this court,the equitable tolling doctrine fosters the policy of the law of this state which favors avoiding forfeitures and allowing good faith litigants their day in court.addison state of california cal d,addison.
as its opinion nowhere specifies the elements of equitable tolling,the majority leaves the inaccurate impression that,unless we in this case categorically bar that remedy in construction defect cases,it will appear by judicial fiat,ante,d at,at or happen automatically whenever a potential defendant promises or attempts to repair the defect are pending id.at,at.the majority misdescribes the law.courts do not enjoy unfettered discretion to toll a statute of limitations.rather,application of the doctrine of equitable tolling requires timely notice,and lack of prejudice,to the defendant,and reasonable and good faith conduct on the part of the plaintiff.addison,supra,cal d at.
according to the majority,the plain language of section suggests that the limitations period is not subject to extension for reasons not stated in the statute itself,ante,d at,at.i discern no such suggestion.section does not mention tolling,equitable or otherwise.the omission is significant had the legislature meant to preclude equitable tolling,it easily could have said so,as it has in other statutes of limitation.see no event shall toll limit on actions against health care providers except those specified,same for attorney malpractice actions,subd.b limit on actions on liability of a deceased person shall not be tolled or extended for any reason except as specified in certain code sections.
thus,contrary to the majority,equitable tolling in this case is not inconsistent with the text of the statute.see,ante,d at,at.the majority in any event is not actually relying on section plain language,but,rather,on its perception of that statute structure and tone,ante,d at,at,which the majority characterizes as stentorian ibid.such observations are at best irrelevant,since,as the majority concedes,the tolling remedy at issue is a general equitable one which operates independently of the literal wording of the code of civil procedure.addison,supra,cal d at,see,ante,d at,at.
the majority also advances a legislative intent argument,based on the legislature asserted failure when enacting section to provide an express repairs extension,despite knowing that case law had earlier engrafted a tolling for repairs rule onto the limitations period for breach of a construction warranty and its asserted careful attention to other unspecified issues raised by prior court decisions,ante,d at,at.but in california it is established that the running of the statute of limitations may be suspended by causes not mentioned in the statute itself bollinger national fire ins,supra,cal d at,and the legislature is presumed to have been aware of that principle when it enacted section people seneca ins.cal th,d.
framing the legislative intent argument somewhat differently,the majority asserts the legislature silence respecting equitable tolling when enacting section bespeaks its intent to bar application of that doctrine in this context.we can rarely determine from the failure of the legislature to pass a particular provision what the intent of the legislature is with respect to existing law.ingersoll palmer cal d.for that reason,we should not presume the legislature intended to overthrow principles of law unless such intention is made clearly to appear either by express declaration or by necessary implication juran epstein th,d.
the majority does not deny the legislature has acquiesced for many years in cascade gardens homeowners mckellar associates d.cascade gardens and grange debris box wrecking superior court th,d grange debris,cases confirming that courts may apply the doctrine of equitable tolling to section.see cascade gardens,supra,at.grange debris,supra,at,d.sixteen years ago,cascade gardens held on the basis of c lear authority that under certain circumstances and where principles of equity and justice allow,section is subject to equitable tolling while repairs are undertaken.cascade gardens,supra,at,citing aced,supra,cal d at,mack hugh comstock associates d.mack,and southern cal.enterprises walter d,southern cal.enterprises.as the majority concedes,the legislature has never expressly disagreed with cascade gardens or taken any action to overrule or limit its holding.see,ante,d at,at.accordingly,it would be reasonable for us to presume the legislature is aware of the judicial construction and approves of it.see people williams cal th,d,people hallner cal d.
the majority,however,seeks to repudiate cascade gardens on grounds that three cases on which that court relied are inapposite because they were breach of warranty cases that predate the adoption of section,ante,d at,at,discussing aced,supra,cal d,mack,supra,d,and southern cal.enterprises,supra,d.but that aced,mack,and southern cal.enterprises were decided before section was enacted is irrelevant,as cascade gardens relied on these cases not for any conclusion respecting section legislative history or wording,but solely as authority for the proposition that repairs,such as those undertaken by the defendants there toll statutes of limitations as a matter of law cascade gardens,supra,d at.the majority does not dispute that aced,mack,and southern cal.enterprises so held.
the majority characterizes cascade gardens authorities as narrowly concerned with how to apply the limitations period for express or implied warranties,ante,d at,at,but that does not tell the whole story.while cascade gardens cited warranty cases,it did so not for peculiarly principles,but,rather,as cases involving or discussing construction defects,defective products,and other breaches of warranty in which the defendant attempts to repair the defect witkin,cal.procedure,supra,actions.for example,the mack opinion expressly addressed tolling of other code of civil procedure sections relating to the tortious injury or damage to person or property mack,supra,d at.considering the application of these statutes and concluding the proper one to apply was tolled during the entire period when the respondents attempted to repair the heating plant involved in the case see also cascade gardens,supra,d at,fn.analogizing mack.in aced,although we cited several cases showing that construction contracts ordinarily give rise to an implied warranty aced,supra,cal d at,we also noted the rule that t he statute of limitations is tolled when one who has breached a warranty claims that the defect can be repaired and attempts to make repairs.id.at.and the court of appeal in southern cal.enterprises actually was at pains to distinguish the case of the typical warranty southern cal.enterprises,supra,d at,from the rule governing that case,which it stated as if the seller promises that something shall happen or shall not happen to the goods within a specified future time,the promise though it may be called a warranty can not be broken until that time has elapsed and until then the statute will not begin to run id.at,see also id.at.in sum,the reasoning of cascade gardens and the warranty cases on which it promises to repair extend the limitations periods for suits on construction defects,ante,d at,at,describing,inter alia,aced and mack is fully applicable in this case.
pointing to section express exceptions,the majority invokes the maxim inclusio unius est exclusio alterius,apparently to suggest that,by including express statutory exceptions,the legislature meant to displace established,generally applicable equitable exceptions.see,ante,d at,at.the majority does not develop the argument,perhaps realizing that the cited maxim,while helpful in appropriate cases,is no magical incantation,nor does it refer to an immutable rule.california fed.savings loan city of los angeles cal th,d.as the court of appeal pointed out,a recognized exception to the maxim arises when its application would conflict with legal principles that the legislature has not expressly repudiated.juran epstein,supra,th at,d see also battuello battuello th,d.accordingly,as the court of appeal concluded,the presence of enumerated exceptions in section does not imply legislative intent to exclude equitable tolling.
confirming trial courts discretionary access to equitable tolling,contrary to the majority,would not undermine the legislative purposes underlying section.see,ante,d at,at.the majority lengthy recitation of section legislative history confirms the statute is the result of general legislative concern about the economic effects of indefinite long tail defect liability on the construction industry,ante,d at,at,but it ultimately does not support the majority position.plaintiffs argue persuasively that the legislature primary aim when enacting section was to eliminate generalized application of the discovery rule in construction defect litigation.retention of equitable tolling would not undermine section impact on the perceived evils of that rule,because,as the majority acknowledges,a defendant who promises or undertakes repairs is generally able to control the time of any suit against it.see,ante,d at,at.
ultimately,the majority can point to but one involving the unsuspecting which it can credibly claim an equitable tolling rule would undermine the statutory purpose.see,ante,d at,at.the majority objection,however,depends on the questionable assumption that subcontractors responsible for defects generally will neither participate in nor be informed about repairs contractor defendants might promise or undertake.common sense suggests that such a circumstance,if it ever occurs,is likely to be the exception.in any event,the majority does not persuade me this theoretical possibility should drive our construction of section.
as we long have understood,section is an ordinary statute of limitations,subject to the same rules as other statutes of limitations.regents of university of california hartford acc.indem.cal d.one such generally applicable rule has been that statutes of limitations may be subject to equitable tolling during periods of repair.cascade gardens,supra,d at.given the legislature acquiescence in cascade gardens and its progeny,the absence of an express reference to equitable tolling in section affords no justification for barring that generally available remedy in construction defect cases.i conclude that equitable tolling of section to protect homeowners from unscrupulous builders and to encourage amicable resolution of construction defect disputes should remain available in appropriate cases when plaintiffs can demonstrate the remedy required elements.
i agree with the majority that a defendant whose conduct induces plaintiffs to refrain from filing suit within the statutory period may,depending on the circumstances,be equitably estopped to assert that section limitation on latent construction defect actions has expired,ante,d at,at.the majority concludes that plaintiffs first amended complaint alleges insufficient facts to establish such an estoppel.id.at,at.assuming that conclusion is correct,i would allow plaintiffs an opportunity to amend their complaint.
the majority correctly notes that plaintiffs did offer more specific estoppel allegations in a proposed second amended complaint.this proposed complaint made express claims that,from the time plaintiffs purchased their homes until expiration of the limitations period,defendants engaged in a pattern of falsely promising repairs,or making sham repairs they knew would fail,and then refused to respond further once the period had passed,all with the purpose and effect of inducing plaintiffs to forbear suing within the statutory time,ante,d at,at.it is axiomatic that if there is a reasonable possibility that a defect in the complaint can be cured by amendment or that the pleading liberally construed can state a cause of action,a demurrer should not be sustained without leave to amend.minsky city of los angeles cal d.the majority acknowledges this axiom see,ante,d at,at,but fails to apply it.
conceding that plaintiffs proposed allegations may be technically sufficient to establish an estoppel,the majority nevertheless denies plaintiffs that remedy,partly on the ground that plaintiffs belated presentation of the proposed second amended complaint gives rise to doubt about the credibility of its allegations,ante,d at,at.but elsewhere the majority acknowledges that plaintiffs have urged at all stages that if their complaint is deficient,but could be remedied by additional factual allegations,a chance should be afforded to assert such facts.ibid.at,at,italics added.
the record contains a declaration,submitted to the superior court by one of plaintiffs counsel,stating that only five days after defendants demurrer was granted without leave to amend did counsel become aware,through conversations with another attorney,of the facts plaintiffs proposed to allege in their second amended complaint.moreover,we previously have stated,in a case where the defense of estoppel set out in the amendment was known for a considerable time before the trial,that the fact the new matter set up by the amendment was well known to the party when he filed his original pleading was no good reason why he should not have been permitted to amend.tolbard cline cal,see also d pleading.the majority on the other hand cites no authority for its apparent implication that plaintiffs failure to supply a reason why the second amended complaint was not presented sooner,ante,d at,at is grounds for denying them an opportunity to amend their complaint,nor do i know of any such authority.to the contrary,a ny judge,at any time before or after commencement of trial,in the furtherance of justice,may allow the amendment of any pleading.
the majority also professes doubt about the credibility of the new allegations for the reason that,when plaintiffs counsel was asked at oral argument what additional facts,not included in the first amended complaint,could be asserted to support a theory of equitable estoppel,he responded that repairs promised or attempted by defendants at any time during the period gave rise,as a matter of law,to a form of implicit reliance by plaintiffs,thus reiterating a theory of equitable tolling,rather than specifically referring us to the claims set forth in the proposed second amended complaint,ante,d at,at.the majority concludes that this omission and the proposed amendment timing negate any inference that these new assertions had a substantial basis in fact.ibid.the conclusion does not follow.after all,the majority does not claim that plaintiffs abandoned or repudiated the allegations of the proposed second amended complaint,nor,indeed,did plaintiffs do so.
i am aware of no requirement that an issue or position that has been briefed before this court must be reiterated at oral argument in order to be preserved,nor of any principle that counsel who is nonresponsive to the courts question concerning a position is deemed to have abandoned that position.in addressing the topic of reliance before us,plaintiffs certainly were entitled to argue implicit reliance and even to reiterate their tolling theory,without being deemed to abandon the alternative,and perfectly consistent,position respecting amendment that they have urged at all stages of this,that if their complaint is deficient,but could be remedied by additional factual allegations,a chance should be afforded to assert such facts,ante,d at,at.in accordance with our liberal rules respecting amendment of the pleadings see,i would afford plaintiffs that opportunity.
for the foregoing reasons,i dissent.
all further unlabeled statutory references are to the code of civil procedure.
section continues to apply fully to many construction projects,including all nonresidential projects,but certain categories of residential construction,including common interest developments and residential units first sold after january,are subject to separate,more recent legislation affecting the applicable limitations periods for suit upon latent defects in those projects,et,see further discussion,post.the homes at issue here were first sold before january,and no party has suggested they are part of a common interest development.hence,as the parties do not dispute,section applies to this case.
the trial court never expressly ruled on defendants request for judicial notice of the november completion notices on plaintiffs homes.however,as the trial court indicated,there seems no dispute that plaintiffs suit is untimely under the statute of limitations except for the possibility of equitable tolling or equitable estoppel.
no other defendant has appeared on appeal,either in the court of appeal or in this court.the california building industry association,the national home builders association,and the civil justice association of california have filed amicus curiae briefs in this court on behalf of centex.
as the text indicates,tolling extends the limitations period no matter when the tolling event occurred.this produces generally fair results where,as in the usual equitable tolling situation,the underlying limitations period itself is quite short.see text discussion,ante and post.but where a lengthy limitations statute such as section is at issue,automatic tolling bears a far less direct relationship to fundamental fairness.the facts of cascade gardens,supra,d,demonstrate the point.there,a
