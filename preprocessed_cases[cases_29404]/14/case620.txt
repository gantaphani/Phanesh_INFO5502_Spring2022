introduction 
attorneys who jointly represent clients in the same action owe a duty of undivided loyalty to each of their clients and are subject to disqualification if an unwaivable conflict exists arising from the joint representation.we address whether a may enforce this duty of loyalty and move to disqualify opposing counsel.in this case,the parties seeking disqualification were not present clients,former clients,or prospective clients,and they had no prior confidential relationship with opposing counsel.they moved to disqualify opposing counsel graham associates,and bruce graham,a member of the firm graham,from jointly representing their adversaries,appellants jim and maartje burman the burmans and ted kipers.the moving parties acknowledge that their motion is not based upon california law,but rather on what they refer to as a minority view in colyer smith d,permitting a to move to disqualify opposing counsel.while the decision of a federal district court is not binding on this court,we do not read colyer minority rule as dispensing with the standing requirements.here,the,moving parties have no legally cognizable interest in graham undivided loyalty to his clients.therefore,the moving parties lacked standing to bring this motion to disqualify.we reverse the disqualification order.
factual and procedural background 
this is a dispute that began on the internet when homeowner maartje burman posted comments criticizing great lakes construction.she later retracted her comments but redirected her internet criticism to hampton builders,the contractor hired to remodel the burmans residence.the dispute moved from the internet to the courts and expanded to several parties directly and indirectly involved in the burmans remodeling project.
background giving rise to the disqualification motion 
the burmans hired the draftsman planning and design,mike trifunovich,and scott christiansen to prepare drawings and engineering specifications for their remodeling project.based upon these prepared plans,the burmans hired hampton builders.hampton builders hired kipers as a subcontractor.kipers subcontract contains an indemnification provision,which is the basis of the disqualifying motion 
a.the complaint 
hampton builders and great lakes filed suit against the burmans,alleging libel in connection with maartje burman internet postings breach of contract for the balance due under the contract and on common counts to recover for hampton builders services on the remodeling project.
b.the burmans and kipers 
the burmans filed a against great lakes,as the alter ego of hampton builders,hampton builders,mike ross,faramarz moshfegh,and harvey stern.the burmans alleged that hampton builders failed to perform the terms of the contract,abandoned the project,and failed to pay kipers who placed a lien on the project and stopped work.the burmans further alleged that the project was plagued with numerous building code violations arising from the design and substandard workmanship.the burmans asserted causes of action against hampton builders and great lakes for breach of contract,negligence,and fraud.they also sought to rescind the contract with hampton builders.
the burmans asserted causes of action for breach of contract and negligence against the draftsman planning and design,alisha spears,mike trifunovich,and scott christiansen,based upon the allegedly defective plans.
kipers asserted causes of action in the against hampton builders for breach of an oral contract,and against both hampton builders and great lakes for common counts.he did not bring a contract cause of action.
hampton builders 
hampton builders then filed a against kipers,alleging breach of contract,interference with contract,express contractual indemnity,equitable indemnity,and declaratory relief.hampton builders alleged that pursuant to the subcontract,kipers agreed to supervise the project,obtain all permits,schedule and be present for inspections,and guarantee all subcontractor work,labor,and materials for a period of one year from the date of completion.
hampton builder express contractual indemnity cause of action against kipers is based upon the indemnification provision in the subcontract.the indemnification provision states subcontractor shall indemnify and save harmless contractor from and against any and all suits,claims,actions,losses,costs,penalties and damages,or whatsoever kind or nature,including attorneys fees,arising out of,in connection with,or incident to subcontractor performance of this agreement.
the motion to disqualify opposing counsel from jointly representing the burmans and kipers 
kipers deposition testimony triggers a purported conflict 
hampton builder counsel believed kipers responses during his deposition revealed he had not been informed about the potential conflict arising from graham dual representation of kipers and the burmans.the specific testimony concerned kipers understanding of the indemnity provision in his subcontract,and his written discovery responses addressing insurance coverage.this testimony,according to opposing counsel,revealed an actual conflict.
kipers admitted that under the terms of the subcontract,he oversaw the project and supervised the subcontractors.kipers also acknowledged that the subcontract contains an indemnification provision.counsel read the indemnification provision into the record,and after a series of objections and questions,which were interrupted by a request to go off the record,kipers testified okay.you do understand that,for example,you would be responsible for paying our legal fees it would be legal fees,damages,damages for the burmans do you understand that yes.
kipers also answered questions inconsistently with his written discovery responses.he testified that he had insurance coverage,even though he did not notify his insurance carrier of the lawsuit,but his responses to form interrogatories stated he did not have insurance to cover this incident.he also testified,for example,that he did not tell the burmans that hampton builders failed to pull a mechanical permit,but his response to a request for admission stated the opposite.
b.the disqualification motion is granted 
following kipers deposition,hampton builders and great lakes collectively hampton,and the draftsman planning and design,mike trifunovich,and scott christiansen collectively designers moved to disqualify graham based upon what they believed was an actual conflict in the joint representation.designers attorney conceded the general rule that a does not have standing to disqualify counsel,but argued colyer smith,supra,d,applied.
the burmans and kipers challenged hampton and designers standing to move to disqualify graham and also maintained no conflict existed in the dual representation.graham attested that he had secured written waivers of conflicts of interest from each of my clients that is,burman,burman,and kipers as a prophylactic measure.these waivers were offered,but not submitted,to the trial court.
the trial court granted the motion stating in its minute order motion to disqualify bruce graham and graham associates is granted.the burmans and kipers obtained a stay of the disqualification order to file a writ,and on the same day filed a notice of and a writ of supersedeas.after we imposed an initial stay to review the writ,we determined the matter did not warrant the issuance of a writ of supersedeas to stay the order disqualifying graham.
discussion 
we must determine whether a legal exception permits hampton and designers to disqualify graham from jointly representing the burmans and kipers based upon a conflict that implicates the duty of loyalty owed to graham client.we conclude that no exception exists which permits a without a legally cognizable interest to disqualify opposing counsel.since hampton and designers do not have any legally cognizable interest in the duty of loyalty owed to graham clients,they have no standing to move to disqualify graham.
standard of review 
our review requires us to consider whether there is a legal basis for the trial court disqualification order.generally,a trial court decision on a disqualification motion is rev
