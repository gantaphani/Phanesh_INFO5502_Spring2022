in this diversity action,defendants turner construction company and b c steel,appeal a jury verdict finding them negligent and awarding plaintiff eugene elliot damages for personal injuries he suffered while assisting in the launch of a pedestrian bridge.we exercise jurisdiction pursuant to and affirm in part and reverse in part.
turner construction was hired as the general contractor for construction of invesco field at mile high stadium in denver,colorado.as part of the construction,the company was required to place a temporary pedestrian bridge across the platte river to accommodate pedestrian traffic.turner construction entered into a rental agreement with mabey bridge and shore for the component parts for the bridge.mabey agreed to provide a site demonstrator elliot for three days during construction of the bridge.turner construction also subcontracted with b c to construct and launch the bridge.
as site demonstrator for the project,elliot testified that his job responsibilities included 
go ing to a job site and show ing the contractor basically how the bridge was put together,how a launch was enacted,what equipment is suggested as far as what you would use to push or launch the bridge with,making sure that the bridge is put together correctly,mak ing sure that all the bolts are tight and sort of an inspector,basically.
app.ii at.he testified that prior to a typical job,he would prep the contractors on the tools and equipment needed and make sure everybody had everything together.id.at.additionally,he would go to the site and demonstrate how to correctly build and launch the bridge,and discuss which launch method should be used for the bridge in question.as his job responsibilities suggest,elliot function was in part as a consultant and in part as an inspector.he testified that as the panels were hooked together,he would climb up and down throughout the bridge,checking and making sure that all th e pins had the retaining clips on,all the bolts were tightened,all the pieces were in the right place facing the right way,not upside down,or so on.id.at.he stated that thorough inspection was his job and that,in the hours before the launch,he inspected the bridge again and held a meeting to let everybody know what to expect and what going to go on.id.at.
other workers corroborated elliot testimony regarding his job responsibilities.john goodrich,the project superintendent on the invesco field construction,testified it was his understanding that elliot was there to help direct the erection of the bridge,of putting the parts and pieces together.app.iii at.according to goodrich,elliot was there to assure that the quality of the bridge being put together was up to mabey bridge standards,and he offered help and advice to the actual iron workers that put the pieces and parts together.id.similarly,william farmer,b c foreman iron worker in charge of overseeing assembly of the bridge for b c,testified that during the week of the launch,elliot observed us working and ma de sure we were doing it right,putting it together.id.at.
the bridge was launched on august.it was decided that a launch would be employed.under this procedure,the bridge is constructed in one complete unit.rollers are placed on the edge of the launching side and the bridge is pushed percent across the water.just before the point where the bridge weight would cause it to tip into the water,a crane on the other side of the river lifts the front of the bridge and pulls it across while a bulldozer pushes the bridge from the launching side.when the bridge is nearly across the river,it is lifted from the rollers and set down.
when the launch began,elliot was on the side of the river where the bridge was launched.the bridge was suspended in air over the river with a crane on the other side of the river attached to a corner of the bridge by a nylon strap.elliot observed that the retaining wall which was supporting the crane on the other side of the river was beginning to collapse,causing the crane to begin to tip sideways.he saw bud boyd,owner of b c,standing between the crane and the bridge,attempting to remove the nylon strap attached to the corner of the bridge.at this time,the bridge was about twenty feet across the water and four feet in the air.elliot was concerned that if boyd removed the nylon strap,the bridge would fall into the water.elliot decided to walk across the bridge to tell boyd to stop.when he was on top of the bridge,he gave the osha signal,not to move anything,id.at,but the bridge moved and elliot fell.as a result,elliot sustained numerous pelvic injuries,including a severed urethra.
elliot filed a negligence action against turner and b c in colorado state court alleging negligence and negligent supervision,and seeking damages turner and b c removed the action to federal court.b c moved for summary judgment arguing it owed no duty to elliot because it was not foreseeable that elliot would walk across the bridge as it was being moved by the crane.turner also moved for summary judgment claiming elliot claims were barred by the colorado worker compensation act because turner was a statutory employer as defined in.a.the court denied both motions for summary judgment and the case proceeded to a jury trial.the jury returned a verdict for elliot against turner construction and b c,finding damages in the amount of for economic losses,for injuries,and for permanent impairment.the jury found that each construction,b c,and percent of the fault.turner renewed its motion for judgment as a matter of law and filed a separate motion for new trial.b c filed a motion for judgment as a matter of law,or in the alternative,for reconsideration of the court denial of its motion for summary judgment.the district court denied the motions and entered judgment against defendants,requiring each to pay.
in a diversity action,we apply the substantive laws of the forum state,including its choice of law rules.new york life ins.k n energy,cir.here,the forum state was colorado.under colorado choice of law rules,the law of the state with the most significant relationship to the claims will be used.morgan united air lines.applying these principles,the parties do not dispute that colorado law applies to elliot tort claims.
statutory employer status under colorado law 
turner construction contends it was elliot statutory employer,as defined by,and was therefore immune from suit.the determination of whether a person or entity is a statutory employer is a question of fact.virginians heritage square smith.however,whether a legal conclusion based upon undisputed facts is correct is a matter of law.id.this court reviews de novo a trial court determination of state law.salve regina college russell,d.
the primary purpose of the colorado workers compensation act is to provide a remedy for injuries,without regard to fault.finlay storage tech.through an interrelated set of provisions,t he statutory scheme grants an injured employee compensation from the employer without regard to negligence and,in return,the responsible employer is granted immunity from negligence liability.id.to be afforded this immunity,an employer must be a statutory employer as defined by the act.id.section a provides the starting point for determining whether a party qualifies as a statutory employer 
any person,company,or corporation operating or engaged in or conducting any business by leasing or contracting out any part of all of the work thereof to any lessee,sublessee,contractor,or subcontractor shall be construed to be an employer as defined in articles to of this title and shall be liable to pay compensation for injury or death resulting therefrom to said lessees,sublessees,contractors,and subcontractors and their employees or employees dependents.
a.relying on this language,the district court concluded that turner construction was not a statutory employer because it did not fall within section with regard to its dealings with mabey.app.iv at.the court read the statute as only covering those situations where mabey was a lessee,sublessee,contractor,or subcontractor.id.at.the court found that mabey leased the temporary pedestrian bridge to turner construction and,therefore,was a lessor to turner,not a lessee from turner.id.at.the court reasoned that,because the statutory employer definition does not extend to those circumstances where the employee of a lessor is injured,turner construction was not a statutory employer.as a result,the court permitted elliot tort suit to proceed against turner construction.
on appeal,turner construction contends the district court erred in its overly strict reading of a and should have focused instead on the actual relationship between turner construction and elliot.under colorado law,the test for whether an alleged employer is a statutory employer is whether the work contracted out is part of the employer regular business as defined by its total business operation.finlay,at.this test is satisfied where the disputed services are such a regular part of the statutory employer business that absent the contractor services,they would of necessity be provided by the employer own employees.id.at.in determining whether this test is met,courts should consider the elements of routineness,regularity,and the importance of the contracted service to the regular business of the employer.id.at.
in analyzing statutory employer status,courts have been guided by colorado rule that the workers compensation act is to be liberally construed to accomplish its humanitarian purpose of assisting injured workers and their families.garner vanadium of america,see also stewart united states,cir.thus,courts have liberally construed the workers compensation act to find statutory employer status in a wide variety of cases and have not made the determination a function of whether the equipment accompanying the plaintiff was leased to the.see,san isabel ass n,bramer,holding employee of aircraft service under contract to make aerial inspection trips of power lines was statutory employee of electric association pioneer constr.davis,noting when plaintiff leased a truck and attending driver,it became statutory employer of the driver while driver was on duty and driving the truck rowan vail holdings,d,holding ski manufacturer was skier statutory employer when skier was killed while testing skis for manufacturer subsidiary because,absent employing the skier,the manufacturer would have to hire its own employee to test the skis.instead,the approach has been to find that a party is a statutory employer and thus required to pay workers compensation to the downstream injured employee as long as the employee services are necessary and routine to the employer regular business.see buzard super walls.
turning to the case at bar,we conclude the district court erred when it concluded turner construction was not elliot statutory employer.first,we do not read the text of the statute,when applied to the employment relationship at issue here,as barring the conclusion that turner construction was elliot statutory employer.the district court unduly emphasized the fact that mabey leased the bridge to turner construction and permitted this fact to control its analysis of turner construction legal relationship with elliot.mabey was a lessor with respect to the component parts of the bridge,but a subcontractor to the extent it assisted turner c through elliot in constructing and launching the bridge.employees of subcontractors are explicitly covered by the act.
second,under colorado law,we are required to apply the test set forth in finlay to determine whether the work turner construction contracted to mabey employees was part of turner construction regular business as defined by its total business operation.we are cognizant of the fact that its regular business did not include fabricating temporary pedestrian bridges.however,as elliot concedes,t here is no question that erecting bridges is a regular part of turner business.aple.br.at.it was not unusual for a major construction company involved in a large project to need employees with expertise in bridge assembly and construction.see finlay,stating a computer company normally would need cleaning services melody homes,lay,stating a construction site normally would need security.stated another way,absent elliot expertise and assistance,turner construction would have had to hire its own employee to study the bridge design and assembly and advise and oversee its construction and launch.
finally,we decline to adopt the district court interpretation of a because such an interpretation would be contrary to a liberal construction of workers compensation laws to provide workers compensation coverage.see finlay,at stating statutory employer statute should not be interpreted to bar the recovery of an injured worker who is unable to show negligence and whose primary employer is uninsured and financially irresponsible.we conclude turner construction was elliot statutory employer and,thus,was immune from suit.
as turner construction is immune from suit,the remaining issues,which both turner and b c have raised,are now relevant only to b b c contends that the district court erred in admitting evidence of b c miscues leading up to the launch of the bridge in including a sudden emergency instruction and in concluding b c owed a duty of care to elliot and that his injuries were foreseeable 
prior bad acts evidence 
b c contends the district court erred in relying on federal rules of evidence b and to introduce evidence of b c mistakes preceding the launch of the bridge.we review a district court ruling on the admissibility of evidence for an abuse of discretion.see christiansen city of tulsa,cir.under this standard,we will not reverse a trial court evidentiary rulings unless we are convinced the district court made a clear error of judgment or exceeded the bounds of permissible choice in the circumstances and the complaining party rights were adversely affected.pandit american honda motor,cir.
over b c objections,the district court relied on rule b to admit evidence tending to show that b c trucks carrying the bridge parts were not unloaded where the bridge was to be assembled b c poor planning resulted in several problems in moving the bridge closer to the water,including failure to note the location of a fence,concrete guardrails,and a set of trolley tracks in the bridge path b c personnel initially assembled the bridge upside down a b c truck hit a power wire causing a small fire which required the fire department response and b c did not arrange for the power lines to be disabled before the bridge was moved beneath them.the district court ruled this evidence was admissible under rule b because it tended to establish a pattern of negligence in constructing and assembling the bridge from the time that the bridge was received until the time it was installed.app.ii at.
under rule b,e vidence of other crimes,wrongs,or acts is not admissible to prove the character of a person in order to show action in conformity therewith.as a prerequisite to rule b application,a party must seek to exclude evidence extrinsic to the plaintiff claim.united states,cir.evidence is extrinsic if it involves an act wholly apart from and not intricately related to the asserted claim.see united states elder,cir noting f or evidence of prior bad acts to be subject to the admissibility requirements of rule b,they must at the very least be other acts not intricately related to the charged offense.conversely,evidence is direct or intrinsic to the plaintiff claim if it is part of the same tortious event.see united states lambert,cir explaining in the criminal context that evidence is direct or intrinsic to the crime charged if both acts are part of a single criminal episode or the other acts were necessary preliminaries to the crime charged united states masters,cir stating evidence is admissible when necessary to a full presentation of case.
we conclude the district court properly admitted the challenged evidence,but we disagree with the rationale it provided.rule b is inapplicable here because the evidence at issue was directly related to elliot negligence claim against b c and was offered to prove the central theory of plaintiff case the unpreparedness of the defendant b c steel for the project
