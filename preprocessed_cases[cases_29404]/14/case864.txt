factual and procedural histories 
sometime prior to,the city adopted the campus north specific plan campus north,which encompasses acres in north merced.campus north was subdivided into several tracts.the city projected that hundreds of units would be developed in campus north by various developers.
in september,grant homes,grant entered into a subdivision agreement with the city to develop a portion of campus north referred to as campus north unit unit,comprised of units.the agreement required grant to construct certain improvements within one year.grant also promised to construct future additional improvements,which the agreement called deferred work.deferred work refers to improvements in a large development project intended to mitigate the project impacts.these improvements are not required to be built in the earlier phases of the project because they are not needed at that time,but may be required later as development progresses.grant agreed to obtain a performance bond in the amount of for its share of the deferred work specified in the agreement.the city determined grant share by multiplying the total estimated cost of the deferred work by a ratio of the units in unit,divided by the total units in campus north.
in june,grant entered into a second subdivision agreement with the city,this time regarding the installation of improvements in campus north unit unit,comprised of units.the agreement required grant to provide a second performance bond covering its share of the following deferred work 
a realignment of black rascal creek when the vacant property to the south southeast of rice court first obtains a final map.
b installation of a permanent storm pump station and detention basin when the vacant property to the south sic of rice court first obtains a final map or when some other development proposal requires it.
c median and other work in g street when west el portal drive connects to g or when a third final map is recorded in the campus north specific plan area.the latter shall also result in the extension of west el portal drive to g street.
d deferred improvements for sundance drive and bikeway parcel including paving,curb,gutter,sidewalk,bikeway,landscape and irrigation.this work shall be constructed when a third final map is recorded in the campus north specific plan area.
the bonded amount for this deferred work was.in determining the bond amount,the city used the same formula it used for the bond required for unit.although the number of units in unit was fewer than in unit,the bond amount increased because the deferred improvements specified in subdivision d for sundance drive and the bikeway were not included in unit deferred work.on may,amic issued a performance bond in the face amount of,naming the city as obligee,for the deferred work described in the june subdivision agreement.
after grant completed construction of the homes in unit,the city was advised grant would be unable to perform the deferred work because grant was insolvent.union bank took title to grant property and,by deed recorded december,conveyed the remaining undeveloped property within units and to northern california universal enterprise company ncuec,an entity owned by joe wu.in february,ncuec deeded the property to campus vista,a california limited partnership controlled by wu.
before purchasing the property in december,wu conducted due diligence.among other things,wu reviewed the conditions for grant subdivision and discussed them with the city.john franck,the city senior civil engineer,explained to wu that grant was obligated to perform work which had been deferred until the third final map of the area was filed,and if wu filed a map,it would be the third,triggering map.jack lesch,the city director of planning,told wu if wu took over the property he would be responsible for finishing grant portion of the deferred work.both lesch and franck,however,advised wu numerous times that grant share of the deferred work was bonded and if wu agreed to perform grant deferred work,the city would make demand on the bonds and use its best efforts to obtain the bond proceeds,which it would pay to wu to defray his costs in completing grant obligations.wu would not have purchased the property had he not been told the bonding money would be available.
in may,ncuec and wu entered into an agreement with the city for zone and general plan changes for the undeveloped property within unit and.as part of this agreement,wu promised to perform certain items of deferred work,including all the deferred work grant was obligated to perform under the june subdivision agreement,as well as additional improvements not within grant obligations.
in september,campus vista entered into a subdivision agreement with the city regarding installation of improvements in a subdivision referred to as campus vista,which was within campus north.the agreement required campus vista to provide the city with a performance bond for deferred work on extending west el portal to g street and for work on g street,including traffic signal,turn lanes,median and related work,which wu agreed to perform.this work was deferred until development of lot or until the city engineer determined it was necessary.
on november,the city informed grant its obligations to perform the deferred work listed in its subdivision agreements with the city had been triggered by the recent recording of the campus vista subdivision final map.the city demanded grant perform the work.on november,grant advised the city it was unable to respond to the request for construction of the deferred items because it was insolvent and had ceased operating months before.on november,and again on december,the city informed amic that grant would not be performing the deferred work and demanded payment on grant bond.
on may,the merced city council passed a resolution authorizing wu attorney,the law offices of steven hassing,to file suit on the city behalf to enforce grant bond obligations.the following day,this lawsuit was filed.the second amended complaint names the city as the plaintiff and amic as the defendant,and contains a single cause of action for enforcement of the surety performance bond.
in may,the city filed a separate lawsuit against campus vista for breach of contract after campus vista refused to complete the deferred work specified in its subdivision agreement.the city and campus vista settled that lawsuit in july,with campus vista agreeing to construct a traffic signal at the corner of west el portal and g street according to a schedule set forth in a written settlement agreement and to post a cash bond in lieu of its performance bond.
in july,the city agreed to pay campus vista approximately as partial reimbursement for its total cost of constructing the stop light at west el portal and g street.by the time of trial in march,wu testified he had completed construction of grant deferred work,with the exception of the bicycle path.wu spent in completing all of the common area improvements.the city did not actually perform any of the deferred work,and therefore did not incur any expense in constructing the improvements.
following a court trial,the court orally issued a tentative decision finding in the city favor on its claim.the city submitted a proposed statement of decision in turn,amic filed opposition to the proposed statement of decision which also requested the court to address additional questions.the court adopted the proposed statement of decision without change.
the trial court entered judgment in the city favor in the amount of,representing principal of,plus in interest.the judgment further stated the city was the prevailing party and the judgment could be amended in due course to include costs and attorney fees.amic filed a notice of appeal from this judgment 
discussion 
in its statement of decision,the trial court addressed and rejected various defenses amic raised.these defenses were a may subdivision status inquiry released the bond the city did not suffer damages the agreement between wu and the city whereby the city agreed to pay wu the proceeds from this lawsuit constitutes an illegal assignment that same agreement is unenforceable and the city waived any claims against amic in this case when it settled another lawsuit brought against amic concerning a performance bond which pertained to the same improvements as the bond in the current case.
on appeal,amic addresses only two of these issues whether the city suffered damages and whether the agreement between wu and the city constituted an illegal assignment.amic also contends,apparently for the first time on appeal,that wu performance of grant share of the deferred work effectively released the bond.
standard of review 
the parties disagree on the appropriate standard of review.the city contends the substantial evidence standard of review applies because the trial court decision involved the resolution of factual issues.amic,however,is not challenging the sufficiency of the evidence.in its opening brief,amic states that the appeal involves legal issues which are reviewed de novo and that the trial court erred in awarding bond proceeds to the city under the undisputed facts of this case.amic contends review is de novo because it involves the interpretation of contracts and statutes.
since amic is not challenging the sufficiency of the evidence,we will accept the facts the trial court found in itsstatement of decision and determine whether those factual findings support the judgment as a matter of law.see emma inglewood unified school dist.th,d.in doing so,we keep in mind that where a statement of decision sets forth the factual and legal basis for the decision,any conflict in the evidence or reasonable inferences to be drawn from the facts will be resolved in support of the trial court determination.in re marriage of hoffmeister d.we also keep in mind the principle that a judgment or order of the lower court is presumed correct.all intendments and presumptions are indulged to support it on matters as to which the record is silent,and error must be affirmatively shown citations.denham superior court cal d.accordingly,amic has the burden of affirmatively showing error.winograd american broadcasting th,d.
damages and performance 
at trial,amic contended the city suffered no damages.the trial court rejected this contention on two grounds the city was damaged when grant refused the city demand to perform and the damages were measurable by the cost of completing grant share of the deferred work and the city incurred actual costs as a result of grant breach,as shown by the time it spent negotiating with wu and other developers,the lawsuit it brought against campus vista to cause it to finish the work,and its payment of to campus vista in partial reimbursement for its construction costs for the stop light at west el portal and g street.amic challenges each of these grounds on appeal.
a public entity requires a performance bond because of its potential liability for injury to persons or property which might result from dangerous or defective conditions created by the failure of completion of required improvements.berman aetna casualty and surety d.see also county of los angeles margulis d.when a subdivider who is contractually responsible for constructing public improvements fails to perform,the public entity damages are measured by a sum equal to the cost of the uncompleted portion of the work and the surety on the performance bond is liable under the bond up to the bond amount.id.at.put another way,the public entity damages are measurable by the value of its unfulfilled right,the cost of bringing the subdivision into compliance by installing the improvements.city of sacramento trans pacific industries,d.city of sacramento.these damages exist even if the public entity has not actually completed the improvements.county of los angeles margulis,supra,d at.
here,grant agreed to be responsible for its share of the deferred work obligations specified in the june subdivision agreement,which the city determined by the number of units grant was developing within campus north in unit.based on this agreement,the city had a contractual right to have grant participate in performing its share of the deferred work.when the time came for grant to perform,the city made demand on grant,but grant failed to perform.although grant had completed construction of unit,the deferred work was not completed.based on the above authorities,the city was damaged when grant failed to perform,its damages are measured by grant share of the cost of the uncompleted portion of the work,and amic is liable under the bond up to the bond amount.
amic contends the city was not damaged by grant refusal to perform because wu agreed to perform grant share of the deferred work,at no cost to the city,before grant time to perform arose.wu agreement,however,does not mean the city was not damaged when grant refused to perform.this is because the city continued to have a contractual right to look to grant to perform its share of the deferred work despite its agreement with wu.once the triggering event for grant deferred work obligations occurred,the third final map was recorded,the city,having promised wu it would attempt to collect on grant bond,demanded performance from grant,but grant failed to perform that the city had a right at that point in time to also demand that wu perform grant share of the deferred work does not mean that grant failure to perform did not damage the city,since wu only promised to be responsible for grant share of the improvements based on the city unconditional promise to repay him if it prevailed in its action against amic.see city of sacramento,supra,d at.
a similar result was reached in city of sacramento.in that case,the city entered into a subdivision agreement with a subdivider which required the subdivider to construct public improvements within one year and provided if it failed to do so,the city had the right to complete any unfinished work and recover its costs in full from the subdivider or its surety.the subdivider was also required to obtain a performance bond.city of sacramento,supra,d at.the subdivider sold the property to a second subdivider before completing all of the required improvements.after escrow closed,the city learned the second subdivider was the new owner of the property and began negotiations for construction of the improvements.the city informed the second subdivider it did not have funds to install the missing improvements.the city then filed suit against the first subdivider and the surety on the performance bond.since the city estimated the lawsuit would take two years to complete,the second subdivider entered into an agreement with the city whereby he agreed to construct the improvements in exchange for the city promise to reimburse him from any judgment it recovered in the lawsuit.id.at.the trial court,following a bench trial,entered judgment in the city favor.id.at.
on appeal,the defendants argued the city could not recover because it suffered no damages since the second subdivider agreed to perform the work at no cost to the city unless the city recovered a judgment in the lawsuit.in rejecting this argument,the court concluded the city was damaged when the first subdivider refused to perform after the city demanded it do so,and its damages were measurable by the value of its unfulfilled right,the cost of bringing the balance of the subdivision into compliance with the contract by installing the improvements.city of sacramento,supra,d at.the court further concluded that the city damages did not magically disappear when the city later entered into the agreement with the second subdivider,since he did not promise to construct the improvements as a gift he extracted consideration from the city in the form of city conditional prom
