melvin and mary long,along with several other individuals,who signed contracts to purchase eight condominiums in the condominium complex known as vantage at merrifield town center in falls church,virginia,commenced these actions against the developer,alleging violations of the interstate land sales full disclosure act ilsfda pronounced,perhaps,et,and seeking to rescind their contracts and obtain refunds of their deposits.
the developer,merrifield town center limited partnership merrifield,filed a motion to dismiss on the ground that the sales contracts for units in the vantage condominium complex were exempt from ilsfda requirements under two exemptions that,when combined,covered all units.merrifield contended that the sales contracts for of the lots or units,which promised delivery of condominiums within two years,were allegedly exempted under ilsfda improved lot exemption,which exempts from ilsfda sales contracts that obligate the seller to construct the promised condominiums within a period of two years.see id.a.and the sales contracts for the remaining units,which promised delivery of condominiums within three years,were allegedly exempted under ilsfda lot exemption,which exempts from ilsfda transactions involving developments containing fewer than lots that are not otherwise exempt under the act.see b.the plaintiffs responded,arguing that in order for the lot exemption to apply,the remaining units had to be exempt under the improved lot exemption and that,in this case,the contracts for the sale of those units did not satisfy the requirements of a because they did not obligate merrifield to deliver the condominiums within two years from the date that each purchaser signed the purchase contract.
the district court granted merrifield motion to dismiss based on the lot exemption.but it did so without discussing whether the other sales contracts in the development were indeed exempt under the improved lot exemption.the plaintiffs appeal challenges merrifield qualification for both exemptions,as the first is dependent on the second.
we hold that to qualify for the improved lot exemption under a,which provides that a sales contract must obligate the seller to erect a residential,commercial,condominium,or industrial building thereon within a period of two years,the sales contract must obligate the seller to build and deliver the required structure within two years of the date that the purchaser signs the contract and incurs obligations,rather than within two years of the date that the seller signs the contract.because the sales contracts for the condominiums did not obligate merrifield to construct the condominiums within two years of the date that the purchasers signed the contracts and incurred obligations,those contracts were not exempt from regulation under ilsfda.and because those sales contracts were not exempt,the lot exemption could not be relied on to exempt the remaining condominiums because there were more than lots or units in the development that were not exempt.accordingly,we reverse the district court order of september,granting merrifield motion to dismiss and remand for further proceedings.
in selling the lots and unbuilt condominium units at the vantage condominium complex,merrifield offered two types of sales contracts.one type,which covered units,promised construction and delivery of the condominium unit within months of merrifield ratification of the sales contract,and the other type,which covered condominium units,promised construction and delivery of the condominium unit within months of merrifield ratification of the sales contract.all of the plaintiffs in this case signed contracts during june and july of,and merrifield ratified those contracts by signing them from one to three months later.
other than the promised delivery date,all of the sales contracts at the vantage condominium complex were substantially similar.each contract provided that it was made on the date of purchaser signing by and between purchaser and merrifield.each contract required that the purchaser provide a deposit at the time the purchaser signed the contract equal to of the purchase price if the purchaser intended to occupy the unit,or if the purchaser was an investor who intended to sell or lease the unit,and a second,larger deposit within days of the purchaser signing.each contract also obligated the purchaser to make a written loan application within seven days of the date purchaser signs the contract and to obtain approval of the financing within two weeks from the date purchaser signs the contract.if the purchaser intended to buy the condominium without obtaining a loan,the purchaser was obligated to produce documentation within five days of the date purchaser signs,showing its ability to pay.finally,each contract provided that if the purchaser breaches or defaults under this agreement,the agreement deposit and the options deposit will be retained by merrifield as liquidated damages and not as a penalty,in which event purchaser and merrifield shall be relieved from further liability hereunder.the default clause also authorized merrifield,i n the alternative,to retain the initial deposit and the options deposit and to pursue such other legal or equitable remedies as it may have.
each contract anticipated that merrifield would,at some later date,ratif y the sales contract signed by the purchaser and provided that the contract was not binding on merrifield until such ratification.in the case of the eight contracts at issue in this case,merrifield ratified the contracts from one to three months after the purchaser signed them.
due to a series of disagreements,none of the contracts in this case went to settlement.rather,the purchasers commenced these actions under ilsfda and state law,seeking rescission and return of their deposits by way of rescission or damages.merrifield filed a motion to dismiss the complaints under federal rule of civil procedure b,claiming that the contracts were exempt from ilsfda requirements under the improved lot exemption,a,as they obligated merrifield to construct the condominiums within two years of merrifield ratification of the contracts.because units were exempt,the remaining contracts,which included plaintiffs contracts,were exempt under the lot exemption,b.merrifield also addressed the plaintiffs claims in its motion to dismiss.
the district court granted merrifield motion,reasoning that because it was undisputed that merrifield was selling only units under the contracts,the lot exemption applied to them,warranting dismissal of the ilsfda claims.the district court did not,however,address the question of whether the improved lot exemption applied to the contracts,nor did it discuss the fact that the condominium complex,when combining the contracts and the contracts,contained more than units.the district court also dismissed the claims,a ruling that the plaintiffs do not appeal.
the plaintiffs filed a timely motion to alter or amend the district court judgment,arguing that the district court had erred by applying the lot exemption without considering the antecedent question of whether the contracts were exempt under the improved lot exemption.they argued that case law,as well as regulations of the department of housing and urban development hud,provided that the improved lot exemption requires that a seller be obligated to build the structure within months of when the purchaser signs the sales contract and incurs obligations.the plaintiffs argued that the contracts in this case failed to meet that requirement because they did not require merrifield to build and deliver completed condominiums until two years after it ratified the contracts.because the contracts were not exempt,the plaintiffs argued,the plaintiffs contracts also were not exempt,as the total number of units in the development exceeded.
the district court denied the plaintiffs motion to alter or amend the judgment,and this appeal followed.
because vantage at merrifield town center was a condominium complex that contained a total number of lots or units,only if the units sold with contracts were exempt under the improved lot exemption of a could th
