opinion of the court 
in this statutory interpretation case,we must decide when the statute of limitations begins to run in a case arising under the americans with disabilities act ada and the rehabilitation act ra.appellant disabled in action of pennsylvania dia argues that under the plain language of the statute,its claims accrued upon the completion of alterations to two philadelphia subway stations.appellee southeastern pennsylvania transportation authority septa argues,and the district court held,that dia claims accrued prior to the completion of the alterations when dia discovered that the planned alterations would not include elevators.
we view the facts and draw all reasonable inferences in the light most favorable to dia,the party against whom summary judgment was entered.feesers,michael foods,cir citing andreoli gates,cir.
dia is a nonprofit corporation that seeks to eliminate discrimination against disabled individuals in all aspects of community life.to achieve this goal,dia employs a variety of methods including government monitoring,political activism,direct involvement in municipal planning,and,as a last resort,litigation.many of dia approximately members use wheelchairs and rely on septa for their public transportation needs.
septa is an agency of the commonwealth of pennsylvania responsible for providing public transportation in southeastern pennsylvania.in philadelphia,septa city transit division operates a vast network of subway and rapid rails,regional rails,light rails,trackless trolleys,and buses that provide over passenger trips per day.septa receives federal funding for many of its activities,including its recent remodeling of an entrance to the street station.
street station and courtyard 
the bustling street station is located underground near and market streets in downtown philadelphia.passengers can access the station in two ways.first,using the stairway at the southwest side of and market streets,passengers can descend directly to the platform for the subway line.second,using the stairway or escalator at the northwest side of the same block,passengers can descend to the street courtyard.from there,they can turn northward toward the suburban regional rail line station suburban station,or southward,toward the platform.septa renovations to this latter entrance gave rise to the present dispute 
prior to septa renovations,the street courtyard included a set of stairs and two escalators enclosed within a headhouse.on september,septa received a grant from the economic development administration of the united states department of commerce for a project entitled renovation of and market streets headhouse at suburban station.according to the grant,the project was to involve various renovations to the and market streets entrances and related areas including renovation of entrances to the underground train station concourse demolition of existing facilities the of new stairs,landscaping,lighting,signage,finishes,canopies and all appurtenances.
in accepting the commerce department funding,septa agreed to pursue diligently the development of the project so as to ensure completion within the time schedule.specifically,the grant required septa to begin construction within months of its receipt of the funds and to limit the total construction period to months.in addition,the grant was to expire five years from the fiscal year of the grant award,requiring that the project be physically and financially completed by september.
having secured funding,septa applied to the city of philadelphia for a variance from certain provisions of the building code.among the provisions from which septa sought a variance was section,which requires that w here building entrances are altered,or when plans are presented to relocate and provide a new primary entrance,the entrance shall be made accessible.for obvious reasons,septa variance application caught the attention of dia legal counsel,stephen gold.
fearful that septa renovations would not include an elevator,gold wrote to edward mclaughlin,city commissioner for the department of licenses and inspections.in his letter of august,gold expressed concern that the city would allow septa to apply for such a variance on its behalf for such a major public access point.gold insisted that i n addition to ensuring that renovations are carried out in compliance with the building code,the city also has an obligation to ensure that such renovations are carried out in compliance with the americans with disabilities act.he asked mclaughlin to keep him informed as to how the city plans to proceed with septa variance request.
gold received no response from mclaughlin and consequently discussed his concerns with pete winebrake,an attorney in the city solicitor office.gold summarized the discussion in a letter dated september,as i stated on the phone yesterday,this problem should be resolved before construction commences,or you leave me with very few options.i am very concerned that the city train has already left the station and i must act sooner than later sic.i am available to meet with you at your earliest convenience.emphasis in original.
gold heard nothing more from winebrake,but received a letter dated november,from assistant city solicitor fredrick pasour regarding the street courtyard portion of the suburban station project.in pertinent part,pasour letter stated 
i represent the city of philadelphia with respect to the project.i understand that you believe that the ada,its regulations and the accessibility guidelines require an elevator in the street courtyard.i also understand that you are considering bringing a lawsuit to enjoin the street courtyard portion of the project if the city issues a building permit based on plans that do not include an elevator in the street courtyard.
this letter is to advise you that the city doe sic not share your view that an elevator is required in the street courtyard and has issued a building permit for the project please remember that the street courtyard will be readily accessible to and usable by individuals with disabilities.as you are aware,elevators are planned for other locations near the street courtyard.
the current bids for the portion of the project that includes the street courtyard renovations are only good through december.if,therefore,you plan to bring an action challenging the street courtyard portion of the project,please do so in an expeditious manner.
i understand that you had one meeting with representatives of the city and septa at the street courtyard to discuss the project.i believe that another meeting this week may be useful in order to discuss the project in more detail and to determine if we can reach an agreement that is satisfactory to you,the disabled community,the city and septa.
despite pasour letter,gold did not immediately file a lawsuit,and the city issued septa a building permit on or about february,describing the street courtyard project as follows 
demolition incorporates head house,stair,railings,limited wall,veneer,pavement,and lighting systems.also to be removed are planters,fountain and ceilings.construction scope consists of glass head house,stair,retail spaces,railings,storefront,planters,lighting and paving installed,as well as new ceiling.
app x.septa commenced construction a few days later.
the record suggests several explanations for dia decision not to file suit prior to this juncture.first,gold testified that in,he met with representatives of septa and the city because they were really anxious to get a commitment from him that there would not be a lawsuit regarding street.see also app x referring to a meeting between gold and representatives of the city and septa to determine if the parties could reach an agreement.according to gold,frances egan,assistant to septa general manager for government and public affairs,and deborah russo,a representative of the city,assured him that in lieu of an elevator at street,septa would put in the elevator at city hall and begin construction in with the completion date of.see also app x noting that elevators are planned for other locations near the street courtyard.
gold discussed the proposed compromise with dia,and dia agreed that it was acceptable.gold informed egan of his client assent,but neither party memorialized the deal assuaged nonetheless dia took no further action until late when it appeared that septa was not installing an elevator at city hall 
gold explanation for dia decision not to file a lawsuit is supported by a settlement agreement in which dia voluntarily dismissed its claims against the city,and the city affirmed that it only granted permits for the street courtyard renovation because it believed septa had agreed to construct elevators in the city hall courtyard in lieu of the required elevator at and market.
alternatively,the record suggests that at some point,dia strategy shifted from obtaining a injunction to pursuing remedies based on gold belief that even though septa had started construction or even completed construction,the ada enabled dia to force septa to install an elevator.gold admitted that he gave pasour admonition to file suit in an expeditious manner v ery,very,very much consideration but determined that he could optimize representing dia by letting septa move the stairs and begin the construction because dia could always get the elevator and make septa put it in if necessary along street.for reasons that are not clear from the record,gold concluded that if construction did not proceed,there would be no elevator.accordingly,he decided to let septa and the city sit in their own petard sic.
whatever the reasons for waiting,dia filed its initial complaint on march,approximately eight months after the newly renovated street courtyard entrance was opened on august,without an elevator.dia requested permanent injunctive relief to enjoin septa to begin construction immediately of a n elevator at the and market street entrance to assure access for persons with disabilities.
city hall station and courtyard 
the second subject of the present dispute is septa replacement of an escalator that carried passengers from the concourse above the city hall station platform to city hall courtyard located near the street station,city hall station is one of the busiest stops on the broad street subway line and serves as a transfer point between the broad street line,the line,and regional rail lines.for instance,from the concourse below city hall courtyard,passengers can access the and street line platforms without using stairs.
the city hall courtyard project was part of septa escalator replacement program,launched in to improve the safety of escalators throughout the system.septa included funding for the program in its fy capital budget after holding a public meeting to discuss the improvements on may.although no representative of dia attended the meeting,dia executive director testified that dia reviews septa capital budget each year and was aware of the project.
by august,septa had barricaded the area around the city hall courtyard escalator and posted signs that read project of the pennsylvania public transportation assistance fund escalator replacement at erie,spring garden,city hall street stations southeastern pennsylvania transportation authority.septa removed the existing escalator,extended the wellway and relocated the truss upon which it sat,and installed a new escalator.construction was completed and the escalator was opened to the public on or about august.the finished project did not include an elevator.on february,dia filed its fourth amended complaint,adding allegations regarding this project.
c.the district court proceedings 
dia filed its initial complaint on march,alleging that septa renovations to the street station entrance violated the ada and the ra.the district court dismissed the complaint because dia failed to name the city of philadelphia,the owner of the real property upon which the entrance is located,as a defendant.after the court granted dia relief from the dismissal,dia added the city as a defendant in its first amended complaint.on october,dia filed a second amended complaint,which included allegations about a deal between dia,septa,and the city to install an elevator at the city hall courtyard instead of the street courtyard.
after an unsuccessful settlement attempt,dia filed a third amended complaint,adding an ada key station claim.see b.septa moved to dismiss the key station claim and argued that portions of the third amended complaint should be stricken pursuant to a stipulation between dia and septa.the district court refused to dismiss the key station claim,but dia agreed to strike its allegations that septa had agreed to install an elevator at city hall in lieu of street.
on august,dia reached a settlement agreement with the city.therein,the city stipulated that i t is the city legal opinion that septa is legally obligated under the ada and accompanying regulations to construct an elevator at the and market street courtyard entrance,which septa renovated.moreover,the city asserted that it only granted permits for the street renovation because it believed septa had agreed to construct elevators in the city hall courtyard.based on this agreement,the district court dismissed the city from the case.
on february,dia filed a fourth amended complaint in which it added a second claim under a based on septa renovations to the city hall courtyard.dia alleged that septa renovations to both the street and city hall courtyards constituted alterations that triggered ada and ra accessibility obligations a a.dia also alleged that both street and city hall are key stations that septa must make accessible.b a.dia requested,inter alia,an injunction compelling septa to construct elevators at both locations.after completing discovery,the parties filed cross motions for summary judgment.
the district court granted septa motion for summary judgment on all counts.as to dia a claims,the court reasoned that t o determine the accrual date of a discrimination claim,a court must focus on when the discriminatory act occurred,not when the effect of that act became painful.dia,wl,at citing chardon fernandez,d.the district court rejected dia argument that septa discriminatory acts occurred upon completion of the alterations to the street and city hall courtyards.id.at citing a.rather,the district court held that the claims accrued when dia knew,or had reason to know,that septa renovations would not include elevators.according to the district court,dia had such knowledge regarding the street courtyard no later than november,when dia was informed that septa would proceed with the planned construction at the and market street courtyard without installing an elevator,id.at,and regarding the city hall courtyard,at least as early as august,when a sign was posted in the city hall courtyard on the outside of the construction area where the escalator was being replaced.id.at.because dia filed its a claims more than two years after these dates,the district court dismissed them as barred by the statute of limitations,and dia appealed 
dia claims arise under section of the ada,a,and section of the ra,a the district court had jurisdiction over these claims pursuant to and.we review the district court final order granting summary judgment to septa pursuant to.
our review is plenary,and we apply the same standard as the district court.michael foods,at.we will affirm the grant of summary judgment if the pleadings,depositions,answers to interrogatories,and admissions on file,together with the affidavits,if any,show that there is no genuine issue as to any material fact and that septa is entitled to judgment as a matter of law.c.in making this determination,we view the facts in the light most favorable to dia and draw all inferences in dia favor.michael foods,at quoting farrell planters lifesavers,cir.
in,congress passed the rehabilitation act to assure that no individual with a disability shall be subjected to discrimination under any program or activity receiving federal financial assistance.a.seventeen years later,congress extended this mandate to cover all public transportation providers in title ii of the americans with disabilities act.see and.title ii begins with a general prohibition of discrimination,followed by seven provisions that define what shall be considered discrimination for purposes of the statute,and.in this case,we address an important question of first impression regarding one of these provisions when does a claim under a accrue 
neither title ii of the ada nor section of the ra includes an express statute of limitations.as both statutes were enacted prior to the effective date of the default statute of limitations for federal statutes,see,we borrow the statute of limitations of the most analogous state law cause of action.north star steel thomas,d wilson garcia,d.the district court concluded,and the parties do not dispute,that pennsylvania statute of limitations for personal injury claims should apply to claims under a.
this conclusion is consistent with our precedent regarding the statute of limitations for federal civil rights claims.see,lake arnold,cir kost kozakiewicz,cir bougher of pittsburgh,cir.it is also consistent with the majority of courts of appeals that have decided the question.see gaona town country credit,cir noting that most courts of appeal s have applied the state statute of limitations for personal injury actions to claims under the rehabilitation act and the ada everett cobb county sch,cir soignier am.bd.of plastic surgery,cir baker bd.of regents,cir morse of vermont,cir hickey irving indep.sch,cir wolsky med.coll.of hampton,cir.
accordingly,we hold that the statute of limitations applicable to claims under title ii of the ada and section of the ra is the statute of limitations for personal injury actions in the state in which the trial court sits.in this case,the applicable statute is.cons.stat,which prescribes a statute of limitations.
the more difficult the crux of the dispute between dia and when this two year statute of limitations begins to run.in answering this question,we note that t he ada is a remedial statute,designed to eliminate discrimination against the disabled in all facets of society,and as such,it must be broadly construed to effectuate its purposes.kinney yerusalim,citing tcherepnin knight,d,aff,cir.
ordinarily,a statute of limitations begins to run from the moment the potential plaintiff has a complete and present cause of action.bay area laundry dry cleaning pension trust fund ferbar,d quoting rawlings ray.arnold,at quoting ross,cir limitations period begins to run from the time the cause of action accrue s.for federal causes of action,the accrual date is a matter of federal law.romero allstate,cir.
where congress has specified an accrual date by explicit command or by implication from the structure and text of the statute,we defer to its directive.trw andrews,d see romero,at.i n the absence of a contrary directive from congress,we apply the federal discovery rule,which dictates that a federal cause of action accrues when the plaintiff discovers,or with due diligence should have discovered,the injury that forms the basis for the claim.romero,at internal quotation and citations omitted 
we agree with the parties that congress did not explicitly command an accrual date for a claims as it has done for other civil rights actions.e a charge under this section shall be filed within one hundred and eighty days after the alleged unlawful employment practice occurred id.an aggrieved person may commence a civil action not later than years after the occurrence or the termination of an alleged discriminatory housing practice.nevertheless,for the reasons that follow,we hold that the structure and text of the statute,andrews,at,evince congress intention that claims under a accrue upon the completion of alterations to public transportation facilities.
the portion of a at issue in this appeal provides 
with respect to alterations of an existing facility or part thereof used in the provision of designated public transportation services that affect or could affect the usability of the facility or part thereof,it shall be considered discrimination,for purposes of section of this title and section of title,for a public entity to fail to make such alterations or to ensure that the alterations are made in such a manner that,to the maximum extent feasible,the altered portions of the facility are readily accessible to and usable by individuals with disabilities,including individuals who use wheelchairs,upon the completion of such alterations.
as the district court correctly observed,the dispute between dia and septa emanates from the difference in how the parties interpret this provision as to when the alleged discrimination occurs.dia,wl,at.like the parties and the district court,we believe a concluding phrase upon the completion of such alterations is of fundamental importance in answering this question.
dia argues that the phrase modifies the entire definition of what shall be considered discrimination because only when alterations are completed and the inaccessible facility is will people with mobility disabilities be subject to discrimination.therefore,dia concludes,claims under a do not accrue until alterations are completed.
septa invokes the rule of the last antecedent,arguing that the upon the completion phrase only modifies the phrase the altered portions of the facility are readily accessible to and usable by individuals with disabilities and not the entire definition of what constitutes discrimination.under this interpretation,which the district court adopted,the function of the upon the completion phrase is merely to suggest that accessibility for disabled individuals must be in place at the time the alterations are completed.dia,wl,at.in other words,the phrase merely acknowledges that while renovations are in progress,facilities will necessarily be inaccessible to everyone,including individuals with disabilities,and that this temporary inaccessibility is not what a prohibits.
our evaluation of these conflicting interpretations is guided by familiar rules of statutory construction.our primary concern is to give effect to congress intent.rosenberg xm ventures,cir.we assume that congress expresses its intent through the ordinary meaning of its language and therefore begin with an examination of the plain language of the statute.id.if the language is unambiguous,our inquiry is at an end.id.
a statutory provision is not ambiguous simply because by itself,it is susceptible to differing constructions because in addition to the statutory language itself,we take account of the specific context in which that language is used,and the broader context of the statute as a whole.in re price,cir.we assume,for example,that every word in a statute has meaning and avoid interpreting one part of a statute in a manner that renders another part superfluous.rosenberg,at.we also consider he overall object and policy of the statute,united states schneider,cir,and avoid constructions that produce odd or absurd results or that are inconsistent with common sense.see public citizen of justice,d internal quotations omitted singer,sutherland statutes and statutory construction,at ed hereinafter sutherland.
applying these principles to a,we find dia interpretation of the upon the completion phrase more persuasive.the language appears in the specific context of a single sentence that defines activities that shall be considered discrimination and in the broader context of title ii,which assures that no individual with a disability is subjected to discrimination.a and.discrimination,as it is ordinarily defined,is the denial of privileges to a certain class because of race,age,sex,nationality,religion,or handicap.black law dictionary ed.the privileges at stake in a are access to,and use of,public transportation facilities.it is difficult to understand how these privileges are denied to individuals with disabilities by the mere promulgation or approval of renovation plans that do not include accessibility features.instead,as congress recognized,it is only when renovations are completed that individuals with disabilities will be excluded from accessing and using such facilities while others will not.this is the time at which disabled individuals are subjected to the disparate treatment that a was enacted to prevent.
septa argument that the upon the completion language merely clarifies that a imposes no duty upon public entities to ensure accessibility while transportation facilities are under construction is specious.we are confident that congress would not have felt compelled to make such an obvious clarification.see public citizen,at.faced with a choice between septa interpretation,which essentially renders the phrase surplusage,and dia interpretation,which gives it substantial effect,we choose the latter.see silverman eastrich multiple investor fund,cir a statute should be construed so that effect is given to all its provisions,so that no part will be inoperative or superfluous,void or insignificant.sutherland,at a construction that renders a portion of the statute meaningless should not be reached by the court unless that construction is unavoidable.sutherland,at no clause,sentence,or word shall be construed as superfluous,void or insignificant if the construction can be found which will give force to all the words of the statute.
we thus interpret the upon the completion clause as modifying the statutory definition of discrimination such that claims under a arise upon the completion of inaccessible alterations.
our interpretation of this seminal clause in dispute on appeal is bolstered by the remainder of the statute.in fact,even if the upon the completion clause was absent from the statute,we would conclude that a claim under a does not accrue until alterations are completed.
as the district court stated,t o determine the accrual date of a discrimination claim,a court must focus on when the discriminatory act occurred.dia,wl,at citing chardon,at.section a defines two closely related discriminatory acts the failure to make alterations,and the failure to ensure that alterations are made,in such a manner that the altered portions of transportation facilities are accessible and usable.
regarding the first act,we agree with the amicus curiae submission of the department of justice that as a matter of logic,there can be no fail ure to make the altered portions of a facility accessible until the alterations are completed.the relevant act is to make to cause something to exist.black law dictionary ed.merely funding,designing,approving,or even commencing construction of alterations that will not provide accessibility does not cause such alterations to exist,especially in light of the notoriously contingent nature of construction plans.see,dia sykes,cir subway station renovation planned and funded in but modified in to exclude elevator.therefore,an individual can not suffer discrimination under this portion of the statute until the alterations are completed.
unlike the first discriminatory act,the second act can logically occur before,during,or after construction.for example,a public entity arguably fails to ensure that alterations are made when it fails to insist that construction drawings include certain features although rational in vacuo,this reading is unfaithful to the structure of the statute.price,at.the phrase or to ensure that the alterations are made appears in parentheses immediately following the phrase to fail to make such alterations,indicating that the meaning of the former phrase is related to,or dependent upon,the latter.see peters ashcroft,cir noting that parentheses reduce the grammatical import of the language contained therein see generally pritchard liggett myers tobacco,cir noting that punctuation can be a relevant factor in statutory interpretation sutherland,favoring rule that treats punctuation as a relevant factor in statutory construction.furthermore,both phrases center around a form of the verb to make,an additional indication that they are,in dia words,two sides of the same coin.see merrill lynch,pierce,fenner smith,dabit,d generally,identical words used in different parts of the same statute are presumed to have the same meaning.internal quotation and citation omitted.given this context,we hesitate to ascribe to the phrase ensure that the alterations are made the broad and independent meaning septa urges.see mizrahi gonzales,cir declining to ascribe independent meaning to parenthetical statutory phrase beginning with word or because it can reasonably be construed to illustrate or explain the preceding phrase.
it is more probable that congress included the parenthetical and used the passive verb form are made because it recognized that a public entity is rarely the entity that make s the alterations.instead,alterations are made by sundry contractors and subcontractors.without the parenthetical,a public entity could immunize itself from a liability by delegating renovation projects to private entities that are not subject to ada liability.the parenthetical closes this loophole by placing the onus on the public entity,as opposed to its agents,to ensure that alterations are made in an accessible and usable manner.
this interpretation comports with a similar provision in title iii of the ada dealing with public accommodations 
d iscrimination respect to a facility or part thereof that is altered by,on behalf of,or for the use of an establishment in a manner that affects or could affect the usability of the facility or part thereof,a failure to make alterations in such a manner that,to the maximum extent feasible,the altered portions of the facility are readily accessible to and usable by individuals with disabilities.
a emphasis added.absent from a is the or to ensure that the alterations are made phrase.instead,the statute provides that the offending alterations can be made by or on behalf of a public entity.this language is consistent with our conclusion that congress included the parenthetical phrase in a to cover the situation in which alterations to a public transportation facility are made on behalf of a public entity.
moreover,regardless whether the mak er of the alterations is the public entity itself or the entity agents,the general activity that a regulates is the same the mak ing of alterations.f c regulating the underlying activities of design ing and construct ing multifamily dwellings emphases added.as discussed,the failure to make alterations in a certain manner,as opposed to plan or design them,can not logically occur until the completion of such alterations.
finally,to establish whether a public entity committed the discriminatory acts of fail ing to make alterations,or fail ing to ensure that alterations are made in an accessible manner,the statute directs us to determine whether the altered portions of the facility are readily accessible not whether the portions to be altered will be readily accessible.a emphases added.the verb tenses employed by congress in this phrase altered,past tense,and are,present tense further clarify that the time for passing upon a public entity success or failure in complying with the statute is upon completion of the alterations.
in short,despite the district court repeated emphasis on septa construction plans the word plan is absent from the statute while the phrase completion of alterations is present.consistent with this language,as well as the structure and purpose of the statute,we hold that the discriminatory acts defined by a occur,and the statute of limitations begins to run,upon the completion of alterations to public transportation facilities.
before discussing the policy considerations underlying our holding,we clarify the proper application of the discovery rule as it was the basis of the district court holding and the subject of extended debate between the parties.the district court reasoned 
in the absence of any explicit statutory limitation period the court must look elsewhere for guidance as to when a cause of action such as this one accrues.under federal law,a claim accrues on the date when the plaintiff knows or has reason to know of the injury that is the basis of the action.to determine the accrual date of a discrimination claim,a court must focus on when the discriminatory act occurred,not when the effect of that act became painful.
dia,wl,at internal quotations and citations omitted.although largely accurate,two corrections to this statement of law are necessary.first,as discussed in part,in addition to arising from an explicit statutory directive,id.at,an accrual date can arise by implication from the structure and text of the statute.andrews,at.second,the district court erred in applying the discovery rule to establish when dia claims accrued before first determining,per the terms of a,when dia alleged injuries occurred.these inquiries are analytically distinct.
because a potential plaintiff can not discover his injury before it has occurred,the discovery rule only postpones the accrual date of a claim where the plaintiff is unaware of the injury.cgb occupational therapy,rha health servs,cir.it does not accelerate the accrual date when the plaintiff becomes aware that he will suffer injury in the future.see podobnik postal,cir the discovery rule delays the initial running of the statute of limitations,but only until the plaintiff has discovered that he or she has been injured and that this injury has been caused by another party conduct.emphasis added oshiver levin,fishbein,sedran berman,cir the discovery rule postpones the beginning of the limitations period from the date a plaintiff was wronged until the date a plaintiff discovers that he or she was injured.emphasis added.
accordingly,the first step in applying the discovery rule in a situation like the present is to establish when the injurious discriminatory act defined by the statute actually occurred.see podobnik,at.the second step is to determine whether that injury was immediately discoverable,or whether the accrual date will be postponed until it is reasonable to expect the plaintiff to discover the injury.oshiver,at.having skipped step one,the district court application of the discovery rule resulted in an accrual date that preceded the occurrence of dia alleged injuries.
because dia was not injured before septa completed its alterations,the discovery rule would not have rendered dia claims untimely.
we conclude by reviewing the policy considerations underlying our holding.see price,at.in particular,we appreciate the district court concern that 
i t would be impractical to impose upon a defendant the requirement that it fully complete a facility modification before having to address any assertion that modifications that can be clearly understood from design drawings and specifications amount to alterations triggering an obligation under the ada that might require significant and material modifications that surely would have been more easily,efficiently and economically incorporated well prior to the completion of the work.
dia,wl,at.this public entities will incur unnecessary expense if potential plaintiffs can wait until the last nail is hammered into place to bring assuaged by a number of mitigating and countervailing considerations.id.
first,our interpretation of a does not prevent a public entity like septa from obtaining preliminary declaratory relief to ensure ada compliance prior to commencing alterations.see.declaratory relief is available to settle actual controversies before they ripen into violations of a law or a breach of duty.united states,cir emphasis added see data,wyse,cir.such relief is appropriate where there is a substantial controversy,between parties having adverse legal interests,of sufficient immediacy and reality.armstrong world,by wolfson adams,cir quoting.cas.pacific coal oil.
although septa activities did not ripen into actual violations of a until septa completed its alterations to the street and city hall courtyards,a substantial,immediate,and real controversy existed between septa and dia regarding these activities much earlier.on august,dia attorney,stephen gold,wrote to city commissioner edward mclaughlin expressing dia concern that the street courtyard project would not comply with the ada.gold relayed the same concerns to septa throughout in a series of meetings with septa and the city.in these meetings,gold also discussed septa ada obligations regarding the city hall courtyard project.because of these interactions,septa was anxious to get a commitment from dia that there would not be a lawsuit and was undeniably aware that a substantial controversy existed.accordingly,to the extent that septa planned modifications could be clearly understood from design drawings and specifications,septa could have obtained a declaratory judgment to assuage its anxieties before proceeding with construction.
conversely,our interpretation of a does not prevent an entity like dia from seeking an injunction prior to the commencement of construction to prevent threatened ada violations.see injunction a preliminary injunction is an anticipatory remedy which prevents the perpetration of a threatened wrong united states grant.swift united states.
there is little doubt that it would have been better for all if dia or septa had sought declaratory or injunctive relief before construction began.it does not follow,however,that a claim for relief on the merits under a accrues as soon as claims for declaratory and injunctive relief accrue.ramey district,cir t he possibility of maintaining a preliminary injunction proceeding does not trigger the statute of limitations.see reiter cooper,d while it is theoretically possible for a statute to create a cause of action that accrues at one time for the purposes of calculating when the statute of limitations begins to run,but at another time for purposes of bringing suit,we will not infer such an odd result in the absence of any such indication in the statute.dasgupta of.bd.of regents,cir if an employer tells his employee,i am going to infringe your rights under title vii at least once every year you work for me,this does not start the statute of limitations running on the future violations,violations that have not yet been committed.the following hypothetical adapted from our decision in cgb occupational therapy,at,illustrates our point.
a telephone company informs a homeowner that it has a across the homeowner property,and that next friday,it plans to utilize the to repair an underground line.the homeowner informs the company that he disputes the parameters of the.upon receiving notice of this controversy,the phone company could seek a declaratory judgment to establish the parameters of the and protect itself from future trespass liability.see centel cable television admiral cove,cir commw.wertelet.conversely,the homeowner could obtain an injunction to prevent the phone company from entering his property until the dispute is resolved.see wertelet,at.even though both declaratory and injunctive relief are available,the homeowner has no trespass claim against the phone company until it physically enters his property.cgb occupational therapy,at see united states union,d,citing restatement of torts.
assume that neither party seeks preliminary relief and the phone company enters the homeowner property.at the moment of entry,the homeowner trespass claim accrues.see cgb occupational therapy,at union,d at.it would be incorrect to say that the statute of limitations on this claim began to run from the time the parties discovered the dispute regarding the.similarly,it would be incorrect to say that the statute of limitations on a a claim begins to run as soon as the parties discover a controversy that may entitle them to preliminary declaratory and injunctive relief.
in light of the availability of preliminary relief to parties facing the dilemma that confronted dia and septa,we believe the district court concern that public entities will be forced to completed projects to add the features is overstated.dia,wl,at.that may be the unfortunate consequence of our decision in this instance,however.
second,the district court desire to give public entities repose from a liability is not advanced by an interpretation of the statute that incorporates the discovery rule.see dia,wl,at.the discovery rule dictates that a cause of action accrues when a potential claimant discovers,or should have discovered,the injury that forms the basis of his claim.romero,at.as dia argues,it is easy to imagine a situation where an individual with a disability relocates to philadelphia many years from now and attempts to use the
