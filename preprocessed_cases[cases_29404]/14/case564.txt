petitioner seahaus la jolla homeowners association association is the plaintiff in a construction defect action alleging water and other damage to the common areas of a common interest development.the association sued the developers and builders of the complex,la jolla view,llc et and webcor construction defendants,who,among others,are the real parties in interest in this mandamus proceeding.the association contends the trial court erred and abused its discretion in overruling the association claim of privilege in this discovery dispute over defendants efforts to depose individual homeowners regarding disclosures made at informational meetings about the litigation.
the record shows that counsel for the association board of directors the board gave notice to the individual homeowners in june that the board was pursuing mediation but was also contemplating filing construction defect litigation.former,now see.such litigation was filed in july of,and the board and its counsel subsequently conducted meetings with many individual homeowners of the units,to apprise them of the status and goals of the litigation.pursuant to the provisions of the governing documents,at one such litigation update meeting,the board sought and obtained majority approval by the homeowners for pursuing the action,subd.b association declaration of covenants,conditions and restrictions ccrs,members approval of certain actions.
by the time of the later litigation update meetings,a subgroup of individual homeowners had filed its own companion action in which they seek damages for construction defects in their private individual units,and their action was coordinated for discovery purposes with the association action.sarnecky la jolla view,llc super.san diego,cu ic ctl sarnecky action.
defendants contested discovery requests were made during depositions of many individual homeowners,and seek to inquire into the content and disclosures made at those informational litigation update meetings,which were conducted by the association counsel.the association objected,invoking the privilege under evidence code section and the common interest doctrine.see oxy resources california llc superior court th,oxy resources parties who possess common legal interests may share privileged information without losing the protection afforded by the privilege.however,several rulings by the trial court have declined to allow such a privilege to be asserted by the association,or have concluded any privilege was waived,regarding the communications received at the meetings by individual homeowners who are not the actual clients of the association retained counsel.this petition ensued.
confidential communications between client and lawyer are defined in section as meaning information transmitted between a client and his or her lawyer in the course of that relationship and in confidence by a means which,so far as the client is aware,discloses the information to no third persons other than those who are present to further the interest of the client in the consultation or those to whom disclosure is reasonably necessary for the transmission of the information or the accomplishment of the purpose for which the lawyer is consulted,and includes a legal opinion formed and the advice given by the lawyer in the course of that relationship.italics and emphasis added.
we evaluate this discovery dispute in the context of the usual first principles,that parties may obtain discovery regarding any unprivileged matter that is relevant to the subject of the pending action,or motions,but subject to the rule that the matter either is itself admissible in evidence or appears reasonably calculated to lead to the discovery of admissible evidence.code civ,italics added.defendants claim to entitlement to information about the litigation update meetings is apparently based upon the claim of some of the individual plaintiffs to stigma damages for their units apparently in the sarnecky action.defendants argue that in the association common area action,they should be able to inquire into the beliefs of the individual homeowner plaintiffs about damages and the source of their beliefs such as any perceptions gained from information given to them by the association attorneys at the board litigation update meetings.
to the extent this record reveals anything about the purpose of the requested discovery,it shows that counsel for defendants is seeking to develop information about the litigation strategy of the association counsel,including the legal opinions formed and the advice given by the lawyers in the course of that relationship,and such disclosures would not likely lead to the discovery of admissible evidence.code civ,mitchell superior court cal d,mitchell public policy concerns outlined against unwarranted invasions of privilege.
in the act governing common interest developments,the legislature placed certain obligations on homeowners association governing boards to communicate with individual owners about proposed construction defect litigation by the association regarding the common areas,subd.a.the association may sue developers over common area defects,and also over alleged damage to the separate interests that the association must maintain or repair,or damage to the separate interests that is integrally related to damage to the common areas.by the same token,individual owners have economic interests in the value of not only their own individual units,but also in the state of the development as a whole.ostayan nordhoff townhomes homeowners,th,ostayan.
as we will show,the challenged orders in the association action represent an overly technical definition of the privilege,and do not account for the protection of client confidentiality as it operates through the common interest doctrine,in this factual and legal context surrounding common interest developments.we grant relief on the petition to allow the privilege to be asserted under these circumstances.
factual and procedural summary 
nature of meetings held by board for individual homeowners legal representation 
the association board hired the epsten grinnell howell law firm to represent it in pursuing mediation with the developer and general contractor of the development.on june,the association counsel sent a letter to all homeowners notifying them that mediation was pending,no lawsuit had been filed,and a preliminary list of defects was enclosed,reflecting that the association was currently investigating the nature,extent and severity of the defects at the site.the letter stated that if an owner was selling or refinancing a unit,you may be required to provide this document to escrow,buyer,or a lending institution.
the next letter from the association attorneys was dated august,and provided homeowners with an update regarding the status of the construction defect claims involving the common areas of the development.this letter notified homeowners that the association had just filed its lawsuit on july,due to limitations concerns and bankruptcy of one defendant,and the homeowners might be required to disclose that filing in connection with any pending sale or refinance of a unit.mediation was continuing,but the legal action filing had been deemed to be essential to preserve the claims.counsel stated that members of the firm would be present at the association annual meeting on september,to answer questions and discuss the association legal options and the status of the investigation and mediation efforts.
on january,the board and its mediation and litigation committee sent out a notice of an informational meeting to all homeowners,at which counsel for the association would be present to provide owners with information about the status of the claims against the developers and builders of the complex.the meeting was scheduled for january,for presentations by the attorneys and some of the consultants retained to assist in connection with pursuing the claims.
next,counsel for the association sent all homeowners another status update on the claims against the developers and builders dated march.this letter referenced the homeowner meeting held january,and stated that additional defects had been identified and were being investigated.the homeowners were told that additional meetings would be scheduled when the results of the current investigation were obtained.
on march,counsel for the association notified the individual homeowners that an upcoming open forum meeting was scheduled for march,to answer individual homeowners questions regarding the litigation,particularly its relationship to the separate sarnecky individual homeowners action.only some of the individual homeowners were parties to the separate action,and they were represented by their own attorneys the aguirre firm.the letter also stated that the association structural engineer would be attending the meeting to answer questions.
discovery dispute referee 
defendants pursued discovery in the association action,requesting that several individual homeowners be produced for deposition and questioned about the litigation meetings content,and any basis they might have learned there about any stigma damages being claimed for their units.defendants argued that the meetings were not held in a confidential context and any applicable privileges had been waived.
the association objected to the questions and asserted that the information was protected from disclosure by the privilege.the association did not claim that the individual homeowners were also clients of its counsel,but rather that they were third persons to whom disclosure is reasonably necessary for the accomplishment of the purpose for which the lawyer is consulted.thus,it claimed the individual homeowners were present to further the interests of the association,as client,in the consultation.
when defendants continued to seek information about the content of the meetings,the association brought the issue before the appointed discovery referee,james roberts.after a tentative ruling and hearing,the referee issued a report and recommendations for a protective order to be issued by the court.the referee concluded that the information requested about the content of the meetings was not subject to discovery because it was neither directly relevant to the action nor reasonably likely to lead to relevant evidence.in his june,letter decision,he stated his opinion that the association had the better argument as to why such communications should be determined to be privileged.in his formal recommendation dated july,issued after a request for reconsideration,the referee stated that even though some of the letters from the association counsel to the homeowners,about the status of the litigation and the claims being made,were stated on their face not to be confidential and thus could be shown to lenders or prospective purchasers,the public content of those letters was different from the content of the confidential information being discussed at the homeowner litigation meetings.
court proceedings on referee recommendation 
defendants brought their objections to the referee recommendations to the trial court judge vargas,who held several hearings.in a series of proposed orders and rulings,judge vargas stated he sustains defendant objection to the recommendation,but also stated t he court overrules all other objections.although the order granted the protective order proposed by the referee,it was stamped granted with modifications which were unclear,and the same order was stamped as rejected defective courtesy copy not received by court.meanwhile,some of the individual homeowners depositions were proceeding,out of over that were set.
at the end of,judge vargas retired and the case was reassigned to judge meyer.in july,defendants moved to compel further answers,claiming that the information sought about the meetings at the individual homeowners depositions was not protected by the privilege,since there were no relationships between the association counsel and the individual homeowners.
the association responded that there was not any relationship between its own counsel and the individual homeowners,but that nevertheless,its counsel disclosures to those homeowners were privileged under section,as reasonably necessary for the accomplishment of the purpose for which the association lawyer was consulted.
at the hearing on the motion to compel,judge meyer stated that he could not understand judge vargas orders,which were ambiguous and contradictory.the matter was taken under submission and the motion to compel granted on september,this court can not change judge vargas order reversing the discovery referee determination regarding an relationship between the association counsel and individual homeowners.
this petition followed,asserting that the court erred in granting the motion to compel solely on the ground that it had to follow judge vargas earlier order,which was ambiguous.petitioner seeks orders compelling the trial court to vacate its orders allowing the requested discovery,and asks that we direct the trial court to order adoption of the referee report.the association contends this privilege question is one of first impression that should be considered by this court,before the association or witnesses are required to disclose information it claims is privileged 
we issued a stay,received additional briefing,and issued an order to show cause.oral argument was held and the matter submitted.
discussion 
in this context of association litigation seeking recovery for construction defects in the common areas,we are asked to decide whether privileges extend to communications,for which confidentiality was intended or preserved,between the association counsel and third party nonclients individual homeowners,at association update meetings about the common area litigation,which were held for the individual homeowners.although there may be some differences between the procedural posture of some of these third party nonclients,only some of the individual homeowners have filed the separate sarnecky action seeking damages to their private units,we will treat the association and its litigation counsel communications to individual homeowners at the meetings as raising the same legal issue.were such communications sufficiently confidential,and reasonably necessary for the accomplishment of the purpose for which the association lawyer is consulted,based on common interests in the subject matter of the association litigation updates.

procedural status no reliance on laches 
before analyzing the record in light of the above legal principles,we acknowledge that the sequence of discovery referee recommendations and two sets of superior court rulings have created some confusion on the basis for the rulings and the exact issues to be resolved.defendants complain that the association could have sought mandamus relief earlier,but did not do so until well into the discovery and litigation process,and thus,the petition arguably should be barred by laches.see,johnson city of loma linda cal th,planned parenthood golden gate superior court th.
writ review on the merits is appropriate to evaluate the rulings granting the motion to compel brought by defendants,since they effectively disallowed the claims of privilege raised by the association with respect to the proposed questioning of individual homeowners.it is not necessary to enter into the debate about what judge vargas meant in the rulings he made before he retired in,or about judge meyer subsequent interpretation of what judge vargas must have meant,when judge meyer found it determinative that there was no relationship between the association counsel and individual homeowners.in light of the novel and important issues raised by the petition on the interpretation of section,we decline to take the route of relying on principles of laches to resolve this matter.see lipton,supra,th.
moreover,the association has requested in its petition that this court direct the trial court to order adoption of the referee report.such an intermediate step is not necessary,and instead we exercise our discretion to reach the merits of the privilege questions presented.
eligibility for privilege coveragea.basic statutory criteria evidence code 
two basic situations arise under section for determining whether a confidential communication between a client and lawyer will retain its privileged character.most importantly to the case before us,section provides that confidentiality is retained if such an communication is transmitted in confidence to no third persons other than those who are present to further the interest of the client in the consultation,italics added.together,sections and will permit sharing of privileged information when it furthers the relationship not simply when two or more parties might have overlapping interests.mckesson hboc,superior court th,italics added,citing raytheon superior court d.
in general,section,subdivision a provides guidance for when disclosures operate to waive a privilege.one of its exceptions,section,subdivision d expressly clarifies it is not a waiver of privilege,under the following circumstances a disclosure in confidence of a communication that is protected by a privilege provided by privilege,when disclosure is reasonably necessary for the accomplishment of the purpose for which the lawyer was consulted,is not a waiver of the privilege.oxy resources,supra,th at,italics added see first pacific networks,atlantic mut.ins,both sections and of the california evidence code contain the same concept,whether there is a reasonable necessity for disclosure to a third party,in order to accomplish the purpose of consulting the lawyer.

in a related situation,public policy considerations were enunciated to assist in defining the proper scope of statutory protections of confidential communications.the supreme court in mitchell,supra,cal d,was confronted with a defendant discovery requests that were nominally intended to produce evidence relating to a plaintiff claimed damages,in the form of questioning of the plaintiff about the nature and content of any warnings or information she had received from her attorney about the potential damages she was asserting.id.at.in that case,the plaintiff was claiming injury from the defendants wrongful environmental contamination,including her emotional distress stemming from fears of future physical harm that might be caused from the contamination.id.at.
in the requested discovery in mitchell,defense counsel arguably was seeking to inquire into whether the plaintiff and her counsel had discussed any potential physical harm to her from the contamination,and if so,whether that discussion had contributed to plaintiff distress.mitchell,supra,cal d.in considering privilege,the supreme court balanced the respective interests and concluded that such questioning went too far,because it might very well reveal much of plaintiff investigative efforts and trial strategy.ibid.the plaintiff privilege should protect against any such investigation by opposing counsel into confidential client communications about injury and damages.id.at.
moreover,allowing such proposed discovery into discussions would potentially uphold a harassment tactic whereby defendants are able to shift the focus of the case from damages caused by their actions to damages caused by allegedly inflammatory or false information provided by attorneys t his technique not only obfuscates many of the substantive issues in a case but also frequently places the wrong defendant on trial.mitchell,supra,cal d.permitting such discovery would constitute an unwarranted abrogation of the privilege,that would unjustifiably undermine the proper functioning of the judicial system.id.at.
having set forth these basic principles and policy limitations regarding the protected scope of the privilege,we turn to the more specific questions presented about the application of the common interest doctrine in this situation.
common interest doctrine definition 
although the protection of the privilege is absolute,the protection afforded by the common interest doctrine is qualified,because it depends on the content of the communication t here is no absolute brightline sic test which distinguishes between the parties sic adversarial interests and their common interests.oxy resources,supra,th.
not only the content of the communication must be considered,but also the circumstances of the communication.applying these waiver principles in the context of communications among parties with common interests,it is essential that participants in an exchange have a reasonable expectation that information disclosed will remain confidential.if a disclosing party does not have a reasonable expectation that a third party will preserve the confidentiality of the information,then any applicable privileges are waived.an expectation of confidentiality,however,is not enough to avoid waiver.in addition,disclosure of the information must be reasonably necessary for the accomplishment of the purpose for which the lawyer was consulted,subd.d.thus,f or the common interest doctrine to attach,most courts seem to insist that the two parties have in common an interest in securing legal advice related to the same matter and that the communications be made to advance their shared interest in securing legal advice on that common matter.citation.oxy resources,supra,th at,italics added.
in citizens for ceres superior court th,the court expounded on the rules regarding the nonwaiver principles of sections and.a communication to a lawyer,even where made in the presence of another person,a business associate or joint client,who is present to further the interest of the client in the consultation,and on a matter of joint concern,may retain a privileged character,within the existing scope of the privilege statutes.evidence code sections and,however,make no reference to common interests or joint concerns they refer instead to a reasonable necessity of disclosure.those two sections give rise to the doctrine t he alignment of the parties common interests may mean disclosures between them are reasonably necessary to accomplish the purposes for which they are consulting counsel.citizens for ceres,supra,at.
in smith laguna sur villas community th,smith,the court analyzed discovery demands for privileged information,that were made by appellants as condominium owners and members of their association,regarding litigation materials created by the association.those owners were not individually named as plaintiffs in the association construction defect litigation against developers,so that the owners were not equivalent to the association client that had retained the attorney to bring the lawsuit,and thus the owners could not be allowed to access the privileged information.the court explained,like closely held corporations and private trusts,the client association is the entity that retained the attorney to act on its behalf.id.at,defining client as the person who directly or through an authorized representative,consults a lawyer for the purpose of retaining the lawyer.thus,w here the association sues in its own name without joining with it the individual unit owners,the association,not the unit owners,holds the privilege.miller starr,cal.real estate ed.
in reaching its conclusions,the court in smith,supra,th,relied on wells fargo,supra,cal th,in which no fiduciary exception to the privilege was allowed on behalf of beneficiaries of a trust,who had sought to discover confidential communications between their trustee and the outside trust counsel hired by the trustee.it was immaterial that the trust had paid the attorney such payments do not suffice to create an relationship.smith,supra,at.courts do not enjoy the freedom to restrict california statutory privilege based on notions of policy or ad hoc justification.wells fargo,supra,at.
in smith,supra,th,the court colorfully addressed concerns about group client confidentiality and potentially conflicting loyalties of association counsel,by stating it is no secret that crowds can not keep them.unlike directors,the residents owed no fiduciary duties to one another and may have been willing to waive or breach the privilege for reasons unrelated to the best interests of the association.some residents may have had no defects in their units or may have had familial,personal or professional relationships with the defendants.indeed,it is likely that the developer in the underlying litigation itself may have owned one or more unsold units within the complex.as association points out,o ne can only imagine the sleepless nights an attorney and the board of directors may incur if privileged information is placed in the hands of hundreds of homeowners who may not all have the same goals in mind.with the privilege restricted to an association board of directors,this is one worry,at least,that their lawyers can put to rest.id.at.
homeowners associations obligations civil code criteria 
for purposes of evaluating the proper scope of the privilege,we turn to the statutes governing the association obligations to its members.in former civil code section now,an association that was established to manage a common interest development is granted standing to sue in its own name,on matters concerning damage to the common area,or damage to separate interests that are affected by damage to the common areas,former,repealed by stats,ch,operative.as previously explained,after the association filed its construction defect action in alleging damage to the common areas,individual homeowners hired their own attorneys to file a separate but coordinated action for damage to individual units the sarnecky action.however,the association can seek redress for damage to separate interests that are affected by damage to the common areas.
the duties and powers of a homeowners association are controlled both by statute and by the association governing documents.ostayan,supra,th.in that case,the appellate court observed that the complex relationship between the individual owners and the managing association of a common interest development may depend on the function the association is fulfilling under the facts of each case.lamden la jolla shores clubdominium homeowners cal th.although the individual owner has an economic interest in the proper business management of the development as a whole for the sake of maximizing the value of his or her investment,in other ways,each individual owner,at least while residing in the development,has a personal,not strictly economic,interest in the appropriate management of the development id.at,quoting lamden,supra,at.
as explained already,the act places certain obligations on an association to communicate with individual owners about any proposed construction defect litigation.current civil code section,subdivision a of the act requires the board of an association to provide a written notice to each current member of the association,days prior to the filing of any civil action by the association against the developer,for alleged damage to the common areas,alleged damage to the separate interests that the association is obligated to maintain or repair,or alleged damage to the separate interests that arises out of,or is integrally related to,damage to the common areas or separate interests that the association is obligated to maintain or repair.ibid.such a notice shall specify a meeting will take place to discuss problems that may lead to the filing of a civil action what are the options available to address the problems the time and place of the meeting.ibid.if there are potential statute of limitations problems imminent,the association may give such notice within days after the filing of the action,subd.b this method was evidently used here.
in the ccrs applicable to this property,the association is required not only to give such written notice of intended litigation to association members,but also to obtain a vote of approval by more than percent of the members,before filing the action.ccrs.this provision implements the protections of the individual homeowners economic interests in the value of not only their own individual units,but also the development as a whole.ostayan,supra,th.it anticipates that investigation of common area defects could require individual homeowners to permit access and testing that affect their units.
analysis no waiver found 
in light of the above principles of law,we turn to the record and request for relief in this case.
was confidentiality of communications maintained at meetings 
the common interest doctrine is properly characterized under california law as a nonwaiver doctrine,analyzed under standard waiver principles applicable to the privilege and the work product doctrine.oxy resources,supra,th at,fn.omitted.f or the common interest doctrine to attach,most courts seem to insist that the two parties have in common an interest in securing legal advice related to the same matter and that the communications be made to advance their shared interest in securing legal advice on that common matter.citation.id.at.
defendants argue that any confidentiality of communications at the meetings was initially waived through several different sets of circumstances.first,persons employed by or affiliated with defendants,and who were also individual homeowners,were allowed to attend,and expert consultants attended and spok
