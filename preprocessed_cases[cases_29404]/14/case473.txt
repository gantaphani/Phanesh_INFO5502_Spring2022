under sections a and a of the national labor relations act,employers are obligated to bargain only with unions that have been designated or selected for the purposes of collective bargaining by the majority of the employees in a unit appropriate for such purposes.a see also id.a making it an unfair labor practice to refuse to bargain with a union selected in accordance with section a.in fact,an employer that signs a collective bargaining agreement recognizing a minority union as the exclusive representative of its employees will generally be deemed to have committed an unfair labor practice by interfering with employee rights under nlra section to,to form,join,or assist labor organizations,to bargain collectively through representatives of their own choosing,to engage in other concerted activities,and generally to refrain from any or all such activities.int l ladies garment workers union nlrb,d.even if the employer and union have both acted on a good faith belief of majority status,such agreements are unenforceable because t o countenance such an excuse would place in permissibly careless employer and union hands the power to completely frustrate employee realization of the premise of the its prohibitions will go far to assure freedom of choice and majority rule in employee selection of representatives.garment workers,at.at.

in this case,intervenor southern california pipe trades district council opened negotiations in with petitioner nova plumbing,a residential plumbing contractor.nova president rodney robbins had previously worked for his father company,calta plumbing,and took many of its employees with him to nova when his father retired and closed calta.district council,which had a collective bargaining agreement with calta,threatened litigation if nova refused to bargain with it as well.nova initially responded by petitioning for a board election because robbins believed that many former calta employees were angry that district council had previously agreed to terms under which they received lower wages and benefits than commercial plumbers.after further negotiation,however,nova withdrew its petition and agreed to sign a contract.in return,district council agreed to drop its litigation threat,to provide skilled workers,and to attempt to organize nova nonunion competitors.the contract incorporated a recognition clause from district council master labor agreement 
based upon evidence presented to the contractor by the union,which evidence demonstrates that the union represents an uncoerced majority of the employees of the contractor,and which has been independently verified by a certified public accounting firm satisfactory to the contractor,the contractor hereby recognizes the unions who are signatory hereto as the sole and exclusive collective bargaining representative of all employees of the contractor performing plumbing and piping work as defined in this agreement.

district council filed unfair labor practice charges,claiming that nova had violated nlra sections a and a by refusing to bargain and by making unilateral changes to working conditions after the contract expired.at a hearing before an administrative law judge,robbins testified that he believed the agreement was a section f contract which left him free to walk away upon expiration if the arrangement proved disadvantageous.district council representatives had a very different view,testifying that the agreement memorialized a section a relationship and that nova therefore had a duty to bargain after it expired.the alj assumed arguendo that the expired agreement was a section a contract,but ruled that nova had acted lawfully in refusing to bargain because it had a good faith uncertainty as to district council majority status in june and throughout the contract period.see allentown mack sales,at.at.
