nominal parties are excepted from the requirement that all defendants join in or consent to removal to federal court.this case concerns whether insured contractor hammonds,hammonds is a nominal party in a contribution suit between its insurers.we affirm the district court holding that hammonds is a nominal party for purposes of the nominal party exception to the rule of unanimity governing removal.
this action arises out of allegedly defective roofing work performed by defendant hammonds,a north carolina corporation,on a project in charleston,south carolina the concord west project.the work was completed between early and march.a series of different companies issued hammonds liability insurance between and.plaintiff hartford fire insurance company hartford,the appellant here,insured hammonds from to.the remaining defendants,appellees here,insured hammonds for overlapping or subsequent years assurance company of america zurich from to first financial insurance company first financial from to harleysville mutual insurance company harleysville from to and first mercury insurance company first mercury from to.
hammonds was sued in by homeowners and their association in south carolina state court for the alleged defects in its work on the concord west project.that lawsuit the concord west action was settled on september,with all claims against hammonds related to that construction project being dismissed with prejudice.hartford,harleysville,and zurich each agreed to pay one third of a settlement,subject to each insurer right to subsequently resolve the proper allocation of the settlement through arbitration or litigation.
five days later,harleysville filed a declaratory judgment action in the district court for the eastern district of north carolina north carolina action,joining hammonds and all of the aforementioned insurers as defendants.that suit sought a declaration of the rights and obligations of the insurers with respect to damages arising out of hammonds work on the concord west project,as well as its allegedly defective work on two other projects.on september,hartford filed the present action for a declaratory judgment in south carolina state court.hartford named hammonds and the four other insurers that had covered hammonds as defendants.hartford seeks a declaration of each insurer respective share of the settlement in the concord west action and equitable contribution from the other insurers to the extent that hartford is found to have overpaid its share.
harleysville timely removed this action to the district court for the district of south carolina pursuant to.the other defendant insurers consented to the removal on the same day.hammonds,however,neither consented nor objected to removal,nor claimed an interest in the outcome of the proceeding at that time.upon removal,harleysville filed a motion to dismiss on the grounds that the present action was duplicative of the parallel,north carolina action hartford moved to remand the present case on the basis of hammonds failure to join in or consent to the notice of removal.months later,on february,hammonds filed an untimely answer to hartford complaint in which it asserted an interest in the outcome of the proceeding 
the district court found that hammonds was a nominal party for purposes of the nominal party exception to the rule of unanimity governing removal.the district court determined that the action did not seek any relief from hammonds but merely sought to determine the percentage that each insurer was required to pay of a settlement already agreed to by the insurers on behalf of hammonds.applying two different tests for nominal party status articulated by other circuits,the district court held that it was not possible for hartford to establish a cause of action against hammonds,and that there was no reasonable basis for predicting that hammonds could be held liable in any way.it then dismissed the south carolina suit under the rule.this appeal followed.
we review a district court ruling on matters relating to the propriety of removal de novo.dixon coburg dairy,cir.the burden of demonstrating jurisdiction and therefore the propriety of removal rests with the removing party.id.
a provides that a civil action brought in a state court of which the district courts of the united states have original jurisdiction,may be removed by the defendant or the defendants.to remove to federal court,the defendant or defendants must file a notice of removal.containing a short and plain statement of grounds for removal.id.a.the supreme court has construed these statutes to require all defendants in a case to join in or consent to removal,creating the rule of unanimity.see mayo bd.of educ.of prince george,cir citing lapides bd.of regents of.of.the rule of unanimity is consistent with our obligation to construe removal jurisdiction strictly because of the significant federalism concerns implicated.maryland stadium auth.ellerbe becket,cir internal quotation marks omitted see also shamrock oil gas sheets.the rule of unanimity helps to effectuate congress intent in limiting removal to prevent it from being used too broadly or casually.
the federal courts have,however,long recognized an exception to the rule of unanimity,which states that a nominal party need not consent to removal.see charles alan wright et,fed.prac.proc.juris.ed collecting cases.this nominal party exception ensures that only those parties with a palpable interest in the outcome of a case,and not those without any real stake,determine whether a federal court can hear a case.see tri cities newspapers,tri cities printing pressmen assistants local,int l printing pressmen assistants union of,cir n ominal or formal parties,being neither necessary nor indispensable,are not required to join in the petition for removal.this exception helps to prevent a party from overriding congressionally prescribed bases for removal through strategic pleading.
this court has never defined a nominal party for purposes of the nominal party exception to the rule of unanimity necessary for removal.courts outside of this circuit have devised various tests to define a nominal party.some have required that a defendant be indispensable in order to avoid the nominal party exception.see ryan state bd.of elections of,cir.others have required only that a defendant be indispensable or necessary.see farias bexar cnty.bd.of trustees for mental health mental retardation,cir tri cities newspapers,at.both formulations appear to ask whether in the absence of the defendant,the court can enter a final judgment consistent with equity and good conscience which would not be in any way unfair or inequitable to plaintiff.tri cities newspapers,at internal quotation marks omitted.meanwhile,another line of case law provides that a defendant is nominal if there is no reasonable basis for predicting that it will be held liable.shaw dow brands,cir,holding modified by meridian sec.ins.sadowski,cir see also thorn amalgamated transit union,cir describing nominal defendants as those against whom no real relief is sought internal quotation marks omitted farias bexar cnty,at t he removing party must show that there is no possibility that the plaintiff would be able to establish a cause of action against the defendants in state court internal quotation marks omitted.
all these tests in discussing indispensable parties,necessary parties,or what removing parties must show about parties may provide useful insights but they have strayed from the fundamental inquiry.they what ought to be a straightforward examination of the meaning of the word nominal and the reasons for having the nominal party exception.nominal means simply a party having no immediately apparent stake in the litigation either prior or subsequent to the act of removal.in other words,the key inquiry is whether the suit can be resolved without affecting the nominal defendant in any reasonably foreseeable way.
there are dangers to incorrectly calibrating the scope of the nominal party exception in either direction.if courts broaden the exception so as to disregard too many defendants,there is a possibility not only that the interests
