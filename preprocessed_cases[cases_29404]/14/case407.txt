background 
in late,reno,and swit were beginning the process of developing a residential housing complex in angel fire,new mexico.in order to reduce costs,they wanted to build the homes out of prefabricated,modular segments which would only need to be combined and placed onto a foundation on site.they contacted preferred building systems preferred,a company that specializes in the building of modular homes,about providing the prebuilt segments.preferred,in turn,enlisted the services of earl hilchey,an architect and the president of la resolana,with whom preferred often worked.
in december,lance clay,president of reno,and gary plante,president of swit,met with larry jones,a representative of preferred,and hilchey.the parties have markedly different recollections as to what happened at that meeting.clay claims that,prior to the meeting,he already had a very detailed idea of how the homes should be built.each building should consist of two dwelling units,each with living space and a garage,built in the shape of a u.the garages would occupy the center of the structure and would be joined at the lot line,with the living spaces on either end forming the sides of the aplee.br.at.the exterior was to be a combination of stucco and redwood siding.clay claimed to have designed a basic floor plan and reportedly even knew such details as the location of the dormers,the size and shape of the windows,and the pitch of the roof.at the trial,clay testified that he told all of this to hilchey at the december meeting and even drew a sketch of what he wanted.
according to hilchey,however,neither clay nor plante gave him any specific instructions.he testified that they were looking for a home,no larger than square feet,typical,and that was pretty much it.at.
after this initial meeting,there was an exchange of communications regarding a site development plan and other topics involving the angel fire development.hilchey sent via facsimile at least five sets of architectural plans,each modified from the last and based primarily on communication with plante.hilchey admitted that he did not fax the plans directly to plante rather,he faxed three sets of plans to plante prior legal counsel and two sets of plans to a lawyer who was a potential investor.plante testified that he never received any of the plans.after the spring of,hilchey heard nothing further from either plante or clay.
hilchey also faxed a copy of the final plans to jones of preferred,who prepared a price quotation for plante.jones testified that it was his normal practice to send the architectural drawings along with the quotation.he could not remember,however,whether he did so in this case.plante acknowledges that he received the quotation but denies receiving any drawings with it.
clay submitted a proposal to the village of angel fire for the use of modular homes in his development.receiving a lukewarm reception,he decided to erect homes instead.to that end,clay hired another architect,charles hasford,to draw site plans and architectural plans for the project.as with hilchey,clay claims to have provided hasford a detailed drawing showing what he wanted his homes to look like.
in,hilchey saw what he thought looked like homes built from his architectural plans in clay development in angel fire.hilchey company,la resolana,brought suit against reno,and lance clay,as well as southwest investment trust and gary plante,claiming copyright infringement,violation of the lanham act,a,and violation of the new mexico utpa,stat.la resolana seeks injunctive relief as well as damages.
after holding a bench trial,the district court recorded findings of fact and conclusions of law and entered judgment for reno,and swit on all claims.la resolana timely filed a notice of appeal.
ii.discussion 
on appeal,la resolana argues that reno,and swit infringed la resolana copyright that the district court erred in excluding lay opinion testimony regarding the substantial similarity between la resolana copyrighted work and reno,plans and that the district court erred in entering judgment for reno,and swit on la resolana lanham act and utpa claims.we agree with the district court that la resolana has not established copying as a factual matter.as a result,and for the reasons noted below,la resolana can not prevail on this appeal.
in an appeal from a bench trial,we review the district court factual findings for clear error and its legal conclusions de novo.keys youth,city of olathe,cir.findings of fact are clearly erroneous when they are unsupported in the record,or if after our review of the record we have the definite and firm conviction that a mistake has been made.transwestern publ g multimedia mktg,cir internal quotation marks omitted.if the district court account of the evidence is plausible in light of the record viewed in its entirety,the court of appeals may not reverse it even though convinced that had it been sitting as the trier of fact,it would have weighed the evidence differently.anderson city of bessemer city,d.this admonition applies equally regardless of whether the district court factual findings are based on credibility determinations or on documentary evidence id.at.where there are two permissible views of the evidence,the factfinder choice between them can not be clearly erroneous.this is so even when the district court findings do not rest on credibility determinations,but are based instead on physical or documentary evidence or inferences from other facts.citation omitted.
copyright infringement 
there are two elements to a copyright infringement claim ownership of a valid copyright,and copying of constituent elements of the work that are original.feist publ ns,rural.serv,d.the plaintiff bears the burden of proof on both elements.palladium music,eatsleepmusic,cir.because reno,and swit do not challenge the validity of la resolana copyright we address only the second element.
la resolana must prove that reno,unlawfully appropriated protected portions of the copyrighted work.gates rubber bando chem,cir.this requires proving both that reno,as a factual matter,copied portions of la resolana work and that those elements of the work that were copied were protected expression and of such importance to the copied work that the appropriation is actionable.see jacobsen deseret book,cir.the district court determined that la resolana had failed to prove,as a factual matter,that reno,copied its plans.since we uphold this finding,we need not render any conclusions concerning the second part of the analysis.
direct proof of copying is often hard to come by.see country kids n city slicks,sheen,cir ellis diffie,cir.therefore,a plaintiff can indirectly prove copying in a factual sense by establishing that defendants had access to the copyrighted work and that there are probative similarities between the copyrighted material and the allegedly copied material.country kids city slicks,at.
a plaintiff may meet the initial burden of establishing access by showing that the defendant had a reasonable opportunity to view or an opportunity to copy the allegedly infringed work.autoskill educ.support,cir internal quotation marks omitted see wildlife express carol wright sales,cir.thus,while a plaintiff is not required to demonstrate the defendant actual access to the work,evidence that only creates a bare possibility that the defendant had access is not sufficient.mag jewelry cherokee,cir alterations and internal quotation marks omitted see melville nimmer david nimmer,nimmer on copyright a,at access may not be inferred through mere speculation or con
