date purchaser 
stat.a.the virones never received a disclosure summary.on january,more than two years after signing the purchase agreement,but before closing,the virones gave princeton written notice of their intention to void the purchase agreement pursuant to florida statute c,which permits a buyer to void the contract of sale if a disclosure summary is not provided prior to closing.on may,the virones sent a letter to princeton declaring their election to revoke the purchase agreement due to princeton failure to provide the virones a printed property report pursuant to the ilsfda.princeton failed to acknowledge both letters,and never cancelled or revoked the purchase agreement.princeton and the virones never closed on the town home.
on may,princeton filed a complaint in florida state court seeking specific performance for the virones failure to close on the town home and damages for breach of the purchase agreement.on june,the virones removed the case to the united states district court for the southern district of florida,answered princeton complaint,and filed a counterclaim with four counts.the counts in the counterclaim were for i violation of the ilsfda,ii violation of the florida deceptive and unfair trade practices act,iii cancellation pursuant to florida statute,and iv cancellation based on availability of financing.only counts i and iii are pertinent to this appeal,as the remaining two counts became moot and are not argued on appeal.
on january,the virones filed their first motion for summary judgment on counts iii and iv of their counterclaim,arguing,inter alia,that princeton was the developer and parcel owner of the lot on which their town home was to be constructed,and therefore,princeton was obligated to provide the virones with a disclosure summary substantially similar to the one provided in florida statute,but failed to do so.the district court granted the virones motion for summary judgment on count iii,finding that princeton violated,and rendered count iv and princeton complaint moot.thus,the virones were permitted to void the purchase agreement and recover their deposit.the district court then ordered the parties to submit a stipulated motion as to the remaining issues.the district court granted the stipulated motion,leaving only count i of the virones counterclaim on the violation of the ilsfda at issue.
on april,the virones filed their second motion for summary judgment on count i of their counterclaim,arguing that princeton violated the ilsfda because it was not exempt from providing the virones a property report or disclosing the right to a property report in the purchase agreement.on april,princeton filed a motion for summary judgment on count i of the virones counterclaim,arguing that it was exempt from the ilsfda under a and b because it obligated itself to build the town home within two years and because it did not sell more than twelve town homes in andrews park within one year from the date of the first sale.the district court granted the virones motion for summary judgment and denied princeton,finding that princeton was not exempt from providing the virones with a property report under the ilsfda.although the virones sought rescission of the purchase agreement,the district court found that the statute of limitations had run,and consequently,it awarded damages in the amount of the virones deposit the district court directed the virones to file a motion for final judgment,and the district court granted the motion,as well as attorneys fees and costs.princeton timely appealed.

iii.discussion 
violation of florida statute 
the parties do not dispute that andrews park is governed by andrews park property owners association,and that florida statute applies.section a requires that the developer or parcel owner provide the buyer of a lot governed by a community association with a disclosure summary identical to or substantially similar to the disclosure summary provided in the statute.further,if the buyer does not receive a disclosure summary before executing the contract of sale,
the purchaser may void the contract by delivering to the seller or the seller agent or representative written notice canceling the contract within days after receipt of the disclosure summary or prior to closing,whichever occurs first.this right may not be waived by the purchaser but terminates at closing.
stat.c.it is undisputed that the virones were never presented a disclosure summary by anyone,either before or after the purchase agreement was executed.
in finding that princeton violated,the district court focused its analysis principally on whether princeton qualified as the developer or parcel owner,the entities identified by the statute that must provide the disclosures.the district court conclusively found princeton to be the parcel owner and stated that princeton relationship to the development was sufficient to meet the definition of developer under.on appeal,princeton argues that it is neither the developer nor the parcel owner of the property at issue,but merely the homebuilder.the virones respond that princeton was the developer or parcel owner,as determined by the district court.however,the virones alternatively argue,for the first time on appeal,that even if we find that princeton does not meet these definitions,the virones are still entitled to void the purchase agreement pursuant to c they argue that regardless of who was required to provide a disclosure summary,the virones never received the disclosures,and at the heart of the statute is the importance that the buyers receive the disclosures from someone.we agree with the virones alternative argument on appeal.
section c makes clear that a buyer may void the contract of sale against the seller,even though the seller may not always be the same entity as the developer or parcel owner required to provide the disclosure summary under a.the statute,read plainly as a whole,indicates that a buyer who does not receive the disclosures,regardless of who was required to provide them,is entitled to void the contract of sale by giving notice to the seller under c.the fourth district court of appeal of the state of florida reached this conclusion,in a substantially similar scenario in princeton homes,morgan,dca,so d,june,which we find persuasive.see ernie haire ford,ford motor,cir in rendering a decision based on florida substantive law,w here the state highest court has not spoken to an issue,a federal court must adhere to the decisions of the state intermediate appellate courts absent some persuasive indication that the state highest court would decide the issue otherwise citation and quotation omitted.
in morgan,the buyer found herself in the same factual situation as the virones and entered into a contract with princeton to purchase a town home at andrews park.id.at.the contract she executed was substantially similar in its terms,if not identical,to that executed by the virones.see id.the buyer sued princeton in florida state court alleging that she did not receive the disclosure summary as required by florida statute.id.like the virones,the buyer sent princeton written notice demanding a refund of her deposit and exercised her right to void the contract of sale.id.the trial court held that because the buyer never received a disclosure summary,and closing had not occurred,she had the right to void the contract under c.id.on appeal,the florida court affirmed,stating that s ection could not be clearer in its explanation that if the disclosure summary is not provided to a prospective purchaser before the purchaser executes a contract for the sale of property,the purchaser may void the contract.id.at citation omitted.the court relied on the statute legislative purpose,which is to ensure that prospective purchasers of properties in homeowners associations will receive a disclosure summary.id.more importantly,the court explained 
in light of this statutory purpose,it need not decide whether the duty to provide the disclosure summary fell upon the title owner of the property at the time the contract was executed,or instead whether it fell upon princeton homes as the subsequent owner and prospective seller of the property under the contract.we conclude that regardless of which entity was required to present the disclosure summary,morgan right to void the contract arose because she did not receive the disclosure summary before executing the contract for sale or at any time thereafter.
id.at footnote omitted.
we agree with the reasoning of the fourth district court of appeal of florida and believe that it is the correct interpretation of.even if princeton is not the developer or parcel owner with no duty to provide a disclosure summary,princeton ran the risk that the virones would exercise their right to void the purchase agreement by failing to ensure that the actual developer or parcel owner,whoever they happened to be,timely provided a disclosure summary.therefore,it is of no consequence whether princeton was obligated to provide the virones with a disclosure summary.the virones properly exercised their right to void the contract of sale because they did not receive the required disclosures before closing.
thus,we affirm on grounds other than those provided by the district court and need not decide whether princeton should properly be labeled as the developer or parcel owner for purposes of.see stegmaier trammell,cir finding that an appellate court must affirm the lower court judgment if the result is correct even though it is based upon an improper ground citations omitted 
violation of the interstate land sales full disclosure act 
the parties do not dispute that the ilsfda applies to the sale of the town home,that the virones never received a printed property report pursuant to a b,and that the purchase agreement failed to disclose the virones right to revoke the purchase agreement based on the lack of a property report pursuant to c.when a property report has not been provided to the buyer before executing the contract of sale,such contract or agreement may be revoked at the option of the purchaser or lessee within two years from the date of such signing,and such contract or agreement shall clearly provide this right.c.
the district court found that princeton violated the ilsfda because it did not provide a property report to the virones before the purchase agreement was executed,and princeton was not exempt from the ilsfda pursuant to.on appeal,princeton argues that it did not give a property report to the virones because it was exempt from the ilsfda requirements,pursuant to a and b.
exemption under a 
princeton argues that it was not required to provide the virones with a property report because the purchase agreement and construction agreement obligated princeton to complete construction of the town home within two years.a seller is exempt from providing a property report under the ilsfda if the seller agrees to the sale of land under a contract obligating the seller to erect a residential building thereon within a period of two years.a.the district court found that princeton alleged obligation to complete construction within two years was illusory because it was conditioned upon obtaining a building permit from the city of port lucie by an undetermined date,that such a condition is not the same as a condition based on impossibility or force majeure,and that limiting construction to working days is ambiguous.we agree.
we look to both federal and state law to determine whether the purchase agreement qualifies under the a exemption from the ilsfda.stein paradigm mirasol,llc,cir.we interpret the ilsfda using principles of federal statutory construction because it is a federal statute.id.florida law will inform us about the extent and nature of princeton legally enforceable obligation to fulfill its contractual promise to complete construction within two years.id.a contract is illusory under florida law when one of the promises appears on its face to be so insubstantial as to impose no obligation at all on the says,in effect,i will if i want to.johnson enters.of jacksonville,fpl group,cir citation and quotation omitted.here,princeton obligation to complete construction within working days,which is conditioned upon princeton obtaining a building permit from the city of port lucie,is illusory.see santidrian landmark custom ranches,d,holding that an obligation to complete construction within two years from the date seller obtains a building permit from the appropriate governmental authority was illusory citation omitted.
in santidrian,the district court for the southern district of florida stated that the clause at issue was distinguishable from clauses because the two year period does not begin until seller obtains a building permit,which could also delay completion be
