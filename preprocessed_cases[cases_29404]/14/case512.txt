a developer wanted to build condominiums on a parcel of land.as a condition of obtaining a permit to do so,the city required the developer to set aside condominium units as below market rate housing and make a substantial cash payment to a city fund.the developer proceeded with the construction but challenged in court these requirements pursuant to a statute that permits a developer to proceed with a project while also protest ing the imposition of any fees,dedications,reservations,or other exactions imposed on a development project,subd.a.
we must decide whether section applies.if it does not,it appears another statute would apply,and that statute would make this action untimely.see.specifically,we must decide whether the requirements at issue constitute the imposition of any fees or other exactions under section,subdivision a.the trial court and court of appeal held that this statute only governs fees imposed for the purpose of defraying all or a portion of the cost of public facilities related to the development project,subd.b defining fee.because the protested requirements were imposed for other purposes,the courts further held,section does not apply,and this action is untimely.
we conclude otherwise.even if the requirements at issue here were not fees under section,they were other exactions.accordingly,the statutory scheme permitting a challenge to the requirements while the project proceeds applies here.
factual and procedural history 
we take these facts largely from the court of appeal opinion.
plaintiffs sterling park,and classic communities,collectively,sterling park owned two lots totaling acres on west bayshore road in the city of palo alto the city.sterling park planned to demolish existing commercial improvements and construct residential condominiums on the site.the proposed development was subject to the city below market rate housing program,which is set forth in the palo alto municipal code.section,subdivision a,of that code provides,developers of projects with five or more units must comply with the requirements set forth in program h of the city of palo alto comprehensive plan.
as pertinent here,program h requires that housing projects involving the development of five or more acres must provide at least percent of all units as below market rate units.the developer must agree to one or more of certain requirements or equivalent alternatives that the city accepts.one of the requirements applicable to sterling park project is that of the below market rate units be affordable to households in the to percent of median income range.of the units may be affordable to the higher range of between to percent of the county median income.the developer may provide off site units or vacant land if providing on site units is not feasible.if no other alternative is feasible,the city may accept a cash payment to the city housing development fund in lieu of providing below market rate units or land.the payment for projects of five acres or more is percent of the greater of the actual sales price or fair market price of each unit.the city requires the below market rate units to be sold to qualifying buyers it selects.to implement the requirement,the city takes an option to purchase the units for the specified price,which it generally then assigns to the buyer it selects.
sterling park submitted its initial application for project approval in.the city planning staff found the project would not cause any significant adverse environmental impact,and the city architectural review board recommended approval of the design and site plan in march.
in a letter dated june,the city stated the terms of an agreement between sterling park and the city planning staff under which sterling park agreed to provide below market rate units on the project site and pay fees of percent of the actual selling price or fair market value of the market rate units,whichever was higher.classic communities,vice president executed the letter on june.on that date,the city council approved the project.
the city approved sterling park application for a tentative subdivision map on november,and for a final subdivision map on september.a document entitled regulatory agreement between sterling park,lp and city of palo alto regarding below market rate units was executed on september,and recorded on november.this document referred to and attached the june,letter.
over a year later,when the new units were being finished,the city began requesting conveyance of the designated homes.on july,sterling park submitted a notice of protest to the city,claiming the prior agreements were signed under duress and arguing that the below market rate requirements are invalid.when the city failed to respond to the protest,sterling park filed this action on october.it sought an injunction and a judicial declaration that the below market rate requirements are invalid and the city may not lawfully impose such below market rate affordable housing fees or exactions as a condition of providing building permits or other approvals for the project.its third cause of action cited sections and and sought restitution or equitable relief for the compelled conveyance of houses under restrictive terms.
the city moved for summary judgment on statute of limitations grounds,arguing that the action is untimely under section.the trial court agreed and granted the motion.ultimately,the court entered judgment in the city favor.sterling park appealed.
the court of appeal affirmed the judgment.relying heavily on an earlier decision from the same appellate district trinity park,l.city of sunnyvale th trinity park,the court held that section does not apply to this case,and that the action is untimely under section.
we granted sterling park petition for review to determine which time limits those of section or those of section govern this action.
ii.discussion 
we must decide which of two possible statutes of limitations applies here.
section,part of the subdivision map act see,provides as relevant any action or proceeding to attack,review,set aside,void,or annul the decision of an advisory agency,appeal board,or legislative body concerning a subdivision,or any of the proceedings,acts,or determinations taken,done,or made prior to the decision,or to determine the reasonableness,legality,or validity of any condition attached thereto,including,but not limited to,the approval of a tentative map or final map,shall not be maintained by any person unless the action or proceeding is commenced and service of summons effected within days after the date of the decision.
it seems clear,and no one disputes,that section is broad enough that it would apply unless another statute applies instead.it is also undisputed that this action would be untimely under section the action was commenced more than days after the decision that it challenges.but sterling park argues that another statute,section,governs this case.
section,part of the mitigation fee act,subd.a,provides as relevant 
a any party may protest the imposition of any fees,dedications,reservations,or other exactions imposed on a development project by a local agency by meeting both of the following requirements 
tendering any required payment in full or providing satisfactory evidence of arrangements to pay the fee when due or ensure performance of the conditions necessary to meet the requirements of the imposition.
serving written notice on the governing body of the entity,which notice shall contain all of the following information 
a a statement that the required payment is tendered or will be tendered when due,or that any conditions which have been imposed are provided for or satisfied,under protest.
b a statement informing the governing body of the factual elements of the dispute and the legal theory forming the basis for the protest.
b compliance by any party with subdivision a shall not be the basis for a local agency to withhold approval of any map,plan,permit,zone change,license,or other form of permission,or concurrence incident to,or necessary for,the development project 
d a protest filed pursuant to subdivision a shall be filed at the time of approval or conditional approval of the development or within days after the date of the imposition of the fees,dedications,reservations,or other exactions to be imposed on a development project.each local agency shall provide to the project applicant a notice in writing at the time of the approval of the project or at the time of the imposition of the fees,dedications,reservations,or other exactions,a statement of the amount of the fees or a description of the dedications,reservations,or other exactions,and notification that the day approval period in which the applicant may protest has begun.
any party who files a protest pursuant to subdivision a may file an action to attack,review,set aside,void,or annul the imposition of the fees,dedications,reservations,or other exactions imposed on a development project by a local agency within days after the delivery of the notice.thereafter,notwithstanding any other law to the contrary,all persons are barred from any action or proceeding or any defense of invalidity or unreasonableness of the imposition 
e if the court finds in favor of the plaintiff in any action or proceeding brought pursuant to subdivision d,the court shall direct the local agency to refund the unlawful portion of the payment,with interest at the rate of percent per annum,or return the unlawful portion of the exaction imposed.
a related statute,section,subdivision a,provides as relevant any party on whom a fee,tax,assessment,dedication,reservation,or other exaction has been imposed,the payment or performance of which is required to obtain governmental approval of a development or development project,may protest the establishment or imposition of the fee,tax,assessment,dedication,reservation,or other exaction as provided in section.
sterling park argues that section applies here.it further argues that this action is timely under that statute because the city never provided the notice that section,subdivision d,requires invoking the rule of statutory construction that a special statute dealing expressly with a particular subject controls and takes priority over a general statute,one court has held that when section does apply,its time limits govern the case,not those of the more general section.branciforte heights,llc city of santa cruz th.we agree.this construction comports with the legislature understanding that the mitigation fee act generally governed developer protests against fees imposed upon developments.id.at.
accordingly,we must decide whether section applies.if it does,then section does not apply contrariwise,if section does not apply,then section does.
the legislature originally enacted the substance of section in as government code,former section.stats,ch,bill reg.sess.senate bill see shapell industries,governing board th.after reviewing the legislative history,the shapell industries court explained the legislative purpose behind the enactment.prior to the enactment of this statute,a developer could not challenge the validity of fees imposed on a residential development without refusing to pay them.pfeiffer city of la mesa d.since payment is a condition of obtaining the building permit,a challenge meant that the developer would be forced to abandon the project.the bill was drafted to correct this situation.it provided a procedure whereby a developer could pay the fees under protest,obtain the building permit,and proceed with the project while pursuing an action to challenge the fees.if the action were successful,the fees would be refunded with interest.shapell industries,governing board,supra,at.
sterling park argues that this purpose applies here it should be allowed to pay the required amount or ensure performance of the below market rate requirements see,subd.a under protest and proceed with the project while pursuing an action to challenge the requirements.the city argues,on the other hand,that the statute does not apply,and sterling park had to delay the construction project as the price of challenging the requirements.
the question concerning section applicability comes down to this are the requirements at issue any fees,dedications,reservations,or other exactions under section,subdivision a the court of appeal held that they are not.
trinity park,supra,th,the case on which the court of appeal primarily relied in reaching its conclusion,supports the city argument.trinity park,and the court of appeal here,interpreted the phrase any fees,dedications,reservations,or other exactions as being limited to fees as defined in section,subdivision b a monetary exaction that is charged by a local agency to the applicant in connection with approval of a development project for the purpose of defraying all or a portion of the cost of public facilities related to the development project italics added.the court of appeal also held that the requirements at issue here were not imposed for the purpose of defraying the cost of facilities related to the proposed development.
in reaching its conclusion,the trinity park court noted that the mitigation fee act,which includes section,does not define the term exaction.trinity park,supra,th at.in seeking its own definition,and reading section in the context of the overall statutory scheme,the court cited several provisions of the mitigation fee act that use the word exaction or exactions in the context of defraying the cost of services or facilities related to a project.trinity park,at citing,subd.b,subd a,and,subd.b.it viewed these statutes use of this word in that context as meaning that section is limited to that context given the mitigation fee act express references to a fee or exaction imposed to defray the cost of public facilities related to the development,and the express requirement that a fee or exaction not exceed a reasonable cost,we find that the plain language of the pertinent provisions of the mitigation fee act shows that the legislature intended the day limitations period provided by section,subdivision d to apply to an exaction imposed for the purpose of defraying all or a portion of the cost of public facilities related to the development project.trinity park,supra,at,quoting,subd.b.
the trinity park court also cited a statement in one of our cases that the term fees,as used in section,applies only to development fees that alleviate the effects of development on the community and does not include fees for specific regulations or services.barratt american,city of rancho cucamonga cal th,barratt.it determined that what we said about fees also applies to an other exaction under the canon of statutory construction knows as ejusdem generis trinity park,supra,th at.
the canon of ejusdem generis simply means that if a statute contains a list of specified items followed by more general words,the general words are limited to those items that are similar to those specifically listed.clark superior court cal th.it implies the addition of similar after the word other.scalia garner,reading law the interpretation of legal texts.
the trinity park court explained its view of how the canon applied there applying the rule of ejusdem generis to the enumeration of fees,dedications,reservations,or other exactions in section,it is apparent that exactions is a more general word that follows a list of specified items fees,dedications,and reservations.the meaning of the phrase other exactions must therefore be limited to exactions of like kind and character as the fees,dedications and reservations listed in section that are imposed for the purpose of defraying all or a portion of the cost of public facilities related to the development project,subd.b or,as stated by the california supreme court,to alleviate the effects of development on the community barratt,supra,cal th at.trinity park,supra,th at.
the trinity park court also viewed the legislative history behind section as showing the legislature intended that the mitigation fee act would allow a developer to challenge a fee,dedication,reservation or other exaction imposed on a development project and obtain a refund where the exaction exceeded the cost or burden of the project.trinity park,supra,th at.accordingly,the court stated,an exaction constitutes an other exaction within the meaning of the mitigation fee act only where the exaction was imposed by a local agency as a condition of approval of a development project and for the purpose of defraying all or a portion of the cost of public facilities related to the of public facilities related to the development project,subd.b see barratt,supra,cal th at.ibid.
the trinity park court erred in interpreting the term other exactions so narrowly.it is certainly true that the legislature intended to allow a developer to challenge a fee or exaction that exceeded the cost or burden of the project.but nothing in the statutory language,the statutory context,or the statute purpose suggests it is limited to that situation.trinity park interpretation is contrary to other courts far more reasonable interpretation and would lead to absurd results the legislature can not have intended.
trinity park used the canon of ejusdem generis to conclude that section words any fees,dedications,reservations,or other exactions mean nothing more than fees as defined in section,subdivision b.but this view deprives the words any and or other exactions of all meaning.as we said in interpreting another statute within the mitigation fee act,t he use of the word any and the inclusion of several disjunctives to link essentially synonymous words all serve to broaden the applicability of the provision.utility cost management indian wells valley water dist.cal th,referring to,italics added.the words any other exactions must have some meaning to broaden the statute reach beyond merely a specific definition of fees.
another court also applied the canon of ejusdem generis to these same words and reached a quite different result.in fogarty city of chico th fogarty,a city council had precluded a subdivision developer from building on a certain portion of its property.the developer sued,purporting to use section protest procedures.as here,the question arose whether section applied.relying on the words or other exactions,the developer had argued that the statute governed the use restriction the city council had imposed.the court of appeal disagreed,in part due to its own application of the canon of ejusdem generis.after explaining what the canon is,the court noted that the specific terms in section all involve divesting a developer of either money or a possessory interest in the subject property.the present land use conditions at issue do not result in either consequence they are simply a restriction on the manner in which plaintiffs may use their property.fogarty,supra,at,italics added.
fogarty also relied on the analysis of an earlier decision interpreting this same statutory language.williams communications city of riverside th williams.as fogarty explained,williams had found that a assessment imposed in connection with a permit to lay cable in conduit under city streets was not a fee but was nonetheless an exaction within the meaning of section.fogarty,supra,th at.
in williams,the trial court had ruled the assessment did not come within section because the city did not purport to impose the subject license fee on plaintiff to mitigate or defray the cost of any alleged impacts on public improvements or facilities.williams,supra,th at.the court of appeal reversed.citing section,subdivision b,the court agreed that the assessment was not a fee within the meaning of this definition because it was not assessed for the purpose of defraying the cost of the project.williams,supra,at.but it determined the assessment was an other exaction under section,subdivision a.as did the trinity park court,the williams court noted that the statutes do not define exaction.so it turned to other sources for a definition.t he term is generally defined to include a compensation arbitrarily or wrongfully demanded.black law dict.ed,webster new internat.dict,t he levying or demanding of some benefit as a fee or gratuity that is not lawfully or properly due.williams,supra,at.the court found that a certain statute had prohibited certain charges.due partly to this definition,it also held that the legislature used the collective term other exactions in section to include all such prohibited charges.ibid.
the williams court rejected the argument that the mitigation fee act only applies to fees,and not anything else.this argument derives from the definition of fee in section.while we agree that the payment was not a fee,as defined in section,subdivision b,it was an other exaction as defined in sections and.because the sum charged was an other exaction,the mitigation fee act is applicable.williams,supra,th at.
the fogarty court concluded that the definition cited in williams indicates that the usual and ordinary meaning of the word exaction,the first step in the interpretation of a statute citation,does not include land use restrictions,which are not any form of payment.fogarty,supra,th at,italics added.accordingly,fogarty held that section,and not section,governed the challenge to the use restriction of that case.fogarty,supra,at.
in combination,williams and fogarty indicate that the term other exactions under section at least includes actions that divest the developer of money or a possessory interest in property,but it does not include land use restrictions.this interpretation conforms to the statute plain language far better than does trinity park excessively narrow interpretation.divesting the developer of money or a possessory interest is similar to imposing a fee,dedication,or reservation.this interpretation also conforms to the legislative purpose behind the statute.
we have explained that the mitigation fee act sets forth procedures for protesting the imposition of fees and other monetary exactions imposed on a development by a local agency.as its legislative history evinces,the act was passed by the legislature in response to concerns among developers that local agencies were imposing development fees for purposes unrelated to development projects.ehrlich city of culver city cal th,italics added,quoting centex real estate city of vallejo th.we described the language in section that is essentially identical to the relevant language in section as a broadly formulated and unqualified authorization that is consistent with the view that the legislature intended to require all protests to a development fee that challenge the sufficiency of its relationship to the effects attributable to a development project regardless of the legal underpinnings of the protest to be channeled through the administrative procedures mandated by the act.ehrlich city of culver city,supra,at.
under trinity park interpretation,a developer may pay under protest a fee charged to defray the cost of facilities related to the development and then challenge the fee as excessive while proceeding with the development but it may not so challenge any other fee or exaction.however,the legislature was not concerned merely about excessive fees but also about fees for purposes unrelated to the project.ehrlich city of culver city,supra,cal th at.the legislature did not want developers to have to choose between either paying the fee with no recourse or delaying the project while challenging the fee,as previous law had required.shapell industries,governing board,supra,th at.but trinity park interpretation would mean section does not apply to fees imposed for purposes entirely unrelated to the project.under that interpretation,if a fee or other exaction is not merely excessive but truly arbitrary,the developer would either have to pay it with no recourse,or delay the entire development to challenge the fee or exaction.in other words,the more unreasonable the fee or exaction,the less recourse the developer would have.this perverse interpretation is not only contrary to legislative intent,it is contrary to the broad language any fees,dedications,reservations,or other exactions the legislature used in defining section reach.
the williams court agreed with the developer that u nder the trial court reading of the statute,no illegal monetary charge would fall within the purview of the statute,yet the very purpose of the statute is to challenge the lawfulness of m
