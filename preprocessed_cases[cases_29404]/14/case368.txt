vincent and janet dressel the dressels are developers who remodel and convert private homes into student residences.a group of homeowners and community organizations collectively,logan neighborhood,concerned that the dressels construction was degrading and devaluing the historic character of their neighborhood,brought suit in federal district court seeking injunctive and declaratory relief.logan neighborhood principally contends that the city alleged failure to enforce provisions of its zoning code intended to preserve historic districts violated the fourteenth amendment due process clause.notwithstanding logan neighborhood understandable concerns about the aesthetics and ambiance of the neighborhood,we conclude it has not stated a federal constitutional claim.although not preempted by the fifth amendment takings clause,see crown point,city of sun valley,cir,logan neighborhood due process claim nonetheless fails.its other claims also fail,so we affirm the district court judgment against logan neighborhood.
the mission avenue historic district district lies just north of gonzaga university in the city of spokane,washington spokane.the district is listed on the national register of historic places,a designation conferred by the secretary of the interior pursuant to the national historic preservation act of nhpa.see a.it is architecturally noteworthy because it includes a significant collection of late and early century houses located on one of the city oldest landscaped boulevards.on both sides of mission avenue are a variety of queen anne,four square,craftsman,and bungalow style houses that reflect the substantial architecture of the period and the original suburban character of the area.
in march,spokane granted the dressels a building permit to construct a duplex addition to east mission,a,four square house located within the district and inventoried on the district nomination for the national register of historic places.the dressels demolished an existing garage on the property and erected a dormitory building attached to the original house.
we summarize the municipal ordinances that logan neighborhood alleges have been violated.in,the city amended the spokane municipal code smc to provide criteria and procedures for the management of historic landmarks.a newly created historic landmarks commission was charged with the stewardship of historic and properties to effect the recognition and preservation of such properties.two of its responsibilities are relevant here reviewing applications for certificates of appropriateness,as provided by smc,and reviewing requests for administrative special permits,as provided by smc.see smc c d,f.
smc requires owners to obtain a certificate of appropriateness for work that affects the exterior of property within an historic district or for development or new construction within an historic district.in evaluating an application for a certificate of appropriateness,the historic landmarks commission uses the secretary of the interior standards for rehabilitation and other general guidelines established and adopted by the commission.smc b.the owner of a property and the commission may negotiate different management standards for a specific piece of property,subject to the approval of the spokane city council.see smc.
smc provides for special development standards that apply only to those historic districts for which defining characteristics have been prepared by the landmarks commission,and those structures or properties listed in the national register of historic places.when these standards apply,proposed construction requires an administrative special permit from the director of planning services.the historic landmarks commission make s recommendations concerning the approval or denial of the special permit.smc c f.it issues a certificate of appropriateness in support of approval only if the construction is of a character which is consistent with the defining characteristics of the historic district,or the department of interior standards in the case of structures or properties listed in the national register but not located within an historic district.smc d b.if no action is taken within days,the application is deemed approved.smc d c.in any event,the commission recommendation will not otherwise preclude the director of planning services from reaching a contrary decision upon consideration of other factors of public interest.id.
the dressels did not seek a certificate of appropriateness or an administrative special permit for their development of the east mission property,nor has spokane taken any steps to require them to do so.logan neighborhood alleges that the dressels construction has compromised the historic character of the mission avenue historic district,resulting in harm to its cultural,architectural,educational,recreational,aesthetic,historic,and economic interests.its complaint asserts three claims that spokane violated and the due process clause of the fourteenth amendment by not enforcing the spokane municipal code that spokane and the dressels violated the national historic preservation act and that spokane and spokane employees violated the spokane municipal code.the district court granted spokane motion for summary judgment and the dressels motion to dismiss.

due process clause 
logan neighborhood complains that spokane and its employees failed to enforce the spokane municipal code and take action sufficient to protect the mission avenue historic district.spokane alleged failure to discharge its mandatory duties under the spokane municipal code was,logan neighborhood asserts,arbitrary,capricious,and not in accordance with the procedure required by law.by issuing a building permit to the dressels without first requiring that they obtain a certificate of appropriateness and an administrative special permit,spokane allegedly deprived logan neighborhood of constitutionally protected property interests.
as we shall explain,we agree with logan neighborhood that the takings clause of the constitution does not invariably preempt a real property owner challenge under the due process clause.see crown point,at.a plaintiff must do more than clear this initial hurdle to state a cognizable due process claim,however.because spokane conduct did not deprive logan neighborhood of a constitutionally cognizable property interest,we affirm the district court entry of summary judgment in favor of the city.
preemption by the takings clause 
relying on squaw valley dev.goldberg,cir,and armendariz penman,cir en banc,spokane asserts that any claim that governmental action caused a diminution in the value of real property involves the takings clause,not the due process clause.we have rejected this very argument.see,north pacifica llc city of pacifica,cir action apartment ass n,santa monica rent control,cir crown point,at equity lifestyle,county of san luis obispo,cir.expressly repudiating squaw valley suggestion that a substantive due process challenge brought in the context of regulating use of real property might not be viable,we recently held that the armendariz line of cases can no longer be understood to create a blanket prohibition of all substantive due process claims.action apartment,at internal quotation marks omitted.accordingly,we have no difficulty concluding that the takings clause does not foreclose altogether a due process claim like logan neighborhood.see crown point,at.logan neighborhood does not seek compensation for an otherwise proper interference amounting to a taking,but rather invalidation of a land use action that is so arbitrary or irrational that it runs afoul of the due process clause.lingle chevron,d citing county of sacramento lewis,d see also crown point,at.
logan neighborhood would have us stop there,reverse the district court judgment and remand for further proceedings.we decline to do so because logan neighborhood has not stated a viable claim on either a substantive due process or a procedural due process theory 
substantive due process 
to state a substantive due process claim,the plaintiff must show as a threshold matter that a state actor deprived it of a constitutionally protected life,liberty or property interest.see action apartment,at.logan neighborhood and allegations do not suffice.the constitution generally does not require the state to protect the life,liberty,and property of its citizens against invasion by private actors.deshaney winnebago county dep t of soc,d.consequently,the state failure to protect an individual from harms inflicted by persons not acting under color of law will not ordinarily give rise to liability.huffman county of los angeles,cir logan neighborhood does not argue that the dressels were themselves acting under color of example,that they conspired with spokane officials in pursuit of a common end,see franklin fox,cir when they undertook their construction.see supra note.under these circumstances,spokane had no independent constitutional duty to safeguard the dressels neighbors from the negative,aesthetic or the dressels construction project.see gagliardi vill.of pawling,cir citing deshaney and explaining that substantive due process does not generally require government to enforce laws against private wrong doers gini las vegas metro.police dep t,cir same.
logan neighborhood urges that spokane applied the law improperly and therefore took an affirmative step beyond simply not enforcing it at all.it contends that spokane unlawfully and arbitrarily issued a building permit to the dressels because it did not first require them to obtain a certificate of appropriateness and administrative special permit.we do not agree that the issuance of a building permit to the dressels made their conduct fairly attributable to spokane in the sense required for liability.without more,spokane m ere approval of or acquiescence in the dressels construction is not sufficient to justify holding it responsible for that construction under the terms of the fourteenth amendment.blum yaretsky,d 
but even if logan neighborhood could show,for example,that the decrease in value of its homes caused by the dressels construction amounted to a governmental deprivation of a property we hold above that it can not,on these substantive due process claim would fail for the independent reason that it has not alleged executive action on spokane part that rises to the level of the constitutionally arbitrary.the supreme court has long eschewed heightened scrutiny when addressing substantive due process challenges to government regulation that does not impinge on fundamental rights.lingle,at.see also halverson skagit county,cir.accordingly,the irreducible minimum of a substantive due process claim challenging land use action is failure to advance any legitimate governmental purpose.north pacifica llc,at see dodd hood river county,cir.the exceedingly high burden required to show that spokane or its employees behaved in a constitutionally arbitrary fashion has not been met here.see matsuda city county of honolulu,cir internal quotation marks omitted.
when executive action like a discrete permitting decision is at issue,only egregious official conduct can be said to be arbitrary in the constitutional sense it must amount to an abuse of power lacking any reasonable justification in the service of a legitimate governmental objective.lewis,at.see city of cuyahoga falls buckeye cmty.hope,d rejecting substantive due process claim because city engineer refusal to issue building permits in no sense constituted egregious or arbitrary government conduct.official decisions that rest on an erroneous legal interpretation are not necessarily constitutionally arbitrary.see collins city of harker heights,d brittain hansen,cir.logan neighborhood contrary,and erroneous,assumption that every state law violation invariably gives rise to a substantive due process claim is inconsistent with the principle that substantive due process is not a font of tort law that superintends all official decision making.see lewis,at.
the conduct logan neighborhood routine,even if perhaps unwise or legally erroneous,executive decision to grant a a building short of being constitutionally arbitrary.there is no suggestion,for instance,of a sudden change in course,malice,bias,pretext or,indeed,anything more than a lack of due care on spokane part compare kawaoka city of arroyo grande,cir rejecting substantive due process claim when plaintiff merely assert ed that decision was arbitrary and pretextual without providing any evidence,with del monte dunes at monterey,city of monterey,cir concluding that there was triable issue of fact when city approved project subject to conditions,plaintiff fulfilled those conditions and then city abruptly changed course and rejected the plan,giving only broad conclusory reasons.it is at least fairly debatable that spokane rationally furthered its legitimate interest in facilitating residential housing in a residential neighborhood by issuing a building permit to the dressels.see halverson,at internal quotation marks omitted.when reviewing a substantive due process challenge,this suffices our task is not to balance the public interest supporting the government action against the severity of the private deprivation.kawaoka,at.
we reject as an erroneous legal conclusion logan neighborhood assertion that spokane and its employees acted in a constitutionally arbitrary manner.see western mining council watt,cir.for this reason,too,we hold that it has not stated a substantive due process claim.
procedural due process 
we are also not convinced by logan neighborhood argument that it has been deprived of procedural due process because it did not have fair notice and an opportunity to be heard before spokane issued the dressels a building permit.logan neighborhood claims a constitutionally protected property interest in the denial of the permit unless the city compl ied with the spokane municipal code applicable to historic districts.it contends that the historic preservation provisions obliged spokane to hold a public design review taking into account the mission avenue historic district and complying with the certificate of appropriateness and administrative special permit requirements even if logan neighborhood interpretation of the spokane municipal code is parties dispute whether construction in the district is subject to those additional has not stated a viable claim.
the claim is an unusual one more typically,the plaintiff asserts that it personally was denied a permit without due process of law,not that someone else was granted a permit without the decisionmaker following the procedure established by state law.see gagliardi,at describing argument as rather unique see generally dumas kipp,cir citing town court nursing,d,and noting distinction between direct and indirect beneficiaries of government regulation assuming without deciding that a property owner ever could have a constitutionally protected interest in the proper application of zoning restrictions to neighboring properties,see id.at,we conclude that logan neighborhood procedural due process claim fails because spokane historic preservation provisions do not contain mandatory language that significantly constrains the decisionmaker discretion.jacobson hannifin,cir.
