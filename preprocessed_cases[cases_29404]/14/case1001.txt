this dispute between one primary liability insurer and another primary insurer that also provides the applicable excess insurance policy comes to us on certified questions from the united states court of appeals for the fifth circuit.pursuant to article v,section of the texas constitution and texas rule of appellate procedure,we answer the following questions 
two insurers,providing the same insured applicable primary insurance liability coverage under policies with million limits and standard provisions one insurer also providing the insured coverage under a million excess policy,cooperatively assume defense of the suit against their common insured,admitting coverage.the insurer also issuing the excess policy procures an offer to settle for the reasonable amount of million and demands that the other insurer contribute its proportionate part of that settlement,but the other insurer,unreasonably valuing the case at no more than,contributes only,although it could contribute as much as without exceeding its remaining available policy limits.as a result,the case settles without an actual trial for million funded million by the insurer which also issued the excess policy and by the other insurer.
in that situation is any actionable duty owed directly or by subrogation to the insured rights to the insurer paying the million by the underpaying insurer to reimburse the former respecting its payment of more than its proportionate part of the settlement 
if there is potentially such a duty,does it depend on the underpaying insurer having been negligent in its ultimate evaluation of the case as worth no more than,or does the duty depend on the underpaying insured evaluation having been sufficiently wrongful to justify an action for breach of the duty of good faith and fair dealing for denial of a first party claim,or is the existence of the duty measured by some other standard 
if there is potentially such a duty,is it limited to a duty owed the overpaying insurer respecting the it paid on the settlement under its excess policy 
liberty mut.ins.ins,cir.we answer the first question in the negative,and therefore do not reach the second and third questions.
background 
in november,an automobile accident occurred in the construction zone of a state of texas highway project.a westbound car driven by tony cooper on the lanes narrowed by construction crossed into oncoming traffic and collided with an eastbound car driven by james boutin and occupied by his family.all members of the boutin family suffered substantial injuries.kinsel industries was the general contractor on the highway project.crabtree barricades was kinsel subcontractor responsible for signs and dividers.the boutin family sued cooper,the state,kinsel,and crabtree in the state district court of liberty county,texas,for damages resulting from the accident.
kinsel was the named insured under liberty mutual insurance company million comprehensive general liability cgl policy.liberty mutual also provided kinsel with million in excess liability insurance.crabtree was the named insured under insurance company million cgl policy.policy identified kinsel as an additional insured for liability arising from crabtree work.kinsel,therefore,was a covered insured under two cgl policies,both of which provided kinsel with million in indemnity coverage for the underlying suit.the insurers had no contract between them that was implicated by the automobile accident.
the cgl policies contained identical other insurance clauses providing for equal or pro rata sharing up to the respective policy limits if the loss is covered by other primary insurance 
other insurance.
if other valid and collective insurance is available to the insured for a loss we cover under coverages a bodily injury and property damage liability or b of this coverage part,our obligations are limited as follows 
primary insurance 
if this insurance is primary our obligations are not affected unless any of the other insurance is also primary.then,we will share with all that other insurance by the method described in below.
method of sharing 
if all of the other insurance permits contribution by equal shares,each insurer contributes equal amounts until it has paid its applicable limit of insurance or none of the loss remains,whichever comes first.
if any of the other insurance does not permit contribution by equal shares,we will contribute by limits.under this method,each insurer share is based on the ratio of its applicable limit of insurance to the total applicable limits of insurance of all insurers.
each policy also contained a voluntary payment clause a subrogation clause and a version of the standard no action clause 
liberty mutual and do not dispute that each owed some portion of kinsel defense and indemnification.the insurers agreed that a total verdict for the boutins against all defendants would be around to million,but they disagreed on the settlement value of the case against kinsel.initially both insurers estimated kinsel percentage of fault between ten percent and fifteen percent,but as the case progressed liberty mutual increased its estimate to sixty percent.after repeated refusals by to increase its contribution to a settlement,liberty mutual agreed at a mediation with the boutins to settle on behalf of kinsel for million sixty percent of a million anticipated verdict.liberty mutual demanded contribute half,but continued to calculate the settlement value of the case against kinsel at and agreed to pay only.liberty mutual,therefore,funded the remaining million,paying more than its million cgl policy limit.liberty mutual reserved the right to seek recovery against for its portion of the settlement.sometime later,before trial,settled the boutins claim against crabtree for.liberty mutual sued in the judicial district court of dallas county,texas,seeking to recover pro rata share of the sum paid to settle the boutin family claim against kinsel.timely removed the case to federal court on diversity grounds.after a bench trial,the united states district court for the northern district of texas concluded that liberty mutual was entitled through subrogation to recover from.liberty mut.ins.ins,d.relying on general agents insurance of america home insurance of illinois,antonio,pet.dism by agr,the district court determined that each insurer owed a duty to act reasonably in exercising its rights under the cgl policies.liberty mut,d at.it found that was objectively unreasonable in assessing kinsel share of liability,and that liberty mutual was reasonable in assessing the same and in accepting the boutins settlement offer.id.at.specifically,the district court stated that recalcitrance to consider any change,despite the changing circumstances,was unreasonable,causing it to unreasonably assess its insured exposure,while on the other hand liberty mutual,b y agreeing to settle for million resolved the case within policy limits,based on a reasonable estimation of kinsel liability,and avoided the real potential of joint and several liability.id.at.
therefore,the district court concluded that,whether apportioned pro rata or in equal shares,was liable in subrogation for,of the million settlement with kinsel.id.at because already paid of its million policy limit in settlement for the suit against kinsel and for the suit against crabtree,the district court ordered to pay only.id.although this amount is short of share of the kinsel settlement,the district court found no justification for increasing total liability above its million policy limit.id.appealed,and the fifth circuit certified questions of law to this court.we accepted the certified questions.
ii.discussion 
liberty mutual defends the district court award on grounds that it is entitled to reimbursement through the contractual subrogation clause in its cgl policy and through the type of equitable subrogation applied in general agents.liberty mutual argues it is subrogated to the contractual right of kinsel to enforce language in policy that places a duty on to defend any claim or suit and pay an equal or pro rata share of settlement.liberty mutual also contends it is subrogated to the common law right of kinsel to have act reasonably when handling an insured reasonable negotiation and participation in settlement.the latter suggests we expand or create a modified stowers duty in the circumstances of this case.
contends that it did not breach any recognized contractual or common law duty to kinsel to which liberty mutual may be subrogated.further argues that it owed no direct duty to liberty mutual upon which reimbursement may be based.any new duty in this context created by general agents and adopted by the district court,continues,is contrary to texas law.
specifically,with respect to subrogation,denies that kinsel has an enforceable contract right to which liberty mutual may be subrogated.explains that because it complied with its contractual duty to timely assume defense of the suit against kinsel and acknowledged policy coverage,therefore liberty no contract claim against.relies on the voluntary payment and clauses in its policy to limit its liability to the amounts it consented to pay.
adds that its only common law duty to kinsel in this third party context was the stowers duty to accept a reasonable settlement offer within policy limits from the boutins,or else be liable for any excess judgment against kinsel.see stowers furniture am.indem.comm app,holding approved.ins.head indus.coatings,superceded by statute.claiming there was no offer within policy limits and no excess judgment,asserts stowers can not apply in this case.
asserting that no direct action exists between in texas,points to traders general insurance hicks rubber,and american centennial insurance canal insurance.in hicks rubber,we held that a direct contribution action does not exist between when their policies contain other insurance clauses.at.similarly in canal,the court declined to recognize a direct action between an excess liability insurer and a primary liability insurer.at.adds that the lack of litigation in texas between insurers disconfirms any need to create a right of reimbursement between them.
liberty mutual claim for reimbursement involves the contractual and common law duties of an insurer in two distinct scenarios.the first scenario involves the ability of one to compel a second proportionate participation in the settlement of a third party claim.the second scenario,which arises from the first through liberty mutual claim of subrogation,involves the ability of an insured to compel an insurer proportionate participation in the settlement of a third party claim.because no statute applies in the third party context,the scenarios are matters of common law contract and tort.
we agree with and conclude that liberty mutual is not entitled to reimbursement because there is no direct duty of reimbursement between these insurers,and because kinsel has no rights against to which liberty mutual may be subrogated.we disapprove of general agents to the extent it would provide recovery to an overpaying insurer in the context presented.
contribution 
even though liberty mutual does not expressly argue for a right of contribution,its reliance on general agents necessarily implies such.thus,we analyze whether liberty mutual has a direct action for reimbursement under a right of contribution from.
we recognized long ago in hicks rubber the general rule that,if two or more insurers bind themselves to pay the entire loss insured against,and one insurer pays the whole loss,the one so paying has a right of action against his,or,for a ratable proportion of the amount paid by him,because he has paid a debt which is equally and concurrently due by the other insurers.hicks rubber,at.the right of action is one of contribution,the elements of which require that the several insurers share a common obligation or burden and that the insurer seeking contribution has made a compulsory payment or other discharge of more than its fair share of the common obligation or burden.employers cas.trans.ins,citing d contribution.
we also recognized in hicks rubber,however,that this direct claim for contribution between disappears when the insurance policies contain other insurance or pro rata clauses.at.a pro rata clause operates to ensure that each insurer is not liable for any greater proportion of the loss than the coverage amount in its policy bears to the entire amount of insurance coverage available.id.at.the effect of the pro rata clause precludes a direct claim for contribution among insurers because the clause makes the contracts several and independent of each other.id.with independent contractual obligations,the do not meet the common obligation requirement of a contribution contractually agreed with the insured to pay only its pro rata share of a covered loss the did not contractually agree to pay each other pro rata share.employers cas,at.in addition,the paying more than its contractually agreed upon proportionate share does so voluntarily that is,without a legal obligation to do so.id.at.thus,a paying more than its proportionate share can not recover the excess from the other.hicks rubber,at.the effect is not the same with respect to the insured right of recovery.when an insured is covered by multiple policies containing pro rata clauses,and the insured has not been fully indemnified,the insured may enforce this contractual obligation to recover the multiple insurers shares of the covered loss,so long as the shares are within the respective insurers policy limits.see id.at.
the cgl policies at issue here contain pro rata clauses.liberty mutual and contractually agreed in their respective policies to pay a proportionate share of kinsel covered loss up to million.the did not,however,contract with each other to create obligations between themselves or to pay each other proportionate share of kinsel loss.there is no contractual right of contribution between them,and the presence of the pro rata clauses in the cgl policies precludes an equitable contribution claim.in this situation,no contractual obligations exist between to apportion between themselves the payment on behalf of the insured,and we are not persuaded to create such an obligation under the common law.canal,at declining to recognize an excess insurer right to bring a direct action for reimbursement from a primary insurer.
this conclusion is contrary to the holding of the san antonio court of appeals in general agents,which appears to have recognized a new duty between to reasonably exercise their rights under an insurance policy given the totality of the circumstances.at.there,two insurers,general agents insurance company of america,gainsco and the home insurance company of illinois home,concurrently held identical million policies in favor of power equipment.id.at.it is unclear from the opinion whether the policies contained pro rata clauses.still,both insurers acknowledged coverage and provided defense in a personal injury suit against power equipment.id.at.the insurers differed in their assessment of prevailing at trial.id.home was willing to offer million in settlement,while gainsco would offer no more than.id.home settled for million,an amount funded million by home and by gainsco.id.home sued gainsco for one half the million settlement less the paid by gainsco,and recovered judgment based on the jury finding that million was the fair and reasonable amount that should have been paid to settle the claim against power equipment.id.at.
on gainsco appeal,the san antonio court of appeals reversed and remanded for a new trial,holding that t he trial court should have submitted a question to the jury that inquired about the reasonableness of gainsco position and actions in exercising its rights under its policy given the totality of the circumstances.id.at listing various factors a jury should consider.according to the court,gainsco willingness to proceed with the defense of the lawsuit and its right to enforce the clause in its policy had to be balanced against home desire to settle for policy limits and its right to control the defense and settlement of the lawsuit.id.at.
the general agents opinion suggests that breach of this duty would provide,through subrogation,an overpaying with a right of reimbursement for the excess from the breaching.id.at.although it characterized the right of action as one of subrogation,the general agents court did not identify the rights of the common insured to which home could be subrogated to recover its overpayment from gainsco.rather,by balancing home interests with those of gainsco,the court appeared to premise a right of reimbursement on a direct duty between to act reasonably in exercising their policy rights.id.at.for the reasons outlined above,we disagree with general agents to the extent it creates a common law duty between insurers to reasonably exercise rights under an insurance policy.
subrogation 
acknowledging that a right of contribution does not exist in this context,liberty mutual contends it can seek reimbursement through contractual or equitable subrogation to the rights of kinsel.both hicks rubber and employers casualty contain language suggesting that such an avenue of reimbursement could exist.
in employers casualty,after precluding a right to contribution,we said that the remedy for reimbursement would lie in contractual or equitable subrogation.at.in hicks rubber,a case relied upon in employers casualty,we said that when several insurance policies covering the same loss contain pro rata clauses,none of the has a right to contribution from the others,nor will the payment of the whole loss by any of them discharge the liability of the others.at.this language suggests that payment of the insured entire loss by one does not relieve the other contractual obligations to the insured to pay their pro rata share of the loss.id.the implication is that the insured would still have a right to enforce the contractual obligation,and presumably,that the seeking reimbursement could be subrogated to this right.
having a right to subrogation,however,is distinct from the ability to recover under that right.see esparza scott white health plan,writ denied while an insurance contract providing expressly for subrogation may remove from the realm of equity the question of whether the insurer has a right to subrogation,it can not answer the question of when the insurer is actually entitled to subrogation or how much it should receive.in hicks rubber and employers casualty we did not apply the particular facts to the elements of the suggested right to subrogation to determine if the overpaying could actually recover.doing so here,we determine that the facts preclude recovery because liberty mutual can not meet the elements of subrogation.
there are two types of subrogation.see id.at.contractual or conventional subrogation is created by an agreement or contract that grants the right to pursue reimbursement from a third party in exchange for payment of a loss,while equitable or legal subrogation does not depend on contract but arises in every instance in which one person,not acting voluntarily,has paid a debt for which another was primarily liable and which in equity should have been paid by the latter.argonaut ins.allstate ins,christi,writ denied see also lee russ thomas segalla,couch on insurance ed in either case,the insurer stands in the shoes of the insured,obtaining only those rights held by the insured against a third party,subject to any defenses held by the third party against the insured.see interstate fire ins.first tape,dist,writ denied int l ins.l of corpus christi,christi,writ ref see also couch on insurance.privity of contract between the insurers is not necessary.phipps fuqua,writ ref.
kinsel potential contractual rights 
liberty mutual asserts a right to subrogation in equity and through the subrogation clause found in its cgl policy.in either case,liberty mutual must step into kinsel shoes to assert only those rights held by kinsel against,subject to any defenses held by against kinsel.see interstate fire,at l of corpus christi,at.the potential rights of kinsel to which liberty mutual may be subrogated stem from the contractual and common law duties an insurer owes its insured,which liberty mutual and both owed to kinsel.we analyze in turn kinsel right to enforce these duties.
liberty mutual argues it is subrogated to the contractual right of kinsel to enforce language in policy imposing a duty upon to defend and indemnify kinsel and to pay a pro rata share of settlement.we agree that the contractual duties to kinsel were specified in the cgl policies and included,as discussed above,a several and independent duty to pay a pro rata share of a covered loss up to their respective policy limits.see hicks rubber,at.but this duty can not be viewed independent of the purpose of a pro rata clause,nor without consideration of the rules of indemnification.as validly asserts,kinsel has no right,after being fully indemnified,to enforce duty to pay its pro rata share of a loss.
a liability policy obligates an insurer to indemnify the insured against a covered loss arising from the insured own legal liability.members mut.ins.hermann.an insured right of indemnity under an insurance policy is limited to the actual amount of loss.paramount fire ins.aetna cas.sur.where two different policies provide coverage for a loss,the pro rata clause does not create an exception to the principle of indemnity,but rather implements that principle by eliminating the potential for double recovery by the insured.see ortiz great southern fire and cas.ins,one reason that the right of equitable subrogation is granted to an insurer is to prevent the insured from receiving a double recovery.fireman fund ins.cas,th,d,the fact that several insurance policies may cover the same risk does not increase the insured right to recover for the loss,or give the insured the right to recover more than once.
w here there are several policies of insurance on the same risk and the insured has recovered the full amount of its loss from one or more,but not all,of the insurance carriers,the insured has no further rights against the insurers who have not contributed to its recovery.similarly,the liability of the remaining insurers to the insured ceases,even if they have done nothing to indemnify or defend the insured.
fireman fund ins,d at.
equity does not demand a different result here.we hold,therefore,that a fully indemnified insured has no right to recover an additional pro rata portion of settlement from an insurer regardless of that insurer contribution to the settlement.having fully recovered its loss,an insured has no contractual rights that a may assert against another in subrogation.
kinsel potential common law rights 
liberty mutual also argues it is subrogated to the common law right of kinsel to enforce duty to act reasonably when handling an insured reasonable negotiation and participation in settlement.an insurer common law duty in this third party context is limited to the stowers duty to protect the insured by accepting a reasonable settlement offer within policy limits.see stowers,at.stowers is the only common law tort duty in the context of third party insurers responding to settlement demands.ins,at citing.farmers ins.soriano,cornyn,concurring.the stowers duty is not activated by a settlement demand unless three prerequisites are met the claim against the insured is within the scope of coverage,the demand is within the policy limits,and the terms of the demand are such that an ordinarily prudent insurer would accept it,considering the likelihood and degree of the insured potential exposure to an excess judgment.am.physicians ins.exch.garcia,citing stowers,at.a demand above policy limits,even if reasonable,does not trigger the stowers duty to settle.id.
did not breach a stowers duty to kinsel because the boutins did not make a settlement offer within policy limits.see id.settlement demand must be within policy limits to trigger stowers duty.we decline to modify stowers to create rights for kinsel and therefore,liberty mutual,via subrogation.in addition,we note liberty mutual paid a debt for which it too was primarily liable,thus not satisfying the traditional subrogation requirement that the subrogee pay a debt for which another was primarily liable.see argonaut ins,at see also couch on insurance d insurance,at t he doctrine of subrogation
