in this construction defect action the court granted real party in interest geocon incorporated geocon motion seeking a determination that its settlement with developer serena sunbow sunbow for was in good faith within the meaning of code of civil procedure section.although the damages plaintiff sunbow allegedly suffered as a result of geocon negligence in performing geotechnical engineering services on the project exceeded million,geocon asserted its settlement was in good faith because its contract with sunbow contained a limitation of liability clause that limited geocon liability to sunbow to.petitioners tsi seismic tenant space,tsi,which contracted with sunbow to act as the general contractor on the project,and swanson associates swanson,the structural engineer on the project,opposed the motion.they argued that the settlement was grossly disproportionate to geocon proportionate share of liability,and the effect of a determination the settlement was in good faith would be to cut off their right to seek recovery for implied indemnity or contribution from geocon,even though according to experts,geocon was responsible for over million in damages.
on these petitions for writ of mandate,tsi and swanson seek to overturn the court determination that the settlement was entered into in good faith,asserting the settlement for is far outside geocon potential share of liability in this matter and it was improper for the court to rely on the limitation of liability clause in finding the settlement was entered into in good faith we conclude that the court erred in finding the settlement between sunbow and geocon was entered into in good faith based solely upon the limitation of liability clause,without considering geocon proportionate share of liability to the other defendants on their claims for implied indemnity or contribution against geocon.accordingly,we grant the petitions and order the court to vacate its order determining the settlement between sunbow and geocon to be in good faith.
factual and procedural background 
geocon contracted with sunbow to provide geotechnical services on a parcel of real property that was being prepared for construction of an apartment complex called villa serena.geocon contract with sunbow included a limitation of liability clause that provided 
sunbow agrees to limit geocon liability to sunbow and to all other parties for claims arising out of geocon performance of the services described in the agreement.the aggregate liability of geocon will not exceed for negligent professional acts,errors,omissions,including attorney fees and costs which may be awarded to the prevailing party,and sunbow agrees to indemnify and hold harmless geocon from and against all liability in excess of the monetary limit established above.
pursuant to the contract with sunbow,geocon prepared an initial soils report in february,before any grading was done,which identified the soils as having very low to medium expansion potential.however,in two subsequent reports prepared by geocon,one after rough grading and one after finish grading,it concluded that the soils had a high expansion potential.based upon this finding and its tests of the soils on site,geocon modified its recommendations for foundations and slabs contained in its original february report.
tsi entered into a contract with sunbow to act as general contractor overseeing the construction of villa serena.swanson was the structural engineer on the project.construction began in and was completed in.
following completion of construction of villa serena,cracking in the site stairs and flatwork appeared,as well as cracking in the interior and exterior of some of the buildings,which was attributed to the movement of expansive soil.sunbow filed a construction defect action against geocon,tsi,swanson and several others involved in the construction of villa serena.tsi subsequently filed a against geocon.
sunbow and geocon thereafter entered into a stipulation to submit the issue of the enforceability of geocon limitation of liability clause to a judicial referee,the honorable kevin midlam,retired.the parties agreed that if the contract was applicable to the work geocon performed,the limitation of liability clause was enforceable,unless it was shown that geocon was grossly negligent in the performance of its work.
the question of whether geocon acted in a grossly negligent manner was decided based upon the testimony of sunbow and geocon experts,as well as documentary evidence submitted to judge midlam.sunbow expert opined that a number of breaches of the applicable standard of care occurred,which,taken as a whole,constituted gross negligence.
judge midlam rejected most of sunbow criticisms,found the evidence regarding one inconclusive,and determined that,assuming arguendo that sunbow could meet its burden of proof that geocon had violated the standard of care in two areas,at most sunbow could show ordinary,not gross negligence,on the part of geocon.judge midlam also found that the contract was applicable to the work geocon performed.based upon these findings,judge midlam determined that the limitation of liability clause was enforceable.
thereafter,sunbow agreed to settle with geocon for,and geocon,as a part of that settlement,waived attorney fees and costs it had incurred in excess of.the settlement was conditioned upon the court finding that it was made in good faith under section.
geocon brought a motion under section to determine that the settlement was made in good faith.geocon argued the settlement was in good faith because its liability was limited,under the enforceable limitation of liability clause,to its expert testified at the hearing before judge midlam that geocon had not breached the applicable standard of care and it was waiving the right to recover in attorney fees.
tsi and swanson opposed the motion,arguing that the to be paid was not close to geocon proportionate share of liability for sunbow claimed damages,where approximately million of those damages was attributed to geocon negligence geocon liability to the other defendants for implied indemnity was not affected by the limitation of liability clause the settlement did not meet the applicable standards for a good faith settlement the settlement was designed to injure the interests of the nonsettling defendants and the settlement was not in good faith because geocon was responsible for the vast majority of damages incurred by sunbow,as demonstrated by the opinion of sunbow geotechnical engineer.in support of their opposition,tsi and swanson submitted the expert testimony of sunbow geotechnical expert,as well as tsi soils engineer,that showed that sunbow total claimed damages were approximately million dollars and geocon was primarily responsible for approximately million of those damages.
in its reply points and authorities,geocon argued,in addition to the arguments made in its opening brief,that the motion should be granted because even if for indemnity and contribution were barred by the order,the nonsettling defendants could still argue at trial that geocon was liable and obtain an offset against sunbow because of its contractual obligation to indemnify geocon tsi and swanson were not bound by any allocation of fault created by the settlement and tsi and swanson could use sunbow expert to argue geocon was at fault for the damages claimed by sunbow.
the court granted geocon motion,finding that despite tsi and swanson submission of evidence of geocon negligence,sunbow total cost of repair,and sunbow previous demand on geocon,in light of the fact that geocon liability to sunbow was capped at,the settlement was within the reasonable range of geocon proportionate share of liability for sunbow injuries.
these petitions for writ of mandate followed.
