in this construction defect case,the general contractor hired a subcontractor to waterproof retaining walls and install back drains in a large residential development.after discovering seepage and drainage problems,the homeowners association sued the general contractor and the subcontractor for negligence.during a jury trial,the subcontractor motion for nonsuit was granted and judgment was entered in its favor.on appeal,the homeowners association and the general contractor contend that the trial court erroneously precluded expert testimony on the subcontractor standard of care and erred in granting nonsuit.we agree and reverse the judgment in favor of the subcontractor.we also reverse the summary judgment granted in favor of the subcontractor on the general contractor for indemnity because we find there are triable issues of material fact as to whether the subcontractor was negligent.in light of our rulings,the costs awarded to the subcontractor must also be set aside.
factual and procedural background 
this action arises out of the construction of a residential development in the west hills section of los angeles the stonegate project.the developer entered into a written contract with appellant r r palacios construction,palacios for construction of retaining walls.palacios,by oral agreement,subcontracted the waterproofing and drainage work on the retaining walls to respondent staben staben,a company with which palacios had previously worked.
at trial,ron palacios testified that he told tom staben to waterproof the walls with thoroseal,install subsurface drain lines,backfill the walls with sand and lay.palacios testified that he did not know how to apply thoroseal and that he told staben to apply it according to the manufacturer specifications.he later testified that he never had a conversation with staben about how the thoroseal should be applied.he also testified that he did not tell staben how to install the drains.palacios further testified i do tell staben how to do his job,explaining that staben was a professional.
staben testified that he was not given any specifications as to how to apply the thoroseal to the walls at the stonegate project and that he was only told to apply it the same way he had at the moorpark project,which involved the same developer.but palacios testified he had not worked on the moorpark project and that he was unaware of how staben did the work on the moorpark project.
in late,staben completed the waterproofing and drainage installation on the walls palacios built at the stonegate project.palacios paid staben for its work and did not have any problems with the work.after the work was completed,homeowners in the development began to notice wet soil or boggy conditions in their yards together with dampness on the downhill side of the retaining walls and a white powdery substance on the walls called efflorescence.in,appellant the stonegate homeowners association stonegate filed suit against the developer and others for negligence,strict liability and implied warranty,alleging that the retaining walls had been defectively waterproofed and drained.stonegate later substituted palacios and staben in place of fictitiously named defendants.the trial court dismissed the strict liability and warranty claims,leaving only the negligence cause of action to be tried.palacios against staben for indemnity,contribution and declaratory relief.
stonegate eventually settled or disposed of its claims against all defendants except staben.palacios entered into a sliding scale or mary carter settlement agreement booth mary carter paint so d with stonegate,whereby palacios guaranteed a global payment of million that would be reduced by the amount recovered by stonegate from nonsettling parties through settlement or judgment.prior to trial,stonegate dismissed palacios as a defendant,and the court severed palacios indemnity.trial proceeded only against staben on stonegate claim for negligence.
during trial,stonegate attempted to present expert witness testimony on the standard of care in applying thoroseal and in installing a subsurface back drain and that staben work fell below those standards.the trial court precluded the testimony,ruling that the relevant issue was not the standard of care,but the oral contract between palacios and staben and what staben was told to do under that agreement.the court deemed palacios to be the gatekeeper and stated that palacios should be responsible for any defects.
at the close of stonegate evidence,staben orally moved for nonsuit on the grounds that there is no conflict in the evidence that staben duty was to do what palacios asked him to do pursuant to what he had done for the same developer in the project called moorpark and that staben did not owe a duty to stonegate.the trial court granted the motion for nonsuit,stating the court basis for the nonsuit is that there was a lack of any testimony by the plaintiff as to the specific duties the defendant had regarding his oral contract with palacios.the court further stated the bottom line of the situation is that the plaintiff just did not present any evidence of facts with regard to the contract between palacios and staben to raise any duty or obligation for staben to perform other than he did.the court then entered judgment in favor of staben.both stonegate and palacios filed motions for a new trial,which the court denied.stonegate and palacios have separately appealed from the judgment in favor of staben.stonegate also appeals from the trial court award of costs to staben.
following entry of judgment in its favor,staben moved for summary judgment on palacios severed for indemnity,arguing that because staben fulfilled its obligations under the oral agreement with palacios,the requisite predicate tort to maintain an action for equitable indemnity was absent.the trial court agreed,granting the motion and entering summary judgment in favor of staben.the court then awarded costs to staben in the amount of same amount the court had awarded against stonegate.palacios appeals from both the summary judgment on its and the award of costs.stonegate and palacios appeals have been consolidated.

i.the nonsuit motion 
stonegate and palacios contend the trial court erred in granting the nonsuit because expert testimony on staben standard of care should have been admitted 
standard of review 
a motion for nonsuit allows a defendant to test the sufficiency of the plaintiff evidence before presenting his or her case.because a successful nonsuit motion precludes submission of plaintiff case to the jury,courts grant motions for nonsuit only under very limited circumstances.carson facilities development cal d.a defendant is entitled to a nonsuit if the trial court determines that,as a matter of law,the evidence presented by plaintiff is insufficient to permit a jury to find in his favor.citation.in determining whether plaintiff evidence is sufficient,the court may not weigh the evidence or consider the credibility of witnesses.instead,the evidence most favorable to plaintiff must be accepted as true and conflicting evidence must be disregarded.the court must give to the plaintiff evidence all the value to which it is legally entitled,indulging every legitimate inference which may be drawn from the evidence in plaintiff favor.citation.a mere scintilla of evidence does not create a conflict for the jury resolution there must be substantial evidence to create the necessary conflict.citation.nally grace community church cal d.

b.the trial court erred in precluding expert testimony on staben duty of care 
trial court proceedings 
it was stonegate position at trial that staben was responsible for two major defects in construction of the retaining walls inadequate waterproofing and improper placement of back drains.
inadequate waterproofing 
stonegate argued that inadequate waterproofing with thoroseal permitted hillside drainage to seep into and through the concrete blocks of the walls and caused the formation of sulfate efflorescence that threatened the structural integrity of the walls.tom staben acknowledged that the goal in applying thoroseal was total coverage,and that the more thorough the coverage,the better water deterring effect it would have.stonegate waterproofing expert,warren kelly roberts,testified that when properly applied,thoroseal develops a hard shell that impervious to water.roberts testified that during his excavation and physical inspection of the retaining walls at several places,he observed areas where the thoroseal application was too thin and other areas where no thoroseal had been applied.of the sites he observed,roberts found the coverage faulty or inadequate in all but one,and the coverage was not effective in preventing water from passing through the thoroseal barrier.
roberts tried to explain the standard of care in applying thoroseal to the walls,and that staben work fell below that standard.but the trial court ruled that standard of care in the industry was not relevant,based on its conclusion that the terms of the oral contract between palacios and staben established staben responsibilities.the court sustained objections to roberts testimony that would have explained how a contractor would ordinarily go about preparing and applying thoroseal.
the day following roberts testimony,stonegate filed a motion for reconsideration,which included an offer of proof that roberts would testify that staben failed to meet the manufacturer specifications for applying thoroseal that appeared on every bag of thoroseal when staben did his work.among these specifications was the requirement for application of two coats to ensure complete coverage.the court denied the motion,stating that it had no recollection that ron palacios had told tom staben to apply the thoroseal according to the manufacturer instructions.
improper placement of drains 
stonegate sought to establish that staben installed the subsurface back drains too high above the foundation,which rendered the drains largely useless because water would accumulate behind the walls and flow through weep holes or open head joints before rising to the level of the back drains.this created wet or boggy soil conditions in the owners yards.staben admitted that it was his personal feeling that the drains should have been placed right on top of the footing.he testified that he believed a city building inspector told him to install the drains at an angle,which he did,though he thought such placement was incorrect.stonegate drainage expert,mohammad joolezadah,testified that during his inspection of the site he observed drains placed at various heights above the footing,with one drain as high as inches above the footing.
joolezadah was prepared to testify that the standard of care was to place the drains horizontally along the footing with a bed of gravel below and that staben placement of the subsurface back drains was too high and fell below the standard of care.but the trial court precluded this testimony,refusing to allow stonegate experts to go beyond the oral contract to establish any standard of care on staben part.
subcontractor standard of care 
appellants contend that the court erred in narrowing its focus on the words of the oral agreement to the exclusion of evidence on the standard of care.we agree.the subcontractor has a duty to perform work in a good and workmanlike manner.a subcontractor who is careless and negligent in the performance of the work is liable to the general contractor,to the owner,and to third persons for any damages proximately caused.when the work is performed in a defective manner,the measure of liability is the same as the damages that the owner can recover from the contractor the owner ordinarily has a cause of action against the subcontractor arising from the subcontractor defective work,even though there is no privity of contract between the owner and the subcontractor.the owner usually has a cause of action in negligence as a party within the area of foreseeable risk.miller starr,cal.real estate ed,to,fns.omitted see also la jolla village homeowners superior court d,disapproved on another point in jimenez superior court cal th,d,imposition of liability is still available against the subcontractor based upon the conventional theories of breach of contract,warranty or negligence,cal.construction contracts and disputes ed,subcontractors are held to a standard of due care for their performance.

standard of care and its breach in the construction defect context must usually be established through expert testimony,though lay testimony may suffice where construction defects are of such common knowledge that men of ordinary education could easily recognize them.raven cove townhomes,knuppe development d.miller los angeles county flood control dist.cal d.
we conclude that the trial court erred in precluding stonegate from presenting expert testimony on staben standard of care.staben agreed to perform the waterproofing and drainage work on the retaining walls built by palacios and had the duty to perform those tasks in a good and workmanlike manner.as such,the testimony of stonegate experts was relevant to the issue of whether staben met the standard of care expected within the industry.the trial court focus on the terms of the oral agreement to the exclusion of the standard of care evidence puts contractors like palacios in an untenable position.the evidence showed that palacios did not know how to do portions of the work subcontracted to staben and therefore did not tell staben how to perform its work.but under the trial court theory,staben would only be liable for defects in its work if palacios had given it detailed instructions on how to do the work.in other words,according to the court,the more the contractor must rely on the subcontractor,the less the subcontractor will be held accountable.this is not sound public policy and is not the law in california.indeed,that palacios did not tell staben how to waterproof the walls or how to install the back drains underscores wh
