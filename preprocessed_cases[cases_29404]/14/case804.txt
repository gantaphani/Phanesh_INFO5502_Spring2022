after the city of placerville the city approved a project for the construction of a hotel,gas station,and convenience store complex,various residents near the project site brought this action for writ of mandate claiming,among other things,the approval violated the california environmental quality act ceqa pub.resources code,et further undesignated section references are to the public resources code and the project is inconsistent with the city general plan.the trial court entered judgment denying the petition,concluding the city proceeded in the manner required by ceqa and there is substantial evidence to support the city approval.plaintiffs appeal nearly every aspect of the trial court decision.we agree with plaintiffs that the city did not comply with ceqa and reverse the judgment.
facts and procedural history 
this dispute involves a development project planned for an parcel of real property located in the eastern portion of placerville between smith flat road to the north and state highway to the south the property.the area north of the property includes smith flat,a low density residential community.
in,the city approved construction of a restaurant and motel on a portion of the property.in,the city approved a project with a motel,restaurant,coffee shop,banquet facilities,lounge,retail area,gas station and for the property.this latter project was resubmitted for approval in,but this time was rejected by the city.
prior to,the property was in an area zoned tourist residential.in,this designation was changed to highway commercial,permitting uses such as restaurants,gas stations and other uses necessary and convenient to the traveling public.
in,bob bartels,of point view development and management corporation,submitted a proposal to construct a motel,restaurants,lounge,gas station,convenience store,and carwash on the property.this project,the north point project,included construction of a connecting road between point view drive and smith flat road to provide access to the property from highway.the city prepared a mitigated negative declaration mnd for the project the north point mnd.
the north point mnd identified a number of potentially significant adverse impacts of the project,including the introduction of commercial activities among residential uses,increased water runoff,alteration of air movement and changes,increased traffic,removal of virtually all onsite vegetation,adverse effects to an onsite wetland,noise increases during construction,and the creation of light and glare.however,the north point mnd also identified mitigation measures that would reduce these impacts to a less than significant level.
like the various other projects submitted to the city for the property,the north point project was never constructed.in march,the city prepared an initial negative declaration the for a new project on the property,the gateway project,sponsored by real party in interest edward mackay.the described the gateway project as a hotel holiday inn express with convention facilities,a pump gas station with a square foot convenience store and attached carwash including parking,landscaping,grading and stream channel realignment.the further explained on and offsite improvements include grading for drainage,building and road construction.grading on and offsite is expected to result in the filling of approximately seasonal and riparian wetlands that are located in the north and northeastern most portion of the project site.additionally,a modification realignment to the existing unnamed intermittent drainage channel that traverses the wetlands is proposed.
plaintiff save our neighborhood is an ad hoc,unincorporated association of concerned neighborhood residents who live in the vicinity of the gateway project.the remaining plaintiffs,scott cooney,bill crim,janet kelly,stephen cox,and lyn eastwood,are members of save our neighborhood and live in smith flat.
the city conducted two public hearings on the and adjourned a third hearing to allow city staff to review written comments submitted by save our neighborhood,which challenged the use of a negative declaration and called for the preparation of an environmental impact report eir instead.following review,city staff recommended use of an addendum to the north point mnd rather than an eir or mnd.staff concluded an addendum was appropriate because none of the conditions requiring preparation of a supplemental eir or mnd are presented.
an addendum to the north point mnd was prepared on may,the addendum.the addendum indicated the gateway project involved only minor changes to the north point project.it compared the environmental impacts and mitigation measures of the two projects.it made the following findings there are no substantial changes proposed by the revised site plan that require major revisions of the existing mnd,or preparation of an eir due to the involvement of new significant environmental effects.as illustrated above,the project involves minor modifications to the previously studied and approved site plan and actually reduces somewhat the intensity of those uses somewhat.
there have also been no changes in the circumstances that would result in new significant environmental effects.the site remains unchanged from that previously analyzed and additional environmental review is not necessary.citation.
there are no substantial changes to the mitigation measures proposed for adoption and applicable to the gateway p roject.certain of the mitigation measures have been clarified and made more specific.these mitigation measures,however,are generally consistent with those incorporated into the project as approved in.
on august,the placerville city council,and in particular council members kathi lishman,robby colvin,pierre rivas,and marian washburn,approved the gateway project,adopting findings and conditions of approval recommended by city staff.those findings and conditions of approval included findings of consistency with various elements and policies of the city general plan.regarding ceqa,the findings included the following 
a.the north point mnd adopted for the previous,larger version of the hotel and gas station project,which concluded that all potentially significant environmental impacts could be reduced to a less than significant level through the implementation of mitigation measures approved and adopted by the city,is still legally valid.
no new significant or substantially more severe environmental effects would be created by the applicant proposed modifications to the originally approved project nor would changed circumstances since the completion of the negative declaration give rise to any new significant or substantially more severe environmental effects nor is there new information of substantial importance,which was not known and could not have been known at the time the previous negative declaration was adopted,showing that the project will have any new significant or substantially more severe environmental effects.
the conditions of approval attached to the addendum included various measures included with the north point mnd.also included were various building,planning and engineering division requirements as well as requirements to comply with directives of the el dorado county irrigation district,the el dorado county fire protection district and caltrans.finally,the conditions of approval included various city council requirements,such as providing a detached sidewalk,whenever feasible,parallel to the point road extension,converting at least parking spaces into landscaped planters,locating utilities outside a proposed acre willow riparian restoration area,and installing a not a through street or no outlet sign at the new connector at the jacquier road entrance to the point view drive neighborhood.
on august,the city issued a notice of determination regarding approval of the gateway project.
on september,plaintiffs filed this action against the city,the placerville city council,and the individual members of the city council who voted to approve the gateway project.the complaint sought a writ of mandate compelling defendants to vacate the notice of determination and approval of the gateway project as well as all other matters associated with that project.plaintiffs also sought an injunction against any actions taken pursuant to the gateway project.the complaint,as amended,alleged the project approvals violated ceqa,planning and zoning laws,and the public trust doctrine.
the trial court denied the petition for writ of mandate and entered judgment for defendants.the court concluded substantial evidence supports the city choice to use an addendum to the north point mnd,both the north point mnd and the addendum address the issues raised by plaintiffs,and substantial evidence supports the conclusions reached in those documents.the court further concluded substantial evidence supports the city conclusion the gateway project complies with the city general plan and the city considered the public trust with respect to water resources on the project site.
discussion 
iintroduction 
plaintiffs challenge the various actions taken by the city and,in particular,the city council in connection with approval of the gateway project.they contend defendants failed to comply with the requirements of ceqa,the gateway project is inconsistent with the city general plan,and the project conflicts with the public trust doctrine.we begin with plaintiffs ceqa claims.
plaintiffs contend defendants were required by ceqa to prepare an eir for the gateway project rather than rely on an addendum to the north point mnd.as a general matter,ceqa requires the preparation of an eir whenever a public agency proposes to approve or carry out a project that may have one or more significant impacts on the environment.if the public agency determines the project will not have significant environmental impacts,it may instead prepare a negative declaration,subd.c.
where a project for which an eir or negative declaration has been prepared is later modified or the circumstances under which it is to be carried out change,a subsequent or supplemental eir or negative declaration may be required.section states 
when an eir has been prepared for a project pursuant to this division,no subsequent or supplemental eir shall be required by the lead agency or by any responsible agency,unless one or more of the following events occurs 
a substantial changes are proposed in the project which will require major revisions of the eir.
b substantial changes occur with respect to the circumstances under which the project is being undertaken which will require major revisions in the eir.
c new information,which was not known and could not have been known at the time the eir was certified as complete,becomes available.
although section speaks in terms of an eir,it is augmented by section of the ceqa guidelines,tit,hereafter guidelines,which imposes the same obligation on a project for which a negative declaration was prepared.it reads 
a when an eir has been certified or a negative declaration adopted for a project,no subsequent eir shall be prepared for that project unless the lead agency determines,on the basis of substantial evidence in the light of the whole record,one or more of the following 
substantial changes are proposed in the project which will require major revisions of the previous eir or negative declaration due to the involvement of new significant environmental effects or a substantial increase in the severity of previously identified significant effects 
substantial changes occur with respect to the circumstances under which the project is undertaken which will require major revisions of the previous eir or negative declaration due to the involvement of new significant,environmental effects or a substantial increase in the severity of previously identified significant effects or 
new information of substantial importance,which was not known and could not have been known with the exercise of reasonable diligence at the time the previous eir was certified as complete or the negative declaration was adopted,shows any of the following 
a the project will have one or more significant effects not discussed in the previous eir or negative declaration 
b significant effects previously examined will be substantially more severe than shown in the previous eir 
c mitigation measures or alternatives previously found not to be feasible would in fact be feasible and would substantially reduce one or more significant effects of the project,but the project proponents decline to adopt the mitigation measure or alternative or 
d mitigation measures or alternatives which are considerably different from those analyzed in the previous eir would substantially reduce one or more significant effects on the environment,but the project proponents decline to adopt the mitigation measure or alternative.guidelines,subd.a.
where changes in a project are not substantial enough to require a subsequent or supplemental eir,the agency may instead prepare a subsequent negative declaration,an addendum,or no further documentation.guidelines,subd.b.guidelines,subdivision b,reads an addendum to an adopted negative declaration may be prepared if only minor technical changes or additions are necessary or none of the conditions described in guidelines calling for the preparation of a subsequent eir or negative declaration have occurred.
the purpose behind the requirement of a subsequent or supplemental eir or negative declaration is to explore environmental impacts not considered in the original environmental document.fund for environmental defense county of orange d.fund for environmental defense.section comes into play precisely because review has already occurred,the time for challenging the sufficiency of the original eir has long since expired,subd.c,and the question is whether circumstances have changed enough to justify repeating a substantial portion of the process.fund for environmental defense,supra,at.the event of a change in a project is not an occasion to revisit environmental concerns laid to rest in the original analysis.only changed circumstances,and any additional environmental impacts they cause,are at issue.
the primary thrust of plaintiffs ceqa challenge in this matter is that use of an addendum was inappropriate because the gateway project did not involve minor technical changes or additions to the north point project but instead introduced substantial changes that will result in new significant environmental effects or a substantial increase in the severity of previously identified significant effects.guidelines,subd.a.plaintiffs point to,among other things,a substantial increase in grading and soil removal,increased tree removal,and additional watershed changes.
however,as a threshold matter,plaintiffs contend,as they did in the trial court,that section and the related ceqa guidelines have been erroneously cast in the leading role in this dispute,because the gateway project is not a modification of the north point project but a new project altogether.plaintiffs argue the two projects are unrelated,except that they both include hotels and are located on the same land.according to plaintiffs,guidelines does not even contemplate city attempt to employ a previous environmental document covering a different it related or analysis of the new project new impacts.
defendants and real party in interest hereafter respondents contend plaintiffs claim that the two projects are unrelated is absurd,inasmuch as the projects involve the same land and the same mix of uses and connector road.they argue the question on appeal is whether the city had a rational basis for concluding the two projects are related.
plaintiffs have the better argument.we do not accept respondents suggestion that the question on appeal is whether the city had a rational basis for concluding the two projects are related.respondents cite no authority for this standard of review.the question here is not whether the city properly concluded the two projects are related but whether section applies to a situation such as that presented here,where a new project is proposed that has many of the same characteristics as an earlier project approved for the same site.this is a question of law for the court.see benton board of super
