this case requires us to determine whether a city can,consistent with federal law,deny a telecommunications company a permit to construct and to install a wireless antenna based solely on a city ordinance which is preempted by state law 
sprint pcs is a wireless telecommunications company seeking to install two wireless telecommunications facilities in the city of la cañada flintridge the city.the city rejected sprint applications pursuant to portions of its local wireless ordinance.after the city denied two of sprint five applications,sprint brought two actions against the for each permit application violations of the federal telecommunications act of,stat.codified as amended in scattered sections of,telecom act,and the california public utilities code,cal.pub,utilities code.the district court concluded that the city ordinance provided substantial evidence supporting the permit denial.sprint appeals from the grant of summary judgment in favor of the city,arguing that the denials violate state and federal law.in a separate,memorandum disposition we considered sprint argument that state law preempts provisions of the city ordinance.see sprint city of la cañada flintridge,wl filed may.because we agreed with sprint and held that state law preempts the provisions of the city ordinance relied upon by the city,see id.at,wl,the only remaining question is whether,as the city argues,portions of a municipal ordinance preempted by state law can constitute substantial evidence supporting a permit denial under federal law.
in october,the city enacted ordinance,an urgency ordinance of the city council of the city of la cañada flintridge adopting a moratorium on the issuance of any demolition,grading,utility,excavation or other permits relating to structures along city public ordinance or the city ordinance,setting forth criteria that applicants for a public above ground construction permit permit must satisfy 
sprint applied for five permits shortly after the city enacted its ordinance.the city granted two of the permit applications,sprint withdrew one application,and the city rejected two of the applications,which now form the bases for sprint complaint.
sprint intended to construct wireless facilities along figueroa street and descanso drive,and applied for permits in december and july,respectively.after a variety of appeals through the city public works and traffic commission,sprint ended up in the city council,which held hearings and denied both of sprint applications based on the city ordinance.
sprint brought suit under the telecom act,which requires that permit denials be supported by substantial evidence.the actions for the figueroa street facility and the descanso drive facility were consolidated and the district court found that substantial evidence supported the permit denials based on provisions of the city ordinance that we have determined in a separate memorandum disposition are preempted by state law.ruling on for summary judgment,the district court ruled against sprint on two of its critical claims.the parties thereafter consented to dismissal of sprint remaining claims,and the district court entered summary judgment for the city.
the interpretation of the statutory provisions of the telecom act and the utilities code presents questions of law which receive de novo review.carson harbor,unocal,cir en banc.however,if this court reviews the evidence relied upon by the city in denying the permits,the city must satisfy the substantial evidence standard.see c b iii.
we have described the substantial evidence standard as deferential.see metropcs,city county of san francisco,cir see also id.at holding that substantial evidence implies the traditional standard used for judicial review of agency decisions internal quotation omitted.
the telecom act requires that the city permit denials be supported by substantial evidence.specifically,c b iii states that a ny decision by a state or local government or instrumentality thereof to deny a request to place,construct,or modify personal wireless service facilities shall be in writing and supported by substantial evidence contained in a written record.
the interpretation of substantial evidence in the context of the telecom act was the focus of extended analysis in metropcs,which held that the substantial evidence inquiry does not require incorporation of the substantive federal standards imposed by the telecom act.at.rather,courts should consider whether the denial is based on substantial evidence in the context of applicable state and local law.id.at.consequently,the telecom act does not affect or encroach upon the substantive standards to be applied under established principles of state and local law.id.quoting cellular.town of oyster bay,cir see also id.concluding that the substantial evidence standard does not create a substantive federal limitation upon local land use regulatory power internal quotation omitted.metropcs accords with the decisions of other circuits in this respect.see id.at noting that there appears to be universal agreement among the circuits as to the substantive content of the substantial evidence requirement see,preferred sites,llc troup county,cir oyster bay,at.
the substantial evidence standard is essentially deferential,and courts may not engage in their own nor supplant a city reasonable determinations.metropcs,at quoting oyster bay,at first alteration in original.substantial evidence implies less than a preponderance,but more than a scintilla of evidence.metropcs,at internal quotation omitted.
thus,to be valid,the grounds for denial must receive at least some weight under state and local law.if not,the denial is deemed invalid even before the application of the telecom act federal standards.metropcs,at.
section c a of the telecom act provides that e xcept as provided in this paragraph,nothing in this chapter shall limit or affect the authority of a state or local government or instrumentality thereof over decisions regarding the placement,construction,and modification of personal wireless service facilities.c a emphasis added.
if the city local ordinance were valid under the telecom act,despite being preempted by state law,as we have concluded in a separate memorandum disposition,then the telecom act effectively would provide a measure of sovereign authority to cities,which their own state constitutions and statutes deny them.the language of subsection c a,however,does not imply that local law should be valid to the exclusion of state law,but merely that local law itself may not be ignored.thus,if the local law itself is example,because it conflicts with state subsection c a will not save it.if the telecom act intended to grant such authority to local those that are preempted by state might have preserved the authority of state and local government s,rather than the disjunctive.
further,the city argues that the plain language of the the authority of state or local government mandates city autonomy.under this reading of the statutory text,the telecom act does not limit state rules or local rules.thus,since there is a local rule,whether or not valid,the telecom act must recognize it,goes the argument.
we are not persuaded.the disjunctive language implies that state or local authority is preserved,not that both are necessarily preserved regardless of other constraints.further,even if we followed the city argument and held that the language of subsection c a preserves local authori
