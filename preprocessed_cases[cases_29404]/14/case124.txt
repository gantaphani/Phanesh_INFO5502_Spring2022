capital city advances two arguments on appeal.first,it contends that the district court erred in concluding that the underwriters would have a duty to defend only if the underlying complaint had alleged that capital city was vicariously liable for the actions of its subcontractor.second,capital city argues that the district court should have made clear that,if the underwriters owe it a duty to defend,then capital city is entitled to recover expenses,including attorney fees.
