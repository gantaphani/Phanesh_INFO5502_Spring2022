discussion 
iintroduction 
a motion for summary judgment is properly granted if the moving papers establish there is no triable issue of material fact and the moving party is entitled to judgment as a matter of law.code civ,subd.c.summary judgment provide s courts with a mechanism to cut through the parties pleadings in order to determine whether,despite their allegations,trial is in fact necessary to resolve their dispute aguilar atlantic richfield cal th,d.under t he historic paradigm for our de novo review of a motion for summary judgment w e first identify the issues framed by the pleadings since it is these allegations to which the motion must respond.we then determine if the moving party has established a prima facie entitlement to judgment in its behalf.only if the moving party has satisfied this burden do we consider whether the opposing party has produced evidence demonstrating there is a triable issue of fact with respect to any aspect of the moving party prima facie case.rio linda unified school dist.superior court th,d.
the present matter involves a claim for breach of contract against a local public entity.
before a complaint may be filed against a public entity,the entity must be presented with a claim in the form required by the government claims act.the public entity has days to grant or deny the claim if the claim is not acted upon within days,it is deemed rejected.if written notice of rejection is sent,suit must be brought within six months,subd.a.if no written notice is given,the claimant is allowed two years from the accrual date to file the suit,subd.a.chalmers county of los angeles d.
a claim for breach of contract must be presented to the public entity within one year of accrual of the cause of action.
in its motion for summary judgment,the county contended westcon failed to submit a claim under the government claims act within one year of accrual of its cause of action.the trial court agreed and granted the motion.
on appeal,westcon contends the county was not entitled to summary judgment,because it failed to establish the date on which westcon claim accrued.westcon further contends evidence was presented in opposition to the county motion establishing that westcon filed a public contract code claim and such claim tolled the statutory period for filing a claim under the government claims act.finally,westcon contends the claim packet submitted to the county on june,substantially complied with the government claims act.as we shall explain,none of these contentions has merit.
date of accrual 
westcon contends the county was not entitled to summary judgment,because it failed to establish the date upon which westcon claim for breach of contract accrued.westcon argues the county instead presented evidence of three possible dates of accrual.according to westcon,the county failure to establish a date as a matter of undisputed fact is a fatal defect in its motion for summary judgment.we disagree.
in order to obtain summary judgment,the county was not required to establish as an undisputed fact the date of accrual of westcon cause of action.all the county was required to prove was that westcon government claims act claim was submitted more than one year after accrual.
the county presented evidence that westcon government claims act claim was submitted on december.therefore,the county was only required to establish that westcon claim accrued before december.the county asserted the claim accrued either on june,when the county took possession of the improvements,march,when the county tendered final payment on the contract,or july,when the project was formally accepted by the county.because each of these dates preceded december,it was unnecessary for the county to prove which of them was the correct one.
westcon contends the period for submitting its claim under the government claims act was tolled while the parties attempted to resolve westcon public contract code claim.the latter claim,westcon argues,was not resolved until july,when it was expressly rejected by the county.westcon submitted its government claims act claim within one year of that date.
division,part of the public contract code governs contracts between local public entities and contractors.chapter,article,of this part pub.contract code,et concerns the resolution of construction claims not exceeding.pub.contract code,subd.a.within this article,section addresses the presentation of such claims to the local public entity.
such a claim must be in writing and include the documents necessary to substantiate the claim.pub.contract code,subd.a.it must also be filed on or before the date of final payment.pub.contract code,subd.a.for claims of over,the local agency must either respond in writing within days,or within days,request additional documentation.pub.contract code,subd.c.if additional documentation is requested,it shall be provided upon mutual agreement of the local agency and the claimant.pub.contract code,subd.c.upon receipt of further documentation,the local agency shall respond to the claim within days or within a period of time no greater than that taken by the claimant in producing the additional information or requested documentation,whichever is greater.pub.contract code,subd.c.if the claimant disputes the agency response,or the agency fails to respond,the claimant may notify the agency within days and demand an informal conference to meet and confer for settlement of the issues in dispute.pub.contract code,subd.d.the agency must then schedule a conference within days.ibid.
if the matter or any portion thereof remains in dispute following the meet and confer conference,the claimant may file a claim under the government claims act.pub.contract code,subd.e.for purposes of that act,the period for submitting a claim is tolled from the time the claimant submits his or her public contract code claim until the time that claim is denied as a result of the meet and confer process,including any period of time utilized by the meet and confer process.ibid.
westcon contends it submitted a claim under the public contract code prior to final payment on the project,which occurred on march.westcon argues either of two letters satisfies the claim requirement.the first letter was sent to scott maddux,a county engineer in charge of the project,on october.it read the county of sacramento filed the notice of completion for this project on september.we need to reach resolution on approximately worth of outstanding change order requests per the attached log.we have not received a reply to most of these change order requested sic.what is their status please identify when and where the county would like to discuss and resolve these issues.accompanying this letter was a log listing changes or additions to the project.
the second letter,dated november,was sent to mark carruesco,a high level county supervisor on the project.it read please find attached westcon construction corp current change order request log for the above referenced project.it has been quite some time since we have heard from the county regarding these outstanding issues.excluding finance charges,almost worth of force account work,change order requests and claims are still pending on this project.please advise us as soon as possible when a meeting can be arranged to discuss and resolve these issues.if you have any questions or comments,please contact me.accompanying this letter was a change order request log itemizing pending change order requests.
westcon contends the county responded to both of these letters with requests for more documentation to substantiate the claims.on october,the county responded to westcon october letter,asserting the bulk of the delays in the county processing of payments for change order work stemmed from contractor related issues.nevertheless,the county agreed to review any late payment impact claims that are demonstrated to have been solely caused by the county and requested adequate and substantiation of responsibility for such claims.
on november,the county responded to westcon november letter.that response read we have reviewed your above referenced letter and table of claimed outstanding change items.several items are undisputed and we are simply waiting to resolve final costs to incorporate into the next contract change order our records indicate we are waiting for westcon construction to resubmit cost information of several of these items.three of the listed items have been previously rejected as being invalid change order items.the county went on to explain that westcon had not submitted sufficient information to allow review of other claims and asserted the county would gladly review the merits of these items upon submission of the required substantiated documentation.finally,the county expressed its willingness to meet and discuss the disputed items once adequate documentation is submitted.
the parties met on december,to discuss westcon claims.at the conclusion of that meeting,the county insisted that westcon provide a firm claim amount and documentation in support.
westcon provided the requested documentation in a packet of materials sent to the county in april and in june.in july,the county rejected westcon claim as untimely.
westcon contends either the october or the november letter,with attached list of changes,constituted a claim within the meaning of the public contract code.according to westcon,what followed were attempts by the parties to resolve the claim,including a meet and confer conference in december.this dispute resolution process continued,westcon argues,until july,when the county formally rejected the claim.westcon filed its government claims act claim in december,within a year of the county july rejection.
the county responds that westcon has forfeited this contention on appeal by failing to raise it in the trial court.in response to the county motion for summary judgment,westcon argued the period for submitting a claim under the government claims act was tolled during resolution of the public contract code claim.however,at the time,westcon identified the public contract code claim as either the april or the june packet of documentation submitted to the county,not the october or november letters.no doubt recognizing that the april and june packets were sent after final payment on the contract,and were therefore untimely for purposes of the public contract code,westcon has chosen to change its theory on appeal as to when the public contract code claim was initiated.
ordinarily the failure to preserve a point below constitutes a waiver of the point.citation.this rule is rooted in the fundamental nature of our adversarial system the parties must call the court attention to issues they deem relevant.in the hurry of the trial many things may be,and are,overlooked which could readily have been rectified had attention been called to them.the law casts upon the party the duty of looking after his legal rights and of calling the judge attention to any infringement of them.citation.the same policy underlies the principles of theory of the trial.a party is not permitted to change his position and adopt a new and different theory on appeal.to permit him to do so would not only be unfair to the trial court,but manifestly unjust to the opposing party.citation.the principles of theory of the trial apply to motions citation,including summary judgment motions.citation.it would be manifestly unjust to the opposing parties,unfair to the trial court,and contrary to judicial economy to permit a change of theory on appeal.north coast business park nielsen construction th,d see also saville sierra college th,d.
westcon argues the county forfeiture argument is ridiculous,because westcon is not newly arguing the existence or effect of the october,letter and made no shift in it sic theory of the trial.westcon points out that the county own separate statement mentioned the october,letter.the county stated as an undisputed fact on october,westcon wrote to the county stating its intent to file a claim for finance charges for all force account work performed under the contract.in its response to the separate statement,westcon acknowledged it was undisputed that in october,settlement negotiations were in progress.according to westcon,the mention of negotiations in its response demonstrates that westcon considered the october letter to be part of the negotiation process then underway to resolve westcon claim.
westcon arguments betray its own confusion.on the one hand,westcon says the october letter initiated a claim under the public contract code on the other hand,that letter was part of the negotiations underway to resolve the public contract code claim.if the october letter was part of the ongoing negotiations,then the claim must have been submitted earlier.
at any rate,the fact that both the county and westcon mentioned the october letter in their factual submissions is a far cry from establishing that their theory below centered on the october letter being the initiation of a claim under the public contract code.rather,westcon theory in the trial court was that the june,packet of documentation was the claim.even if the october letter was part of ongoing negotiations between the parties,this does not prove those negotiations were pursuant to the public contract code.on the contrary,the parties conduct following the october letter do not track the procedures outlined in the public contract code.the public contract code contemplates a request for additional documentation by the public entity,submission of additional documentation,rejection by the public entity,a request for a meeting by the claimant,a meet and confer conference,and,if disputes remain,a government claims act claim.here,the county requested additional information in its response to the october and november letters and the parties met in december to discuss the dispute.however,no additional documentation was submitted until after the december meeting.
westcon contends it briefed the factual circumstances surrounding its october correspondence with the county in its points and authorities in opposition to the motion for summary judgment.however,the only reference provided by westcon is to that portion of its opposing brief where westcon argued the june packet constituted the public contract code claim.
westcon contends it is nevertheless entitled to raise a new argument on appeal because our review is de novo.westcon argues an exception to the rule against raising new arguments on appeal is recognized where an issue involves purely a legal question which rests on an uncontroverted record which could not have been altered by the presentation of additional evidence.westcon cites as support california auto.assigned risk plan garamendi d.caarp and wilson lewis d.wilson.
in caarp,the insurance commissioner argued on appeal that the hearing procedures established by proposition,subds.b and c,and through apply to rate setting hearings for automobile policies issued under the plan.caarp,supra,d at.in a footnote,the court rejected the plaintiff argument that this issue could not be raised for the first time on appeal.according to the court the commissioner is not barred from raising this issue on appeal,because the issue involves purely a legal question which rests on an uncontroverted record which could not have been altered by the presentation of additional evidence.id.at,fn.
in wilson,the court concluded the critical issue of the dispute was the legal effect of a conditional and postdated good faith deposit check upon a contract to sell residential property.wilson,supra,d at.the court noted the issue had been raised by the pleadings and the evidence on it was undisputed,but it was not mentioned at trial.the court concluded the issue could be considered on appeal,because it was a pure question of law based on noncurable undisputed evidence.ibid.
unlike the foregoing cases,the present matter does not involve a pure question of law based on undisputed and noncurable evidence.this is instead a shift in factual theory from one in which the june packet constituted the public contract code claim to one in which the october letter was the claim.a claim under the public contract code includes any separate demand for payment of money or damages arising from work done by,or on behalf of,the contractor pursuant to the contract for a public work and payment of which is not otherwise expressly provided for or the claimant is not otherwise entitled.pub.contract code,subd.b.in order to set the public contract code claims resolution wheels in motion,the claim must be in writing and include the documents necessary to substantiate the claim.pub.contract code,subd.a.by virtue of westcon change in factual theory,one of the questions that would have to be resolved is whether the october letter amounted to a claim within the meaning of the public contract code definition.this will depend on whether the documentation accompanying the letters was sufficient to substantiate the claim.this is not a pure question of law based on undisputed and noncurable evidence.
but even if we were to allow westcon to argue for the first time on appeal that a public contract code claim was submitted in october or november of,the end result would be the same.assuming either the october or the november letter was a public contract code claim,the evidence presented below suggests such claim was effectively rejected more than a year before westcon submitted its government claims act claim.
the record contains no evidence of anything occurring between the parties after the december meeting until march.in his declaration in support of the county motion for summary judgment,scott maddux stated 
on or about march,i caused a letter to be issued to the sacramento county board of supervisors seeking approval of a change order number to the contract in order to pay for additional work performed by westcon under the contract.in so doing,i also disclosed to the board of supervisors that westcon owner had informed me of his intent to prepare a claim seeking further compensation in an unknown amount arising from this contract.the board of supervisors did approve change order number 
on or about march,i caused a letter to be issued to westcon informing westcon that all work under the contract was complete as of march,that field acceptance under section of the contract standard construction specifications would be effective as of that date,and that the guarantee period stated under the contract would be deemed to have commenced when the county took beneficial occupancy of the improvements on june,
on or about march,i caused a memorandum to be issued,with copy sent to westcon,for the purpose of releasing all of westcon remaining contract retention in the amount of 
on or about march,pursuant to my authorization,the county issued its warrant number in the amount of payable to westcon as a release of all remaining retention withheld from payment due westcon under the contract under the contract,tender of final payment shall constitute denial by the county of any unresolved claim of the contractor not specifically excepted by the county 
among the documents submitted by the county in support of its motion for summary judgment are the contract between the parties and excerpts from the county standard construction specifications,which were incor
