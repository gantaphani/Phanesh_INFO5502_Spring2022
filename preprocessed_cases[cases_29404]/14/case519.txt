government code section requires that all claims for money or damages against local public entities be presented to the responsible public entity before a lawsuit is filed failure to present a timely claim bars suit against the entity.here we hold that these requirements apply to breach of contract claims.we also adopt the practice of referring to the claims statutes as the government claims act,to avoid the confusion engendered by the informal short title tort claims act.
in this suit against a city and its redevelopment agency,the trial court overruled defendants demurrer,deciding that the claim requirements did not apply to plaintiff contract causes of action.the court of appeal issued a writ of mandate directing that the trial court sustain the demurrer.we affirm the court of appeal judgment,with modifications.
background 
plaintiff civic partners stockton,llc civic executed two redevelopment contracts in may with defendant redevelopment agency of the city of stockton the agency.one contract involved rehabilitation of the hotel stockton the other was for construction of an adjacent cinema.in may,defendant city of stockton the city leased the upper floors of the hotel from civic for office space.
three months later,however,the city repudiated the lease.mark lewis,the city manager and executive director of the agency,demanded that civic find another use for the upper floors of the hotel.civic had been depending on the lease to support its financing for the hotel project.the financing for the cinema depended on a viable hotel operation.lewis proposed senior housing as an alternative for the upper floors.that change required redesigning the hotel interior and altering the financial arrangements to include federal and state income tax credits.by the end of civic had completed new plans for the hotel,as well as tax and financial analyses and other work needed to apply for the tax credits.this work cost civic several hundred thousand dollars.
in january,lewis informed civic that the agency wanted cyrus youssefi and his company,cfy development,to take over the upper floors,the senior housing plan,and the tax credit application.civic began discussions with agency personnel about how to protect civic from the losses resulting from the breaches of the hotel and lease agreements.the agency agreed to preserve civic rights in the rest of the hotel and reimburse it for its investment and overhead expenses.
civic agreed to give the agency a set of its plans for the hotel.in a letter agreement dated february,steve pinkerton,the agency director of housing and redevelopment,accepted civic conditions that the plans would remain civic property,and could only be used by the agency or others subject to an agreement between the agency and civic regarding the future renovation of the hotel including reimbursement of costs to date,as well as a cooperative agreement regarding other components of the project including the cinema.at some point in february,pinkerton also agreed to pay the balance due on civic contract with its architect.
the next month,pinkerton agreed to assume a loan taken by civic the paramount loan,to recognize amounts due to civic,and to take certain steps to mitigate civic losses.civic sent pinkerton a memorandum dated march,outlining the terms of the agreement.pinkerton never questioned or disavowed those terms.for a time,the agency abided by the terms of the february and march agreements,taking steps to assume the paramount loan,discussing reimbursements with civic,and forwarding an agreement on property intended for the cinema project.
on march,without informing civic,the agency entered into a new hotel development agreement with a company named hotel stockton investors,operated by youssefi.this agreement conflicted with civic hotel agreement,which was still in effect.the agency gave civic plans to youssefi and took steps to repudiate its agreements with civic and to oust it from the redevelopment projects.it did not reimburse civic for its investment in the plans as required by civic hotel agreement.it made its own arrangements with the architect,obtaining all the plans and associated project documents.it accused civic of breaching the hotel contract,and gave notice to terminate the agreement.although it had approved a cinema lease between civic and kirkorian premiere theatres,the agency approached kirkorian in an attempt to take over civic position.ultimately,the agency executed a lease with another theater operator.
civic did not present a claim before filing suit.its original complaint,dated january,sought declaratory relief to establish its rights in the hotel plans,damages from youssefi and his companies for interference with its contracts,and damages from the city and the agency for breaching the hotel agreement and the mitigation agreement of february.the city and the agency demurred,but did not rely on the government claim requirements.the trial court sustained the demurrer on the grounds that civic rights in the hotel plans were governed by federal copyright law and within the exclusive jurisdiction of the federal courts,that the city was not liable on the contract claims because it was not a party to either the redevelopment contracts or the february and march agreements,and that the february and march agreements could not support a cause of action against the agency because the statutory requirements for public contracting were not met.
civic amended complaint,dated march,sought damages from the city for breach of the lease for the upper floors of the hotel,from the agency for breach of the hotel and cinema agreements,from the city for interfering with the hotel and cinema agreements,and from youssefi and his companies for interference with civic contracts.civic again sought declaratory relief regarding its ownership rights in the plans.the city and the agency demurred again,still without raising the claim requirements.
the court sustained the demurrer.it found that civic had stated sufficient facts to support contract claims against the city for breach of the lease,and against the agency for breach of the hotel and cinema agreements.however,civic had failed to specify whether the contracts were oral,written,or implied the court granted leave to amend as to these claims.the demurrer was sustained without leave to amend as to the declaratory relief claim,on the ground that the only recoverable damages were under federal copyright law,over which the court lacked jurisdiction.
the second amended complaint,dated june,restated the contract and interference with contract causes of action,specifying that the contracts in question were written.the claim for declaratory relief regarding civic rights in the hotel plans was omitted.the city and the agency demurred for the third time.they argued that civic contract claims were defective because they depended on the february and march agreements,which were never properly approved.they also asserted that the second amended complaint was barred because civic had failed to comply with the government claim requirements.they noted that in state of california superior court bodde cal th,d,filed may,this court ruled that failure to plead compliance with the claim requirements is a ground for demurrer.id.at,d.
the trial court overruled this demurrer.it decided that the factual allegations supported the contract claims,and that the claims statutes did not affect contractual liability.the city and the agency then against civic,seeking damages for breaches of the hotel and cinema contracts and the hotel lease,misrepresentation,and failure of consideration.they also petitioned the court of appeal for a writ of mandate directing the trial court to sustain their demurrer.they pointed out that the claims statutes unquestionably governed civic tort claim for interference with contract,and contended they also applied to civic contract claims under the weight of the case authority.
the court of appeal agreed.it held that the claim presentation requirements apply to contract causes of action against government defendants,and rejected a series of arguments by civic attempting to excuse its noncompliance.however,the court ruled that if the city and the agency pursued their,civic would be allowed to file a of its own asserting defensive claims.the trial court was directed to enter an order sustaining the demurrer the court of appeal did not reach the question whether leave to amend was proper.we granted civic petition for review.
ii.discussion 
we independently review the court of appeal decision.smiley citibank cal th,d.civic concedes,as it did below,that its tort cause of action for interference with contract was subject to the claim requirements,unless compliance was somehow excused.
a.the claims statutes and contract causes of action 
section requires the presentation of all claims for money or damages against local public entities,subject to exceptions not relevant here.claims for personal injury and property damage must be presented within six months after accrual all other claims must be presented within a year.n o suit for money or damages may be brought against a public entity on a cause of action for which a claim is required to be presented until a written claim therefor has been presented to the public entity and has been acted upon or has been deemed to have been rejected.thus,under these statutes,failure to timely present a claim for money or damages to a public entity bars a plaintiff from filing a lawsuit against that entity.state of california superior court bodde,supra,cal th at,d.
the purpose of the claims statutes is not to prevent surprise,but to provide the public entity sufficient information to enable it to adequately investigate claims and to settle them,if appropriate,without the expense of litigation.citations.it is that claims statutes must be satisfied even in face of the public entity actual knowledge of the circumstances surrounding the claim.city of san jose superior court cal d.the claims statutes also enable the public entity to engage in fiscal planning for potential liabilities and to avoid similar liabilities in the future.baines pickwick city of los angeles th,d baines pickwick see minsky city of los angeles cal d.
contract claims fall within the plain meaning of the requirement that all claims for money or damages be presented to a local public entity.as the baines pickwick court noted,other statutory terms further demonstrate the legislature intent that the claim requirements apply to contract causes of action.baines pickwick,supra,th at,d.section requires the presentation of all claims against the state f or money or damages on express contract,subd.b.section,governing the contents of claims against both the state and local entities,requires specification of the date,place and other circumstances of the occurrence or transaction which gave rise to the claim asserted,subd.c,italics added,and a general description of the indebtedness,obligation,injury,damage or loss incurred,subd.d,italics added.section provides that c laims against local public entities for supplies,materials,equipment or services need not be signed by the claimant or on his behalf if presented on a billhead or invoice regularly used in the conduct of the business of the claimant.section permits local government contracts to include provisions for the presentation of any or all claims arising out of or related to the agreement.see also,providing the same authorization for state contracts.in view of these provisions,it is no surprise that courts have routinely applied the claim requirements to contract causes of action against local government defendants 
the legislative history of the money or damages term of sections and confirms that they were meant to include contract claims.the current statutory scheme was the second enacted to replace a multiplicity of former claim requirements.in,the legislature acted on the law revision commission recommendation to provide a unified procedure for claims against local entities by adding former division to the government code,including former sections and,the predecessors of sections and.stats,ch,et recommendation and study relating to the presentation of claims against public entities cal.law revision com.pp,et 
former section referred to claims for money or damages just as section does now,and former section included the reference to no suit for money or damages currently found in section.as explained in the study supporting the law revision commission recommendation,references to claims for damages in the statutes were understood to include both tort and breach of contract claims,but not ordinary claims for money due on a contract.statutes requiring claims for money were construed to cover all forms of monetary demands including pension claims and all types of tort and contract claims.recommendation and study relating to the presentation of claims against public entities,cal.law revision com,supra,at pp,fns.omitted.
the study noted that the recommended scope of the new statutes governing claims for money or damages was consistent with that of the preexisting statutes,and stated that i nsofar as the claim is one for breach of contract,the need for early investigation and negotiation is frequently as important as in the case of tort claims.recommendation and study relating to the presentation of claims against public entities,cal.law revision com,supra,at.routine claims for money due were in a different category and did not require a formal claims procedure.ibid.the study suggested allowing contractual waiver of compliance with the claims statutes as to causes of action founded upon express contract other than claims for damages for breach of contract.ibid.thus,it is clear that the references to money or damages now found in sections and were always intended to embrace contract as well as tort claims.see alliance financial city and county of san francisco,supra,th at,d.
civic argument that breach of contract claims are not subject to the claim requirements is based primarily on section,which provides nothing in this part affects liability based on contract or the right to obtain relief other than money or damages against a public entity or public employee.it is true that some courts of appeal have read section to exclude contract causes of action from the scope of the claim requirements.harris state personnel bd.d,disapproved on another point in coleman department of personnel administration cal d,fn,gonzales state of california d.national automobile cas.ins.pitchess d.others,however,have rejected that view,reasoning that section pertains only to immunity from liability,and has no effect on the claims requirements.baines pickwick,supra,th at,d loehr ventura county community college,supra,d at.see also crow state of california d.this reasoning finds ample support in the language,structure,and purpose of the statutes.
section is found in part of the statutory scheme,which the legislature captioned liability of public entities and public employees.et,added by stats,ch.the claim presentation requirements are in part,which was enacted separately.et,added by stats,ch,cal.government tort liability practice ed.claims against public entities,pp.cal.government tort liability practice.thus,the claim requirements are not included in section declaration that nothing in this part affects liability based on contract.section simply reaffirms the long standing rule that governmental immunity does not encompass contractual liability.see souza mccue constr.superior court cal d,citing cases.that proposition has no necessary connection to the requirement that a claim be presented before suit is filed.prior notice of claims serves the purpose of facilitating investigation and possible settlement,whether or not the public entity would otherwise be immune from liability.see loehr ventura county community college,supra,d at.people ex rel.of parks and recreation,d.
civic contends we invoked section to exclude contract claims from the reach of the claims statutes in morrill state of california cal d,and longshore county of ventura cal d.however,in morrill this court made no reference to the claim presentation procedures,confining itself to the question of governmental immunity.morrill,supra,cal d at.nor did the longshore court indicate that the scope of the claim requirements is affected by section.to the contrary,it held that the claim before it fell within a statutory exception to those requirements,and discussed the immunity exemption of section as a separate matter.longshore,supra,cal d at.civic reliance on section fails.
because of the broad scope of the claim requirements,a number of courts of appeal have followed the suggestion in baines pickwick that government claims act is a more appropriate short title than the traditional tort claims act.baines pickwick,supra,th at,d see,bates franchise tax bd.th,fn,d gatto county of sonoma th,fn,d hart alameda county th,fn,d.we agree that this practice is a useful way to reduce confusion over the application of the claim requirements.henceforth,we will refer to division,parts through of the government code et as the government claims act 
restitution claims 
civic contends its contract causes of action are based on the law of restitution,and are therefore exempt from the claims statutes under minsky city of los angeles,supra,cal d,minsky,and holt kelly cal d.in minsky,the plaintiff sought the return of money seized by the police from an arrested person and allegedly diverted to the policeman and fireman pension fund after the criminal charges were resolved.minsky,at.this court held that a claim for the recovery of specific property is not one for money or damages under the government claims act.id.at.even if the cash taken from the arrestee was no longer traceable,the initial exemption of the action from the claims statute is not lost simply because the city takes the further wrongful step of disposing of the bailed property.the city can not be permitted to invoke the claims statute,originally not available to it,by virtue of a later wrongful dissipation of the property.to so hold would be in effect to allow the local entity to profit by its own wrong,penalizing a plaintiff who,in light of the specific recovery remedy apparently available to him,justifiably did not file a claim.id.at,fn.
minsky was followed in holt kelly,which similarly involved a claim for the return of personal property seized at the time of an arrest.holt,supra,cal d at.the rule that suits to recover specific property are not subject to the claim requirements has also been applied in actions to recover property seized under a search warrant,or compensation for its value.long city of los angeles th,d hibbard city of anaheim d.none of these cases involved a government contract.
civic argues that it transferred its plans and assets to the agency in the expectation that it would be compensated for them,bringing it within the rule of minsky and holt.civic characterizes that rule as an exemption of all restitution claims from the claim requirements.such a blanket exclusion has never been recognized.the minsky rationale is that a claim for specific property effectively held by the government as a bailee for the claimant is not one for money or damages under the government claims act.minsky,supra,cal d at.the minsky court reference to general constructive trust principles must be understood in that context.ibid.subsequent cases have limited the minsky exception to situations in which the defendant had a duty to return seized property,enforceable by way of mandamus.holt kelly,supra,cal d at,long city of los angeles,supra,th at,d hibbard city of anaheim,supra,d at.see hart county of alameda,supra,th at,d.when a claim for money or damages is not based on a governmental obligation to return specific property,it is subject to the claim requirements.
civic identifies no specific property held by defendants that it was entitled to recover.rather,it contends it yielded assets in exchange for a promise of compensation.an attempt to enforce such a contractual agreement is a claim for damages under section the minsky line of cases provides no excuse for civic failure to comply with the claim requirements.
estoppel and waiver 
civic argues that defendants were estopped from relying on the government claims act,or that they waived their defense under the act,either by failing to notify civic that its claim was defective,by against civic,or by failing to promptly raise the act as a defense in their first two demurrers.these arguments fail.
it is well settled that a public entity may be estopped from asserting the limitations of the claims statute where its agents or employees have prevented or deterred the filing of a timely claim by some affirmative act.citations.estoppel most commonly results from misleading statements about the need for or advisability of a claim actual fraud or the intent to mislead is not essential.citation.john oakland unified school dist.cal d,see also ortega pajaro valley unified school dist.th,d,citing cases.civic specifies no act or statement by defendants that prevented it from filing a timely claim.it asserts that in early defendants assured it that its interests would be protected,in an effort to avoid a claim against them.but civic alleges no conduct that might have deterred it from presenting a claim after defendants failed to keep their promises.ocean services ventura port,supra,th at,d.thus,it does not establish even a colorable estoppel claim 
civic principal waiver argument is equally defective.it contends the provisions of sections and apply because defendants did not advise it that the correspondence between the parties in february and march of was insufficient to constitute a claim.section provides that i f,in the opinion of the board or the person designated by it,a claim as presented fails to comply substantially with the requirements of sections and,the board or the person may,at any time within days after the claim is presented,give written notice of its insufficiency,stating with particularity the defects or omissions therein.under section,a ny defense as to the sufficiency of the claim based upon a defect or omission in the claim as presented is waived by failure to give notice of insufficiency with respect to the defect or omission as provided in section 
for a document to constitute a claim as presented under section,it must disclose the existence of a claim which,if not satisfactorily resolved,will result in a lawsuit against the entity.phillips desert hospital dist.cal d.nothing in the correspondence relied on by civic indicates that litigation might ensue if defendants did not comply with the terms under discussion.this is the most essential element of a claim as presented,because it satisfies the primary purposes of the government claims act facilitating the investigation of disputes and their settlement without trial if appropriate.see also,alliance financial city and county of san francisco,supra,th at,d wilson hospital dist.d.civic has alleged that the parties attempted to restructure their plans in a mutually agreeable fashion,but it points to nothing that would have specifically alerted defendants to weigh the alternatives of litigation or compromise 
civic also argues that defendants waived the right to rely on the claim requirements by filing a.it contends the unjustly allows defendants to pursue contract claims against it while asserting the bar of the claims statutes on civic claims arising from the same transactions.the court of appeal considered this problem and offered a solution for civic predicament.the court noted that case law permits a purely defensive to be asserted against a public entity despite the defendant noncompliance with the claims act,when the public entity initiated the litigation between it and the the arises from the same transaction or event on which the entity claim is based and the asserts only defensive matter,without seeking affirmative relief.krainock superior court d.krainock see also cal.government tort liability practice,supra.although civic initiated this litigation,the court of appeal held that in the interest of fairness,civic should be allowed to file a of its own asserting any defensive claims it might have if defendants choose to pursue their.
while we agree with the court of appeal that it would be unjust to leave civic defenseless against the,it is unnecessary t
