introduction 
the city of long beach appeals from a judgment for inverse condemnation in favor of d m financial corporation,which held a security interest in real property on which the city of long beach demolished an alleged substandard apartment building.the main issue in this appeal is whether,before demolishing a structure which it had declared to be substandard,the city of long beach satisfied its obligation to provide due process of law to d m financial corporation.we reject the claim by the city of long beach that recordation of a declaration of substandard property placed d m financial corporation on notice that a building on its real property security would be demolished.we further conclude that the city of long beach failed to comply with its own practice of updating title reports to determine current ownership of property declared to be substandard.in addition,even after it had actual notice of the security interest held by d m financial corporation,the city of long beach failed to comply with its ordinances requiring notice to mortgagees of property declared to be substandard.the city of long beach also failed to give d m financial corporation the opportunity to repair defects at the property.therefore the city of long beach violated the due process rights of d m financial corporation.we affirm the judgment in favor of d m financial corporation.
ii.procedural history 
in the operative complaint,a second amended complaint filed on september,plaintiff d m financial corporation plaintiff or d m financial alleged that without notice to d m financial,defendant city of long beach the city demolished an apartment building on real property in which d m financial held a trust deed to secure a promissory note executed by rahim pashmaki,who acquired the property on february.the complaint alleged causes of action for deprivation of due process in violation of section of title of the united states code and for inverse condemnation.

the trial court rendered judgment for d m financial,which was to recover in damages from the city,plus attorney fees and costs.the city filed a timely notice of appeal from the judgment.
the city demolished a apartment building at henderson avenue in long beach on august.the history of this demolition is as follows.
in may,loren patten,a senior combination building inspector for the city of long beach,inspected the building at henderson avenue and on june,issued a declaration of substandard building.on july,patten sent a letter titled notice of substandard building to the then owner and served copies on interested parties,including the then trust deed holder.on july,a declaration of substandard property for the henderson avenue property was recorded with the los angeles county recorder pursuant to long beach municipal code section et,relating to substandard buildings.
patten estimated it would cost to bring the building into compliance with applicable codes and to repair deficiencies identified in the declaration of substandard property.
on november,the city of long beach findings of the building official found the apartment building at henderson avenue to be substandard and a public nuisance.the building,constructed in,had been vacant since before the july,notification of substandard building.an attachment identified defects needing repair or replacement,and found the structure to be a safety hazard.
also on november,the city sent a notice of hearing for a hearing on november,to the property owner,cyber,to the then trust deed holder,and to interested parties.
at a november,hearing,the board of examiners,appeals and condemnation beac adopted the building official findings as the beac findings.on november,a notice of board determination was sent to cyber,and to the then trust deed holder.the notice reflected the beac determination that the apartment building on the henderson avenue property was substandard and a public nuisance,and its order that the owner demolish or rehabilitate the structure by december.this notice was not recorded.
by december,aztec financial had acquired the henderson avenue property through foreclosure.on that date aztec financial requested an extension of time to complete repairs on the henderson avenue property.a letter from aztec financial stated that it would obtain permits on december and would start construction on december.on december,the city issued permits for repairs identified in the building official findings.
on january,the beac approved a request for a time extension,with rough inspections to be completed by february,and an additional days to march,for completion of the project.
during the period from february to august,the city records indicated that seven different site inspections showed insufficient work to repair the henderson avenue property.
by a february,grant deed,henderson avenue was sold to rahim pashmaki.daaz financial services,made a loan to pashmaki,secured by a trust deed recorded february,in the los angeles county recorder office.also recorded on february,was the assignment of the daaz financial services trust deed to d m financial.
city policy is to issue a notice of intent to demolish,and to mail the notice of intent to demolish to all persons listed in the city files,the title report,and the lot book update.it was the city practice to obtain a title book update before sending a notice of intent to demolish.the city did not obtain a lot book update before sending out the notice regarding the henderson avenue property.on february,the city sent aztec financial a notice of intent to demolish,but sent no copy to d m financial.
dale wiersma,principal building inspector of the city of long beach department of planning and building,acknowledged that he was told in april of that there had been a change of title and that d m financial held a trust deed on the henderson avenue property.on april,the city obtained an updated title report,showing that d m financial was a beneficiary under a trust deed recorded on february.
on april,wiersma sent a letter to pashmaki stating that pursuant to a february,notice of intent to demolish,the city was preparing a contract to demolish structures at henderson avenue,and requested pashmaki approval for unrestricted access to the properties on april.on may,the city obtained a warrant to inspect the henderson avenue apartment building and garage foundation.on may,the city obtained a warrant to inspect the premises for asbestos for future demolition purposes.on may,the city sent pashmaki a notice to clean premises.on june,the city sent pashmaki a notice to pay public nuisance abatement levy.on june and july,the city sent a notice of lien for costs to abate a nuisance at the henderson avenue property to the office of the los angeles county recorder.the city sent no copies of these documents to d m financial.
on august and,the city obtained warrants to inspect the henderson avenue property for the purpose of demolition.the city sent a copy of the august,warrant to d m financial by certified mail.it was delivered to d m on august.
it is the city policy to issue a notice of intent to demolish before demolishing a building.on friday,august,the city mailed a notice of intent to demolish to pashmaki,and sent a copy to d m financial at its address in belleville,new jersey.wiersma testified that he did not take into consideration that he was sending the notice over a weekend,or that it was being sent to a party in new jersey.d m financial received the notice of intent to demolish on monday,august.on that date desantis of d m financial spoke to wiersma.
from the time it acquired its interest in the henderson avenue property on february,until it received the notice and the inspection warrant on august,d m financial received no notice from the city that the city had commenced any proceeding to demolish the property.
desantis contacted wiersma several times on august and.wiersma had authority to stop demolition.the city began demolition of structures at the property on august,and on that date informed d m financial that demolition had already commenced.cleanup of the site was concluded by august.
on september,the city sent pashmaki a demand for payment of costs for demolition and enforcement,and recorded a notice of lien for.
on july,pursuant to the deed of trust recorded on february,the trustee under the deed of trust sold the henderson avenue property to d m financial for cash.
the parties agreed and stipulated that if the city were found to be liable,damages suffered by d m financial for demolition of the building would be calculated as for the value of the property had demolition of improvements not taken place,and as the value of the property after demolition of improvements.thus damages awarded to plaintiff would be calculated as less the residual value,for a total of.d m financial would also be entitled to removal of the city lien on the property,and if the lien was not removed within days of entry of the court order for judgment,would be added for a total judgment of if the court ordered judgment in favor of d m financial.if the city were found liable,d m financial would also be entitled to recover its costs and attorney fees upon entry of the judgment.
as stated,the trial court entered judgment for d m financial in the amount of,plus attorney fees and costs.
the city primary argument on appeal is that the judgment erroneously imposes a notice requirement beyond that imposed by the fourteenth amendment of the united states constitution.
discussion 
before demolishing the structure,the city of long beach failed to provide due process to d m.due process requirements for demolition of substandard property 
under its police power to protect public health and safety a city may destroy private property without liability to the property owner,but when it does this it must afford the owner due process of law.friedman city of los angeles d.when a city threatens to demolish structures,due process requires that the city provide the property owner and other interested parties with notice,with the opportunity to be heard,and with the opportunity to correct or repair the defect before demolition.
before taking an action which will affect a property interest protected by the due process clause of the fourteenth amendment,a state must provide notice reasonably calculated,under all the circumstances,to apprise interested parties of the pendency of the action and afford them an opportunity to present their objections.mullane central hanover tr.constitutionally sufficient notice is such as one desirous of actually informing the interested parties might reasonably adopt to accomplish it.id.at.the notice must be of such nature as reasonably to convey the required information.id.at.
except in emergencies,due process of law also requires an opportunity to be heard.friedman city of los angeles,supra,d at.procedural due process,guaranteed by the fifth and fourteenth amendments to the united states constitution and by article i,section of the california constitution,exists to provide affected parties with the right to be heard at a meaningful time and in a meaningful manner.ryan california interscholastic diego section th,d united states james daniel good real property,d.
the right to prior notice and a hearing is central to the constitution command of due process.the purpose of this requirement is not only to ensure abstract fair play to the individual.its purpose,more particularly,is to protect his use and possession of property from arbitrary minimize substantively unfair or mistaken deprivations of property.united states james daniel good real property,supra,at.
finally,when a city threatens demolition of structures,due process also requires the city to give a property owner the opportunity to correct defects or repair a structure constituting a nuisance before demolition.hawthorne savings loan city of signal hill th,d see duffy city of long beach d.
d m financial had a sufficient ownership interest to bring an inverse condemnation action 
the authorities speak of due process which must be accorded to owners of property and to interested parties.between its acquisition of the trust deed and note on february,and the demolition of the building at the henderson avenue property,d m financial held the note and trust deed and had a security interest in that property.the owner of the henderson avenue property during this period was not joined as a party to this action we conclude that the circumstances of this case made trust deed holder d m financial an interested party with standing to bring an inverse condemnation action without joining the mortgagors.
article i,section,of the california constitution provides that property may be taken or damaged for public use only if just compensation is paid to the owner.that provision authorizes not only an eminent domain proceeding instituted by a public entity to acquire private property,but also an inverse condemnation action initiated by a landowner to obtain compensation for a claimed taking or damaging of his or her property.barthelemy orange county flood control dist.th,d.an inverse condemnation action is the equivalent of an eminent domain proceeding,except that the plaintiff is the property owner,not the condemnor.equivalent principles govern the parties rights in both actions.id.at,d breidert southern pac.cal d,fn.
to be constitutionally entitled to compensation for inverse condemnation,a plaintiff must show it owned a property interest taken by the state.parties with interests sufficient to bring an inverse condemnation action include holders of fee interests,easements,and building restrictions county of san diego miller cal d,a holder of an unexercised option to purchase property id.at,a mortgagor whose interest has been foreclosed,the executor of a property owner estate in which the decedent held an interest with a spouse,and an seeking recovery in the name of the insurer or of its insured mcmahan of santa monica city of santa monica d.
the entitlement to due process compensation does not turn on strict categories of estates in real property or contractual rights.t he right to compensation is to be determined by whether the condemnation has deprived the claimant of a valuable right rather than by whether his right can technically be called an estate or interest in the land.county of san diego miller,supra,cal d at,italics omitted.
we find that the beneficiary of a deed of trust on property has a sufficient ownership interest to be entitled to just compensation in inverse condemnation.such a party has a compensable interest in an eminent domain proceeding as to the property.carson redevelopment agency adam d.
ordinarily the compensable interest of the beneficiary of a trust deed to recover an inverse condemnation award derives from the recovery.when a portion of the property constituting the security is taken by eminent domain,the trust deed holder remedy is to participate in an apportionment proceeding to recover an amount equivalent to the impairment of the security interest.people ex rel.of transportation redwood baseline,d,fn,citing code civ.however,an agreement between parties to the trust deed creating the security interest can permit the trust deed holder to recover an inverse condemnation award directly.redwood baseline,at.see also carson redevelopment agency adam,supra,d at.
the mortgagor and d m financial had such an agreement.the trust deed creating the security interest of d m financial in pashmaki henderson avenue property defined miscellaneous proceeds as any compensation,settlement,award of damages,or proceeds paid by any third party for ii condemnation or other taking of all or any part of the property.that trust deed required that such miscellaneous proceeds from a partial taking of the secured property be applied to reduce the debt secured by the trust deed such a provision is valid and enforceable.people ex rel.of transportation redwood baseline,supra,d at,fn.
according to the stipulated facts,the value of the henderson avenue property would have been had demolition of improvements not taken place.the security instrument and trust deed recorded february,which was assigned to d m financial,secured a promissory note signed by rahim pashmaki in the amount of.thus the quoted trust deed clause regarding disposition of miscellaneous proceeds from an inverse condemnation involving a partial taking of the henderson avenue property applies,because the fair market value of the property immediately before the partial taking,destruction,or loss in value was equal to or greater than the amount of the sums secured by this security instrument immediately before the partial taking,destruction,or loss in value.this assignment of a right to recover an inverse condemnation judgment gives d m financial a sufficient ownership interest in the henderson avenue property to bring the inverse condemnation action.
as we subsequently determine,the city own ordinances required it to serve mortgagees with notices and orders provided for in the chapter governing administration and enforcement of housing.long beach.this ordinance recognizes that a mortgagee has a sufficient property interest to entitle the property owner to due process when the city takes actions which affect the mortgagee property right.it supports a mortgagee right to bring an inverse condemnation suit when those actions constitute a taking of mortgaged property without due process of law.
the city did not give notice to d m financial of its intention to demolish the substandard building 
one fundamental requirement of due process is the necessity of giving notice of demolition of structures to parties with an interest in the property.at numerous times as it proceeded toward demolition,the city failed to provide this notice.
a.the recorded declaration of substandard property did not give notice of the city intention to demolish the substandard building 
on july,the city recorded a declaration of substandard property for the henderson avenue property with the los angeles county recorder.it stated notice is hereby given that pursuant to the provisions of section et of the long beach municipal code,the property described below has been inspected and found to be substandard,as defined in section of the above ordinance and the owner has been or will be so notified.the owner is responsible for any costs,including incidental enforcement expenses,incurred by the city to correct the substandard condition.this document will be terminated only when the superintendent of building and safety of the city of long beach finds that the public nuisance has been abated and either that such abatement has been accomplished at no cost to the city or that any such cost s have been repaid to the city,or that such costs have been placed upon the tax rolls as a special assessment.detailed information may be obtained by contacting the housing section,building and safety bureau.
the city contends that this recorded declaration of substandard property put all present and future interested parties on notice that the building could be demolished.the city argues that this declaration satisfied any due process requirements.we disagree.
this declaration of substandard property makes no reference to demolition of structures,and gives no express notice that demolition of structures will occur or is even contemplated.it states only that the property has been found to be substandard,the owner has been or will be so notified,and that the owner is responsible for the city costs incurred to correct the substandard condition.the declaration also advises that it will be terminated only when the city finds that the public nuisance has been abated.it does not advise that demolition will occur if the public nuisance is not abated.
one of the ordinances referred to in the declaration,long beach municipal code section,states whenever the building official determines by inspection that an existing building is substandard,or constitutes a nuisance,he shall institute proceedings to cause the repair,rehabilitation,vacation or demolition of such building.italics added.the city argues that by identifying long beach municipal code section,the recorded declaration placed d m financial,as a subsequent encumbrancer,on constructive notice of the possibility of demolition of the henderson avenue property.demolition,however,is only one of four possible outcomes of proceedings instituted after the building inspector determines that a building is substandard.in addition,long beach municipal code section permits demolition only after a beac hearing at which persons claiming an interest in the building that is the subject of the hearing may appear and object,and a determination by the beac,with written findings,that total demolition is required since it was issued and recorded before any beac determination,the declaration of substandard property could not and did not give notice that the city would demolish the building at henderson avenue.thus it does not constitute recordation of an intention to demolish,which would have the effect of placing a prospective buyer on notice of the city projected action.see friedman city of los angeles,supra,d at.
we reject the notion that recordation of the declaration of substandard property put d m financial on inquiry or constructive notice that the city would demolish a structure at the henderson avenue property.we also reject the claim that recording the declaration of substandard property satisfied due process.
b.the city failed to comply with the requirement in its own ordinances that it give notice of demolition to mortgagees such as d m financial 
the long beach municipal code section a states,in relevant part all notices and orders provided for by this chapter shall be in writing,shall state in general terms wherein the building or structure is unsafe or dangerous,or in what manner it is substandard,or in what manner it constitutes a public nuisance,and the minimum requirements for its correction,or total costs that will be charged to the owner of the property.service of such order shall be upon the owner thereof or upon the person causing or permitting the condition to exist,or the person having the custody,control,maintenance,occupancy,use or management of the building,and upon any lessee or mortgagee thereof if shown on the official records of the county,by delivering the same to either of said persons or their agents in charge of the building.italics added.chapter provides for such notices in at least eight situations 
this ordinance codifies the constitutional due process principle that the city must give notice reasonably calculated under all circumstances to apprise interested parties of the city action,and in a manner which someone who desired to give actual notice to the interested party might reasonably adopt to accomplish such actual notice.mullane central hanover tr,supra,at.
thus the city own ordinance requires express notice to mortgagees of orders and notices which affect buildings or structures found to be unsafe,dangerous,or substandard.the city failed to comply with those requirements,even after it had actual notice of the change of ownership and actual notice that d m financial held a security interest in the henderson avenue property.
c.the city violated its own procedures when it failed to obtain an updated title report 
although it was the city practice to obtain a title book update before sending a notice of intent to demolish,the city did not obtain a lot book update before sending the notice regarding the henderson avenue property.thus,for example,on february,the city sent a notice of intent to demolish to aztec financial,but sent no copy to d m financial.
a city can not rely on notice to prior owners of record as determined by an title search,and must make a timely title search to determine current ownership of property.friedman city of los angeles,supra,d at.in friedman,city ordinances required only that the city give notice of impending demolition to owners listed on tax rolls,which did not provide accurate and timely information.otherwise the city made no attempt to investigate current ownership of the property at the time of demolition,and relied instead on a title search made months earlier.during that period ownership had changed twice.thus for five months before demoli
