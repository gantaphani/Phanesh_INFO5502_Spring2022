john rickher brought a lawsuit against home depot,arguing that home depot sale of a damage waiver in connection with tool rentals violated the illinois consumer fraud and deceptive business practices act cfa,see.comp.stat.rickher claims that the waiver is a worthless product because it does not provide any value or protection to the customer beyond what is already provided in the basic rental agreement.in rickher view,the sale of the worthless damage waiver is both deceptive and unfair under the cfa.the district court rejected rickher argument and denied his motion for class certification.because we agree with the district court that the damage waiver has value,we affirm the judgment.
this appeal deals with a question that many consumers face on a regular i buy the extra protection being offered with this purchase or rental john rickher faced this question on over a dozen occasions over the past few years when he rented tools and equipment from home depot stores.on each occasion,rickher entered into a rental home depot.the first page is home depot copy of the agreement.it outlines the description and price of the rental,with itemized charges one line item is labeled damage waiver.the first page also contains a special terms and conditions section,which includes the following statement i accept the benefits of the damage waiver if applicable described in paragraph in the terms and conditions of this rental agreement.the customer signs the first page of the agreement,underneath this statement of acceptance.the second page is the customer copy of the agreement,and it also describes the rented item and the itemized charges.it looks very much like the first page home depot copy,but does not contain the special terms and conditions that are identified on the front page.
the third page details the specific terms and conditions of the agreement.four provisions are relevant to rickher appeal.according to the risk of loss provision,a rental customer is liable for all damage or destruction,partial or complete to the equipment.a different provision explains that the customer is not liable for reasonable wear and tear resulting from proper use.then,according to the repair or replacement provision,in the event a tool or piece of equipment becomes unsafe or in a state of disrepair,home depot has the option to fix the equipment,provide the customer with a comparable item,or adjust the rental charge.the repair or replacement provision goes on to explain that if the equipment is damaged or in disrepair because of the customer improper use or maintenance,the customer will bear the cost of the replacement or repair.finally,there is the damage waiver provision,which relieves the customer of liability for damage to the equipment that does not result from the customer improper use of the equipment,provided the customer pays an additional fee.
the precise language of the baseline risk of loss provision states 
i the customer assume all risks of loss,theft,damage or destruction,partial or complete,of the equipment from any and every cause whatsoever.
the second relevant condition,which rickher characterizes as the wear and tear provision,specifically provides 
i acknowledge that i have examined the equipment,seen it in operation if appropriate and that its condition is acceptable.i agree to surrender the equipment to you upon termination hereof,in as good order and condition as when received,except for reasonable wear and tear resulting from proper use,and if returned unclean,i may be charged a reasonable cleaning fee.i agree to keep and maintain the equipment in good condition,use it in a careful and proper manner including without limitation maintenance of proper fuel,oil and lubricant levels,if applicable and comply with all applicable laws and regulations.
in the repair or replacement provision,the customer agrees 
immediately to discontinue using equipment that becomes unsafe or in a state of disrepair,and immediately to notify home depot of such fact.you home depot have the option to make such equipment operable within a reasonable time,provide me with a similar piece of equipment or adjust the rental charge.however,if such equipment is unsafe or in disrepair because of my improper use or maintenance,i will bear the expense of such replacement or repair or,at your option,be declared in default.
the damage waiver provision explains that,if the customer pays the damage waiver fee equal to ten percent of the cost of the equipment regular rental depot will waive its right to hold the customer liable for damage caused to the product while in the customer for damage caused by the customer misuse or abuse of the equipment among other exceptions.
if i pay the damage waiver charge for any equipment,this agreement shall be modified to relieve me of liability for accidental damage to it,but not for any losses or damages due to theft,burglary,misuse or abuse,theft by conversion,intentional damage,disappearance or any loss due to my failure to care properly for such equipment in a prudent manner including without limitation by using proper fuel,oil and lubricants and not exceeding such equipment rated capacity,if applicable.
in the district court,rickher claimed that home depot had violated the cfa in two ways.first,he alleged that home depot deceived him into believing the damage waiver was a mandatory charge by failing to inform him each time he rented tools that the waiver was optional,and by including it,as a default condition,in each rental agreement.second,he argued that the damage waiver is a worthless product because it does not provide consumers with any protections above and beyond those already afforded by the regular rental agreement.rickher sought to certify a class consisting of persons who paid the damage waiver charge when they rented equipment from home depot stores in illinois during the period before rickher filed his complaint.
the district court determined that rickher evidence could not survive summary judgment on either of his claims.when he rented the tools,rickher failed to read the rental agreement,which clearly described the nature of the damage waiver.as for the scope of the damage waiver,the district court decided that the waiver had value,so there was nothing deceptive or unfair about home depot sale of the waiver to customers.after granting summary judgment in home depot favor,the district court denied rickher motion for class certification as moot.
ii.analysis 
rickher only challenge on appeal is to the district court disposition of the for summary judgment respecting count ii of his second amended complaint,which alleged that the damage waiver is a worthless product.we review de novo the district court disposition of for summary judgment,while construing the evidence and all reasonable inferences in favor of the party against whom the motion under consideration is made.basf ag great am.assurance,cir.summary judgment is proper if the pleadings,the discovery and disclosure materials on file,and any affidavits show that there is no genuine issue as to any material fact and that the movant is entitled to judgment as a matter of law.c.the resolution of the cfa claim in this case depends entirely on the terms of the rental agreement contract,and as such,summary judgment is appropriate only if there are no genuine issues of material fact surrounding the interpretation of that contract.see cherry auburn gear,cir.under illinois law,the interpretation of a contract presents a question of law that is decided by the court basf,at bowers,chi.mach.tool,d.neither side argues that the contract is ambiguous,nor do we identify an ambiguity that prevents our analysis.the contract is not susceptible of different constructions when read in its plain and ordinary meaning,see cromeens,holloman,sibert,ab volvo,cir quoting althoff,elgin med,d,so we proceed to the merits of the question raised on appeal whether the damage waiver is worthless.
rickher argues that the damage waiver is worthless because even without it,the rental agreement relieves renters of liability for all damage to a piece of equipment that results from its proper use.in his view,the damage waiver offers no additional protection because it excludes from coverage damage resulting from improper use.thus,rickher argues that the damage waiver is redundant because damage from proper use is already excused by the rental agreement,and the damage waiver does not excuse the customer of anything other than damage from proper use.in rickher opinion,the damage waiver is a worthless product,and charging customers a fee for a worthless product is deceptive and unfair under the cfa.
to demonstrate a deceptive practice under the cfa,rickher must show that he suffered actual damages and he must present facts demonstrating a deceptive act or practice by the defendant the defendant intent that the plaintiff rely on the deception the deception occurred in the course of trade or commerce and the consumer fraud proximately caused the plaintiff injury.white daimlerchrysler,d,see also connick suzuki motor.to show that something is an unfair practice under the cfa,the practice must offend public policy be immoral,unethical,oppressive,or unscrupulous or cause substantial injury to consumers.robinson toyota motor credit.all three criteria do not need to be satisfied to support a finding of unfairness.a practice may be unfair because of the degree to which it meets one of the criteria or because to a lesser extent it meets all three.id.quoting cheshire mortgage,montes.
at first blush,the rental agreement clearly allocates all risks to the risk of loss provision in paragraph states that the customer is responsible for all damage and loss to the rented item.thus,unless the risk of loss provision is modified or nullified by other provisions in the rental agreement,the damage waiver effectively alleviates some of the customer liabilities.charging customers for the waiver and its corresponding shifting of risks is an acceptable arrangement that appears neither deceptive,nor unfair.see chabraja avis rent a car system,d,explaining that bailee is generally liable for injury to bailed property,but parties are free to alter traditional risk allocations by contract so long as resulting agreement does not violate public policy.
rickher points to the repair and replacement provision,as well as the wear and tear provision,to argue that home depot shifts nearly all of the risk away from the customer and onto home depot.rickher argument can be broken down as follows 
the risk of loss provision provides the baseline the customer is responsible for all loss,theft,damage,or destruction,partial or complete,of the equipment,regardless of the cause.
the repair and replacement and wear and tear provisions effectively nullify the risk of loss provision by shifting all of the risk onto home depot,except for the risk of damage resulting from improper use or maintenance,which remains with the customer.
a.the wear and tear provision provides that customers are not liable for reasonable wear and tear that results from proper use.wear and tear encompasses all damage resulting from proper use,so customers need not worry about anything except for damage resulting from improper use or abuse.
b.the repair and replacement provision states that customers will have to pay for repairs or damage caused by improper use or maintenance according to rickher,this affirmative statement,absent a comparable statement about the customer liabilities for damage resulting from proper use,establishes that customers will never be liable for damage to a piece of equipment unless that damage results from improper use,abuse,or improper maintenance.
the damage waiver excludes coverage for damages stemming from improper use,abuse,and improper maintenance.the rental agreement already protects customers from liability for damage resulting from proper use via,so the damage waiver adds no additional coverage,even though customers pay a fee for the damage waiver.
rickher argument hinges on his interpretation of paragraphs and.but as the district court recognized,rickher reading of the wear and tear and repair and replacement provisions suffers from major flaws.
the first flaw is that rickher broadly defines the concept of wear and tear to encompass any and all damage that might occur during a tool proper use.rickher reads paragraph explicitly allows for reasonable wear and tear of the tool during the rental relieve the customer of liability for any and all damage to the tool so long as that damage happens by way of proper use of the tool.this leads rickher to conclude that the damage waiver is effectively the inverse of the wear and tear provision the customer is already relieved of responsibility for damages resulting from proper use,but the damage waiver excludes from its protections any damages stemming from improper,it provides no additional protection to the customer.home depot,on the other hand,claims that the wear and tear provision of paragraph does not effect a shifting of simply informs the customer that home depot will not hold the customer liable for reasonable wear and tear of the equipment.the paragraph does not mention loss,damage,or destruction of the tool,nor does it mention who is required to pay for any such loss,damage or destruction.
rickher cites dictionary definitions of wear and tear to support his contention that damage and wear and tear are one and the same depreciation,damage,or loss resulting from ordinary use or exposure,webster ii new college dictionary damage or deterioration resulting from ordinary use normal depreciation,random house webster college dictionary.although it is true that dictionary definitions of wear and tear often employ the word damage,that does not mean that damage and wear and tear are synonymous.wear and tear is a more specific phrase that connotes the expected,often gradual,depreciation of an item.see wear and tear,http en.wikipedia.org wiki wear and tear,last visited may.
it is a form of depreciation which is assumed to occur even when an item is used competently and with care and proper maintenance.for example,friction may erode a hammer head.in the normal use of a hammer for its designed task erosion is impossible to prevent,and any attempt to eliminate this erosion would make the hammer useless.at the same time,it is expected that the normal use of a hammer will not break it beyond repair until it has gone through a certain amount of use.
id.most items,such as power tools,when used regularly,suffer from ordinary wear and tear.tools are not meant to be maintained in pristine condition,and home depot recognizes that motors will slow over time,blades will dull,and casings will get scratched.true,these measures of depreciation technically can be termed damage but while all wear and tear resulting from proper use might fall under the broad category of damage,the all damages fall under the category of wear and simply not true.see kallman radioshack,cir drawing line between reasonable wear and tear,which was allowed in the contract,and damage the district court found that the extensive damage and poor condition of the roof,parking lot,and hvac units did not constitute reasonable wear and tear,and we agree assets goodyear tire rubber,cir delineating ordinary wear and tear,such as masonry work from several items that may be described as damage to the building,such as broken windows,doors,floor tiles and ceiling tiles.
in a southern district of florida case dealing with the same home depot damage waiver,the plaintiff also equate d damage to the phrase normal wear and tear.jeff,home depot,slip op.at.july,unpublished decision.the jeff enterprises court pointed out that the rental agreement uses the terms wear and tear and damage separately,which supports reading the terms to have different meanings.additionally,if damage and wear and tear are synonymous,then the risk of loss and damage waiver provisions in the rental agreement are meaningless.see id.jeff enterprises interpretation renders both the risk of loss and damage waiver provisions of the rental agreement meaningless,which runs contrary to basic contract interpretation principles.see also elda arnhold byzantio,ocean atl.woodland,cir illinois courts construe contract terms so as to avoid rendering other terms re
