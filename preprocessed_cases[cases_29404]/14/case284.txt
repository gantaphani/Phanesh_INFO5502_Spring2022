louisiana pacific corporation lp is a national manufacturer of building materials.this case involves a rebate promotion that lp offered to builders and contractors who purchased a certain amount of lp siding products.curtis lumber company,curtis lumber,a retail supplier of building materials,presented lp rebate promotion to many of its customers.of those customers purchased or ordered lp siding products with the expectation that lp would pay rebates worth up to.after the customers submitted rebate applications,lp demanded that the customers also submit proof that the siding products had been installed.that requirement surprised a large majority of the customers,many of whom cancelled orders with curtis lumber,refused to pay curtis lumber,or demanded a rebate from curtis lumber.in the end,curtis lumber allegedly lost over as a result of lp acts,but none of curtis lumber customers suffered expenses.curtis lumber brought this diversity action against lp.the district court granted summary judgment to lp on all of curtis lumber claims,from which curtis lumber now appeals.lp asserts a conditional,claiming that curtis lumber lacks standing and is not the real party in interest for this dispute.we affirm in part and reverse in part.
background 
in late or early,lp announced a rebate promotion for a line of siding products called smartside.the purpose of the promotion was to encourage builders and contractors to install smartside products.lp offered rebates for several types of siding,soffit,lap,and panel for a maximum rebate of.the rebate promotion applied to orders received and acknowledged between january,and may.
lp relied on wholesalers and retailers to market the rebate promotion,and for guidance,it distributed an information sheet listing the promotion details.the information sheet listed two qualifications this promotion is open to new builders or contractors who purchase at least one house worth of smartside products,and will receive checks based upon purchases.in addition,the information sheet stated that lp required invoice documentation for a rebate to be paid.lp also distributed an application for builders and contractors to complete and submit.under the heading terms and conditions,the rebate application stated please indicate products used and expected rebate,with a maximum.following this instruction was a chart for an applicant to write in how much of each category of siding product he or she ordered.
upon learning of the rebate promotion,curtis lumber solicited orders from its customers who were builders and contractors.by the promotion deadline,curtis lumber sold smartside products to of its customers with the expectation that lp would pay a rebate worth up to to each customer.most of the orders were close to,so the customers expected to receive the smartside products with little or no cost.curtis lumber placed orders with lp wholesale distributor,boise cascade,to fulfill its customers orders.curtis lumber also helped most of the customers complete rebate applications and submit them to lp along with the required invoices.curtis lumber expected to make roughly in profit on each purchase of smartside products.
lp was suspicious of the rebate applications from curtis lumber customers because they were submitted in batches,written in the same handwriting,and were at or near the minimum purchase amount for the maximum rebate.lp was also concerned because the applications were submitted with sequentially numbered invoices that did not indicate purchases of other building materials.these characteristics were unusual among the nearly rebate applications lp received from builders and contractors across the country.therefore,on june,lp sent a letter to all of the rebate applicants who purchased smartside products from curtis lumber,requesting the following information in order to process their rebates a picture of the home showing smartside products,the street address of the newly sided home,and responses to a short questionnaire.if a rebate applicant did not submit proof of use,then lp would not pay a rebate 
upon receiving lp letter,rebate applicants complained to curtis lumber.a majority of the applicants purchased smartside products for future use and therefore had not yet installed the products.curtis lumber told the complaining customers not to respond to the june letter since it believed lp should pay the rebates instead of imposing an additional requirement for the rebate promotion.on july,curtis lumber counsel sent an email to lp,detailing the customers complaints,requesting lp to process the rebates,and threatening to sue lp if it did not pay rebates to the customers.
in the end,only nine of curtis lumber customers responded to the june letter with proof of use.lp paid rebates to those nine customers along with one other customer who did not respond habitat for humanity.the remaining rebate applicants either cancelled their orders with curtis lumber,demanded a rebate from curtis lumber,or refused to pay invoices sent by curtis lumber.curtis lumber complied with its customers requests.orders of smartside products were cancelled prior to delivery.curtis lumber paid rebates to seventeen customers,out of concern for losing the customers other business and as a result of having presented this program to them.curtis lumber was unable to collect the amount due on fourteen of the smartside sales.none of curtis lumber customers incurred any costs for which they were not reimbursed,and no customer has filed suit in connection with the smartside rebate promotion.
in april,curtis lumber sued lp in arkansas state court,asserting four causes of action breach of the arkansas deceptive trade practices act adtpa,negligent fraud,equitable estoppel,and intentional.curtis lumber alleged that lp acts caused it to suffer just over in damages,including lost profits from the cancelled sales,costs associated with carrying a large inventory of smartside products,the value of sales that curtis lumber was unable to collect,and costs of rebates paid to customers.further,curtis lumber requested that lp pay attorneys fees and punitive damages.
lp removed this case to federal court and moved for summary judgment on three grounds curtis lumber lacked standing and was not the real party in interest,curtis lumber claims were meritless,and arkansas law precludes the alleged damages.the district court rejected lp threshold challenges but granted partial summary judgment,finding that the negligent fraud claim failed on the merits.the remainder of curtis lumber claims survived because questions of material fact remained as to curtis lumber fraud and adtpa,whether lp omission of a proof of use requirement in the rebate documents was a material omission,whether the omission was intentional,and whether it caused curtis lumber damages.also,the court held that curtis lumber could amend its complaint to allege promissory estoppel and two additional claims under the adtpa.however,the court limited the available damages,concluding that arkansas voluntary payment rule prohibited curtis lumber from seeking the value of rebates or refunds paid to customers,and that the evidence was insufficient to support a punitive damages award.
lp then moved for reconsideration,contending that the district court overlooked the terms products used in the rebate application.during a teleconference,the court acknowledged that it had given curtis lumber the benefit of a favorable inference on that question.nonetheless,the court granted lp motion for reconsideration,concluding that lp included a use requirement in its rebate program documents.as such,the court dismissed the remainder of curtis lumber claims and also held that the voluntary payment rule precludes recovery of lost profits.curtis lumber appeals the dismissal of all of its claims and the district court limitations on damages.lp conditionally the district court determinations that curtis lumber has standing and is the real party in interest.our discussion begins with lp threshold challenges and then addresses the merits of curtis lumber claims and the available damages.
ii.analysis 
standing is a threshold inquiry and jurisdictional prerequisite that must be resolved before reaching the merits of a suit.medalie bayer,cir internal quotations omitted.standing requires an injury in fact fairly traceable to the defendant actions and likely to be redressed by a favorable decision.luj an defenders of wildlife.lp argues that although curtis lumber customers were potentially injured,curtis lumber does not have standing because it voluntarily paid rebates and refunds to its customers.accordingly,curtis lumber alleged injuries are not fairly traceable to lp acts the district court concluded that curtis lumber has shown that it sustained damages based upon lp actions.reviewing de novo,see hodak city of peters,cir,cert.denied,we conclude that curtis lumber has standing to bring this lawsuit.
curtis lumber has alleged distinct injuries that would not have occurred had lp paid rebates owed to the customers.specifically,curtis lumber alleges that it lost the expected profits on the cancelled sales of smartside products and that it paid costs related to carrying the large inventory it ordered in reliance on the rebate promotion.these injuries are actual,particularized to curtis lumber,traceable to lp acts,and redressable by a verdict in curtis lumber favor.as such,the standing requirements are satisfied.see lujan,at.we decline lp invitation to use the principle of constitutional standing to enforce arkansas voluntary payment rule.whether curtis lumber can recover the rebates it paid to customers is a question better left to the applicable substantive law.see infra section.
real party in interest 
federal rule of civil procedure a provides that every action must be prosecuted in the name of the real party in interest.the function of this rule is simply to protect the defendant against a subsequent action by the party actually entitled to recover,and to insure generally that the judgment will have its proper effect as res judicata.a advisory committee note.accordingly,rule a requires that the plaintiff actually possess,under the substantive law,the right sought to be enforced.united healthcare am.trade ins,cir.this inquiry presents legal issues,see in re isbell records,cir,which we review de novo,see manion nagin,cir.
lp contends that the rebate applicants are the real parties in interest,not curtis lumber.curtis lumber is merely seeking to recover on the customers claims,lp argues,and thus the rule is necessary to protect lp from double liability.the district court rejected lp argument,concluding that curtis lumber set forth causes of action based on damages allegedly sustained by itself,not the rebate applicants.we conclude that rule a does not bar curtis lumber lawsuit.curtis lumber has alleged injuries that the customers could not,lost profits on the cancelled sales and the costs associated with unsold inventory.conceivably,the rebate applicants could have asserted a claim against lp after it refused to pay rebates.however,it is undisputed that none of those applicants suffered an injury,and therefore,there is no risk of duplicative litigation.as such,curtis lumber is the real party in interest.
curtis lumber claims 
we now turn to whether the district court erred in granting lp motion for summary judgment as to curtis lumber four causes of action.summary judgment is appropriate when there is no genuine issue of material fact and the moving party is entitled to judgment as a matter of law.landon nw.airlines,cir.like the district court,we give the nonmoving party,curtis lumber,the benefit of all reasonable inferences from the evidence in the record.kukla hulm,cir.our standard of review is de novo,and we may affirm summary judgment on any basis supported by the record.in re baycol prods,cir.

under arkansas law,fraud requires a false representation of material fact knowledge that the representation is false or that there is insufficient evidence upon which to make the representation intent to induce action or inaction in reliance upon the representation justifiable reliance on the representation and damage suffered as a result of the reliance.goforth smith.fraud also extends to concealment of material information and nondisclosure of certain pertinent information.farm bureau policy holders members farm bureau mut.ins.of.
the central focus of this litigation has been whether lp actually misrepresented the terms of the rebate promotion.based on the word used in the rebate application please indicate products used and expected rebate,lp contends that the rebate application included an obvious requirement that the builder or contractor actually have installed the smartside products in order to receive a rebate.lp also argues that the word trial on the information sheet purpose encourage builders and contractors to trial smartside products implicitly indicated lp intent that applicants install the products.we disagree with lp argument for several reasons.
first,the information sheet that lp provided to wholesalers and retailers listed qualifications,limits,and documentation requirements for the rebate promotion.yet,the information sheet never mentioned a requirement that the smartside products had to be installed by a certain date,much less that they had to be installed by the time that the rebate applications were submitted.lp could merely have added two words to the information sheet qualifications this promotion is open to new builders or contractors who purchase and install at least one house worth of smartside products.instead,lp interpretation is premised on the word used,which appears in a small font in the middle the rebate application.viewing the whole context of the rebate information sheet and application rather than particular words and phrases,a person could reasonably infer that lp misrepresented or omitted a material term of the rebate promotion.coleman regions bank.
second,lp interpretation of the rebate documents is untenable.it is undisputed that some of curtis lumber customers had not received smartside products by the time they submitted the rebate applications.without delivery of the smartside products,it would have been impossible for those customers to have used the smartside products.given the delay between ordering the products and distribution and delivery,lp proffered interpretation of the rebate requirements is unreasonable.indeed,ben skoog,the lp employee in charge of the rebate program,testified that customers who ordered the products late in the promotional period would qualify for the rebate program if they installed the products within a reasonable time.
third,even if we credit lp argument that prior use was required in order to qualify for the rebate promotion,the rebate documents did not say that applicants would have to submit proof of use,photos,address in order to receive a rebate.for these reasons,we conclude there is a question of material fact as to whether lp rebate documents misrepresented or omitted a material term of the rebate promotion.
alternatively,lp argues that,even if the rebate documents misrepresented a material term,there is insufficient evidence that it knew about the misrepresentation.in order to prove fraud,curtis lumber must demonstrate scienter,that lp made a material false statement knowing that it was false at the time made.mcanally gildersleeve,cir see also south county,first loan,proof of a mere naked falsehood or representation is not enough even though the complaining party relied on it and sustained damages,but,in addition thereto,the false statement must have been knowingly or intentionally made.quotation omitted.to satisfy this element,curtis lumber is not required to put forth direct evidence or positive testimony of fraud.receivables purchasing,eng g prof l,cir.circumstantial evidence can provide a basis for the jury to infer fraud where the circumstances are inconsistent with honest intent.id.quoting stine sanders.however,the circumstances must be so strong and well connected as to clearly show fraud.allred demuth.
we agree that evidence of scienter is lacking in this case.curtis lumber has not identified any unusual or suspicious conduct or circumstances surrounding lp statements from which we could reasonably infer a fraudulent state of mind.interstate freeway,houser,holding that a jury could infer proof of fraud based on several circumstances surrounding the employment offer in question,including the short duration of the plaintiff employment and the reasons and circumstances for the plaintiff termination.moreover,lp has consistently maintained its interpretation of the rebate promotion requirements,unlike situations where fraud can be inferred from a defendant contradiction of the representation in question.see,morrill becton,dickinson,cir holding that misrepresentations may be actionable fraud based in part on internal memoranda from the defendant company that contradicted the representations in question.
curtis lumber argues that lp knowledge of a false statement can be inferred from skoog testimony that lp intended retailers and customers to rely on the rebate program documents,lp intended to include a requirement in the rebate program,and that the rebate program documents are incomplete because they did not specify the requirement that rebate applicants must install the smartside products by a certain date.however,skoog testimony,even when it is construed in the light most favorable to curtis lumber,amounts merely to an admission in hindsight that the rebate documents were incomplete.the mere admission of a misstatement is not enough to presume a fraudulent state of mind.see houser,at fraud is never presumed,and must be affirmatively proved.at most,skoog testimony supports an inference that the omission in the rebate documents was a product of an honest mistake,which is insufficient to prove fraud.see morrill,at some of the defendant misrepresentations could not be actionable fraud where the only evidence of scienter was testimony that the inaccuracies were honest mistakes.this testimony falls short of the elevated burden for proving fraud by circumstantial evidence.
curtis lumber also contends that scienter can be inferred from the fact that lp deviated from its procedures for processing rebate applications by sending the june letter demanding proof of use.even if we assume that the june letter was a deviation from lp procedures,we fail to see how this fact assists curtis lumber case.if anything,the fact that lp established procedures for processing rebate applications,and that it followed those procedures in nearly all other instances,shows that there was no fraudulent scheme at work.
in sum,curtis lumber has not presented evidence to shed light on lp state of mind when it issued the rebate documents.as such,no reasonable could conclude that lp falsely represented the terms of the rebate promotion with knowledge of such falsity.accordingly,summary judgment was appropriate as to curtis lumber fraud claim.see celotex catrett,summary judgment is mandated against a party who fails to make a showing sufficient to establish the existence of an element essential to that party case,and on which that party will bear the burden of proof at trial.
constructive 
constructive fraud is doctrine of limited reach that arkansas courts have used to broaden tort liability.receivables purchasing,at.as explained in the previous section,traditional fraud requires an intent to deceive and knowledge that a material misrepresentation is false.constructive fraud,by comparison,does not require a deceptive intent or knowledge of falsity.knight day.t he test for constructive fraud has been defined as the making of misrepresentations by one who,not knowing whether they are true or not,asserts them to be true without knowledge of their falsity and without moral guilt or evil intent.south county,at.thus,a representation that is not fraudulent in the traditional sense may be construed as fraudulent because of its tendency to deceive others.knight,at see also lane rachel,r epresentations are construed to be fraudulent when made by one who either knows the assurances to be false or else not knowing the verity asserts them to be true.
curtis lumber complaint alleged that statements made by lp wholesaler,boise cascade,were false.the district court correctly concluded that this allegation was without evidentiary support.accordingly,summary judgment was proper to the extent curtis lumber constructive fraud claim was based on alleged misrepresentations by boise cascade.
curtis lumber argument on appeal,however,is that the district court ignored an aspect of its constructive fraud lp committed constructive fraud by misrepresenting the terms of the rebate promotion.curtis lumber contends that the constructive fraud claim should have survived summary judgment for the same reason that the fraud claim should have survived.in support,curtis lumber relies on the statements in arkansas cases that constructive fraud has all of the elements of fraud without intent to deceive,downum downum.
we believe that curtis lumber misconstrues constructive fraud.the doctrine does not apply to all material misrepresentations regardless of the defendant state of mind.if that were the case,then constructive fraud would encompass negligent misrepresentations as well,which is a result precluded by arkansas law.see south county,at.rather,constructive fraud merely extends tort liability to recklessly false statements.see receivables purchasing,at t he arkansas supreme court would hold that liability for fraud attaches in cases where a defendant lacked knowledge that his or her representation was false but did not know whether it was true or not.as we stated in the previous section,the evidence in the record demonstrates that lp misrepresentation was merely negligent or the result of an honest mistake.a jury could not reasonably find that lp rebate documents were recklessly false.accordingly,summary judgment was appropriate as to the constructive fraud claim.
curtis lumber has alleged that lp acts constitute deceptive trade practices or unlawful acts under the adtpa in five ways first,lp knowingly made a false representation as to the characteristics and benefits of goods,in violation of arkansas code a.second,lp advertised goods with the intent not to sell them as advertised,in violation of arkansas code a.third,lp employed advertising consisting of an attractive but insincere offer to sell a product that lp in truth did not intend or desire to sell,evidenced by the requirement of an undisclosed condition precedent to the purchase,in violation of arkansas code a b.fourth,lp acts in business and commerce were unconscionable,false,and deceptive,in violation of arkansas code a.lastly,lp concealed or omitted a material fact in connection with the sale of goods with the intent that others rely upon the concealment or omission,in violation of arkansas code.
the district court granted summary judgment on curtis lumber adtpa claims based on the finding that lp included a use requirement in the rebate application.we disagree.see supra.as with the fraud claim,however,our analysis continues to the requirements under the adtpa.although the district court did not reach this issue,we must address the element because it is a dispositive issue.if the adtpa requires curtis lumber to prove deception,then summary judgment should be affirmed just as with the fraud claim.
the requirements for claims under the adtpa would be an issue of first impression for the arkansas supreme court.to interpret the adtpa,we adhere to arkansas canons of statutory interpretation 
where a term in a statute is clear and unambiguous,it will be given its ordinary meaning.cash.comm on pollution control ecology.a statutory term is ambiguous when it is capable of two or more constructions,or when it is so unclear that reasonable minds could disagree or be uncertain as to its meaning,mgmt.when an ambiguity exists,the court will interpret the provision in a way consistent with the legislature intent.cent.weiss.that intent may be divined by looking to the language of the statute,the subject matter,the object to be accomplished,the purpose to be served,the remedy provided,the legislative history,and other appropriate means that throw light on the subject.saforo,porocel,d.
design prof ls ins.chicago ins,cir.
it is clear from the text of the adtpa that curtis lumber first three theories require that the defendant knowingly and intentionally engage in a deceptive trade practice.see a knowingly making a false representation emphasis added id.a advertising the goods or services with the intent not to sell them as advertised emphasis added id.a the employment of advertising consisting of an attractive but insincere offer to sell a product or service which the seller in truth does not intend or desire to sell emphasis added see also steel domestic sales,llc hogan hartson,llp,holding that the advertising prohibition in the colorado consumer protection act includes the element of an intent to deceive.in other words,the requirement for those three theories mirrors the requirement for traditional fraud.and since there is no genuine dispute of fact that lp knowingly misrepresented or omitted a term of the rebate promotion,summary judgment was appropriate on curtis lumber first three adtpa theories.
for several reasons,though,we conclude that claims pursuant to arkansas code a and do not require knowing or intentional deception.first,neither provision on its face requires an intent to deceive or knowledge that a representation is false.the arkansas legislature could easily have added the word knowingly,intentionally,or willfully to a and,just as it did under several portions of a accordingly,the absence of one of these terms is evidence that the arkansas legislature did not intend to limit a and to intentional or knowing deception.arkansas owens,had the legislature intended for the five years to run only from the initial order of conditional release it could have easily said so by including such language in the statute.
second,states with laws virtually identical to arkansas code have overwhelmingly concluded that intent to deceive is not required under their analogous provisions.for example,the illinois consumer fraud act icfa prohibits unfair or deceptive acts or practices,including but not limited to the concealment,suppression or omission of such material fact,with intent that others rely upon the concealment,suppression or omission of such material fact in the conduct of any trade or commerce.comp.stat.illinois courts have stated that the seller intent to deceive or lack thereof is immaterial for a claim under the icfa because innocent misrepresentations are also actionable.see,cripe leiter,duhl nash realty.indeed,in a case where the plaintiffs brought an icfa claim against an exterminating company based on the company failure to disclose material facts in a termite inspection report,the appellate court expressly rejected the argument that the defendant could be held liable under the icfa because it did not intend to deceive the plaintiffs 
this is no defense.under the statute,state of mind is immaterial,and a defendant need not be motivated by an intent to deceive a violator good or bad faith is not important.even innocent misrepresentations may be actionable.by its own terms,the statute requires only that a violator intend for a purchaser to rely on his acts or omissions.a party is considered to intend the necessary consequences of his own acts or conduct.
warren lemay,internal citations omitted.accordingly,the court held that the defendant mere submission of the termite inspection report evinces the requisite intent under the icfa because the sole purpose for the requested report was to assist plaintiffs in securing va financing.id.similar persuasive evidence exists in judicial interpretations of materially indistinguishable consumer protection laws in arizona delaware iowa minnesota and missouri we see no basis for concluding that arkansas courts would interpret arkansas code differently with regard to the requirement.
third,the arkansas legislature intended to proscribe more than traditional fraud when used it the term deceptive act or practice in the adtpa provision.see a proscribing any other unconscionable,false,or deceptive act or practice in business,commerce,or trade.because,deceptive act or practice is not defined in any arkansas statute,regulation,or opinion,we look elsewhere.arkansas is one of many states that enacted a deceptive and unfair trade practices act,or a little ftc act,in the or.the majority of states with such laws do not require knowing or intentional deception in order to state an actionable claim under their respective acts.see carolyn carter jonathan sheldon,unfair and deceptive acts and practices,at ed collecting authorities donald zupanec,annotation,practices forbidden by state deceptive trade practice and consumer protection acts,at see also wallis ford motor,surveying other states statutes to interpret the adtpa.those states interpretations of deceptive trade practices are further buttressed by many federal court opinions holding that a defendant good faith is immaterial to whether a deceptive act has occurred under of the federal trade commission act because that statute does not require an intent to deceive along the lines of the federal trade commission definition of deception,many courts have defined trade practices as deceptive if they are likely to deceive or have a capacity to deceive a reasonable consumer.see black law dictionary ed defining deceptive act as defined by the ftc and most state statutes,conduct that is likely to deceive a consumer acting reasonably under similar circumstances.
in addition,arkansas code lists both fraud and deception as unlawful acts.these terms can not be coterminous,as that result would violate the basic principle that a statute must be construed so that every word is given meaning and effect,if possible,so that no word is left void,superfluous or insignificant.rose.state plant.
finally,our interpretation of the adtpa is influenced by the fact that the preamble to the adtpa provides that the statute was enacted to protect the interests of both the consumer public and the legitimate business community.mosby int l paper,wl,at.july,unpublished quoting the adtpa preamble.furthermore,the arkansas supreme court has recognized the legislature remedial purpose in enacting the adtpa and also that a liberal construction of the a dtpa is appropriate.arkansas ex rel.bryant r a inv.liberal construction in this context means that the adtpa should protect consumers from trade practices beyond common law fraud.
in light of these considerations,we conclude that summary judgment was inappropriate as to curtis lumber claims under a and.a reasonable could conclude that lp omitted a material term from the rebate documents with the intent that retailers and customers rely on the rebate likewise that lp rebate documents constituted a deceptive trade practice.but unlike the fraud and constructive fraud claims,the adtpa claims are viable despite the lack of evidence regarding lp knowledge of a false or deceptive practice or it specific intent to deceive.
promissory 
under arkansas law,promissory estoppel requires that the plaintiff clearly show four elements the making of a promise,intent by the promisor that the promise be relied upon,reliance upon the promise by the promisee,and injustice resulting from a refusal to enforce the promise.in re hilyard drilling,cir see also props.of,lowell inv.partners,llc,t he party asserting estoppel must prove it strictly,there must be certainty to every intent,the facts constituting it must not be taken by argument or inference,and nothing can be supplied by intendment.curtis lumber alleges that lp promised to pay rebates if customers met the qualifications on the rebate documents,lp intended retailers like curtis lumber and customers to rely on the promise,curtis lumber detrimentally relied on lp promise,and curtis lumber injuries constitute an injustice.notably,other courts have held that a plaintiff is not required to show that a defendant harbored a fraudulent intent in order to recover under the doctrine of promissory estoppel.see harris chicago hous,c,wl,at.july,unpublished defendant contention that fraud or intent to deceive is a required element of a promissory estoppel claim is flatly incorrect.
lp contends that curtis lumber can not prove the elements of promissory estoppel for two reasons.first,lp argues that it fulfilled the promises it made regarding the rebate program.however,we believe a reasonable could disagree.lp promised to pay rebates to customers who purchased smartside products and,importantly,failed to state a condition to this payment that the customers use the products by a certain date or submit proof of their use to lp.see supra.as such,lp first argument fails.
lp second argument is that relief under promissory estoppel is limited to enforcement of the promise between lp and the customers,and therefore curtis lumber can not recover for the costs it incurred in reliance on lp promise.the sole remedy,according to lp,is requiring lp to pay rebates to the customers.however,lp argument is contrary to section of the restatement second of contracts,which,in arkansas,is the law on promissory estoppel,at.comment d to expressly contemplates a variety of available remedies 
a promise binding under this section is a contract,and enforcement by normal remedies is often appropriate.but the same factors which bear on whether any relief should be granted also bear on the character and extent of the remedy.in particular,relief may sometimes be limited to restitution or to damages or specific relief measured by the extent of the promisee reliance rather than by the terms of the promise.
restatement second of contracts,cmt.d emphasis added.moreover,the restatement also contemplates claims brought by third parties who detrimentally rely on a promise.see id.a promise which the promisor should reasonably expect to induce action or forbearance on the part of the promisee or a third person and which does induce such action or forbearance emphasis added see also id.cmt.reliance by third parties.lp cites two arkansas cases,peoples national bank linebarger construction,and country corner food drug,reiss,for the position that the remedies under promissory estoppel are limited,but neither case is apposite.therefore,we conclude that arkansas law permits curtis lumber to recover damages it incurred in reliance on lp promise under the doctrine of promissory estoppel.
curtis lumber seeks damages for lost profits on the sales of smartside products,increased costs associated with carrying extra inventory,the value of rebates that curtis lumber paid to its customers,the value of sales it was unable to collect due to lp acts,injuries to goodwill,attorneys fees,and punitive damages.lp argues that several of the damages claims are barred by law,but it does not appear to challenge the damages sought for inventory costs,goodwill,or attorneys fees.
lost profits 
arkansas has not decided whether lost profits are recoverable under promissory estoppel.see beach beverage harris brands,reserving this question.lost profits are recoverable,however,under the adtpa.see f any person who suffers actual damage or injury as a result of an offense or violation as defined in this act has a cause of action to recover actual damages,if appropriate,and reasonable attorney fees.smith walt bennett ford,l ost profits are recoverable under the federal odometer fraud act as actual damages provided they are proved to the requisite levels of certainty and causation.
the district court initially held that curtis lumber has presented enough evidence to recover damages for lost profits.in its order granting lp motion for reconsideration,however,the court determined that the voluntary payment rule precludes curtis lumber from recovering lost profits.this result is incorrect.although curtis lumber payments to customers arguably were voluntary,curtis lumber alleged lost profits were not.lp does not argue to the contrary.accordingly,we hold that curtis lumber may pursue damages for lost profits on the cancelled sales.
rebates paid by curtis lumber 
this section concerns the rebates that curtis lumber paid,either in the form of a cash refund or an account credit,to seventeen of its customers after lp refused to pay the rebates.lp argues that curtis lumber can not recover any payments or account credits it gave to its customers,because curtis lumber voluntarily gave those payments and credits under arkansas voluntary payment rule,a person can not recover money that he or she has voluntarily paid.see boswell gillett,see also tb of blythesville,little rock sign emblem.a payment is deemed voluntary,and thus not recoverable,when a person without mistake of fact or fraud,duress,coercion,or extortion pays money on a demand which is not enforceable against him.ritchie bluff city lumber.curtis lumber admits that it had no enforceable obligation to pay rebates to its customers.instead,it argues that the fraud and duress exceptions to the voluntary payment rule apply,and therefore,payment of the rebates was not voluntary.
the fraud exception does not apply because,as we stated previously,curtis lumber has not shown a viable fraud claim.moreover,even if curtis lumber could establish the requisite state of mind for fraud,it has not shown that it paid rebates to customers in reliance on lp allegedly fraudulent statement.stated differently,lp alleged fraud did not induce curtis lumber to pay rebates.at most,curtis lumber has shown.e,that lp statements caused a situation in which it felt compelled to pay rebates to the customers.that is different,however,from the situation where a payor is fraudulently induced to make a payment,in which case the law treats the payment as involuntary.see payment.
curtis lumber duress argument is more compelling.the record shows that curtis lumber marketed lp products and the rebate promotion to customers representing percent of its business.after lp june letter to the rebate applicants,curtis lumber owner,who was relatively new to the business,stated that he was compelled to pay customers the rebates o ut of concern for losing their other business and as a result of having presented this program to them.indeed,two of curtis lumber customers stated that they would have considered withdrawing their business from curtis lumber if the rebates were not paid the coercive pressures on curtis lumber are further evidenced by the email it sent to lp through counsel in july demanding the rebates be paid drawing all reasonable inferences in favor of curtis lumber,there is at minimum a factual dispute as to whether curtis lumber decision to pay rebates was compelled by a threat of losing substantial business.the question,then,is whether this type of pressure was enough to render payment involuntary under the doctrine of duress.
lp first argues that the pressure from customers is irrelevant because curtis lumber can only assert the duress exception against the party who exerted pressure over it.in other words,curtis lumber can not complain about pressure from the customers and allege duress against a third party,lp.admittedly,this rule finds some support in a old arkansas case 
the doctrine established by the authorities is that a payment is not to be regarded as compulsory,unless made to emancipate the person or property from an actual and existing duress imposed upon it by the party to whom the money is paid it is sufficient when there is some actual or threatened exercise of power possessed,or believed to be possessed,by the party exacting or receiving the payment over the person or property of another from which the latter has no other means of immediate relief than by making the payment.
vick shinn,emphasis removed and added quotations and internal citations omitted.however,the emphasized language from vick was dicta because the issue on appeal in that case was the sufficiency of evidence to show duress.the court found that the payment was voluntary,and it did not decide whether duress can be asserted against a person different from the payee exerting pressure.id.

furthermore,we are not aware of any case in which a court has held that duress can not be asserted against a.duress is often asserted against payees,but it does not necessarilly follow that duress is limited to that scenario.the duress exception,in essence,recognizes that payments made under compulsion are not voluntary.we believe it makes little difference who exerts pressure and who receives the payment,so long as the duress is causally tied to the defendant and the pressure is sufficient to reasonably deem a payment involuntary any limitation on this doctrine based on the identity of the party exerting pressure would be artificial.in sum,we believe the duress exception is flexible.see bmg direct mktg.peake,t he rule is an equitable one and may require balancing competing interests depending upon the parties circumstances.
next,lp argues that the evidence is insufficient to show duress because curtis lumber had the absolute right to deny the customers requests for payment.surely,duress is limited to situations in which the payor had no other means of immediate relief than by making the payment.vick,at.the problem with lp argument,though,is that curtis lumber alternative options,in reality,would not have afforded relief.see d duress undue influence t he adequacy of the remedy is to be tested by a practical standard,which takes into consideration the exigencies of the situation of the alleged victim.curtis lumber presented this promotion to its customers,and the customers who ordered smartside products represented a substantial portion of curtis lumber overall business.to put it coloquially,it would have been penny wise but pound foolish for curtis lumber to demand payment from the customers and to refuse to pay rebates.that is,curtis lumber would have fared well in the with the smartside promotion but suffered severe repercussions in its overall revenue.as such,a reasonable could find that curtis lumber had no other means of immediate relief.
finally,lp contends that curtis lumber is actually alleging business duress also referred to as economic duress or business compulsion,which arkansas courts have not recognized.curtis lumber responds that the modern trend in a wide variety of jurisdictions is to relax the voluntary payment rule to recognize that duress can exist from business pressures just as much as threats of physical harm.see,machinery hauling,steel of,collecting authorities and summarizing through the years,there has been a steady expansion of duress principle such that direct dire harm is no longer essential,the focus instead being on whether the threat overbears the exercise of free will.
neither party cites cox mclaughlin,which we find informative as to how the arkansas supreme court would apply the duress exception in the context of the voluntary payment rule.in that case,a cargo transportation broker arranged for a trucking company to deliver a shipment of pet food from a factory in nebraska to a warehouse in texas.id.at.the trucking company leased a truck and agreed to pay a driver to haul the shipment.id.while the shipment was en route,however,the trucking company told the driver that it could not pay for the delivery.id.the driver refused to continue on the trip unless paid.id.the broker,who did not want to lose its valuable brokerage account with the pet food company,agreed to pay the driver roughly the amount owed by the trucking company.id.at.the broker later refused to pay the full amount,and the driver sued for breach of contract.id.the broker sought to void the agreement with the driver on the basis of though there was no express threat from the pet food company,let alone a threat of physical harm.the arkansas supreme court expressly recognized e conomic duress as a valid excuse for voiding a contract.id.at.ultimately,the court held that questions of fact precluded summary judgment on the duress issue,whether the broker would have suffered serious financial hardship,whether the broker was the victim of a wrongful act,and whether other remedies would be inadequate.id.at.although cox dealt with a party seeking to void a contract,we believe its analysis is instructive for duress in general in light of cox and the persuasive circumstances of this case,we believe the arkansas supreme court would hold that duress may have existed in this case.thus,summary judgment was inappropriate to the extent it limited damages based on the voluntary payment rule.
punitive damages 
by statute in arkansas,punitive damages are restricted to situations where 
the defendant knew or ought to have known,in light of the surrounding circumstances,that his or her conduct would naturally and probably result in injury or damage and that he or she continued the conduct with malice or in reckless disregard of the consequences,from which malice may be inferred or the defendant intentionally pursued a course of conduct for the purpose of causing injury or damage.
moreover,plaintiffs are required to satisfy the above standard by clear and convincing evidence.id.
curtis lumber argues that punitive damages are particularly appropriate in cases involving fraud.that is true,see ray dodge,moore,but curtis lumber claims based on intentional deception fail as a matter of law.upon careful review of the record,we believe no reasonable jury could find that lp acted with malice or an intent to harm curtis lumber.as such,curtis lumber is not entitled to pursue punitive damages.
iii.conclusion 
for the foregoing reasons,we affirm the district court judgment with regard to curtis lumber claims for fraud,constructive fraud,and deceptive trade practices.we reverse the judgment with regard to the claims under arkansas code a and and promissory estoppel.as to damages,we affirm the district court limitation on punitive damages but reverse the limitation based on the voluntary payment rule.we remand for further proceedings consistent with this opinion.
i respectfully dissent because i conclude that,applying arkansas substantive law with respect to all of curtis lumber claims,curtis lumber is not the real party in interest to prosecute the present action.
federal rule of civil procedure rule a provides e very action shall be prosecuted in the name of the real party in interest.a.the real party in interest is a party who,under governing substantive law,possesses the rights to be enforced.see iowa public serv.medicine bow coal,cir.
in a diversity action,state law determines the issue of who is a real party in interest.jaramillo burkhart,f d,cir.
consul of republic of indonesia bill rentals,cir emphasis added.such a requirement is in place to protect the defendant against a subsequent action by the party actually entitled to recover,and to insure generally that the judgment will have its proper effect as res judicata.united healthcare,at quoting.a advisory committee note.
here,arkansas law governs who possesses the rights to be enforced.consul,at.curtis lumber has brought claims under arkansas law for violation of the adtpa,negligent fraud,equitable estoppel,and intentional.therefore,we must look to arkansas substantive law to determine whether curtis lumber is the proper party to bring these claims.
with regard to the adtpa,arkansas law provides that a ny person who suffers actual damage or injury as a result of an offense or violation as defined in this chapter has a cause of action to recover actual damages,if appropriate,and reasonable attorney fees.ann.f emphasis added.similarly,arkansas law provides that in order for a plaintiff to recover for fraud,a plaintiff must show,among other things,damage suffered as a result of the reliance upon the false representation of material fact.mcadams ellington,emphasis added.the same is true for constructive fraud,see knight day,and promissory estoppel,see shaw smith,no.ca,wl,at.may,unpublished.
as the majority notes,curtis lumber alleges that it has sustained actual damages for lost profits and rebates that it paid to its customers.see supra part.the question of whether curtis lumber has sustained actual damages under arkansas substantive law and,in turn,is the proper party in interest to bring the present suit,turns on whether arkansas voluntary payment rule applies to its claims for damages.
originally,the district court found that curtis lumber could not recover the rebates or refunds that it paid to its customers because those payments were voluntary,and curtis lumber was under no legal obligation to make those payments.the court also found that the economic duress exception to the voluntary payment rule did not apply because that rule would only apply if lp had exerted economic duress over curtis lumber to force curtis lumber to pay the rebates to the customers.but the court found that curtis lumber had provided enough evidence of lost profits and increased costs to withstand lp summary judgment motion on the issue of actual damages.
thereafter,lp filed a motion for reconsideration,arguing that any curtis lumber damage must be separate and independent from a claim of a rebate applicant,which would only be the if they ever sued lp.lp asserted that 
the lost profit that they curtis lumber would seek in this case could only be a part of a rebate claim,because that is the amount of money that curtis built into his sales price when he sold the smartside products.and,thus,if he were to sue us for a lost he already told us on the average the lost profit per customer who bought of material was.if he sues us for that and the court lets him do that and then a customer later sues lp for its rebate of,we ultimately pay a amount on a rebate.
so position is that the lost profit could only be a part of the rebate claim of the claimant and he has no right to recover that,because it not separate and distinct.
lp then asserted that no exception to the voluntary payment rule applied.
curtis lumber also confirmed for the district court that it had initially charged the accounts of customers who had not made a payment on their account when the customers then informed curtis lumber that they did not want the product,curtis lumber then wrote off the account or credited the account for the amount that had been originally billed under an invoice.curtis lumber did not consider this to be a voluntary payment because it had not paid the customers anything furthermore,the customers did not receive the product,nor had they ever paid curtis lumber.
but the district court found that this was a distinction without a difference,explaining 
if they paid you money and you refund them money to erase a debt,then if they have been charged and then you forgive that charge by writing off the account,the bottom line is the same.all of the money has been refunded to the customer either in the form of cash if they advanced cash or credit if they have just been charged on an account.it seems to me that under these circumstances,if it undisputed that all of the customers were either refunded cash for what they were advanced or given credit to cancel their account,that they all fall under this voluntary payments rule and would not be included as damages.
in its order granting lp motion for reconsideration,the district court found that the voluntary payment rule precludes the plaintiff from recovering lost profits based upon the facts of this case.
on appeal,curtis lumber argues that the district court erred in holding that the voluntary payment rule barred its recovery because its cancelation sic of orders and payment of refunds and rebates to its customers were not voluntary in either the or legal meaning of the word because its actions and damages were the result of l.p.fraud and duress placed on curtis lumber.emphasis added.
it has long been settled that money voluntarily paid in satisfaction of an unjust or illegal demand,with full knowledge of the facts,and without fraud,duress,or extortion,can not afterwards be recovered by the payor.larrimer murphy,in order for the rule to apply,the payor must not have had a legal duty to pay.tb of blytheville,at.
under arkansas law,the making of the advancements and the placing of the credits to an account is a payment.ritchie,at.
where there is an open account between two parties,in the absence of an agreement to the contrary,all items of the account become constituent parts thereof,and are applied in payment of the oldest item in the account on the other side and he only is entitled to recover in whose favor the final balance upon the whole account is found.the rule is,where there are mutual accounts,the credits on one side are applied,to the extinguishment of debits on the other,as payments intentionally made thereon.
as to curtis lumber claim for lost profits,the majority concludes that a lthough curtis lumber payments to customers arguably were voluntary,curtis lumber alleged lost profits were not.see supra part.but curtis lumber claim for lost profits stems from it either refunding in total a customer who already paid for the smartside products or crediting back the account of a customer who had ordered,but not yet paid for,smartside products.although it may have been areasonable business decision,curtis lumber has failed to produce any evidence that it was under a legal obligation to make this refund or credit to its customers.see tb of blytheville,at.furthermore,both the refunding of customers and the crediting back of customers accounts constitute payments under arkansas law,as the district court correctly concluded.see ritchie,at.as a result,the voluntary payment rule is applicable unless curtis lumber can show that an exception to the rule applies.see larrimer,at.
as to the rebates that curtis lumber paid to some of its customers,the majority notes curtis lumber concession that it had no enforceable obligation to pay rebates to its customers.instead,it argues that the fraud and duress exceptions to the voluntary payment rule apply,and therefore,payment of the rebates was not voluntary.see supra part.
i concur in the majority conclusion that the fraud exception does not apply,but i extend its conclusion to both curtis lumber claims for rebates and lost profits.see supra part.i respectfully dissent from the majority conclusion that the arkansas supreme court would hold that duress may have existed in this case.id.instead,i conclude that the duress exception does not apply to either curtis lumber claim for rebates or lost profits.
first,i disagree with the majority dismissal of the arkansas supreme court statement in vick 
that a payment is not to be regarded as compulsory,unless made to emancipate the person or property from an actual and existing duress imposed upon it by the party to whom the money is paid it is sufficient when there is some actual or threatened exercise of power possessed,or believed to be possessed,by the party exacting or receiving the payment over the person or property of another from which the latter has no other means of immediate relief than by making the payment.
