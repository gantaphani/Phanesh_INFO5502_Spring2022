alleged defects 
buyer alleges that,after the sale,it became aware of numerous and pervasive defects and damage throughout the apartments.the alleged defects include damaged and defective roofing,balconies,flashing,trim,pavement,and sidewalks.buyer expressed particular concern with water and mold damage caused by the absence of any flashing around all windows in the apartments.buyer asserts that eugene andrade knew flashing had not been installed at the apartments and did not disclose the absence of flashing to buyer.
buyer presented the opinion of adam posard regarding the absence of flashing.posard is licensed by california as an architect and a general building contractor.posard inspected the apartments and viewed photographs taken by an architect and contractor who performed repairs to the apartments in.posard stated that flashing has been used by builders for generations and is required by the uniform building code.he stated his opinion that the only reason the general contractor and its subcontractors would omit the required flashing is to save money,at the expense and harm to any subsequent purchaser of the property.in posard opinion,the omission of the flashing was the result of willful misconduct.
in its separate statement,western asserted that its installation of the windows without flashing paper was open and obvious to any person monitoring,inspecting or working on the job site.disputed this assertion of fact,contending that the omission was not open and obvious because eugene andrade had no knowledge that flashing paper could be installed around windows until after the pending case was filed.in contrast,buyer did not dispute western assertion of fact but made evidentiary objections to the declarations western filed to support its assertion.
western moving papers and the opposition papers indicate that the parties dispute whether western installation of windows complied with the uniform building code and the city of fresno building code and whether,at the time of installation,the city of fresno required flashing paper to be installed with the windows.those papers also establish,and the parties do not dispute,that city of fresno officials inspected and approved the window installation,although buyer objected to the evidence western submitted to support this fact.

discussion 
standard of review 
ii.the limitations period and willful misconduct exemption 
statutory provisions 
section provides in relevant part 
a no action may be brought to recover damages from any person who develops real property or performs or furnishes the design or construction of an improvement to real property more than years after the substantial completion of the development or improvement for any of the following any latent deficiency in the design or construction of an improvement to,or survey of,real property.injury to property,real or personal,arising out of any such latent deficiency.
this limitations period is subject to exemptions.for example,subdivision c of section states 
as used in this section,action includes an action for indemnity brought against a person arising out of that person performance or furnishing of services or materials referred to in this section,except that a for indemnity may be filed pursuant to subdivision b of section in an action which has been brought within the time period set forth in subdivision a of this section.
subdivision f of section provides this section shall not apply to actions based on willful misconduct or fraudulent concealment.
contentions of the parties 
buyer contends the superior court erred in concluding the exemption contained in subdivision f of section does not apply to for indemnity.buyer and argue the term action used in subdivision f of section should be interpreted to include for indemnity.
in contrast,subcontractors contend that they are protected by the limitations period set forth in section.in addition to arguing in favor of the superior court interpretation of subdivision f,they assert the willful misconduct exemption does not apply to for indemnity because that pleading did not specifically allege willful misconduct.
background on section 
generally,a lawsuit alleging a latent construction defect must be brought within three or four years depending on the theory of recovery after the plaintiff discovers,or should have discovered,the defect.lantzy centex homes cal th,d,lantzy.in,the legislature capped the nature of this discovery rule by enacting section,which established a further general rule that no action for latent construction defects may be commenced more than years after substantial completion of the construction project.citation.this absolute limitations period applies regardless of when the defect was discovered.lantzy,at,d,fn.omitted.
the california supreme court use of quotation marks around the word absolute in lantzy indicates that the limitations period can not be regarded as absolute in all contexts.for example,s ection itself provides several clear exemptions from the limit lantzy,supra,cal th at,d,and our high court has recognized that a party might be equitably estopped from asserting that the period has expired.id.at,d.
the two statutory exemptions relevant to our analysis are contained in subdivisions c and f of section.
both buyer and rely on acosta glenfed development th,d acosta in support of their interpretation of subdivision f of section.
in acosta,the plaintiffs sued a contractor for construction defects in their homes.the contractor,in turn,sued various subcontractors for indemnification and on other theories.acosta,supra,th at,d.the contractor moved for summary judgment on the ground that the plaintiffs complaint was filed more than years after substantial completion of their homes.the trial court determined that subdivision f of section did not apply and granted the contractor motion.acosta,supra,at,d.as a result,the trial court also granted the subcontractors motion for summary judgment the subcontractors could not be liable for indemnification when the contractor had prevailed against the plaintiffs.id.at,d.
the court of appeal reversed the trial court order granting the contractor motion for summary judgment.acosta,supra,th at,d.the court concluded there was sufficient evidence in the record that a trier of fact could find the subcontractors engaged in acts of willful misconduct in the construction of the plaintiffs homes and the facts and circumstance justified charging the contractor with the subcontractors willful misconduct.id.at,d.the court partially based its conclusion on the declarations of the plaintiffs experts.those declarations identified many alleged defects,stated that the defects involved conspicuous failures to comply with the building code,and expressed the opinion that the defects could not be present without the tacit or express approval of the contractor.id.at,d.
the court also reversed the summary judgment in favor of the subcontractors on the ground that the reinstatement of the plaintiffs claim against the contractor created the possibility that the subcontractors would be liable to indemnify the contractor.acosta,supra,th at,d.the court of appeal declined to consider the
