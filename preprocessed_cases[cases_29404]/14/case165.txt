following the city of alvin refusal to permit a proposed housing project,the developer,filed suit under the fair housing act,alleging that the city denial was motivated by racial animus and that it had a discriminatory impact on racial minorities,specifically hispanics.the district court granted summary judgment for the city.we now affirm.
and its sister companies collectively proposed two developments,each with residential rental units,to be built in the city of alvin,texas.located miles southeast of houston,in northeast brazoria county,the city is home to more than residents,of whom between and are hispanic 
in january,to secure funding for the project,applied to the texas department of housing and community affairs for housing tax credits.the city opposed the application and,about two months after application,submitted a resolution urging that the city already had a greater proportion of citizens receiving housing assistance than other cities in brazoria county,and that the proposed development did not meet municipal building ordinances.nevertheless,the department of housing and community affairs approved the application in june and notified the city of its decision.in april,the city passed additional resolutions,using the same language as the first,opposing two other housing developments.
undeterred,sought a permit for the proposed project.the city held its first meeting with in april.there,it informed representative that the proposed location for the project would violate section e of the municipal ordinances the ordinance,which proscribes placing an apartment project within feet of a single family residential dwelling the city then provided with a copy of the ordinance.at this meeting,a city official took notes that indicate that when representative asked,what if we got a variance for the apartment project location the city replied,you can ask but there was a resolution on this site not to do it.
again at informal meetings with in june and january,the city reiterated that the proposed project violated the ordinance.at no time did seek a variance for the apparent violation.
during the second meeting in march,the city,presented with preliminary plats,noted that the project continued to violate the ordinance because it remained within feet of a residential triplex that included at least two single family homes.at this meeting,offered to eliminate one development and to move the other farther from the triplex the remaining development would use the front part of the property,abutting a highway,as retail development,with a road running through the middle.the city balked,saying that this proposal still violated regulations because it did not provide adequate access from the complex to a public street.
the parties exchanged letters discussing the street issue throughout the summer of,but to no avail.when suggested,as a compromise,that the city deem the access road a public street,thus excepting it from the development bounds,the city refused.doing so,argued the city,would create unnecessary expense while serving only the housing project.
in any event,according to a map provided by the city in august,the project continued to have other problems.not only was it within feet of the triplex,it also stood within feet of a mobile home park,in violation of the ordinance.notes that this was the first time that the city mentioned the mobile home park.
eventually the parties were able to resolve all of the city objections to the other violations of municipal for the putative violation of the ordinance.still without municipal approval in february,canceled the project,knowing it would not be completed before the state tax credits expired on december.
later brought this lawsuit in district court,alleging that the city actions in adopting or enforcing its separation requirement had the purpose or effect of making housing unavailable to racial minorities,specifically hispanics,in violation of the fair housing act.the district court found summary judgment in favor of the city,now appeals,and this court employs the same standard of review as the district court 
the federal housing act prohibits discrimination in the provision of housing we have recognized that a claim brought under the act may be established not only by proof of discriminatory intent,but also by proof of a significant discriminatory effect.following either avenue,claim falls short.
discriminatory intent 
to survive summary judgment on its claim of discriminatory intent,must establish a fact issue as to whether the city stated reason for its,that the project violates the city municipal pretextual and a reasonable inference that race was a significant factor in the refusal the city refusal may have been unsound,unfair,or even unlawful,yet not have been violative of the fair housing act if there is no evidence that race was a significant factor in the city decision.
the city resolutions 
first points to the city resolution opposing tax credits for the development,as well as the city later opposition to other proposed projects.for each project,the city resolution stated that the proposed project in question does not meet the city building ordinances,that one third of all the residents in brazoria county that utilize housing vouchers currently reside in alvin,that in comparison with all the other cities in brazoria county,the city currently has a higher percentage of citizens receiving housing assistance,and that a new apartment complex with similar rental assistance programs recently opened for occupancy in late.
notes that,at the time of the resolution,the city had not received plans or plats for the project and had not requested marketing studies,and the texas department of housing and community affairs had not approved the project.essentially,contends that the city acted hastily and without adequate information in voicing its opposition,and this speed belies the city assertion of purpose.
as an initial matter,we see no reason why plans,plats,or marketing studies would be necessary to determine that the project does not meet the city building ordinances at least as far as the ordinance at issue here is concerned so long as the city knew where the project would be built,it could determine that the project was within feet of single family housing.fails to convince that rejection of a specific project based on that basic knowledge is arbitrary or unreasonable.moreover,there is no evidence that these resolutions constituted departures from the city normal policy and procedure no evidence that tax application was treated any differently,or addressed more quickly,than other projects submitted to the department of housing and community affairs no evidence to suggest that a marketing study is normally prepared prior to a resolution supporting or opposing a project tax credit application and no evidence that the city opposition of the tax credits affected its consideration of the project permit.the fundamental flaw,in the evidence that does put forth,is that it offered it in a vacuum it presented absolutely no evidence that other,applicants or applications were treated any differently around the time of rejection.without more,as the district court held,the speed with which the city responded is of no moment.
the city interpretation of the municipal code 
also asserts that the city interpretation of the ordinance was is thus evidence of discriminatory the city refused to deem the project proposed access road a city street,excepting it from the project bounds,and because the city treated the structures in the adjacent mobile home park as single family dwellings.
as previously discussed,when offered to change the project design,it proposed moving the actual apartments farther away from the residential triplex.the city found that the change would not save the project from a violation,however,because the changes required the addition of an access road,and the access road would run from the side of the plot closest to the residential triplex.the city considered the access road a part of the apartment project,meaning that nothing had changed for purposes of the ordinance,and the project was still within fe
