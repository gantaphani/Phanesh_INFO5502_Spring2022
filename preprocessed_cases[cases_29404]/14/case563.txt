in march,the property manager discovered a water leak in the home,which was vacant at the time.the property manager shut off the water and called roy,who in turn called his insurer,allstate.a mitigation company was hired to remove excess water,damaged dry wall,and carpet.allstate inspected the property in april and completed repairs of the home in june.in july,allstate sent kb home a notice of its intent to pursue its subrogation right to recover payment for loss at the subject property,specifically water damage due to pipe burst in master bedroom on floor.ceiling damage.the notice was sent to an address in irvine.in november,allstate counsel sent a demand for settlement of the loss in the amount of.the demand was sent to kb home corporate address in los angeles.kb home did not respond.
in march,allstate filed a complaint in subrogation against kb home,asserting causes of action for negligence,breach of implied warranty,and strict liability.in july,the trial court sustained kb home demurrer to the complaint with leave to amend,on the ground that allstate did not allege compliance with the prelitigation procedures of the act.
allstate then filed a first amended complaint that advanced a single cause of action for property damage in subrogation,which alleged a violation of the act.kb home demurred on the ground that allstate had failed to serve a notice of claim that would have allowed kb home to repair the defect.instead of ruling on the demurrer to the first amended complaint,the court issued a nunc pro tunc order reviving the original complaint and overruling the demurrer to that pleading,which it previously had sustained.the court specifically ruled that the prelitigation procedure of the act did not apply to allstate subrogation claim.on kb home petition,we issued an alternative writ of mandate,directing the court to vacate the nunc pro tunc order and to consider the demurrer to the first amended complaint.the court complied,sustaining that demurrer with leave to amend.we then dismissed kb home petition as moot.
in march,allstate filed a second amended complaint for property damage in subrogation,which combined the causes of action for negligence,strict liability,breach of implied warranty and violation of the act from the two previous complaints.in may,the court overruled kb home demurrer to that complaint,again ruling that the act did not apply to subrogation claims.on kb home petition,we issued another alternative writ,directing the court to sustain the demurrer to the negligence and strict liability causes of action in the second amended complaint and overrule the demurrer to the cause of action under the act.the court complied,and we dismissed the petition as moot.
subsequently,kb home filed a motion for summary judgment against allstate and a for indemnity against various entities involved in the construction of the home.the summary judgment motion was based on failure to give kb home timely notice to allow it to repair the defect,which was asserted as an affirmative defense against allstate claim in subrogation.allstate filed its own motion for summary judgment.it argued that kb home had violated the building standards of the act and was statutorily liable for damages,that the act did not require notice to the builder before repairs,and that there was compliance with the notice requirements.
in january,the court denied kb home summary judgment motion,ruling that allstate july and november letters to kb home substantially complied with the notice requirements of the act,and kb home lost its right to repair when it failed to respond to those letters.the court granted allstate motion for summary judgment,finding kb home breached the building standards of the act,and allstate did not have to prove its damages.on kb home third petition in this case,we issued yet another alternative writ of mandate,directing the court to grant kb home motion for summary judgment and to deny allstate motion for such relief.the trial court declined to comply with the alternative writ in light of the recent decision in liberty mutual ins.brookfield crystal cove llc th liberty mutual review denied.
discussion 
in its return,allstate argues that liberty mutual,supra,th,has resolved the issue before us because,under its holding,the act does not apply in cases of actual property damage,and allstate has valid common law tort claims and remedies in subrogation.the issue in liberty mutual was whether the act provides the exclusive remedy in cases where a construction defect causes actual damage to a home.that issue was the subject of kb home earlier writ petition,which we dismissed as moot after the trial court sustained the demurrer to allstate common law tort claims pursuant to our alternative writ.kb home current writ petition pertains to summary judgment motions on allstate only remaining cause of action which was pled under the act.thus,whether the act or tort common law applies in this case is not an issue properly before us at this time.see eisenberg et,cal.practice guide civil appeals and writs the rutter group,issues not raised in petition may not be raised in return.nothing in our decision prevents allstate from raising that issue in an appeal from the final judgment.see mounger gates d,order sustaining demurrer to some but not all causes of action normally subject to appeal from final judgment angelica textile services,park th,interlocutory order granting summary adjudication reviewable on appeal from final judgment.
the issue that is before us is whether the act requires that notice be given to a builder before repairs are made.liberty mutual,supra,th did not address that issue since,in that case,the builder was allowed to repair the damage to the home.here,in contrast,it is undisputed that kb home was not given notice or opportunity to inspect and repair the defect before the damage was repaired.we conclude that the failure to give timely notice to kb home is fatal to allstate cause of action under the act,and summary judgment for kb home is proper under the circumstances.
