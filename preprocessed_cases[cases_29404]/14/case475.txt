petitioner ajp construction,ajp served as the concrete subcontractor for the construction of a residential building in hoboken,new jersey.responding to a call reporting accidents and other safety hazards,osha began an inspection of the construction site in the fall of.while osha investigation was pending,ajp employee james sherengo fell to his death while working at the site.at the time of the fatal accident,sherengo and two other ajp employees were working on a outrigger scaffold.osha regulations define an outrigger scaffold as a supported scaffold consisting of a platform resting on outrigger beams thrustouts projecting beyond the wall or face of the building or structure,the inboard ends of which are secured inside the building or structure.b.the accident occurred when a crane hit construction materials hanging over the edge of the twelfth floor,toppling them onto the scaffold and causing sherengo deadly fall.
after the fatal accident,osha cited ajp for several violations relating to sherengo death.first,and central to this case,osha found that ajp knowingly failed to use personal or guardrail systems to protect the employees on the outrigger scaffold in willful violation of g vii.specifically,osha found that the outrigger scaffold had no guardrails and that sherengo wore no equipment.although the other two employees working on the outrigger scaffold wore harnesses,the harnesses were entirely unsecured.osha also found that the large stack of construction material that fell from the twelfth floor was neither secured nor placed away from the edge of the building in violation of h that the scaffold was not erected under the supervision and direction of a competent person qualified in scaffold erection in violation of f that the scaffold had not been constructed in accordance with a professional engineer design in violation of i that the employees working on the scaffold had never been trained by a person qualified to recognize the hazards associated with the type of scaffold being used and to understand the procedures to control or minimize those hazards in violation of a and finally,that ajp had failed to protect employees exposed to the elevated unguarded edge of the building itself in violation of b.in addition,osha cited the company for several violations unrelated to the fatal accident.
ajp contested all of the citations before the commission.pursuant to j,the commission appointed an administrative law judge who held a evidentiary hearing.with respect to the willful violation of g vii,the company did not dispute that the outrigger scaffold lacked guardrails or that the three employees wore insufficient fall protection.instead,ajp argued that it lacked the level of knowledge required for a violation.it also challenged the willful classification.rejecting ajp arguments,the alj affirmed the willful violation as well as a majority of the other citations.ajp filed a petition for review with the commission.when the commission declined to review the case,the alj decision became the commission final order.see j.
in its petition for review in this court,ajp challenges all of the commission adverse determinations,arguing that they are unsupported by substantial evidence.the company also argues that the scaffolding regulations fail to provide the fair notice required by the fifth amendment due process clause.see epa,recognizing that agency regulations must provide fair notice before penalties are imposed.

we begin with ajp primary the alj erred in finding that the company willfully violated g vii requirement that employers use guardrails or personal equipment to protect employees on outrigger scaffolds.repeating arguments soundly rejected by the alj and urging us to evidence and to substitute our judgment for the alj,ajp contends both that it lacked the level of knowledge required for the violation and that the alj had no basis for finding that the violation was willful.applying our deferential standard of review,we have little trouble concluding that substantial evidence in the record supports the alj findings on both issues.
in finding that ajp had the requisite knowledge,the alj relied largely on the testimony of general contractor employee keith healy that he had repeatedly informed ajp both verbally and through written safety memoranda that the company employees were working on platforms without adequate fall protection.ajp,cas.bna,wl,at.ajp does not challenge healy testimony that he warned the company about safety violations.instead,the company argues that it lacked actual knowledge that the employees working on the outrigger scaffold were wearing insufficient fall protection at the time of the accident that caused sherengo death.in support,ajp points to testimony by its own employees that the men working on the scaffold had been provided with equipment,that they had been instructed to use it,and that,except for the day of the fatal accident,they had always followed those instructions.
ajp argument suffers from several flaws.to begin with,even if the company lacked actual knowledge of the unlawful condition,healy testimony is more than sufficient to support a finding that ajp could have known of the unlawful condition through the exercise of reasonable the act requires.see am.wrecking,at.moreover,the alj expressly credited healy testimony and safety memos over evidence that ajp employees usually wore fall protection,relying on healy opportunity and capacity to observe,the consistency of his testimony,his lack of bias,and the overall reasonableness of his testimony.ajp,cas.bna,wl,at.reinforcing the alj finding that the company had the requisite knowledge,the osha inspector testified that the two surviving employees told him that when they questioned their foreman about using equipment on the outrigger scaffold,the foreman warned them simply not to go out too far and to b e careful.see tr,reprinted in app.the alj found the inspect
