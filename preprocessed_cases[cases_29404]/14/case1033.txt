facts and procedural history 
the facts and procedural history of this case are summarized in the first district opinion 
in late,luke hospital sought permission from the agency for health care administration agency to replace its existing hospital with a new facility to be built on the grounds of the current mayo clinic in jacksonville.luke had an surgery program at its existing location.unlike most hospitals in the state,luke also utilized a personnel model,meaning that its medical personnel were salaried staff.based upon evidence presented below,luke is one of only two hospitals in the state with both an surgery program and a personnel system.
concurrent with luke request,vincent medical center sought permission from the agency to establish a new hospital with an surgery program in the facility to be vacated by luke.state law required new hospitals to submit a certificate of need con with the agency in order to establish an surgery program.
during the regular session,the legislature passed,and the governor signed into law,chapter,laws of florida.the law appears as section l,florida statutes,part of the health facility and services development act.the new statute created an exemption from the con requirement for any adult surgery program meeting the statute criteria.these criteria are paramount to our analysis 
l notwithstanding any other provisions of this chapter to the contrary 
for an adult program to be located in a new hospital provided the new hospital is being established in the location of an existing hospital with an adult program,the existing hospital and the existing adult program are being relocated to a replacement hospital,and the replacement hospital will utilize a model.a hospital is exempt from the review for the establishment of an program if the application for exemption submitted under this paragraph complies with the following criteria

l.stat.emphasis added.
on november,appellees filed a complaint against the agency in circuit court.in essence,appellees alleged that vincent medical center is the only hospital in the state that can take advantage of this law.the complaint argued the law was a special law in violation of the florida constitution and the law violated equal protection by treating one hospital differently from all others in the state.vincent medical center intervened in the action.the agency has not appeared in this appeal.
at a summary judgment hearing,the trial judge ruled that factual determinations should be made on whether the law could apply to a hospital other than vincent.accordingly,the judge set the case for a trial.vincent did,however,receive summary judgment on the equal protection claim.
both sides presented expert testimony on the contested issue.ronald luke,appellant expert in health care planning and health care economics,testified that,within the realm of possibility,many possible combinations of actors,hospitals,physician groups and health plans in florida might qualify for an exemption before the statute sunsets on january.countering luke testimony,todd sagin,an expert in medical staff issues and hospital relations,and patty greenberg,an expert in health planning,testified for the appellees.sagin and greenberg testified that no other hospitals could reasonably qualify for the exemption in the time frame allowed by the statute,july through january.
on march,the trial judge rendered the final declaratory judgment.concluding that only vincent could take advantage of the statute,the judge explained 
after considering all of the evidence and the arguments of counsel,it is concluded that the exemption provision is a special law passed in the guise of a general law,and is therefore unconstitutional because it was not adopted in accordance with the requirements of article iii,section of the florida constitution.the exemption provision is nothing more than a description of the situation involving vincent and luke.the court concludes that the constitutional requirements governing special laws can not be avoided by merely utilizing generic language in a complicated classification scheme that is intended to address a special circumstance.
the trial judge found no other constitutional infirmities and stated that if the legislature had simply adhered to the notice requirements of article iii,section,the statute would have passed constitutional muster.
