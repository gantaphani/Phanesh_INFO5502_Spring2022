smi owen steel company,smi,a subcontractor,sued marsh usa,marsh,an insurance broker,under nevada law,asserting a tort claim for negligent failure to procure insurance,and two claims for beneficiary and promissory estoppel.the jury found for smi on all three claims,and the magistrate judge signed a corrected judgment in favor of smi in the amount of.
on appeal,marsh argues that the judgment in favor of smi should be reversed and judgment rendered in its favor,or alternatively that the case should be remanded for a new trial,because smi failed to prove the causation element of its negligence claim because the exclusion would have precluded coverage under the professional liability pl policy issued by paul fire marine insurance company paul smi negligence claim is barred by nevada economic loss doctrine and smi beneficiary and promissory estoppel claims fail as a matter of law because smi was not an intended beneficiary of any contract,marsh made no promise that it would procure pl insurance for smi,and smi did not detrimentally rely on any promise allegedly made by marsh regarding pl insurance.
we hold that smi negligence claim is not barred by nevada economic loss doctrine.furthermore,we conclude that there was a legally sufficient evidentiary basis for a reasonable jury to find that smi proved the causation element of its negligence claim.because marsh two legal challenges to smi negligence claim fail,we affirm the jury verdict on that basis.we note that smi elected to recover on a theory of negligence,and its damages award was proportionately reduced by nevada comparative negligence statute.because smi negligence claim supports the jury verdict,we decline to address marsh remaining arguments regarding smi beneficiary and promissory estoppel claims.
factual procedural background 
in,fluor daniel,fluor contracted with aladdin gaming,llc aladdin to redesign and rebuild the aladdin hotel and casino in las vegas,nevada aladdin project.fluor,the general contractor,retained marsh,an insurance broker,to administer the insurance scheme for the aladdin project known as a controlled insurance program cip,which involved procuring different insurance policies covering various participants.as compensation,marsh received a commission from the insurance companies and a flat fee from fluor.the insurance provided as part of the cip scheme consisted of several types of policies,including but not limited to commercial general liability coverage,professional liability coverage,pollution liability coverage,subcontractor default coverage,and excess liability coverage.pl coverage insures against design errors and omissions.under the contract between fluor and aladdin,pl coverage was required for fluor,aladdin,and related not for subcontractors.in may,paul issued a pl policy that listed no subcontractors as additional named insureds.
in december,smi winning bid of million enabled it to be retained as a subcontractor to design,engineer,and install the aladdin project structural steel and foundation work.at that time,smi signed a letter of intent with fluor.
in march,smi received an insurance information booklet from marsh stating that enrolled subcontractors of all tiers would be covered by the cip and provided pl coverage.in june,smi received the contractor handbook,prepared in part by marsh,which again stated that enrolled subcontractors would be provided pl coverage under the cip.however,the handbook cautioned that if any part of the foregoing is in conflict with a provision of your subcontract agreement,the provisions of the subcontract agreement will govern.
in july,smi enrolled in the cip and properly completed all enrollment forms.although marsh notes that smi did not request pl coverage in its cip enrollment forms,smi argues that it was not required to complete additional forms to obtain the pl coverage.
in august,smi signed its subcontract,which was retroactively effective to smi december letter of intent.an attachment to smi subcontract with fluor described the cip and stated that coverage for work and design professional errors and omissions insurance were not included in the cip.under an amendment to smi subcontract,smi was required to provide a certificate of insurance from,smi design consultant,showing that had pl coverage and that smi and fluor were additional named insureds.this pl coverage,however,only protected smi for vicarious liability.
in october,marsh sent certificates of insurance to smi stating that smi was an additional named insured on fluor pl policy.unknown to smi,in december,marsh project manager for the aladdin project,phil luecht,advised his employees to stop sending out certificates for pl coverage to subcontractors and to amend the contractor handbook.despite this warning,in september,marsh sent yet another inaccurate certificate stating that smi had pl coverage under the cip.these two inaccurate certificates each contained a capitalized caveat this certificate is issued as a matter of information only and confers no rights upon the certificate holder.this certificate does not amend,extend or alter the coverage afforded by the policies below.smi argues that the handbook and the two inaccurate certificates led it to detrimentally rely on marsh to procure pl coverage.marsh never obtained pl coverage for smi from paul or any other insurer.
smi was actually covered by four different insurance policies under the cip,including a subcontractor default policy.smi contributed money in the form of bid deductions to purchase this cip coverage,but smi never made a bid deduction for pl coverage.
from its inception,the aladdin project ran behind schedule.on or about june,several of smi subcontractors defaulted,including black hawk.as the construction continued,other subcontractors defaulted.smi claims for subcontractor default coverage were initially denied by paul,which caused smi to file a lawsuit against paul and marsh in federal court in galveston,texas galveston suit.
because of the multiple defaults of smi subcontractors,aladdin filed claims in an arbitration proceeding against fluor.subsequently,fluor filed a related in the arbitration proceeding against smi,alleging that smi breached its contract,failed to properly design and fabricate its portions of the aladdin project,and failed to perform satisfactorily its professional design and construction duties arbitration proceeding.
paul and smi eventually reached a settlement in the galveston suit.as part of this settlement,smi released all claims against paul,including claims for coverage under the subcontractor default and pl policies.paul agreed to pay additional amounts if the arbitration among paul,fluor,and smi settled.despite its settlement with paul,smi continued to pursue its claims against marsh in the galveston suit.
the arbitration proceeding eventually settled.smi share of the settlement was million paid to fluor and aladdin.paul paid million of the amount,and smi paid the remaining million.
smi was forced to defend itself against fluor in the arbitration proceeding without any defense or indemnity provided by the pl coverage that smi believed was provided by the cip.after smi settled with paul in the galveston suit,smi amended its complaint to assert tort and claims based on marsh alleged failure to procure pl insurance.smi argues that if marsh had secured pl coverage for smi,then smi would have been reimbursed for the attorneys fees incurred by smi in the arbitration proceeding and the million it contributed to the settlement with fluor and aladdin.smi sought an additional million in damages from marsh because smi released its claim for the unpaid subcontract value as part of its settlement with fluor.these damages were not a part of smi settlement with paul.
the case was tried by consent before the magistrate judge.the court ruled that nevada substantive law applied,and the parties do not contest that ruling.during the proceedings,marsh twice moved for judgment as a matter of law,and the court denied both motions.the jury returned a verdict against marsh on smi claims for negligence,and the jury also found that smi was a beneficiary of the oral contract between fluor and marsh and was entitled to recovery under the theory of promissory estoppel smi elected to recover on a theory of negligence,and the damages award was proportionately reduced by nevada comparative negligence statute.the jury found smi comparatively negligent for of its damages.on july,smi was awarded a final judgment of,including interest and costs.the court overruled marsh motions for judgment as a matter of law and for new trial,and marsh filed a timely appeal.

negligent failure to procure insurance 
in at least three separate cases,the nevada supreme court has recognized the viability of a claim against an insurance broker for negligent failure to procure insurance,buck,keddie beneficial,havas carter.
in havas,the nevada supreme court recognized that an insurance broker who undertakes to procure insurance for another owes an obligation to his client to use reasonable diligence in attempting to place the insurance and to seasonably notify the client if he is unable to obtain the insurance.at.regarding the duty element of the claim,the court stated that insurance brokers are not obligated to assume the duty of procuring insurance,but when they do so the law impose s upon them the duty of performance in the exercise of ordinary care for the rights and interests of the intended purchasers.id.the question of whether a broker exercised the care and diligence that the undertaking required is a question of fact for the jury.id.in havas,the court held that the plaintiff failed to establish negligence because the broker made reasonable efforts to procure the special type of insurance demanded by the plaintiff,and the broker seasonably notified the plaintiff of his inability to procure it.id.
in keddie,the nevada supreme court repeated that o nce an agreement to procure insurance has been reached the insurance agent is obliged to use reasonable diligence to place the insurance and seasonably to notify the client if he is unable to do so.at citing havas,at.regarding the causation element,the court stated that t he agreement to procure must be one for a policy of insurance which would have covered the loss incurred.id.keddie owned a commercial fishing boat,but he submitted an application to his insurance broker for a yacht insurance policy that only covered damage to boats not used for commercial purposes.id.at.in holding that keddie failed to prove causation,the court observed that the yacht insurance policy would not have covered the loss incurred even if the broker had procured the policy pursuant to keddie application.id.at.
in buck,two horse owners the bucks brought an action against an insurance broker for failure to procure equine mortality insurance.at.the bucks had insured several horses through insurance lpi and always followed the same procedures.id.the bucks decided to purchase a thoroughbred horse named bluegrass for.id.an employee of the bucks called lpi and spoke with an lpi representative about adding bluegrass to the bucks existing lloyds of london policy.id.after giving the lpi representative the necessary information and faxing her the veterinarian certificate and bill of sale,the employee believed that bluegrass was insured.id.unknown to the bucks,lpi lacked binding authority with respect to equine mortality insurance.id.the lpi representative forwarded the application via regular mail to a local agent with binding authority.id.at.bluegrass died shortly thereafter,and lpi informed the bucks that bluegrass was not yet insured at the time of death.id.
the jury returned a verdict in favor of the bucks on their breach of contract and negligent failure to procure insurance claims.id.in affirming the judgment,the nevada supreme court approved of the following jury instruction on the negligence claim an insurance agency that undertakes to procure insurance for another owes an obligation to its client to use reasonable diligence in attempting to place the insurance and to seasonably notify the client if it,the insurance agency,is unable to obtain the insurance.id.at emphasis in original.the insurance referred to in the jury instructions was the insurance that lpi actually agreed to procure adding bluegrass to the bucks existing lloyds of london policy.id.at.
thus,as recently as,the nevada supreme court has recognized the viability of a cause of action against an insurance broker for breach of contract and negligent failure to procure insurance.
lack of causation as an affirmative defense 
havas,keddie,and buck are unclear as to which party carries the burden of proof regarding causation.in cases involving a claim against an insurance broker for negligent failure to procure insurance,a minority of jurisdictions hold that the causation issue raised by marsh is an affirmative defense.see hans coiffures int l,hejna,see also patterson agency,turner.a majority of jurisdictions hold that causation is considered an element of the offense that must be proven by the plaintiff by a preponderance of the evidence.see pac.dredging hurley,see bayly,martin fay,pete satire,en banc see macdonald carpenter pelton.because the nevada supreme court cited to pacific dredging when it discussed causation in keddie,we conclude that the nevada supreme court would adopt the majority approach regarding the burden of proof for causation.see keddie,at.in nevada,the plaintiff carries the burden of proof regarding the causation element of a negligence claim,and we see no reason why smi claim for negligent failure to procure insurance would be subject to a different rule.see scialabba brandise const.
legally sufficient evidentiary basis 
marsh is correct in observing that it is liable only if the insurance policy would have covered the loss incurred.keddie,at.marsh argues that smi failed to establish the causation element because the paul policy it procured for fluor would have contained an exclusion that would have precluded pl coverage for subcontractors who were listed as additional named insureds under the paul policy.thus,smi suffered no damages for not being named as an additional named insured on fluor pl policy because that policy would never have covered smi damages resulting from fluor claims against smi in the arbitration proceeding.according to marsh,there was no evidence that paul or fluor would have been willing to delete the exclusion if any subcontractors were added to the pl policy 
at trial,smi produced more than a scintilla of evidence indicating that marsh and fluor initially intended to obtain pl coverage for subcontractors of all tiers marsh submitted a binder proposal to paul requesting pl coverage for enrolled subcontractors the scope of coverage under the pl policy issued by paul was negotiable a marsh representative made a verbal assurance to smi that there was no need for professional liability insurance the actual policy issued by paul deleted the exclusion through endorsement and the insurance information booklet,the contractor handbook,and the two certificates of insurance issued by marsh all stated that smi had pl coverage under the cip.because our review of the causation issue is especially deferential,we conclude that there was a legally sufficient evidentiary basis for a reasonable jury to find that smi has proven the causation element of its negligence claim

nevada economic loss doctrine 
marsh argues that smi negligence claim is barred by nevada economic loss doctrine.see jordan state ex rel.dep t of motor vehicles pub.safety,see also calloway city of reno,overruled on other grounds by olson richard,see also local joint executive bd.of las vegas stern.according to marsh,smi only damages are for an economic loss of insurance proceeds,and the economic loss doctrine precludes recovery in tort for this expectancy interest.marsh argues that nevada version of the economic loss doctrine is extremely broad and applies to the facts of this case.
the ninth circuit recently issued a detailed opinion regarding the scope of nevada economic loss doctrine.see giles motors acceptance,cir.in giles,the ninth circuit held that the economic loss doctrine did not bar the plaintiffs fraud and conversion claims.id.at.in holding that the economic loss doctrine did not apply to intentional torts,the ninth circuit described the nature of the economic loss doctrine 
broadly speaking,the economic loss doctrine is designed to maintain a distinction between damage remedies for breach of contract and for tort.the term economic loss refers to damages that are solely monetary,as opposed to damages involving physical harm to person or property.the economic loss doctrine provides that certain economic losses are properly remediable only in contract.the doctrine has roots in common law limitations on recovery of damages in negligence actions in the absence of physical harm to person or property.
giles,at.the ninth circuit recognized that outside the products liability context,the economic loss doctrine has produced difficulty and confusion.id.at.
marsh cites to language from stern,which states the following 
the well established common law rule is that absent privity of contract or an injury to person or property,a plaintiff may not recover in negligence for economic loss the primary purpose of the rule is to shield a defendant from unlimited liability for all of the economic consequences of a negligent act,particularly in a commercial or professional setting,and thus to keep to the risk of liability reasonably calculable.
at emphasis added.because smi tort claim is based on marsh professional negligence in a commercial setting,marsh argues that the economic loss doctrine bars the claim.
when making an erie guess,o ur task is to attempt to predict state law,not to create or modify it.herrmann holdings,lucent,cir internal quotation marks omitted.no nevada supreme court case had held that the economic loss doctrine bars a claim against an insurance broker for negligent failure to procure insurance.furthermore,the nevada supreme court has recognized the viability of this particular negligence claim even after stern was decided see buck,at.the nevada supreme court has held that the economic loss doctrine applies in certain products liability cases construction defect cases and negligence cases that do not involve the violation of a professional,duty imposed by law 
we conclude that nevada economic loss doctrine does not bar negligence claims involving the violation of a professional,duty imposed by law according to calloway,the applicability of the economic loss doctrine hinges upon whether the actions or omissions complained of constitute a violation of duties imposed by law,or of duties arising by virtue of the alleged express agreement between the parties.at internal quotation marks omitted.in havas,the nevada supreme court stated that insurance brokers are not obligated to assume the duty of procuring insurance,but when they do so the law impose s upon them the duty of performance in the exercise of ordinary care for the rights and interests of the intended purchasers.at emphasis added.the cases cited by marsh are not factually analogous and do not convince us that the nevada supreme court would hold that the doctrine bars all negligence claims,without exception,including those involving the violation of a professional,duty imposed by law this case does not involve products liability or construction defects.furthermore,in stern and jordan,the defendants did not owe any professional,duties to the plaintiffs under established nevada supreme court precedent.
the ninth circuit has concluded that nevada economic loss doctrine is generally consistent with the principles discernable in the case law of other jurisdictions.giles,at.based on our review of case law from other jurisdictions,we conclude that the majority of those jurisdictions hold that the economic loss doctrine does not bar a claim against an insurance broker for negligent failure to procure insurance.see grynberg agri tech,en banc see kanter deitelbaum,d,see steiner johnson higgins.we believe that the reasoning of kanter,which held that the economic loss rule does not bar recovery,is persuasive 
the economic loss doctrine applies to the service industry only where the duty of the party performing the service is defined by the contract between him and his client.where a duty arises outside of that contract,the doctrine does not prohibit recovery under a tort theory for the negligent breach thereof we find that this failure was a breach of his duty to observe reasonable professional competence which existed independently of the insurance policy or contract.we therefore find that the insurance broker duty to plaintiffs,his insureds,in performing insurance brokerage services was not solely defined by contract,but rather was extracontractual in nature.as such,the economic loss doctrine does not bar plaintiffs recovery of their economic damages under a tort theory for the insurance broker negligent breach.
at citations omitted.we also agree with the colorado supreme court conclusion that a party suffering only economic loss from the breach of an express or implied contractual duty may not assert a tort claim for such a breach absent an independent duty of care under tort law.grynberg,at emphasis added.we believe that the nevada supreme court has imposed an independent duty of care on insurance brokers.see id.at see havas,at.
the kanter rationale is supported by the second circuit holding that the economic loss doctrine allows recovery in the limited class of cases involving liability for the violation of a professional duty
