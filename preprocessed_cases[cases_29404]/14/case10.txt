this appeal presents two competing claims to the assets of the bankrupt moultonborough hotel group,llc.appellant rok builders,llc constructed a hotel for moultonborough and has a mechanic lien on the property.appellee sfg venture,llc,is the assignee of the construction lender and has a mortgage on the hotel.when moultonborough filed for bankruptcy,sfg sought a declaration that its mortgage was senior to rok lien to the extent the construction lender had disbursed loan funds to rok.rok responded by seeking a declaration that its lien was senior to sfg mortgage and by advancing various additional counterclaims.the new hampshire bankruptcy court and district court ruled for sfg.we now affirm.
background 
this dispute has its origins in a project that began in to build a hampton inn suites in tilton,new hampshire.on december,rok signed a contract with moultonborough to construct the hotel.rok began work,but the project stalled when moultonborough proved unable to pay its bills.in april,rok terminated the contract due to nonpayment of roughly million.rok signaled its willingness to resume work if moultonborough secured adequate financing and paid the balance due,with interest.
on june,moultonborough signed an agreement letter with specialty finance group in which specialty committed to extending up to million in new funding to restart the project.rok claims to have then immediately taken steps to resume construction.on september,rok signed a new construction agreement with moultonborough.less than a month later,on october,specialty signed a formal construction financing agreement with moultonborough,as anticipated by the commitment letter.as security,moultonborough executed a mortgage on the property,which specialty recorded the next day.in conjunction with the financing agreement,specialty paid rok more than million to settle the amount due,with interest,to rok under its original construction agreement with moultonborough.
rok then set about finishing the hotel.for its work,it received loan disbursements from specialty,in conjunction with at least two of which it executed lien waivers.in its final waiver,executed for the period ending may,rok acknowledged past payments from specialty of for work done under its agreement with moultonborough,and listed a balance due of.the waiver provided,
in consideration of the payment of the above stated sums currently due and amounts previously paid,the receipt of which is hereby acknowledged,rok hereby waives,relinquishes,and releases any and all liens,rights,claims and interests including,without limitation,all rights to mechanic and materialmen liens owned,to be owned,claimed or held by rok in and to the hampton inn suites in tilton by reason of the labor performed materials furnished by rok prior to and including the payment date 
at the time it submitted the waiver,rok was unaware that specialty had decided to stop payments due to moultonborough failure to secure additional financing,as its loan agreement with specialty required.indeed,specialty did not inform rok of this decision even when it received the waiver,and rok performed further work in june,still unaware that it would not be paid.rok briefs do not dispute that it received an additional from specialty,presumably after the may waiver,yielding a total payout of for work performed under the construction contract.however,rok maintains that it is still owed for work under that contract,secured by a mechanic lien 
despite the unresolved payment issue,the hotel opened successfully in june of.moultonborough and specialty,however,soon found themselves in financial trouble.in may of,specialty parent company,silverton bank,failed,and specialty assigned the construction mortgage on the hotel to the federal deposit insurance corporation,the receiver for silverton.soon after,the fdic assigned the mortgage to sfg.later in,moultonborough filed a petition in new hampshire bankruptcy court for reorganization under chapter of the bankruptcy code.
on march,sfg initiated an adversary proceeding against rok in bankruptcy court,seeking a declaration that of the construction mortgage the amount specialty had disbursed to rok for work performed under the construction contract was senior to rok mechanic lien.in response,rok filed a dozen counterclaims two seeking a determination that its lien was senior to sfg mortgage,and an additional ten advancing causes of action sounding in tort,contract,and equity.sfg filed a motion to dismiss,which the bankruptcy court granted as to the ten secondary counterclaims.sfg then filed a motion for summary judgment on the competing seniority claims,which the bankruptcy court granted.rok timely appealed to the district court,see a,which affirmed following de novo review.rok builders,llc sfg venture,llc,cv pb,wl.on september,rok filed a timely notice of appeal to this court.
ii.analysis 
on appeal,rok challenges the grant of summary judgment on the competing seniority claims and the dismissal of three of its secondary counterclaims specifically,those for breach of an implied contract,promissory estoppel,and unjust enrichment.although we constitute the second tier of appellate review in this case arising out of a decision by the bankruptcy court in an adversary proceeding,we cede no special deference to the determinations made by the district court and instead assess the bankruptcy court decision directly.city sanitation,llc allied waste servs.of,llc in re am.cartage,cir.in doing so,we scrutinize that court findings of fact for clear error,and afford de novo review to its conclusions of law.brandt repco printers lithographics,in re healthco int l,cir.
the legal standards traditionally applicable to motions for summary judgment and motions to dismiss apply without change in bankruptcy proceedings.see soto rios banco popular de,cir banco santander de l√≥pez stubbe in re colonial mortg.bankers,cir.accordingly,in reviewing the bankruptcy court summary judgment ruling,our inquiry is whether any genuine issue of material fact exists and whether the moving party is entitled to judgment as a matter of law.soto rios,at see also fed.as for the court ruling on the motion to dismiss,we assume the truth of all facts and indulge all reasonable inferences that fit the plaintiff stated theory of liability,and we affirm if the plaintiff factual averments hold out no hope of recovery on that theory.banco santander de,at see also fed.b.b.as our analysis below makes plain,the bankruptcy court had ample bases for ruling as it did.
the competing seniority claims.
we turn first to the competing seniority claims.as assignee of the mortgage,sfg advances the unremarkable position that,to the extent specialty paid rok for its work,and to that extent only,the mortgage is senior to any remaining mechanic lien that rok has.rok counters that its lien for later work on the project for which it was not paid takes precedence over the mortgage.in support of this position,rok asserts that because it began work on the project before the mortgage was recorded,any lien arising out of work on the project performed at any time,whether prior to or after recording of the mortgage,remains senior to the mortgage,even to the extent the mortgagee paid for work.for the following reasons,we find that new hampshire law plainly rejects rok position 
first,the new hampshire statutory scheme that recognizes mechanics liens,provides the procedure for their perfection,and specifies their relative priority over other encumbrances,runs directly against rok position.the new hampshire recording statute.ann.a,acknowledges by negative implication the rule that the first party to record without notice of a prior party claim has priority.it provides that any instrument which affects title to any interest in real estate must be recorded and shall not be effective as against bona fide purchasers for value until so recorded.id.in amoskeag bank chagnon,the new hampshire supreme court quoted section a,as well as.ann,which provides that conveyances of real estate are not valid against anyone but the grantor and his heirs unless recorded,and then explained 
new hampshire is a jurisdiction.that is,a purchaser or creditor has the senior claim if he or she records without notice of a prior unrecorded interest.the purpose then of the recording statutes recited above is to provide notice to the public of a conveyance of or encumbrance on real estate.the statutes serve to protect both those who already have interests in land and those who would like to acquire such interests.
in a subsequent decision,the supreme court also linked the rule to section see mansur muskopf.specifically,the court cited amoskeag bank for the proposition that the state is a jurisdiction.id.it then explained that t herefore,a purchaser with a senior claim in real estate must record such interest in order to prevail over a bona fide purchaser for value,and cited i n particular section id.
here,the rules favor sfg,because the mortgage was recorded well before the work for which a lien is claimed was performed.this fact alone does not defeat rok claim,however,because the statutory scheme in new hampshire creates an exception to the rule for mechanics liens.specifically,a mechanic lien shall have precedence and priority over any construction mortgage.ann.a see also lewis shawmut bank,describing section a as a n exception to the general rule of.this exception is,however,itself subject to an important qualification a mechanic lien shall not be entitled to precedence as provided in this section to the extent that the mortgagee shows that the proceeds of the mortgage loan were disbursed toward payment of invoices from or claims due subcontractors and suppliers of materials or labor for the work on the mortgaged premises.a.as the bankruptcy court concluded,this qualification takes the a exception out of play in this case.because rok does not contest the fact that specialty,the original mortgagee,made in such payments to rok,the plain text of a demonstrates that the exception for which the statute provides has no application to the facts before us.
in response to this conclusion,rok contends that the scheme envisioned by a is nonexclusive,and that an alternative source of priority for mechanics liens can be found in older new hampshire case law.but in support of that proposition,rok points only to two cases,neither of which establishes any principle at variance with the present statutory scheme.see cheshire provident inst.stone,graton knight woodworth mason.in neither case did the mortgagee pay the mechanic for any work.rather,the mortgagee,presumably for some consideration extended to the owner,acquired a mortgage after work on the property subject to the mortgage had already commenced.graton knight,at cheshire provident,at.the mortgage thus remained junior to the mechanic lien for whatever unpaid work arose out of the ongoing project.in the language of the statute,the lien in full continue d.ann.
in this case,by contrast,payment was in fact previously made to rok by specialty.therefore,the lien for that paid work expired,leaving rok with only a lien for later work.see.ann.and specialty,unlike the mortgagees in graton knight and cheshire provident,even obtained a written lien waiver,to boot.see graton knight,at cheshire provident,at.
accordingly,we conclude that the bankruptcy court did not err in concluding that section a establishes the seniority of sfg mortgage over rok mechanic lien to the extent of the that specialty disbursed to rok.
rok counterclaims.
we turn now to rok counterclaims for breach of an implied contract,promissory estoppel,and unjust enrichment.all three claims rest on specialty course of dealings with rok as the hotel neared completion,roughly two years before sfg appeared on the scene.in essence,rok maintains that specialty,eager to have the value of a finished rather than unfinished hotel as collateral for its loan,misled rok into believing that it would be paid for completing construction.rok now demands that sfg,as the assignee of specialty mortgage,make good on that alleged commitment.
assumption of liability for implied contract and promissory estoppel.
taking the first two counterclaims together,rok asserts that although the doctrines of implied contract and promissory estoppel are distinct,the same conduct by specialty entitles it to recover under either theory.an implied contract is an enforceable agreement that arises from the conduct of the parties,apart from oral and written words.durgin pillsbury lake water.promissory estoppel,in contrast,provides a basis for recovery when no contract exists if a promisor should reasonably expect a promisee to rely on a promise,and the promisee in fact does so,courts may enforce the promise to avoid injustice.see great lakes aircraft city of claremont,panto moore bus.forms,see also restatement second of contracts.
as the bankruptcy court recognized,however,even assuming that specialty actions created an implied contract between specialty and rok or entitled rok to recover from specialty under a theory of promissory estoppel,there is no basis for holding sfg liable for the actions of specialty.no language in the assignments purports to transfer such liabilities to sfg.rok is therefore left to contend that sfg implicitly assumed specialty liability to rok when sfg accepted assignment of the mortgage and loan agreement between specialty and moultonborough without expressly rejecting any assumption of specialty liabilities.in support of this contention,rok relies on section of the restatement second of contracts.
with certain exceptions,section treats a general assignment of all rights under a contract as a delegation of unperformed duties under the same contract,enforceable against the assignee by the obligor of the assigned rights.without commenting on whether and to what extent section might in some cases apply to assignments of mortgages and defaulted notes,we can easily reject any assertion that section helps rok in this case.the contract assigned to sfg was an agreement or agreements between moultonborough as and specialty as.if sfg assumed any obligations as a result of that assignment,they would have been the obligations of the under those agreements.the alleged liability that rok seeks to impose on sfg,however,arises from an alleged implied contract or promise between specialty and rok.sfg received no assignment of any rights under any contract such as that.in short,even if we were to assume that obligations under a contract follow rights upon assignment absent indication otherwise,nothing in section would suggest that obligations under one contract follow rights under another.for this simple reason,rok argument does not get to first base.
unjust enrichment.
rok claim of unjust enrichment fails,too,although for a reason other than that relied on by the bankruptcy court.unjust enrichment is an equitable remedy that entitles a party to restitution from one who has receive d a benefit which would be unconscionable for him to retain.clapp goffstown sch,quoting kowalski cedars of portsmouth condo.the bankruptcy court dismissed rok claim for unjust enrichment on the basis that sfg could not be liable for the conduct of same basis on which it dismissed rok implied contract and promissory estoppel claims.new hampshire law is clear,however,that restitution may be required even if the party receiving the benefit has not itself engaged in wrongful acts.insulation eckman.passive acceptance of a benefit can be enough,as long as it would be unconscionable for the recipient to retain the benefit.see id.
having convinced us that sfg lack of involvement in the alleged wrongdoing by specialty is not itself grounds to dismiss rok claim for unjust enrichment against sfg,rok nevertheless fails to point to any allegation that would support a finding that sfg received a benefit,the retention of which would be unconscionable.rok relies on the case of nute blaisdell.that case,however,serves simply to show by contrast what was lacking in rok allegations in this case.
in nute,george blaisdell acted as a fiduciary for june mckeage.at.blaisdell caused mckeage to borrow funds,which blaisdell then used to buy a house,which he placed in his mother name.id.there was no evidence that the mother,who knew mckeage,paid anything for the hom
