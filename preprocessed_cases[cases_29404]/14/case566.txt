bond safeguard motion for summary judgment

in its separate statement of undisputed facts,bond safeguard set forth the following.r r was the contractor hired by the developer,los valles,to install a storm drain,sanitary sewers,and other improvements for a project consisting of a golf course,residential lots,and public subdivision improvements.los valles entered into a public works multiple agreement the multiple agreement with the county in december,which required los valles to complete subdivision improvements on the project,including the work contracted for with r r,in order to receive a final map.bond safeguard issued labor and material bonds covering work on the public subdivision improvements.the county was the beneficiary under the bonds and los valles was the principal.the work was to be completed by los valles to the satisfaction of the county.

r r opposition to summary judgment 
r r opposed summary judgment on the ground its contract with los valles was for private work,and therefore the statute of limitations for claims on public work was not applicable,and the statute of limitations on written contracts applied.the multiple agreement between the county and los valles was not a contract for public work,as contract is defined in former sections and,because the county was not an owner of the property being developed and los valles is not an original contractor.under former section,the county did not contract for any work,but instead it required the work as a condition of approval of a project on private land.california paving,supra,th was distinguishable because it involved an agreement to pave public streets.the los valles development was a private work of improvement,which at some point contemplated dedication of sewers and storm drains upon approval of the county,but until dedication of the improvements was accepted,r r work was private and not subject to the statutory notice requirements and limitations periods applicable to public work.
r r timely filed and recorded a mechanic lien against the property.when the lien was not paid,r r filed a complaint against los valles in december.bond safeguard was added as a defendant in the sixth cause of action on the material and labor bond in the fac.bond safeguard concedes that none of the subdivision improvements have been completed and dedicated or accepted by the county.
even if r r contracted for public work of improvement,r r argued it was not required to serve a preliminary notice or stop notice on the county under former section,because r r had a direct contractual relationship with los valles.there was no reason for r r to serve notice on the county,as the county was not holding funds due to r 
in its separate statement,r r disputed that the multiple agreement is a public work agreement it was an agreement that if certain work were to be performed,it would be accepted by the county the multiple agreement required completion of public subdivision improvements it required certain works of improvement as a condition of approval of a final map the bonds were issued to cover work on public subdivision improvements,and the county was the beneficiary under the bonds.
r r filed evidentiary objections to four of bond safeguard undisputed facts.
bond safeguard reply to the opposition 
in a prior ruling on a motion for summary judgment by r r,the trial court found los valles entered into the multiple agreement with the county for certain public subdivision improvements on the project.bond safeguard argued in its summary judgment reply brief that the court should reaffirm that r r performed on a contract for public works.it does not matter that the work was not done on public property,but in any case,r r engaged in public improvement work contracted for by a public entity within the meaning of former section.
ruling on summary judgment 
the trial court tentative decision was to deny bond safeguard motion for summary judgment,but after oral argument on the motion and taking the matter under submission,summary judgment was granted.in order to determine if r r sixth cause of action was barred by the statute of limitations,the trial court first considered whether the case involves private or public works of improvement.based upon california paving,supra,th,the trial court ruled r r engaged in a work of improvement contracted for by a public entity as described in former section,because los valles,as the developer,entered into the multiple agreement with the county,requiring los valles to furnish sewers,storm drains,and tunnels constructed according to approved plans applicable for public works construction and to the satisfaction of the county.
