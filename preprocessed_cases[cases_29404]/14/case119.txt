roger and mary jo carlson signed a sales agreement with pultegroup,and its subsidiary del webb communities,together,pulte for the purchase of a lot and construction of a home in hilton head,south carolina.the agreement contained an arbitration clause.this appeal stems from the carlsons attempt to arbitrate claims against pulte under the agreement,and pulte efforts to limit arbitration to the claims between the three parties.the district court held that the availability of class arbitration under an arbitration agreement is a procedural question for the arbitrator to decide,rather than a question for the court.
because the primary goal in enforcing an arbitration agreement is to discern and honor party intent,and because of the fundamental differences between bilateral and class arbitration which change the nature of arbitration altogether we hold that whether parties agree to class arbitration is a gateway question for the court.accordingly,we reverse the district court order denying pulte motion for partial summary judgment,vacate the judgment dismissing pulte petition,and remand the case for the district court to determine whether the arbitration clause permits class arbitration.
the relevant facts are not in dispute.the carlsons signed the sales agreement at issue in march of.section of the agreement contains an arbitration clause that,in relevant part,states 
any controversy or claim arising out of or relating to this agreement or your purchase of the property shall be finally settled by arbitration 
after closing,every controversy or claim arising out of or relating to this agreement,or the breach thereof shall be settled by binding arbitration as provided by the south carolina uniform arbitration act the rules of the american arbitration association aaa,published for construction industry arbitrations,shall govern the arbitration proceeding and the method of appointment of the arbitrator.
any party to this agreement may bring action to compel arbitration 
in september,the carlsons filed suit in south carolina state court against pulte and two other parties.the complaint raised several claims,all regarding alleged construction defects.the carlsons later moved to amend their complaint to add allegations because their lawsuit was one of approximately like cases pending against pulte.the state court granted the motion over pulte objection.
pulte then moved to dismiss the amended complaint,or in the alternative,to compel bilateral arbitration of the carlsons claims.the state court denied both motions,but the south carolina court of appeals reversed,finding the carlsons claims subject to arbitration under the sales agreement with pulte.carlson state plastering,llc.
the carlsons subsequently filed a demand for arbitration with the american arbitration association aaa.their demand sought class arbitration and class certification,and set the claim amount at until such time as the class is certified.the class size,as identified in the demand for arbitration and attached amended complaint,accounts for approximately homes significantly more than the or so similar claims pending against pulte when the carlsons moved to proceed as a class.
on may,the aaa manager held a conference call with the carlsons and pulte.during the call,the manager notified the parties that the arbitrator would decide whether the sales agreement permits class arbitration.
three days later,pulte filed in federal court a petition and complaint to compel bilateral arbitration petition under of the federal arbitration act faa,et.as relevant here,pulte argued that whether the sales agreement authorizes class arbitration is a question of arbitrability for the court to determine not a procedural question for the arbitrator.pulte sought a declaratory judgment that the parties did not agree to class arbitration.
between may and march,the parties filed several motions in the district court,including pulte motion for partial summary judgment that is the subject of this appeal.in the meantime,the arbitrator ruled that the sales agreement authorized class arbitration,but he stayed the matter for the resolution of the federal litigation.subsequent motions in the district court and this court resulted in a stay of the arbitration proceedings pending this appeal.
the district court denied pulte partial summary judgment motion and dismissed the petition.relying on the supreme court plurality decision in greentree financial bazzle,d,and this court unpublished decision in davis ecpi college of technology,app x cir,the court reasoned that whether the arbitration clause permits class arbitration is a simple contract interpretation issue,and because the question concerns the procedural arbitration mechanisms available to the carlsons,the threshold inquiry is a question for the arbitrator rather than for the court.del webb,carlson,cv sb,at.
this appeal followed.
we review a district court grant of summary judgment de novo.thompson aluminum of,cir.
we turn first to the carlsons contention that we should dismiss the appeal and that the district court should have dismissed the petition for lack of jurisdiction.
the carlsons first challenge pulte assertion of diversity jurisdiction,contending that the requirement is not met and that the parties are not geographically diverse.we,however,are satisfied that the district court had diversity jurisdiction in considering a suit to compel arbitration,the question of jurisdictional amount may be determined by reference to the possible award resulting from the requested arbitration.delta fin.paul comanduras,cir.the carlsons amended complaint and demand for arbitration,together,provide that the value of their individual claim is,plus treble damages and attorneys fees,which satisfies the statutory floor.see a francis allstate ins,cir stating that attorneys fees count towards the calculation when the contract provides for them providing in sales agreement that award of attorneys fees goes to the prevailing party.moreover,the parties are completely diverse,as the carlsons are south carolina citizens,and the pulte parties are michigan and arizona citizens.see a home buyers warranty hanna,cir.
the carlsons,however,resist this conclusion on the ground that south carolina state plastering,llc scsp,a defendant named in the original state court complaint,is a south carolina citizen.but scsp is not a party to the federal proceedings,and its citizenship is therefore irrelevant.further,scsp did not agree to arbitrate with the carlsons and is not a party to the underlying arbitration.see moses cone mem l hosp.mercury constr,d calling for piecemeal resolution in different forums of a dispute when the plaintiff has an arbitration agreement with some defendants and not others because an arbitration agreement must be enforced notwithstanding the presence of other persons who are parties to the underlying dispute but not to the arbitration agreement.
we also conclude that the district court had jurisdiction under the class action fairness act of cafa,which provides that a district court has original jurisdiction over class actions with an amount in controversy greater than and in which any member of a class of plaintiffs is a citizen of a state different from any defendant.d a.to determine federal jurisdiction over an faa petition,the court may look through the petition to determine whether it is predicated on an action that arises under federal law.vaden discover bank,d determining jurisdiction over a petition to compel arbitration of claims see also providing that a petition to compel arbitration is proper in federal court when the court would have jurisdiction under title of a suit arising out of the controversy between the parties.
jurisdiction under cafa,then,depends on the underlying substantive controversy here,the putative class action.and in looking through pulte faa petition,we find federal jurisdiction would be proper.vaden,at.as discussed,pulte and the carlsons are completely diverse,and the carlsons have made allegations although pulte seeks only bilateral arbitration,the substantive matter currently in arbitration has an amount in controversy exceeding the amended complaint attached to the carlsons demand for arbitration alleged claims encompass ing thousands of houses,and the demand for arbitration valued the carlsons claim alone at.
next,the carlsons assert that the rooker feldman doctrine precludes federal jurisdiction over the matter because the issues presented in the petition and on appeal were decided by the state courts.under rooker feldman,only the supreme court may review state court final judgments a federal district court has no such authority.of app.feldman,d rooker fid.trust.but the supreme court has since clarified after we and several of our sister circuits interpreted the rooker feldman doctrine broadly that the doctrine applies only when the loser in state court files suit in federal district court seeking redress for an injury allegedly caused by the state court decision itself.davani.dep t of,cir citing exxon mobil saudi basic indus,d.here,pulte is not the loser when pulte moved to compel arbitration in state court,the motion was ultimately granted.moreover,the petition does not challenge the state court decision.rather,it disputes the availability of class arbitration under the sales agreement and the proper forum for deciding that issue,questions that were never litigated in the state court 
last,the carlsons argue that pulte can not establish federal jurisdiction through the faa.pulte,however,has never contended that the district court had federal question jurisdiction based on the faa,acknowledging,as it must,that the faa does not create any independent jurisdiction but rather only permits the federal district court to compel arbitration when the court would have jurisdiction over a suit on the underlying dispute,through diversity of citizenship or some other independent basis.moses cone,at.
at oral argument,the carlsons pressed the purported jurisdictional defect,arguing for the first time that pulte is not an aggrieved party under the faa because the statute provides a remedy only where a party is aggrieved by the alleged failure,neglect,or refusal of another to arbitrate under a written agreement for arbitration.the carlsons contention,however,does not implicate the district court jurisdiction.rather,it is a question of statutory standing,discover bank vaden,cir,overruled on other grounds by,d,which the carlsons waived by failing to raise the point in the district court,see,merrimon unum life ins.of,cir a rguments based on statutory standing,unlike arguments based on constitutional standing,are waivable.
in any case,pulte has statutory standing.the central or primary purpose of the faa is to ensure that private agreements to arbitrate are enforced according to their terms,and a party may not be forced to submit to class arbitration absent express agreement.stolt nielsen animalfeeds int l,d quoting volt info,bd.of trustees of leland stanford junior,d.here,pulte is sufficiently aggrieved under by the alleged refusal of the carlsons to arbitrate bilaterally,as required under the written agreement.puleo chase bank usa,cir en banc rejecting appellants argument that they are amenable to arbitration in the abstract because a district court does not issue an order compelling arbitration in the abstract r ather,of the faa confers only the right to obtain an order directing that arbitration proceed in the manner provided for in the parties agreement alteration in original quoting volt,at.
accordingly,we deny the carlsons request that we dismiss the appeal for lack of subject matter jurisdiction.
the district court denied pulte motion for partial summary judgment,concluding that the inquiry whether an arbitration clause permits class arbitration is procedural and therefore for the arbitrator.we disagree and hold that whether an arbitration clause permits class arbitration is a gateway question of arbitrability for the court.
under the faa,arbitration agreements are valid,irrevocable,and enforceable,save upon such grounds as exist at law or in equity for the revocation of any contract.despite this liberal federal policy favoring arbitration,moses cone,at,the faa seeks to enforce arbitration agreements in the manner provided for in such agreement,see stolt nielsen,at.
the supreme court has reiterated the contractual nature of arbitration agreements,careful to avoid forcing parties to resolve their disputes through means not intended at the time of contract formation,stolt nielsen,at t he faa imposes certain rules of fundamental importance,including the basic precept that arbitration is a matter of consent,not coercion.quoting volt,at howsam dean witter reynolds,d a rbitration is a matter of contract and a party can not be required to submit to arbitration any dispute which he has not agreed so to submit.quoting united steelworkers of am.warrior gulf nav,d first options of,kaplan,d a party can be forced to arbitrate only those issues it specifically has agreed to submit to arbitration.
advancing the prioritization of party intent in arbitration agreements,the supreme court has identified two categories of threshold questions procedural questions for the arbitrator,and questions of arbitrability for the court.see howsam,at.procedural questions arise once the obligation to arbitrate a matter is established,and may include such issues as the application of statutes of limitations,notice requirements,laches,and estoppel.see id.at see also john wiley sons,livingston,d once it is determined that the parties are obligated to submit the subject matter of a dispute to arbitration,procedural questions which grow out of the dispute and bear on its final disposition should be left to the arbitrator.the court has explained that these are questions for the arbitrator not only because the parties would likely expect that an arbitrator would decide them,howsam,at,but also because the questions do not present any legal challenge to the arbitrator underlying power,see at t,commc ns workers of,d united steelworkers,at.
questions of arbitrability,on the other hand,are something else entirely.when the answer to a question determine s whether the underlying controversy will proceed to arbitration on the merits,that question necessarily falls within the narrow circumstance s of arbitrable issues for the court to decide.howsam,at see also rent a center,jackson,d q uestion s of arbitrability thus include questions regarding the existence of a legally binding and valid arbitration agreement,as well as questions regarding the scope of a concededly binding arbitration agreement.alterations in original.
the supreme court has not conclusively told us who gets to decide whether an arbitration agreement provides for class arbitration,but the court has provided some guidance.first,although a plurality of the court in green tree financial bazzle found that the issue was a procedural one for the arbitrator,at,the court treatment of bazzle in subsequent decisions has effectively disavowed that rationale,see oxford health plans llc sutter,d explaining the high bar for overturning an arbitrator decision on the grounds that he exceeded his powers,but stating,we would face a different issue if the petitioner had argued below that the availability of class arbitration is a question of arbitrability.those questions are presumptively for courts to decide.stolt nielsen,at unfortunately,the opinions in bazzle appear to have baffled the parties in this case t he parties appear to have believed that the judgment in bazzle requires an arbitrator,not a court,to decide whether a contract permits class arbitration.in fact,however,only the plurality decided that question.emphasis added citation omitted.
second,the court over several decades has crafted legal rules regarding the interpretation of arbitration agreements,which,together,demonstrate that the issue presented here is one of arbitrability.to begin with,it is well established that whether the parties have submitted a particular dispute to arbitration is undeniably an issue for judicial determination u nless the parties clearly and unmistakably provide otherwise.at t,at see also john wiley,at w hether or not a party i s bound to arbitrate,as well as what issues it must arbi
