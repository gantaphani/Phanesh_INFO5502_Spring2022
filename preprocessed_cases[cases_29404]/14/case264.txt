the question in this case is whether the illinois department of transportation violated the united states constitution in administering a program designed to increase the participation of socially and economically disadvantaged individuals in illinois highway construction subcontracting.after a trial,the district court concluded that the plaintiff had failed to prove a constitutional violation.plaintiff northern contracting,now appeals,arguing that the state disadvantaged business enterprise program is not narrowly tailored to further a compelling governmental interest.for the reasons that follow,we affirm the judgment of the district court.
background 
northern contracting,nci is a corporation that specializes in the construction of guardrails and fences for highway construction projects in illinois.generally,illinois highway construction projects are awarded to a prime contractor on the basis of the lowest qualified bid,and then the prime contractor completes the project through the use of subcontractors who perform work such as the guardrails work that is the specialty of nci.most of nci revenue comes through successful bids as a subcontractor in state and local highway projects.
in,nci filed this action seeking declaratory and injunctive relief against the state of illinois,the illinois department of transportation idot,the united states department of transportation usdot,the secretary of idot,and idot bureau chief of the bureau of small business enterprises,under,and d,claiming that idot disadvantaged business enterprise dbe program is unconstitutional.idot is the state agency responsible for construction and maintenance of all transportation infrastructure in illinois,ranging from highways to airports.it receives approximately one third of its funding from the federal government.
idot dbe program is an outgrowth of federal policy.federal law establishes a national goal that ten percent of federal highway funds are to be spent with dbes.see surface transportation assistance act of,f,stat,see also transportation equity act for the century,b,stat.usdot implementing regulations for require all recipients of federal highway funds such as idot to have an approved dbe program.see a.
to qualify as a dbe,a company must be at least controlled by individuals who are both socially and economically disadvantaged.see.socially disadvantaged individuals are those who have been subjected to racial or ethnic prejudice or cultural bias because of their identity as a member of a group without regard to their individual qualities.a.economically disadvantaged individuals are those socially disadvantaged individuals whose ability to compete in the free enterprise system has been impaired due to diminished capital and credit opportunities as compared to others in the same business area who are not socially disadvantaged.a a.a dbe owner net worth can not exceed.a i.the regulations require recipients to presume,rebuttably,that women and members of racial minority groups are socially and economically disadvantaged if an individual belonging to one of these groups attests to these qualifications in a signed and notarized document.see a.the regulations do not foreclose the classification to members of any racial group or gender.see id.a company with gross revenue exceeding million can not qualify as a dbe.see b.nci is not a dbe.it is not owned by women or members of any racial minority group.
a recipient of usdot funds,such as idot,must take several steps in order to assure compliance with federal law pertaining to its required dbe program.first,the recipient must determine at the local level the figure that would constitute an appropriate dbe involvement goal,based on the relative availability of dbes.b.the regulations detail the various methods a recipient may use to calculate dbe availability,but under any method selected,a recipient must begin by calculating a base figure for the relative availability of dbes,and then must examine evidence in the local area to determine whether any adjustments to the base figure are needed.c,d.these adjustments lead to the final local goal.see id.
after a local goal is established,the recipient must submit its dbe plan to usdot for approval,with explanations as to how it arrived at the goal.f.usdot is not allowed to withhold funds if a recipient later fails to meet its goal unless there is a demonstration of bad faith on the part of the recipient.a.
at the implementation stage,a recipient is required to maximize the portion of its goal that can feasibly be achieved through means.a.the regulations provide a list of means through which a recipient can maximize dbe participation,including such steps as providing bonding assistance to all subcontractors,sponsoring informational programs,and ensuring the widest possible distribution of the recipient dbe directory.see b.
idot typically adopts a new dbe plan each year.in preparing the fiscal year plan,idot retained national economic research associates,nera,a consulting firm,to conduct a custom census in order to determine dbe availability.the nera custom census was ultimately conducted by jon wainwright,an economist.wainwright analysis involved first identifying the relevant geographic market illinois and the relevant product market transportation infrastructure construction.next,wainwright surveyed dun bradstreet marketplace,which is a comprehensive database of american businesses that identifies which businesses are minority or.wainwright supplemented this survey with idot list of dbes in illinois.after arriving at this beginning list of dbes,wainwright corrected for errors in the data by surveying a random sample from the group this survey led him to conclude that of the firms listed as minority or were actually owned by white men.he then surveyed all of the firms listed as not being minority or this survey led him to conclude that were actually owned by minorities or women.in light of these two surveys,wainwright adjusted his calculation of dbe availability and arrived at an overall relative availability of.wainwright then ran a regression analysis of census bureau data on earnings and business formation,and concluded that in the absence of discrimination,relative dbe availability would be.
in arriving at its final goal for fiscal year,along with the nera report prepared by wainwright,idot considered a study nera conducted for metra expert reports used in builders association of greater chicago chicago,d anecdotal information gathered at public hearings data on dbe involvement in construction projects in markets without dbe goals and idot own data on the past use of dbes.included in idot own data was a zero goal experiment conducted in and,in which idot did not use dbe goals on of its contracts.on these contracts,dbes ended up receiving approximately of the total value of the contracts.also of note,idot examined the system utilized by the illinois state toll highway authority,which does not receive federal funding though the tollway has a dbe goal of,this goal is completely average dbe usage rate in and was.on the basis of all of this data,idot adopted as its fiscal year dbe goal.
though was idot overall goal,it determines individually whether each project should carry a dbe goal,based on the type of project and the availability of dbes to perform the subcontracting that will be necessary.after the prime contractor is selected on the basis of the lowest qualified bid,the prime contractor has seven days to report its dbe utilization plan to idot.idot awards waivers and reductions of the goal if a contractor later demonstrates that it made a effort but was incapable of meeting the goal.
at the outset of this litigation,nci complaint alleged that and usdot regulations were outside of the scope of congressional power these federal provisions violated the fifth amendment guarantee of equal protection the illinois statute implementing the federal dbe requirement violated,d and the fourteenth amendment equal protection clause.nci requested declaratory and injunctive relief.
after discovery closed in,all of the parties to this suit filed for summary judgment.the district court granted only usdot motion for summary judgment,concluding that the federal government had demonstrated a compelling interest ending effects of current and past discrimination in highway contracting market and that and its implementing regulations were sufficiently narrowly tailored.the court concluded that a trial was necessary to determine whether idot program was narrowly tailored.
at the bench trial,the state introduced the testimony of wainwright,the testimony of owners of dbes,and the testimony of an idot employee colette holt who explained the fiscal year dbe plan.nci introduced the testimony of prime contractors.the parties stipulated that the percentage of idot total contracting expenditures that went to dbes was in and in the percentage of idot contracting expenditures received by dbes on contracts with dbe goals was in and in and the percentage of contracting expenditures that went to dbes on contracts with no dbe goals was in and in.
at the conclusion of the trial,judge pallmeyer found that idot fiscal year dbe program was narrowly tailored to the compelling interest identified by the federal the effects of racial and gender discrimination in the highway construction granted judgment for the defendants.nci now appeals from that judgment 
ii.analysis 
the only question that we must answer in this appeal is whether nci can prove that idot dbe program does not pass constitutional muster.since the program involves racial classifications,we must employ strict scrutiny in making this determination see adarand constructors pena,d.in order to survive strict scrutiny,a government program that uses racial classifications must be narrowly tailored to serve a compelling governmental interest.see id.following a bench trial,we review the district court legal conclusion that idot program is constitutional de novo and its factual determinations for clear error.bricklayers local of.apprenticeship training program banner restoration,cir riggins walter,cir.
compelling interest 
nci appears to have forfeited the argument that idot dbe program does not serve a compelling governmental interest,focusing instead on the narrow tailoring prong of the test.nevertheless,we think it prudent to briefly address the compelling interest aspect of the strict scrutiny analysis and we agree with the district court that idot has satisfied its burden here.as a state entity implementing a congressionally mandated program,idot relies primarily on the federal government compelling interest in remedying the effects of past discrimination in the national construction market in the era,two other circuits have considered the question of whether a state may properly rely on the federal government compelling interest in implementing a local dbe plan for highway construction contracting,and both have concluded that a state may properly do so.see western states paving,washington state dep t of,cir when congress enacted,it identified a compelling nationwide interest in remedying discrimination in the transportation contracting industry.even if such discrimination does not exist in washington,the state implementation of nevertheless rests upon the compelling interest identified by congress,cert.denied,d sherbrooke turf.dep t of,cir when the program is federal,the inquiry is at least usually national in scope.if congress or the federal agency acted for a proper purpose and with a strong basis in the evidence,the program has the requisite compelling government interest nationwide,even if the evidence did not come from or apply to every state or locale in the nation,cert.denied,d.
as we noted above,nci has not articulated any reason for us to break ranks with our sister circuits.indeed,prior to the supreme court decision in adarand,we considered the question of whether the federal government interest in remedying discrimination in highway construction contracting provided sufficient justification for the state to engage in a federally mandated dbe program,and we concluded that it did.see milwaukee county pavers ass fielder,cir insofar as the state is merely complying with federal law it is acting as the agent of the federal government and is no more subject to being enjoined on equal protection grounds than the federal civil servants who drafted the regulations if the state does exactly what the statute expects it to do,and the statute is conceded for purposes of the litigation to be constitutional,we do not see how the state can be thought to have violated the constitution.as in milwaukee county pavers,nci has not challenged the constitutionality of the applicable federal statutes and regulations on appeal.and as the more recent decisions of the eighth and ninth circuits make clear,our compelling interest analysis in this context should not be altered by adarand.therefore,the question of compelling interest must be decided in favor of idot.the only question is whether idot program is narrowly tailored to achieving this compelling interest.
narrow tailoring 
we are convinced that idot has satisfied its burden of demonstrating that its program is narrowly tailored.our holding in milwaukee county pavers that a state is insulated from this sort of constitutional attack,absent a showing that the state exceeded its federal authority,remains applicable.see milwaukee county pavers,at tennessee asphalt farris,cir citing milwaukee county pavers for the same point see also western states paving,at mckay,concurring in part and dissenting in part noting the continuing applicability of milwaukee county pavers and concluding that the plaintiffs should be limited to challenging the state adherence to its grant of federal authority in adarand,the supreme court did not seize the opportunity to conclude that our decision in milwaukee county pavers,along with the sixth circuit in tennessee asphalt,was incorrect.the court only decided that federal programs involving racial classifications must also be subjected to strict scrutiny.see adarand,at.it did not invalidate our conclusion that a challenge to a state application of a federally mandated program must be limited to the question of whether the state exceeded its authority.here,because nci has not challenged on appeal the district court grant of summary judgment for the federal government,it has forfeited the opportunity to challenge the federal regulations.
we note that much of nci argument regarding narrow tailoring is based on our decision in builders association of greater chicago county of cook but this reliance is misplaced.even before adarand expanded the applicability of strict scrutiny to federal programs,state and local governments that independently created affirmative action programs were subject to strict scrutiny,and we observed in builders association that the state was required to demonstrate that its program was narrowly tailored to remedy the specific past discrimination perpetrated by the state.see builders ass n,at.but as discussed above,idot here is acting as an instrument of federal policy and nci can not collaterally attack the federal regulations through a challenge to idot program.see milwaukee county pavers,at insofar as the state is merely doing what the statute and regulations envisage and permit,the attack on the state is an impermissible collateral attack on the statute and regulations.see also kelley bd.of,cir citing milwaukee county pavers and concluding that plaintiffs attempted challenge to university attempt to comply with requirements of title ix was impermissible collateral attack on the statute.
thus,the remainder of our inquiry is limited to the question of whether idot exceeded its grant of authority under federal law.nci presses three arguments in this respect.first,nci argues that idot violated c by improperly calculating the relative availability of dbes in illinois.second,nci argues that idot failed to properly adjust its base figure based on local market conditions.third,nci argues that idot violated by failing to meet the maximum feasible portion of its overall goal through means.all three of nci arguments fail.
