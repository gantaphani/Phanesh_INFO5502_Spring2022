introduction 
defendant city of beaumont the city approved a specific plan,the specific plan the scsp or project,to build residential units on a site long used for agricultural purposes and located in an unincorporated area north of the city known as cherry valley.in august,the city certified an environmental impact report eir and adopted a statement of overriding considerations for the scsp pursuant to the california environmental quality act ceqa pub.resources code,et and took related actions approving the scsp.plaintiffs cherry valley pass acres and neighbors and cherry valley environmental planning group petitioned the trial court for a writ of mandate setting aside the city certification of the eir,adoption of the statement of overriding considerations,and related actions approving the project.the trial court denied the petition,and plaintiffs appeal.
plaintiffs claim the eir is legally inadequate as an informational document and the city therefore abused its discretion in certifying it because it failed to properly address the project significant impacts on area water supplies and agricultural land uses.they first claim the eir relied upon an improper baseline or environmental setting in assessing the project impacts on local and regional water supplies and also failed to demonstrate a reasonable likelihood the project would have sufficient water supplies over the.second,they claim the eir failed to adequately consider mitigation measures and alternatives for reducing the project impacts on agricultural land uses.third,and finally,they claim the findings the city made in adopting the statement of overriding considerations are not supported by substantial evidence.we find each of these claims without merit and affirm the judgment denying the petition.
ii.factual and procedural background 
cherry valley is an unincorporated area of riverside county located north of the city and east of interstate in the san gorgonio pass area.the scsp site is in the western portion of cherry valley,and consists of rolling terrain with elevations ranging from to feet above mean sea level.the scsp site is roughly rectangular in shape and is bordered by cherry valley boulevard to the north,brookside avenue to the south,and beaumont avenue to the east.a area of cherry valley with rural residences,livestock pens,outbuildings,and small operations is located east of the scsp site.
beginning in the early through late,members of the manheim family,through their company,real party in interest egg poultry operated an egg farm on the scsp site.the egg farm housed over million chickens and supported over structures,mostly chicken coops.closed the egg farm in late after determining it was no longer economically feasible.before,the project site was used for low intensity agricultural purposes.
during the early,a professional wrestler known as gorgeous george purchased a house and began operating a small turkey ranch on the scsp site,just east of the portion of the site where later operated the egg farm.much of the area north of the project site and north of cherry valley boulevard consists of a area known as the danny thomas ranch and includes a home once owned by the famous producer,actor,and comedian.
as finally approved in august,the scsp is a smaller version of a larger scale scsp that proposed in december.as originally proposed,the scsp was to encompass acres,including approximately acres of the danny thomas ranch,and was to include square feet of commercial retail and service properties and residential units.the project area,together with the adjacent area of cherry valley east of the project area,were to be annexed to the city sphere of influence.in december,a notice of preparation was issued for the original scsp and the annexation.in early,the draft eir was circulated for the original scsp and the annexation.
in july,the city planning commission held a public hearing and suggested changes to the project,principally to reduce its size and scope.the original scsp was then modified to eliminate all commercial properties and higher density residential units,to reduce the number of residential units from to,and to exclude the portion of the danny thomas ranch,thus reducing the size or footprint of the scsp from to acres.further,in order to coordinate land uses on the scsp site with development in the area east of the project site,a community plan,the north brookfield community plan,was proposed for the entire area,and the sphere of influence was revised to include this expanded area.
riverside county general plan and zoning guidelines allowed only one residence to be built on one acre in the area,but the north brookfield community plan envisioned that the area would include as many as residential units,with in the scsp.the units were to be built on net acres,with landscape buffers,parks,roads,trails,paseos,and open space acres constructed on the other portions of the scsp area.the draft eir was revised to reflect these changes and was recirculated in may and june.the revised eir assessed the environmental impacts of the revised scsp on a project level and the impacts of the newly proposed north brookfield community plan on a programmatic level.
according to the revised eir,the area surrounding the scsp site and proposed north brookfield community plan,or the entire expanded sphere of influence area,was undergoing substantial growth and development.the portion of the north brookfield community plan consisted mostly of residential lots and dozens of parcels owned by dozens of individuals,but the beaumont unified school district was building a high school on acres in the southwest portion of the area.two new subdivisions with approximately homes were under construction southeast of the scsp site within the existing boundaries of the city.a pga golf course and several more residential developments in various stages of development,including a proposed oak valley specific plan with approximately residential units,was located across interstate and west of the scsp site.the portion of the danny thomas ranch in the original scsp had been sold and was proposed to be annexed to the city of calimesa and developed for residential uses.the revised eir concluded that the cherry valley community had supported mainly rural and agricultural uses for many years,but it and surrounding communities,including the city,were experiencing growth pressure from new homes and businesses.
the city requested and received comments on the revised eir and addressed these and other comments in the final eir,issued in may.additional comments were later received and addressed in june.plaintiffs and persons living in and around cherry valley submitted various letters criticizing the eir analysis of the project impacts on area water supplies and agricultural resources.
at a public hearing in july,the city council directed the city staff and to abandon the north brookfield community plan and to make additional changes to the scsp.the north brookfield community plan was then abandoned,and the scsp was amended to reduce the number of its residential units from to.in august,the city certified the eir,adopted the statement of overriding considerations,and took additional actions in approving the scsp the project approvals.these included the annexation of the scsp site into the city and the amendment of the city general plan to include the scsp site.in september,plaintiffs petitioned the trial court for a writ of mandate setting aside the city actions.the trial court denied the petition,and plaintiffs appealed.

iv.supply impacts 
background 
the beaumont basin 
the scsp area overlies an extensive groundwater basin known as the beaumont basin.the beaumont basin is the largest single source of water from which several water districts in the san gorgonio pass area,including the beaumont cherry valley water district the bcvwd,the yucaipa valley water district,the cabazon water district,and the south mesa water company,draw water to serve their customers.the bcvwd supplies domestic and irrigation water to the city and surrounding communities.
during the,the united states geological survey estimated that the beaumont basin held million of groundwater at a depth of feet below ground surface the united states geological survey estimate formed the basis of a general consensus that the base of usable water in the beaumont basin was at feet below ground surface.more recently,the bcvwd drilled a test well to a depth of feet below ground surface,and results suggested that high quality groundwater existed in large quantities below feet below ground surface.according to the bcvwd,other deep wells drilled by,the southern california professional golfers association,and others indicated this deep water source was relatively wide spread in the beaumont basin.
during the years it operated the egg farm,pumped water directly from the beaumont basin,using wells on the scsp site,for use in operating the egg farm.between and,used an average of per annum afa of beaumont basin groundwater in operating the egg farm.after the egg farm ceased operating in late,began using the project site for cattle ranching and feed crop operations and used far less water,around afa.in order to secure water for the scsp,the scsp provides it is to be annexed to the service area of the bcvwd.
the adjudication and judgment 
in,the city,the city of banning,the bcvwd,the yucaipa valley water district,and the south mesa water company formed a joint powers agency,namely,the san timoteo watershed management authority the stwma,in order to formulate and implement a water resources management program for the san timoteo watershed,a large drainage area that includes the beaumont basin.in,the stwma filed a lawsuit in the riverside county superior court,seeking to adjudicate the rights of several private parties and public agencies to beaumont basin groundwater the public agency defendants consisted of the city,the city of banning,the bcvwd,the yucaipa valley water district,and the south mesa water company.the private party defendants included and its owners,manheim,manheim and berman manheim,and nine other parties who claimed rights to beaumont basin groundwater.
in february,the parties to the suit entered into a stipulated judgment the adjudication or judgment.the private party defendants were identified as overlying parties and the public agency defendants as appropriator parties.the overlying parties were defined as owners of land overlying the beaumont basin who had previously exercised overlying water rights to pump water from the basin,and their successors and assigns.
and manheim were treated as one overlying party and were awarded afa in overlying water rights to beaumont basin groundwater.their afa entitlement was based in part on a rolling average of the amount of water had drawn from the basin each year between and,or afa.all overlying parties,including and manheim,were awarded a total of afa in overlying water rights.
concomitantly,the judgment stipulated that the safe yield of the beaumont basin was afa for each of the years following the february entry of the judgment,and defined safe yield as the maximum quantity of water which can be produced annually from a g roundwater b asin under a given set of conditions without causing a gradual lowering of the groundwater level leading eventually to depletion of the supply in storage.the judgment expressly acknowledged that the beaumont basin was at or near a condition of o verdraft,and defined overdraft as a condition wherein the total annual production from a g roundwater b asin exceeds the s afe y ield thereof.
the judgment provided that to the extent any overlying party obtained water service from an appropriator party,the overlying party would forebear use of that volume of water,and an equivalent amount of water would be earmarked for use by the overlying party.the judgment acknowledged that this provision was intended to ensure that the overlying party would receive credit towards satisfying the water availability assessment provisions of government code section and water code section et,or other similar provisions of law,equal to the amount of groundwater earmarked 
the judgment also adopted and ordered the parties to comply with a p hysical s olution i n accordance with the mandate of section of article x of the california constitution.california american water city of seaside th,a physical solution is an equitable remedy designed to alleviate overdrafts and the consequential depletion of water resources in a particular area,consistent with the constitutional mandate to prevent waste and unreasonable water use.the physical solution enjoined the parties from producing groundwater from the beaumont basin except as provided in the judgment and addressed all p roduction and s torage within the beaumont basin.the physical solution was intended to establish a legal and practical means for making the maximum reasonable beneficial use of the waters of beaumont basin,to facilitate conjunctive utilization of surface,ground and supplemental waters defined as waters imported from outside the beaumont basin,and to satisfy the requirements of water users having rights in,or who are dependent upon,the beaumont basin.the judgment empowered a w atermaster,consisting of a committee of persons nominated by the appropriator parties,to enforce the physical solution and develop a groundwater management plan and program for the beaumont basin.
in accordance with the judgment and as part of the project approvals,and manheim agreed to assign their afa in overlying water rights to the bcvwd.in exchange,the bcvwd agreed to earmark afa of beaumont basin groundwater specifically and exclusively for the scsp.after the scsp was downsized in early to exclude the portion of the danny thomas ranch north of cherry valley boulevard,and the bcvwd agreed to allocate afa of afa entitlement to north or to the portion of the danny thomas ranch.the other afa was allocated to the scsp area south of cherry valley boulevard.
the water supply assessment the wsa 
as indicated in the judgment and as explained in vineyard area citizens,supra,cal th at page government code section generally requires a city or county,before approving a subdivision map for a residential development of more than units,to obtain from the applicable public water system a written verification that adequate water supplies will be available for that project as well as other existing and planned future uses for a projected period 
water code sections to apply more broadly to any large land use project not only residential developments and to approval of any such project subject to ceqa not only to subdivision map approvals.water code,subd.a,subds.a,b.they require the city or county considering a project to obtain,at the outset of the ceqa process,a water supply assessment from the applicable pubic water system,subd.b.the water supply assessment is then to be included in any ceqa document the city or county prepares for the project,subd.b.ceqa,in turn,requires compliance with these water code provisions.pub.resources code.
in march,the bcvwd prepared a water supply assessment,the wsa,for the original,unit scsp.the wsa estimated that the original scsp would require up to afa of water,including afa of potable water suitable for drinking,and afa of irrigation or recycled water,and concluded that sufficient supplies of water were available to meet the demands of the scsp for years.this conclusion was based on agreement to assign their entire afa entitlement of overlying water rights in the beaumont basin to the bcvwd,and the bcvwd agreement to earmark and supply up to an equal amount of beaumont basin groundwater to the scsp.in short,the wsa concluded that afa entitlement was more than sufficient to meet the needs of the original,larger scale scsp over years.
under a heading titled additional supplies,the wsa further concluded that the bcvwd would have sufficient supplies of water to meet the needs of the original scsp from sources other than afa entitlement over years,or through the year.more specifically,the wsa concluded the bcvwd would have sufficient supplies of water from its two existing sources,namely,the beaumont basin and a second groundwater basin,edgar canyon,together with additional supplies generated as a result of its plans to develop a wastewater program,a storm water recharge program,and imports of water from the state water project swp water.
in the wsa,the bcvwd discussed the sources of its anticipated water supplies in some detail.based on studies conducted by itself,the stwma,and the san gorgonio pass water agency the sgpwa,the bcvwd estimated that the safe yield of the beaumont basin was afa,or afa more than the afa estimated and agreed upon in the judgment,and that the safe yield of the edgar canyon was around afa.the wsa cautioned that the afa estimate of the beaumont basin safe yield was conservative,and noted that the studies supporting the bcvwd higher estimated safe yield of afa did not consider the deep acquifer yields indicating the beaumont basin had abundant groundwater supplies at feet below ground surface.
the wsa explained that recycled water would be used for irrigation purposes and was expected to potable groundwater the bcvwd was currently taking from its groundwater sources and using for irrigation.recaptured storm water would be used to recharge the beaumont basin,freeing additional beaumont basin groundwater over the.the bcvwd was in the process of developing and implementing its wastewater recycling and storm water recharge programs,and their completion depended in part on fees the bcvwd expected to receive from residential and other development in its service area.
regarding swp water,the wsa explained that the bcvwd expected to import afa of table a swp water through the sgpwa and use that water to recharge the beaumont basin.additional imports of swp water would supply as much as percent of the bcvwd overall water needs.the state water project stores and delivers supplemental water to state water contractors,including the sgpwa,through a system of reservoirs,pumping plants,and the california aquaduct.the sgpwa was created in for the purpose of preserving water resources in its jurisdiction,the san gorgonio pass area,and is responsible for operating and maintaining the state water project in the san gorgonio pass area.the san gorgonio pass area covers a area including the city,cherry valley,cabazon,and the morongo indian reservation.the sgpwa has an entitlement of afa of table a swp water,but in allocating that water is required to give the highest priority to eliminating overdraft conditions in the san gorgonio pass area.
in the wsa,the bcvwd explained that the sgpwa had indicated the bcvwd would be allotted afa of the sgpwa afa table a entitlement,though the bcvwd acknowledged that this afa allotment could only be considered preliminary because it was based on an assessed valuation conducted in.any additional swp water purchased from the sgpwa or through other state water contractors would be used to directly serve the bcvwd customers.finally,the wsa noted that afa of swp water was currently for sale by another state water contractor.
the wsa also incorporated by reference the bcvwd most recent update to its urban water management plan,prepared in august the august uwmp update.like all urban water suppliers,the bcvwd is required to prepare an urban water management plan and update that plan every five years.according to its august uwmp update,the bcvwd expected to reduce its dependence on beaumont basin groundwater,which it relied on for most of its water supply,and limit its reliance on imported swp water to percent of its overall water demand.this percent would be supplied not from the sgpwa afa table a allotment,but from other purchases of swp water.
the urban water management plan the uwmp 
in january,after the wsa was prepared in march,the bcvwd again updated its urban water management plan the uwmp update.the uwmp update concluded that the bcvwd would have sufficient supplies of water to serve the needs of all its customers,including the needs of the original scsp,through.plaintiffs claim the uwmp update and the wsa contained significant factual and analytical deficiencies and inconsistencies that precluded the city from engaging in the type of water impacts analysis ceqa requires.these claimed deficiencies and inconsistencies are discussed below.
the report on water conditions by the sgpwa 
in april,one year after the revised eir was circulated but before the public comment period expired,the sgpwa issued a report on water conditions in the san gorgonio pass area for the to period.according to the report,engineering studies performed in and showed the safe yield of the beaumont basin was between and afa,smaller than the afa estimated in the judgment or the afa estimated by the bcvwd in the wsa in and,respectively,and of water were drawn from the beaumont basin,or approximately and in excess of the sgpwa afa estimate of its safe yield.the report thus concluded that the beaumont basin was in an apparent state of overdraft,and described the overdraft as apparent because it assumed conditions in the beaumont basin were substantially unchanged from the time the engineering studies were completed in and.
the report stated i n order to eventually achieve a state of equilibrium in the beaumont basin,it may be necessary in certain years to recharge more than of supplemental water in the basin.as of the end of,there were not enough recharge facilities in the beaumont basin to take that much water.the report explained that,as of the end of,the little san gorgonio creek recharge facility,with a capacity of approximately per year,was the only recharge facility operating in the beaumont basin.the report also noted,however,that in september,after the period covered by the report,the bcvwd had placed a large recharge facility on its property near beaumont avenue and cherry valley boulevard.as of that date,the recharge capacity of the beaumont basin has increased,and it will in the future be easier to mitigate overdraft in the basin.since march,the sgpwa had been using all its imports of swp water to directly recharge the beaumont basin through the agency little san gorgonio creek recharge facility.but in september,the bcvwd began purchasing swp water from the sgpwa and was using all of it to recharge the beaumont basin at the bcvwd new recharge facility in cherry valley.even with the bcvwd additional recharging capacity,however,the report concluded that the beaumont basin had a shortage of recharging capacity.
finally,the report noted that in the sgpwa achieved a major milestone toward eliminating overdraft conditions in the beaumont basin and other parts of the san gorgonio pass area with the completed construction of phase i of the east branch extension pipeline and pumping station ebx phase i of the state water project.the ebx phase i extended the california aquaduct to the cherry valley area and the beaumont basin.the capacity of the ebx phase i was limited to afa,perhaps not coincidentally the agreed upon maximum safe yield of the beaumont basin by the parties to the adjudication and judgment.when the report was issued in april,a project to construct additional transmission facilities capable of carrying the sgpwa full swp water allotment of afa was in the planning stages and was expected to be fully operational by.
the final eir conclusions 
in the final eir,the city concluded the scsp would not significantly impact water supplies and resources principally because and manheim were assigning their right to draw afa of groundwater from the beaumont basin to the bcvwd,and the same amount of beaumont basin groundwater would be earmarked or set aside specifically for the scsp.this amount far exceeded the afa of water the scsp,in its final form with residential units on acres,would consume in a worst case scenario.
b.the baseline question 
plaintiffs first contend the eir failed to properly analyze the scsp impacts on area water supplies and resources because it relied on an improper baseline or environmental setting in analyzing these,adjudicated right to draw afa of groundwater from the beaumont basin.they argue the eir should have analyzed these impacts based on the much lower afa that was actually using on the project site after it ceased operating the egg farm in late,and the use of the afa figure caused the eir to oversimplify and understate the project true impacts on area water supplies and resources.
in order to determine whether a project is likely to have significant environmental effects,the lead agency must use some measure of the environment state absent the project,a measure sometimes referred to as the baseline for environmental analysis.communities for a better environment south coast air quality management dist.cal th,cbe.section,subdivision a of the guidelines sets forth the general rule agencies are required to follow in determining the proper baseline.it states an eir must include a description of the physical environmental conditions in the vicinity of the project,as they exist at the time the notice of preparation is published,or if no notice of preparation is published,at the time environmental analysis is commenced,from both a local and regional perspective.this environmental setting will normally constitute the baseline physical conditions by which a lead agency determines whether an impact is significant.italics added.
in using the word normally,section,subdivision a of the guidelines necessarily contemplates that physical conditions at other points in time may constitute the appropriate baseline or environmental setting.fat county of sacramento th.though the baseline conditions are generally described as the existing physical conditions in the affected area,or the real conditions on the ground cbe,supra,cal th at,the date for establishing baseline can not be a rigid one.environmental conditions may vary from year to year and in some cases it is necessary to consider conditions over a range of time periods.id.at,quoting save our peninsula,supra,th at.environmental conditions may also change during the period of environmental review,and temporary lulls or spikes in operations that happen to occur during the period of review should not depress or elevate the baseline.cbe,supra,at.accordingly,n either ceqa nor the ceqa guidelines mandates a uniform,inflexible rule for determination of the existing conditions baseline.rather,an agency enjoys the discretion to decide,in the first instance,exactly how the existing physical conditions without the project can most realistically be measured,subject to review,as with all ceqa factual determinations,for support by substantial evidence.citation.ibid.
an agency determination of the proper baseline for a project can be difficult and controversial,particularly when the physical conditions in the vicinity of the project are subject to fluctuations fairview neighbors county of ventura th,are difficult to discern because little historical data concerning them is available save our peninsula,supra,th at,or when appropriate studies concerning them have not been conducted county of amador el dorado county water agency,supra,th at san joaquin raptor rescue center county of merced th.without an appropriate baseline description,an adequate analysis of a project impacts,mitigation measures,and alternatives becomes impossible.county of amador el dorado county water agency,supra,at.
in certifying the final eir,the city concluded that the afa was entitled to pump from the beaumont basin pursuant to the judgment and was transferring to the bcvwd as part of the project approvals was the appropriate baseline to use in measuring the scsp impacts on area water resources.given this baseline,the city concluded the scsp would not significantly impact area water resources because,even in a worst case scenario,the scsp would consume no more than afa of water,much less than the afa entitlement.to be sure,in responses to comments in the final eir,the city pointed out that the scsp would add over afa of beaumont basin groundwater to the bcvwd existing supplies,and this amount would be available to serve the bcvwd other customers.
the city selection of the afa figure as the baseline for determining the scsp impacts on area water supplies and resources was quintessentially a discretionary determination of how the existing physical conditions without the project could most realistically be measured.cbe,supra,cal th at.the city determination is reviewed for substantial evidence ibid,and substantial evidence shows that the afa figure was a realistic and proper baseline to use in measuring the scsp impacts on area water resources.most significantly,the judgment afforded the right to use afa of beaumont basin groundwater each year beginning in february,and retained afa of this entitlement for use on the scsp site after assigning afa of its entitlement to north in.in addition,the afa figure was not substantially higher than average annual use of afa,between and,in operating the egg farm on the project site.
though,as plaintiffs point out,was using only afa on the site after it ceased operating the egg farm in late,its right to use its full afa entitlement on the project site was wholly unaffected by its cessation of the egg farm operations.the afa figure thus accurately reflected the physical environmental conditions in the vicinity of the project,as they exist ed at the time the notice of preparation was published in december guidelines,subd.a or the real conditions on the ground at that time cbe,supra,cal th at,citing save our peninsula,supra,th at.nor had these conditions changed by the time the revised eir was circulated in early or by the time the final eir was certified in august.as discussed,right to use afa on the project site was unaffected by its cessation of the egg farm operations in late,and the afa figure closely approximated historic water usage on the project site while the egg farm was operating.
nor do plaintiffs explain how the use of afa entitlement as the baseline resulted in an oversimplification and unjustified dismissal of significant impacts on water resources.had the city used the afa figure as the baseline,the eir would have necessarily concluded that the scsp,with its anticipated water demands of as much as afa,would significantly impact area water supplies by adding as much as afa to existing demands on the bcvwd supplies.but this would have been misleading,given right to pump afa of groundwater from the beaumont basin and its agreement to transfer its entire afa entitlement to the bcvwd as part of the project approvals.rather than consume additional beaumont basin groundwater,as plaintiffs claim,substantial evidence showed the scsp would,as the final eir concluded,make more beaumont basin groundwater available for the bcvwd other than additional afa.
plaintiffs argue that the decisions in cbe,woodward park,and environmental planning information council county of el dorado d epic support their claim that the city abused its discretion in failing to use the afa figure as the baseline for assessing the scsp impacts on area water resources.we disagree.each of these cases involved the erroneous use of hypothetical or allowable conditions as is,conditions that were permissible pursuant to an existing plan or regulation but that were not being employed or that did not exist on the ground at the time environmental review commenced.afa entitlement to beaumont basin groundwater was not a hypothetical or allowable condition,but a condition that existed on the ground and that had existed on the project site since february,well before the notice of preparation was published in december and environmental review of the original scsp commenced.the facts of cbe,woodward park,and epic illustrate this critical distinction.
cbe involved a project to expand the operating capacity of a petroleum refinery boilers,which produced steam for the refinery operations and nitrogen oxide,a major contributor to smog.cbe,supra,cal th at.as its baseline for determining the project environmental impacts,the agency relied on the amount of heat the refinery boilers were allowed to emit under the refinery existing permits,though each boiler had operated at its maximum permitted capacity in only limited one or more other boilers were shut down for maintenance.id.at.the agency issued a negative declaration,concluding the expansion project would not significantly impact the environment because the project would result in the boilers emitting less heat,steam,and nitrogen oxide than they were allowed to emit under the existing permits.id.at.the court concluded the agency abused its discretion in using the maximum permitted capacity of the boilers as the baseline for its impacts analysis,because the maximum permitted capacity was a hypothetical allowable condition which resulted in an illusory comparison of the project impacts with a hypothetical baseline,and misled the public concerning the project true environmental impacts.id.at.
like cbe,woodward park before it involved the erroneous use of a hypothetical allowable condition as a baseline,namely,a office park and retail development that had never been built but that constituted the development allowable on the project site under existing plan and zoning designations.woodward park,supra,th at.the proposed project was to build a smaller,office park and shopping center on a vacant lot,but the eir for the most part compared the proposed project impacts on traffic congestion and air pollution with the larger,hypothetical development rather than with the vacant lot or the existing physical situation.id.at.this caused the eir to understate the proposed project true impacts on traffic congestion and air pollution.id.at.the court observed that the public will naturally assume an eir will compare what will happen if the project is built with what will happen if the site is left alone,rather than compare the project impacts with a hypothetical project or condition.id.at.accordingly,the use of the larger hypothetical development as the baseline was misleading.
epic was the first in a long line of cases that,like the more recent decisions in woodward park and cbe,concluded that the use of hypothetical allowable conditions as baselines is erroneous because it distorts a project true environmental impacts and may also lead to the failure to consider feasible alternatives and mitigation measures.see cbe,supra,cal th at,fn,and cases cited.in epic,the court concluded that two eirs for two general plan amendments were legally inadequate because they compared the impacts of the amendments with the county existing general plan,which had not been fully implemented,rather than with the actual conditions in the areas to be affected by the amendments.epic,supra,d at.the general plan called for maximum populations of and in two areas,and the amendments would have reduced these figures to and.the existing populations were only and.the eir concluded the amendments would have no adverse environmental impacts because they would significantly reduce the populations in the affected areas.the court called this comparison illusory and reasoned it could only mislead the public as to the reality of the impacts and subvert full consideration of the actual environmental impacts which would result,given that the amendments would significantly increase the population in each area.id.at see also city of board of supervisors d,effects of rezoning must be compared to existing physical environment,rather than to development allowed under a prior land use plan.
plaintiffs maintain that entitlement to afa of beaumont basin groundwater is indistinguishable from the hypothetical allowable conditions or invalid baselines involved in cbe,woodland park,and epic.again,they point out that was not pumping afa but only afa after it closed the egg farm in late,and had no plans to resume the egg farm operations.the comparison fails because not only had a history of pumping substantially the same amount of beaumont basin groundwater in its egg farm operations an average of afa between and,but was entitled to pump up to afa on the project site.the afa entitlement was not a hypothetical amount of water that had never used or had no right to use on the project site.san joaquin raptor rescue center county of merced,supra,th at established levels of a particular use have been considered to be part of an existing environmental setting with save our peninsula,supra,th at entitlement to use additional water on project site was not the same as actual use.
c.the eir adequately analyzed the scsp impacts on the beaumont basin and the bcvwd total water supplies 
plaintiffs further claim the eir failed to adequately analyze the scsp impacts on local and regional water supplies because it failed to coherently and consistently explain how the bcvwd would have sufficient supplies of water to serve the needs of both the scsp and the bcvwd other customers over an approximate period.they argue the eir relied on faulty assumptions and unduly optimistic predictions concerning the availability of water supplies in the bcvwd service area,specifically those set forth in the bcvwd wsa for the original scsp and its uwmp update.in support of this claim,they rely on vineyard area citizens,supra,cal th at pages through,where the court articulated and established four essential standards that eirs are required to meet in evaluating whether water supplies for large scale development projects are likely to be met.
first,the eir is inadequate if it simply ignores or assumes a solution to the problem of supplying water to a proposed land use project.instead,the eir must present agency decisionmakers and the public with sufficient facts to evaluate the pros and cons of supplying the amount of water that the project will need.citation.vineyard area citizens,supra,cal th at,quoting santiago county water dist.county of orange d.second,the eir must assume that all phases of the project will be built and,to the extent possible,must analyze the impacts of providing water to the entire project.in short,the water supply needs of later phases of a large scale development project can not be deferred to future analysis through the use of tiered eirs.vineyard area citizens,supra,at p santa clarita organization for planning the environment county of los angeles th stanislaus natural heritage project county of stanislaus th.
third,the future water supplies identified and analyzed must bear a likelihood of actually proving available speculative sources and unrealistic allocations paper water are insufficient bases for decisionmaking under ceqa.citation.an eir for a land use project must address the impacts of likely future water sources,and the eir discussion must include a reasoned analysis of the circumstances affecting the likelihood of the water availability.vineyard area citizens,supra,cal th at,citing santa clarita organization for planning the environment county of los angeles,supra,th at and california oak foundation city of santa clarita th.fourth and finally,where,despite a full discussion,it is impossible to confidently determine that anticipated future water sources will be available,ceqa requires some discussion of possible replacement sources or alternatives to use of the anticipated water,and of the environmental consequences of those contingencies.citation.vineyard area citizens,supra,at napa citizens for honest government napa county bd.of supervisors th.
the court in vineyard area citizens was careful to note,however,that none of the appellate court decisions it cited and relied upon in articulating the four requirements either held or suggested that an eir for a land use plan is inadequate unless it demonstrates the project is definitely assured water through signed,enforceable agreements with a provider and already built or approved treatment and delivery facilities.vineyard area citizens,supra,cal th at.to the contrary,the court observed,ceqa does not require an eir to show a project is certain to have sufficient future water supplies,because r equiring certainty when a,development project is initially approved would likely be unworkable,as it would require water planning to far outpace land use planning.ibid.in addition,local water planning is not a burden that must be taken up anew,for ceqa purposes,each time a development is proposed rather,cities and counties may rely on existing urban water management plans,so long as the expected new demand of the project was included in the water management plan future demand accounting.citations.id.at.
plaintiffs argue the eir failed to comply with the third and fourth requirements of vineyard area citizens because it did not clearly and coherently identify the p roject sources of water and disclose the impacts of providing the new water to the p roject.nor,they argue,did the eir explain how water supplies for the project were likely to be met over the,the impacts of providing those supplies,or how these impacts were to be mitigated.though they acknowledge afa entitlement afforded the scsp its own water,plaintiffs point out that the water for the scsp is to be supplied by the bcvwd,not from the four beaumont basin groundwater wells on the project site,and the scsp will have to be served just like all of the bcvwd other customers.the bcvwd,plaintiffs argue,must still come up with the afa of water the scsp will consume,and neither the wsa,the uwmp update,nor the eir coherently explained how the bcvwd would supply afa of water to the scsp over years.
more specifically,plaintiffs claim the wsa and uwmp update contained significant factual and analytical deficiencies and inconsistencies that precluded the city from engaging in the type of analysis ceqa requires.in short,they claim the wsa and uwmp update revealed significant uncertainties concerning how much water the bcvwd will need to serve all its customers through or that water will come from,and how much of it will be available 
regarding the bcvwd anticipated supplies of swp water,plaintiffs point out that the wsa assumed the bcvwd would receive afa of swp water in,increasing to in,while the uwmp update contained significantly different assumptions.it assumed the bcvwd would receive afa of swp water in,increasing to afa in and remaining at roughly that amount,or afa,in.in addition to the higher figures estimated in the uwmp update,plaintiffs point out that this swp water is not part of the sgpwa table a allotment that the bcvwd acknowledged had already been spoken for,but is,rather,other swp water the bcvwd expected to purchase from various state water contractors,including the sgpwa.the availability of this water is anything but certain,they argue.
plaintiffs also question how any swp water,in addition to the sgpwa table a allotment,can be delivered to the bcvwd,given that the sgpwa ebx phase i transmission lines can deliver only afa of table a swp water to the san gorgonio pass area,and the proposal to double this capacity to the sgpwa full entitlement of afa of table a swp water is only in the planning stages.the problem,plaintiffs argue,is there is no indication of what the actual sources of this a swp water are,or what the uncertainties associated with those sources are.and,given the city unquestioning reliance on the bcvwd incomplete and contradictory documents,plaintiffs maintain the eir has failed as an informational document.the city,plaintiffs claim,simply assume d a solution to the water supply problem by relying on s peculative sources and unrealistic allocations paper water,and thus violated the third requirement of vineyard area citizens.vineyard area citizens,supra,cal th at.
plaintiffs also claim the wsa and uwmp update contained speculative and inconsistent projections concerning available supplies of recycled water.recycled water is treated water from the city sewer plant that would be used for nonpotable purposes.the wsa,they point out,claimed that recycled water available to the bcvwd would increase from afa in to afa in,and to by.by contrast,the uwmp update markedly reduced these estimates to zero afa of recycled water being available in,afa being available in,and afa being available in,and the eir never addressed these significant discrepancies.moreover,plaintiffs point out that as of there was no distribution system in place to generate or deliver all of this recycled water.in the uwmp update,the bcvwd reported that the city was in the final stages of expanding the treatment facility and was starting the design for the recycled water pumping station.thus,plaintiffs argue,there was no factual support in the eir for the assumption that recycled water in the amounts predicted by the bcvwd would ever materialize.
plaintiffs claim the eir discussion of the bcvwd available groundwater sources was equally deficient because the eir never explained how the bcvwd would obtain ever increasing amounts of water from the already overdrafted beaumont basin in order to supply afa to the scsp while also supplying the needs of the bcvwd other customers.the bcvwd solution to future water shortages,they argue,is to pump more water from the overdrafted beaumont basin,but the eir did not discuss whether the bcvwd had the right to take as much beaumont basin groundwater as it wanted,and if it did,what the environmental impacts of doing so would be.
nor,plaintiffs argue,did the city ever resolve a significant discrepancy between the wsa and the uwmp update concerning how much water the bcvwd will extract from the already overdrafted beaumont basin.the uwmp update called for extracting afa from the beaumont basin in,increasing to afa in,but decreasing to afa in and remaining at approximately that level through.by contrast,the wsa indicated the bcvwd would use afa in total overlying groundwater rights to the beaumont basin in and,and decreasing to only afa through.again,plaintiffs argue,the eir made no attempt to reconcile these inconsistencies,discuss the bcvwd right,if any,to remove ever increasing amounts of groundwater from the beaumont basin,or discuss the environmental impacts of extracting so much groundwater from the beaumont basin.
though these discrepancies and unanswered questions concerning the bcvwd anticipated supplies of swp water,recycled water,and groundwater were pointed out to the city during the administrative process,plaintiffs claim the city stubbornly refused to address them,instead maintaining that the scsp site ha d its own allocation of groundwater pursuant to the adjudication,and questions concerning the bcvwd operations and groundwater extraction beyond the afa needs of the scsp were not related to the project.the city position,plaintiffs argue,reflects a misunderstanding of the city obligations under vineyard area citizens.we disagree.to the contrary,the city position reflected an accurate reading of its obligations under vineyard area citizens.
in sum,plaintiffs claim the eir was legally inadequate because it failed to show the bcvwd would have sufficient supplies of water to meet the needs of both the scsp and the bcvwd other customers over years.but the eir was not required to make this showing.instead,it was only required to show a reasonable likelihood that sufficient supplies of water,from an identified source,would be available to meet the needs of this project,the scsp,over years.vineyard area citizens,supra,cal th at.as the vineyard area citizens court cautioned ceqa does not necessarily require that an eir show that total water supply and demand are or will be in balance in an area.the eir may by other means demonstrate a reasonable likelihood that water will be available for the project from an identified source id.at,italics added.
the eir made this showing.as the eir repeatedly pointed out,the scsp site has its own water entitlement.and in exchange for the transfer of entire afa entitlement to the bcvwd,the bcvwd will be obliged to earmark up to the same amount of beaumont basin groundwater solely and exclusively for the scsp,even though the scsp will use,at most,only afa of potable and recycled water from the bcvwd supplies.it was for precisely this reason that the wsa concluded that the original,larger scale scsp would have sufficient supplies of water to meet its greater needs of afa over years.the same reasoning applies to the smaller scale scsp and its afa requirement.substantial evidence also showed the bcvwd would have the pumping and delivery capacity to provide as much as afa of potable beaumont basin groundwater to the scsp.thus,the eir demonstrated a reasonable likelihood that sufficient supplies of water would be available for this project,the,unit scsp,from an identified source,the scsp own afa entitlement,over years.vineyard area citizens,supra,cal th at see also foundation city of rohnert park th,when water supply for proposed project includes groundwater,water code section,subdivision f does not require study of past and future pumping by all users of water from groundwater basin.
it is therefore unnecessary for this court to determine whether the wsa,the uwmp,the eir,or the record as a whole contains substantial evidence that the afa requirements of the scsp will be met over the long term from sources other than afa entitlement,or the bcvwd total supplies.even if,as plaintiffs argue,the wsa and uwmp update are inconsistent and incomplete concerning the amounts and sources of water that will be available to the bcvwd over time,and are therefore insufficient to support the conclusion that the scsp will have sufficient water available to it from sources other than the afa entitlement,ceqa did not require the eir to make this showing.simply put,ceqa did not require the eir to show that total water supply and demand are or will be in balance in the bcvwd service area,because the eir demonstrated a reasonable likelihood that the afa needs of the scsp would effectively be supplied from afa entitlement.vineyard area citizens,supra,cal th at.
plaintiffs also claim the eir failed to address the impacts on the beaumont basin of providing water to the scsp.the ultimate question under ceqa,they argue,is not whether an eir establishes a likely source of water,but whether it adequately addresses the reasonably foreseeable impacts of supplying water to the project.vineyard area citizens,supra,cal th at.we agree that the impacts on the beaumont basin of providing water to the scsp were required to be addressed in the eir,but conclude the eir met this requirement.
again,plaintiffs argue the eir failed to properly address the scsp impacts on the beaumont basin because it incorrectly measured the scsp water consumption of afa against the egg ranch historical afa and adjudicated afa water rights,rather than against the afa used on the scsp site after ceased operating the egg farm in late.by this measure,they argue,the scsp will increase existing extractions from the beaumont basin by afa.for the reasons discussed,however,the eir realistically and appropriately relied on afa entitlement as the baseline for evaluating the scsp impacts on water supplies in the beaumont basin.further,and for the reasons explained,the eir properly concluded based on substantial evidence that the scsp would not significantly impact existing water supplies in the beaumont basin.the scsp would use significantly less amounts of beaumont basin groundwater no more than afa than the egg farm had historically used afa or that and manheim were entitled to use on the scsp site afa and were transferring to the bcvwd.
plaintiffs claims are concerned with the extent of the overdraft conditions in the beaumont basin and the impact the scsp will have on these conditions.plaintiffs correctly point out that the adjudication and judgment,through which and manheim acquired their right to use afa of beaumont basin groundwater on the scsp site,and in which the parties stipulated that the safe yield of the beaumont basin was afa,was not subjected to environmental review under ceqa.they also note that the eir did not reconcile the adjudication afa safe yield estimate with the lower to afa safe yield estimated by the sgpwa in its report on water conditions issued in early.
ceqa,however,is concerned with the environmental impacts of the project under consideration.thus,the ultimate question the eir had to address was not the extent to which the beaumont basin was in overdraft,but whether and to what extent the impact the beaumont basin overdraft conditions beyond existing conditions.the eir addressed this question by showing the scsp would use as much as afa of beaumont basin groundwater,far less than existing entitlement to afa of beaumont basin groundwater.the eir properly concluded,based on substantial evidence,that the scsp would cause no additional withdrawals of beaumont basin groundwater beyond existing conditions.
plaintiffs reliance on cadiz land rail cycle th,fourth,div.two is misplaced.that case involved a landfill project that had the potential to contaminate an underlying groundwater basin.this court concluded the eir was legally inadequate because it did not quantify the amount of groundwater in the basin,and this quantification was essential to evaluating the extent of the contamination risk and whether the risk was worth taking.id.at.by contrast,substantial evidence shows the scsp will not impact the overdraft conditions in the beaumont basin beyond the overdraft conditions that existed at the beginning of and throughout the period of environmental review of the scsp.
land use impacts 
plaintiffs further claim the city,in preparing the eir,failed to investigate and analyze feasible mitigation measures and alternatives for reducing the scsp impacts on agricultural land uses.more specifically,they argue there is no evidence to support the city determination in the eir that the scsp adverse impacts on agricultural land uses in the cherry valley area could not be feasibly mitigated because such land uses were no longer economically feasible.nor,they argue,is there any evidence to support the city determination that several onsite project alternatives to the scsp,involving various degrees of continued agricultural uses on the site,were economically infeasible.we reject these claims.
overview of applicable ceqa requirements 
the core of an eir is the mitigation and alternatives sections.goleta valley,supra,cal d at.the purpose of these sections is to consider how a project significant environmental impacts,if any,may be eliminated or reduced through feasible mitigation measures and feasible project alternatives.id.at,subd.a,subd.b,guidelines.feasible means capable of being accomplished in a successful manner within a reasonable period of time,taking into account economic,environmental,legal,social,and technological factors.guidelines.

mitigation measures to reduce agricultural impacts 
plaintiffs claim the eir failed to adequately discuss feasible mitigation measures that would have reduced the scsp impacts on agricultural resources.specifically,they argue the eir was inadequate as an information document because it failed to consider several offsite mitigation measures,including the purchase of offsite lands for agricultural use,the placement of offsite lands into agricultural conservation easements under the agricultural land stewardship program act of or williamson act contracts and the use of impact fees to fund these and other offsite mitigation measures 
relevant background 
the eir concluded the scsp would have significant impacts on agricultural resources in the cherry valley and north beaumont areas,which had historically supported a variety of agricultural uses,cherry orchards,egg farms,turkey ranches,horse stables,the eir explained the scsp would cover prime agricultural soils and would also contribute to cumulative impacts on agricultural resources in the area brought about by tremendous and continuing urban and suburban growth in the area.the eir noted that a pproximately acres or square miles of the area will be developed into various suburban uses,constituting over homes and support uses.
the eir explained that a s the area continues to grow,more agriculture will be displaced by suburban and urban land uses there is no feasible mitigation other than placing large blocks of farmland into conservation easements,williamson act preserve status,or other temporary protection or preservation plans.italics added.then,in the next paragraph,the eir indicated that such mitigation measures were infeasible.after noting the long term continued production of eggs in this area was no longer economically viable,the eir reasoned that a gricultural uses will continue to relocate out of this area as urban development moves east from riverside and san bernardino,and as land values and land use conflicts with urban development increase.this regional loss,both for the project site and the surrounding area,is considered a cumulatively considerable impact which can not be feasibly mitigated.thus,the eir concluded there were no feasible mitigation measures to reduce the scsp direct or cumulative impacts on agricultural lands because the loss of farmland would still occur.
whether agricultural uses were still feasible in the cherry valley and north beaumont areas was a question of fact,and substantial evidence supports the city determination in the eir that such uses were no longer economically feasible.concomitantly,substantial evidence shows that mitigation measures to reduce the scsp direct and cumulative impacts on agricultural uses in the area were not economically feasible.nor did plaintiffs advance any evidence that any of the offsite mitigation measures they claim the eir should have analyzed would have been economically feasible.
given these circumstances,the eir properly treated any offsite land purchases,agricultural easements,williamson act contracts,and similar mitigation measures as facially infeasible and properly declined to analyze them in any detail.concerned citizens,supra,th at insufficient evidence supported claim that eir was inadequate because it failed to discuss specific mitigation measure to reduce project adverse impacts on availability of low income housing los angeles unified school dist.city of los angeles th,eir must respond to specific suggestions for mitigating a significant environmental impact unless the suggested mitigation measure is facially infeasible guidelines,subd.a eir must discuss feasible mitigation measures.
furthermore,a court task is not to weigh conflicting evidence and determine who has the better argument when the dispute is whether adverse effects have been mitigated or could be better mitigated.courts have neither the resources nor scientific expertise to engage in such analysis,even if the statutorily prescribed standard of review permitted us to do so.citation.the standard of review is not de novo but the traditional,deferential substantial evidence test citation.concerned citizens,supra,th at.
as indicated in the eir,substantial evidence showed that the cherry valley and north beaumont areas were,in fact,experiencing tremendous and continuing urban and suburban development.thousands of new homes had been built and were being built in the area.the eir also pointed out that none of the land within a mile area surrounding the scsp site was considered protected resource land,meaning none of it was under agricultural easements or williamson act contracts,and only of the acres in the area surrounding the scsp site were under agricultural production.
based on this evidence and the related increases in agricultural land values,which were creating pressures on owners of all types of agricultural lands to sell or convert their lands for urban and suburban development,the eir reasonably concluded that any measures to reduce the scsp direct and cumulative adverse impacts on agricultural land uses in the cherry valley and north beaumont areas would not have been economically feasible.as the eir explained agricultural uses will continue to relocate out of this area as urban development moves east from riverside and san bernardino,and as land values and land use conflicts with urban development increase.
defend the bay city of irvine th is directly on point.there,the city of irvine approved a program eir to develop a site on acres of prime agricultural land,though the eir concluded the project would have a significant unavoidable adverse impact on agricultural lands by taking acres out of production.id.at.the city considered but rejected as infeasible the purchase of offsite agricultural lands and the continued use of any part of the project site for agricultural purposes.id.at.the court concluded that substantial evidence supported the city determinations,in part because of the negative economics of agriculture in orange county.id.at.i ncreasing land prices and environmental regulation,higher water and labor costs,higher property taxes,competition from other parts of the state and foreign countries,and growing urbanization,the court said,supported the city determination that the retention of onsite lands or the purchase of offsite lands for agricultural use was economically infeasible.ibid.
plaintiffs maintain that the relevant question concerning the feasibility of offsite land purchase and other measures to reduce the project agricultural impacts was whether the net profits realized from the scsp,which the eir estimated to be over million,would be sufficient to fund the purchase of offsite lands or similar mitigation measures.in support of this proposition,plaintiffs rely on this court opinion in save round valley,supra,th at pages and,where we observed the settled principle that a project alternative may properly be rejected as economically infeasible if the reduced profitability of the alternative is sufficiently severe as to render it impractical to proceed with the project.citation.citations.citing this point,plaintiffs complain that the eir here provided absolutely no evidence or analysis whatsoever of the economic costs or profitability of the project with and without offsite mitigation.italics added.
plaintiffs reliance on save round valley is misplaced.first,the case considered the feasibility of a specific project alternative,not an assortment of mitigation measures.save round valley,supra,th at.moreover,the relevant inquiry concerning the economic feasibility of mitigation measures is not,as plaintiffs argue,whether the anticipated net profits from the project were sufficient to fund them.rather,the relevant inquiry is whether such measures were themselves feasible.concerned citizens,supra,th at.an analysis of the economic costs or profitability of the scsp,with and without offsite agricultural mitigation,would not have assisted the city in resolving this question.
nor is there any legal support for plaintiffs assumption that any net profits from a project with significant environmental impacts must be used to fund measures to mitigate those impacts,or that the existence of net profits sufficient to fund a given mitigation measure renders the measure economically feasible.neither save round valley nor other case law supports this proposition,and it is based on flawed reasoning.though some portion of the million in anticipated net profits from the scsp was ostensibly sufficient to purchase some offsite agricultural lands or fund similar mitigation measures,this does not mean that any such mitigation measures were economically feasible.to be sure,substantial evidence showed they were not,and plaintiffs advanced no evidence that they were.
plaintiffs also argue that time tested and legislatively approved mitigation measures to reduce agricultural impacts were available but were ignored without the purchase of offsite agricultural lands and the placement of the project site and offsite lands under agricultural easements or williamson act contracts.not so.the eir did not ignore these potential mitigation measures,but found such offsite measures economically infeasible and for this reason properly declined to analyze them in detail.see concerned citizens,supra,th at.
similarly,plaintiffs argue that state and local policy,reflected in the agricultural land stewardship program act of,the williamson act,and the county of riverside general plan,recognized the vital importance of agriculture and favored the preservation and expansion of agricultural land uses.they fail to acknowledge,however,that ceqa does not require land to be placed under agricultural easements or williamson act contracts.instead,ceqa requires that an eir discuss and analyze feasible means of mitigating the project environmental impacts,and here the eir met this requirement.
nor is the scsp incompatible with the city or the county general plans,as plaintiffs suggest.california native plant society city of rancho cordova,supra,th at general plan is the constitution for all future developments and decisions affecting land use depends on consistency with applicable general plan.the city general plan,approved in march,acknowledged that development pressures severely constrain the viability of agriculture as a continued or permanent use,and provided that the city would support the maintenance of existing agricultural resources in the city to the extent feasible.italics added.the city general plan also called for the expansion of housing and commercial and industrial land uses.in addition,the county general plan,which was not binding on the city,implicitly recognized that agriculture was being phased out on the scsp site and surrounding areas because it designated the scsp site as very low density residential uses,allowing for residential lot sizes of one acre or larger,with a community development overlay,allowing for higher housing densities under a specific plan,such as the scsp.
alternatives to reduce agricultural impacts 
plaintiffs claim the city failed to proceed in a manner required by law because it limited the eir analysis of project alternatives to economically infeasible ones and rejected alternatives if they did not fully mitigate significant agricultural impacts.the question the eir failed to address,they argue,is what forms of agriculture would be viable onsite and what number of housing units would be both economical ly feasible and minimize significant agricultural impacts to the fullest extent possible.the eir addressed this very question,however,in discussing a reasonable range of onsite project alternatives,several involving the continued use of all or a portion of the project site for agricultural uses.each of these alternatives was considered economically infeasible,however,based on substantial evidence.
first,the draft eir analyzed a continued agriculture alternative to lease the entire project site for agricultural operations.under this scenario,the site was valued at million,less than its value of million.for this reason,the city concluded that leasing the entire site for agricultural purposes would be economically infeasible.in responses to comments in the final eir,the city also pointed out that the site could be used for dry farming and grazing once the egg farm facilities were removed and the site was remediated for hazardous materials.it was doubtful,however,that the low profit margins generated from such operations would be sufficiently profitable to pay the costs of removing the egg farm facilities or remediating the hazardous materials.
next,a general plan alternative would have constructed residences on lots in accordance with the county general plan.this alternative would have eliminated all agricultural uses on the site,while resulting in a financial loss of over million.similarly,the eir considered a limited development alternative alternative to construct residences on to lots on acres,while keeping essentially the same layout of roads,parks,and residential development as the proposed project.alternative would have resulted in a financial loss of over million,million more than the general plan alternative.
the eir also considered two alternatives involving continued agriculture uses on approximately acres of the site,namely,alternative development,and alternative development plan.in alternative,residences would have been built on to lots.alternative would have constructed residences on lots ranging in size from square feet to one acre.alternative was designed to eventually phase out the agricultural uses on the portion of the site.both alternatives involved placing a landscape buffer between the agricultural portion of the site and the residences.alternatives and would have resulted in financial losses of over million and million,respectively.
plaintiffs claim the eir is legally deficient because it did not analyze a sufficient range of project alternatives involving the construction of units,or any number of units between and,because this range was the only economically feasible range of housing units that would minimize the scsp significant agricultural impacts.we disagree.
as discussed,an eir is not required to address every imaginable project alternative.gilroy citizens for responsible planning city of gilroy,supra,th at.instead,it is required to analyze a reasonable range of alternatives that could feasibly reduce a project significant environmental impacts.goleta valley,supra,cal d at.ceqa establishes no categorical legal imperative as to the scope of alternatives to be analyzed in an eir.each case must be evaluated on its facts,which in turn must be reviewed in light of the statutory purpose.id.at.the key issue is whether the range of alternatives discussed fosters informed decisionmaking and public participation.laurel heights improvement regents of university of california,supra,cal d at guidelines,subds.a,f range of alternatives is governed by a rule of reason.
absolute perfection is not required what is required is the production of information sufficient to permit a reasonable choice of alternatives so far as environmental aspects are concerned.citation.village laguna of laguna beach,board of supervisors d,fourth,div.two,italics added.when an eir discusses a reasonable range of alternatives sufficient to foster informed decisionmaking,it is not required to discuss additional alternatives substantially similar to those discussed.preservation action council city of san jose th,mira mar mobile community city of oceanside th.the selection of alternatives discussed will be upheld,unless the challenger demonstrates that the alternatives are manifestly unreasonable and that they do not contribute to a reasonable range of alternatives.citation.california native plant society city of santa cruz th.
the eir is not legally deficient because it did not address a residential unit alternative or any of the imaginable alternatives involving the construction of anywhere between and residences,as plaintiffs claim.though one or more of these imaginable alternatives may have represented the optimum number of residences that could have profitably been built while minimizing the agricultural impacts of the project to the fullest extent possible,the range of alternatives discussed in the eir was sufficient to foster informed decisionmaking on this very question.
in its final form,the scsp proposed to build units on the project site at a net profit of million.by contrast,the general plan and limited development alternatives would have built only and residences and would have lost more than million and million,respectively.and neither of these alternatives would have reduced the scsp agricultural impacts to any extent,even if they could have been profitably built.by contrast,alternatives and would have set aside acres for agricultural use,at least in the,but would have lost over million and million,respectively,while constructing and residences of increasing densities on fewer than acres.
alternative comparatively lesser loss of over million indicated there may have been an alternative that would have been profitable and that would have,at least to some extent,reduced the scsp agricultural impacts.this alternative would have involved building some number of residences in excess of by increasing the density of some or all of the residences,setting aside fewer than acres for agricultural use,or both.but ceqa did not require the eir to analyze a alternative or any other alternatives along this continuum.the hypothetical alternative plaintiffs one that would maximize profit while reducing agricultural impacts to the fullest extent have been intelligently considered by studying the specifics and financial feasibility of the alternatives that were discussed.village laguna of laguna beach,board of supervisors,supra,d at.
plaintiffs also argue the eir is legally deficient because it virtually ignores any agricultural uses besides egg ranching,but the eir belies this claim.the agricultural uses contemplated in alternatives and were by no means limited to egg ranching,but contemplated some type of agricultural use.indeed,by the time the revised eir was circulated in early,the egg ranch had ceased operating and was in the process of removing the egg ranch facilities from the project site.the city thus reasonably concluded that another limited development alternative not alternative that was considered in the draft eir and that involved continuing egg farm operations on part of the project site was no longer feasible.
finally,plaintiffs argue there is no evidence to support the city conclusion that all project alternatives involving agricultural uses only or a combination of agricultural uses and residential development were not economically feasible.again,we disagree.extensive financial analysis contained in the administrative record showed egg farming was no longer economically feasible on the project site,and each of the alternatives considered in the eir that involved using the site exclusively for some type of agricultural use or a combination of agricultural use and residential development would lose money and were therefore economically infeasible.
