introduction 
real parties in interest the city of long beach the city and its city attorney,robert shannon,sought records from petitioner the los angeles unified school district lausd relating to a school construction project.when lausd refused to release the records,the trial court issued an order compelling the production of documents under the california public records act cpra or the act,et in this petition for extraordinary relief,lausd seeks an order to stay the trial court order.
lausd contends that neither the city nor city attorney shannon is entitled to request the public documents because they are not persons within the meaning of the cpra.thus,we are called upon to address an issue left unresolved by the supreme court,whether a public agency is authorized to seek disclosure of public records in the possession of another public agency.filarsky superior court cal th,d.
we hold that the city and city attorney shannon may obtain public records from lausd.we deny the request for extraordinary relief and affirm the order of the trial court.
factual and procedural background 
the city is a municipal corporation.shannon is the duly elected city attorney and an officer of the city.
lausd wants to build a public high school on approximately acres within the city at its western boundary,even though the proposed school will serve students residing in the city of carson.the property currently is used for industrial purposes.
because the city expects that the school will have an impact on traffic,fire,and police services in its neighborhoods,city attorney shannon requested by letter dated january,copies of certain public records relating to the construction project.the request cited the cpra and asked for the production of categories of documents,including all correspondence between lausd and appointed and elected officials of the city of carson relating to site selection,location,and construction of the proposed high school,as well as copies of all projected busing patterns and busing studies related to the project.
on february,lausd acknowledged that the records being sought were public records under the cpra,but refused to produce them stating,we are unable to make those records available because this request is from a government agency,as opposed to a member of the public lausd asserted that the cpra did not confer local agencies or their officers such as city attorney shannon the right to inspect public records as they were not persons or members of the public under the act.
on february,city attorney shannon responded by letter to lausd stating,your analysis of lausd legal duty under the cpra is incorrect a ccess to information concerning the conduct of the people business is a fundamental and necessary right of every person in this state.city attorney shannon asserted that the city was entitled to the documents because it was a municipal corporation,and corporations were persons entitled to receive documents pursuant to cpra section,subdivision c.additionally,city attorney shannon stated he was entitled to the documents pursuant to section as an elected official who is attempting to carry out his duties as a representative of the city council,city management and the citizens of the city 
on april,the city filed a verified petition in the superior court for access to public records,seeking an order to direct lausd to turn over the requested documents,see fn.
following a hearing,the trial court granted the petition and directed lausd to produce the requested documents.thereafter,the trial court apparently ruled on the city request for attorney fees and costs and entered an august,judgment granting petition for access to public records against lausd.we construe the judgment as an order directing the disclosure of public records.
lausd has filed a petition in this court for extraordinary relief requesting a stay of the august,order directing production of the public records,subd.c.we stayed enforcement of the judgment and issued an order to show cause directing the parties to appear for argument on the issues raised in the petition.the city and city attorney shannon have filed an opposition and lausd has filed a reply.
discussion 
the only issue before us is whether the city and city attorney shannon have standing to request public records from lausd.the resolution of this issue turns on whether the city or city attorney shannon is entitled to inspect lausd records under the act.
the california public records act cpra.

in construing the cpra and other statutes,our fundamental task is to ascertain the legislature intent so as to effectuate the purpose of the statute.citation.we begin with the language of the statute,giving the words their usual and ordinary meaning.citation.the language must be construed in the context of the statute as a whole and the overall statutory scheme,and we give significance to every word,phrase,sentence,and part of an act in pursuance of the legislative purpose.citation.in other words,we do not construe statutes in isolation,but rather read every statute with reference to the entire scheme of law of which it is part so that the whole may be harmonized and retain effectiveness.citation.citation.if the statutory terms are ambiguous,we may examine extrinsic sources,including the ostensible objects to be achieved and the legislative history.citation.in such circumstances,we choose the construction that comports most closely with the legislature apparent intent,endeavoring to promote rather than defeat the statute general purpose,and avoiding a construction that would lead to absurd consequences.citation.smith superior court cal th,d.
the city is entitled to the public records.
lausd admits the documents requested are public records subject to disclosure and there is no exception precluding disclosure.lausd also admits it is a public agency from which public records can be sought.lausd contends,however,that neither the city,which is a municipal corporation,nor city attorney shannon,who is an elected officer,has a right to access lausd public records because they are not persons entitled to those records.
lausd argument is primarily focused on a strict examination of the statutory language.lausd argues as follows section grants every person the right to inspect public records person is defined in section,subdivision c to include any natural person,corporation,partnership,limited liability company,firm,or association this definition of person does not include a municipal corporation or an elected officer the words used in section to define a person are most commonly associated with private individuals and entities and only persons are entitled to request records and not local agencies nor elected officials.thus,neither the city nor city attorney shannon is entitled to the public records.
we first address the city standing to request the public records from lausd.thereafter,we address city attorney shannon standing to request the records and lausd argument that he is not a member of the public.
with regard to the city,lausd makes the following additional points had the legislature intended to include a municipal corporation in section,subdivision c definition of person it would have done so,as the legislature did in defining local agency in subdivisions a,d,and f of section and as it has done in a number of other statutes.see,code civ.the specific enumeration of governmental entities in one part of the statute,but not in another,weighs heavily against a conclusion that the legislature intended to include such entities in the definition of persons.wells learning foundation cal th,d,wells.in other contexts,the legislature has demonstrated that similar definitions of persons do not include public entities,and legislators know how to include such entities directly when they intend to do so,citing among others,the definition of person in fair employment and housing act,subd.d.a traditional rule of statutory construction is that,absent express words to the contrary,governmental agencies are not included within the general words of a statute.citations.wells,supra,at,d.
many of lausd arguments involve maxims of statutory construction which are helpful in understanding the meaning of statutes when the legislative intent is unclear.however,they can not override positive indicia of a contrary legislative intent.wells,supra,cal th at,d.to decipher a statute,we must not only examine its language,but also its structure and history.ibid.
we begin by recognizing that there is an exception to the traditional rule of statutory construction that absent express words to the contrary,governmental agencies are not included within the general words of a statute.that exception is g overnment agencies are excluded from the operation of general statutory provisions only if their inclusion would result in an infringement upon sovereign governmental powers pursuant to this principle,governmental agencies have been held subject to legislation which,by its terms,applies simply to any person.citations.citations.wells,supra,cal th at,d.
for example,in state of california marin mun.dist.cal d,a street and highways code provision defined person to include any person,firm,partnership,association,corporation,organization,or business trust and did not expressly include any governmental entities.however,a county was held subject to the statute and thus,the department of public works was entitled to order the county as a person to move its pipeline as necessary for public safety or highway improvement.cal d at.
thus,even though governmental agencies are not expressly included in section,subdivision c definition of a person,the city is to be included in that definition unless to do so would infringe upon sovereign powers.
lausd contends the city,as a governmental agency,is not to be included in the definition of person,and thus may not seek lausd public records because to do so would infringe upon one of the state most basic sovereign powers,public education.lausd suggests mandating it to disclose documents would unnecessarily divert funds away from its core educational function.this contention is unpersuasive.
as lausd acknowledges,it is mandated by section to make open for inspection and to copy public records upon the payment of fees to cover duplication costs,or a statutory fee,if applicable,unless it is impracticable to do so however,lausd suggests there are additional costs that divert funds from its core purpose of education when there is a disclosure request.lausd notes that in fulfilling a disclosure request under the act,it incurs expenditures in addition to the copying charges it will have to bear.these include nonreimbursable indirect costs in producing documents north county parents organization department of education th,d,attorney fees in responding to petitions seeking documents,subd.d rogers superior court th,d award of costs to public agency under cpra limited to actions where request is frivolous,and potentially the payment of the requesting party attorney fees if the court orders disclosure,subd.d motorola communication electronics,department of general services th,d.however,the nonreimbursable indirect costs are not significant in light of lausd constitutionally mandated governmental function to disclose public records.we perceive no infringement upon lausd sovereign governmental powers to include municipal corporations,such as the city,into the definition of persons in section.
additionally,we can not ignore the fact that if lausd incurs expenses in complying with the city request for public documents,such expenses are necessitated only because the city must fulfill its own sovereign purpose.the city believes a proposed lausd project may have a dramatic impact on the city citizens,traffic,and fire and police services in its surrounding neighborhoods.in order to assess that impact and whether the city should take other protective measures,the city must be able to evaluate lausd proposal.
further,the ultimate purpose of the cpra is to encourage full disclosure and openness in governmental affairs.thus,one governmental entity should not hesitate to provide public records to another governmental entity.
our conclusion that the city is a person entitled to request documents from another governmental entity is the only rational and reasonable interpretation of the statute.where more than one statutory construction is arguably possible,our policy has long been to favor the construction that leads to the more reasonable result.citation.webster superior court cal d.this policy derives largely from the presumption that the legislature intends reasonable results consistent with its apparent purpose.citation.o ur task is to select the construction that comports most closely with the legislature apparent intent,with a view to promoting rather than defeating the statutes general purpose,and to avoid a construction that would lead to unreasonable,impractical,or arbitrary results.citations.copley press,superior court cal th,d.
we acknowledge that the statutory scheme is not a model of clarity,when applied to the factual situation before us.however,an absurd result would follow if we were to strictly construe sections and to preclude the city from obtaining documents from lausd.
the following illustrates this absurdity the hypothetical john doe and mary doe residing in the city are considered natural persons pursuant to section,subdivision c.they can send a letter to lausd and request the same public documents that have been described by city attorney shannon in his january,letter.city attorney shannon mother,father,sister,and brother also are natural persons pursuant to section,subdivision c and thus,have a right to seek public records from lausd.in that lausd concedes that the records requested are public,lausd will have to comply with the requests from john doe and mary doe,as well as the requests of members of the hypothetical shannon family.once lausd provides the records,these persons can simply walk down the street to the office of any representative of the city,including city attorney shannon office,and drop the items on a desk.we must interpret the act broadly to require full agency disclosure unless information is statutorily exempted citation.times mirror superior court,supra,cal d at.we come to an absurd result and ignore the cpra strong policy in favor of disclosure of public records williams superior court cal th,d,if we conclude that all natural persons,including all city of long beach residents and all city attorney shannon family members are entitled to access the public records in lausd possession,but the city who is charged with conducting the city business,is not entitled to the very same records.
lausd construction of the cpra statutory scheme results in prohibiting one governmental entity from obtaining public records from another governmental entity is unduly restrictive.to construe the act in the manner articulated by lausd ignores its purpose of providing openness in governmental affairs brv,superior court,supra,th at,d,and contravenes the cpra purpose to provide m aximum disclosure of the conduct of governmental operations cbs,block,supra,cal d at,and to hold government agencies accountable by verifying their actions.brv,superior court,supra,at,d.
we will not adopt a narrow or restricted meaning of statutory language if it would result in an evasion of the evident purpose of a statute,when a permissible,but broader,meaning would prevent the evasion and carry out that purpose.citation.copley press,superior court,supra,cal th at,d.
thus,in defining persons,the legislature did not intend to exclude municipal corporations such as the city.
city attorney shannon is entitled to the records.
city attorney shannon also is entitled to access the records under the cpra.
as stated above,lausd contends that because the definition of person does not include an elected officer,city attorney shannon is not entitled to the documents.lausd argues that city attorney shannon is not a member of the public because section,subdivision b specifically exempts officers of local agencies and because section,subdivision a permits disclosure only if the records were being improperly withheld from a member of the public 
as quoted above,section provides that notwithstanding the definition of member of the public in section,an elected member or officer of any state or local agency is entitled to access to public records of that agency on the same basis as any other person.nothing in this section shall limit the ability of elected members or officers to access public records permitted by law in the administration of their duties.this section does not constitute a change in,but is declaratory of,existing law.italics added.
focusing on the word that in the first sentence of section,lausd contends elected members or officers are only entitled to records of their own agency.
to support this analysis,lausd points to the legislative history of cpra section,which was part of a senate bill designed to amend the cpra to require state and local agencies to provide electronic files.rules,off.of floor analysis,analysis of bill reg.sess.digest.senate floor analysis.the bill also amended or added other sections within the act,including adding section.the available legislative history of section available to us is scant.some documents,as noted by lausd,state that the bill was intended to assure that an elected member or officer of any state or local agency is entitled to access to public records of that agency on the same basis as any other person,and states this is declaratory of existing law.floor analysis,supra,at,italics added rules,reading analysis of bill reg.sess.the proposed change had been originally introduced in a prior bill that was vetoed by governor wilson for other reasons.see governor veto message on bill reg.sess.a senate judiciary analysis of the vetoed bill stated that the definition of member of the public had been used as a basis for withholding public records from elected officials and section would clarify the law by ensuring that an elected member or officer of any public agency has the same access rights to public records of that agency as any other person.judiciary analysis of bill reg.sess.march.
however,other documents in the legislative history of senate bill do not include any limitations and do not suggest the new statute was designed only to enable public officials to obtain documents from their own agencies.for example,one analysis of the bill states that section c larifies that public officials are entitled to access public records on the same basis as any other person.assem.com.on judiciary,analysis of bill reg.sess.june.another analysis indicates that the bill would provide that,notwithstanding the definition of member of the public,an elected official of any state agency is a member of the public entitled to public records.it would provide that this section is declaratory of existing law.rules,off.of floor analyses,reading analysis of bill reg.sess,in light of the sparse legislative history available to us and the conflict in the history on the crucial point,we can not conclude,as urged by lausd,that section,was designed to enable elected members or officers to access only public records only from their own agenc
