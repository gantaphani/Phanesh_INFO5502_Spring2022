the federal energy regulatory commission granted joseph keating a license to build a hydroelectric power plant in.at keating request,the commission stayed the statutory deadline for commencing construction on the project to allow keating to obtain the necessary water rights.over fifteen years after the license issued,the commission lifted the stay and keating license expired.keating now petitions for review of the commission decision to lift the stay,arguing that the record does not support the decision and that his reliance on the stay should estop the commission from lifting it.we deny the petition because keating was not entitled to an indefinite extension of the stay and the commission findings concerning the remaining hurdles to commencing construction were sufficient to support the denial of a further stay.
in july,the commission issued keating a license to develop his proposed tungstar project,a hydroelectric power plant in the inyo national forest in california.joseph keating,order issuing license,july.under the proposed project,a dam would divert water flowing from morgan creek and a nearby tungsten mine water treatment facility through a penstock to one kilowatt turbine generator.id.at.after exiting the powerhouse tailrace,the water would enter a,meandering channel where suspended mine water flocculants w ould settle out before the water would enter pine creek below its confluence with morgan creek.id.
under section e of the federal power act fpa,e,the united states forest service may impose conditions on the grant of a license on land within its jurisdiction.the forest service required keating to obtain a special use permit from the service before starting construction,which he did in november.that permit in turn required keating to obtain the necessary water rights before beginning construction.
section of the fpa,requires a licensee to commence construction of a newly licensed hydroelectric facility within two years of license issuance but allows the commission to extend the deadline once for a maximum of two additional years.if the licensee does not commence construction within the statutory time frame,then the license shall be terminated by the commission after notice to the licensee.see requiring days notice to the licensee before termination.nevertheless,the commission has stayed the deadline beyond the statutory period when a licensee was required to await necessary actions of other federal or state agencies,such as approval of plans,before commencing construction.irrigation,see,garry,kings river conservation,describing the commission authority to issue stays as deriving from section of the fpa,and section of the administrative procedure act.the commission stays the deadline only in these and similar narrowly circumscribed circumstances it will not grant a stay merely to relieve the licensee from the statutorily prescribed commencement of construction deadline.ronald rulofson,accord plant bd.of the city of augusta.
keating requested,and the commission granted,an extension of the deadline for two additional years as permitted under section.see joseph keating,order granting stay request in part and setting deadline for required filings,noting that the commission granted the extension in an unreported order issued april.on his last day to commence construction under the deadline,keating asked the commission to stay the deadline while he sought the necessary water rights.the commission granted a stay of the deadline and ordered keating to file annual reports on the status of his efforts to obtain water rights and satisfy the requirements of his forest service permit.id.at.the commission did not,however,stay the other requirements of keating license and advised keating that within six months of the stay order he must file a license amendment application necessitated by his proposed project redesigns and eleven outstanding plans,addressing topics such as erosion control and wildlife mitigation,some of which needed forest service approval in addition to commission approval.id.
seeking the water rights necessary to develop his project and satisfy his forest service permit,keating first argued to the forest service that he already had riparian rights to use the water.the forest service disagreed and directed keating to pursue appropriative water rights from the state or a special use permit for use of federal riparian rights.id.at.keating instead litigated against the forest service from through in an attempt to confirm the adequacy of his riparian rights.ultimately,the district court dismissed his suit,holding the forest service entitled to sovereign immunity,and the ninth circuit affirmed.see keating dep t of,wl cir unpub.
in,keating began seeking appropriative water rights by filing an application with the california state water resources control board water board.his application elicited protests from twelve entities all but creek eventually dismissed.pine creek mine owned the mine that discharged some of the water keating tungstar project proposed to use and also held its own ferc permit for a proposed hydroelectric project.of concern to the water board was the fact that pine creek mine owned the property encompassing the proposed diversion point for keating project.in accordance with state regulations,the water board required keating to demonstrate his ability to secure the necessary right of access over the land before it would approve his application.see cal.admin.code tit,when the owner will not consent,the board may require satisfactory evidence of the applicant ability through condemnation proceedings or otherwise to secure the necessary right of access before the application will be approved.keating argued that,as a ferc licensee,the fpa gave him authority to condemn the land and claim the diversion point property.see.however,because keating had not attempted to acquire the necessary property rights,the water board advised keating that it would not move forward with his application until he provided information demonstrating that he had the ability to acquire the property and was actively pursuing obtaining it.although keating engaged in unsurprisingly unfruitful negotiations with pine creek mine,he has not taken any steps to acquire access to the diversion point property through condemnation.
during this time,keating sought numerous extensions of the deadline for filing the required plans and license amendment application,which extensions the commission continued to grant from through.in august,the commission sent keating a letter reminding him of the most recent extended deadline for those requirements coming up in november.the commission directed keating to respond and address why it should not lift the stay of the construction deadline in light of the fact that the stay had been in effect for seven years,the fact that keating had ample opportunity to secure the necessary property rights for th is project with no success,and his repeated failure to provide timely status reports as required by the stay order.letter from joseph morgan,director of division of hydropower,ferc,to joseph keating august.
keating missed the november deadline but requested a further extension in march,which the commission again granted.after corresponding with the commission in april,almost two years passed before keating filed another status report,in february.this report included some but not all of the required plans.the report included correspondence showing the forest service approved the filed plans,but the service later clarified that it believed its approval was not necessary because of keating pending ferc license amendment.keating,however,has not filed an amendment application with the commission.when,in april,the commission inquired why keating continued to resist filing the overdue amendment application to satisfy the commission requirement,he responded that his first priority was to obtain water rights.
the commission lifted the stay of the deadline for the tungstar project by order of september,and announced that,because the stay was requested on the day of the deadline,the project license would terminate immediately after t
