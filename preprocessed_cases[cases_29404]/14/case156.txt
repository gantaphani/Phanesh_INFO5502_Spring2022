plaintiff carolee laird brought this action in the united states district court for the district of maryland against redwood trust,llc and east redwood street,llc redwood trust.laird alleged that redwood trust violated the americans with disabilities act ada by failing to install an elevator in a nightclub it owned and operated.the district court granted summary judgment for redwood trust,and laird appealed.for the reasons stated,we affirm the judgment of the district court.
the building at issue was originally the headquarters of the mercantile safe deposit and trust company of baltimore,maryland.in,redwood trust bought the building and renovated it.in november,the building opened for business as a sushi and night club offering alcoholic beverages and live and recorded music 
the building,as renovated,has three levels a basement and a first and second level.the basement level,which was formerly the bank vault,is roughly square feet and consists of lounge space,a dance floor,and storage.at times,the basement level has its own music and entertainment separate from the first and second levels.at other times,the music played in the basement is the same as that played on the first and second levels.
the first level is located on the ground floor and is roughly square feet.it contains the sushi,separate bars for purchasing alcoholic beverages,lounge space and a dance floor.the entrances to the building are located on the first level.
the second level is roughly square feet and has a large opening in the center that provides a view of the dance floor on the first level below.the opening is rectangular,and its width is about of the width of the building.there is a lounge area on either side of the large opening,and the width of each lounge is about of the width of the building.the lounge areas are connected to each other by a walkway at one end and a bar at the other.the second level also has a disc jockey booth,a bar,and the owner office.patrons on the first and second levels listen to the same live or recorded music.there are no other floor levels above the second level.
carolee laird suffers from spina bifida.on december,she visited the redwood trust building.she could not access the basement or second level because the building does not have an elevator.on february,miss laird brought suit against redwood trust in the united states district court for the district of maryland alleging violations of the ada.she argued that the ada required redwood trust to install an elevator in the building.the district court granted summary judgment for redwood trust,holding that redwood trust was exempt from the requirement of installing an elevator because the building was fewer than three stories.miss laird appealed.
we review the district court grant of summary judgment de novo.bass dupont de nemours,cir.summary judgment is appropriate when the pleadings depositions,answers to interrogatories,and admissions on file,together with the affidavits,if any,show that there is no genuine issue as to any material fact and that the moving party is entitled to judgment as a matter of law.celotex catrett,d quoting.c.there is no genuine issue for trial if the record taken as a whole could not lead a rational trier of fact to find for the party.see matsushita indus.zenith radio,d.
the americans with disabilities act prohibits discrimination on the basis of disability in the full and equal enjoyment of the goods,services,facilities,privileges,advantages,or accommodations of any place of public accommodation.a.the ada defines discrimination with respect to renovations of a place of public accommodation as the failure to make alterations in such a manner that,to the maximum extent feasible,the altered portions of the facility are readily accessible to and usable by individuals with disabilities,including individuals who use wheelchairs.a.redwood trust concedes that laird is a qualified person with a disability,and that the building is a recently renovated place of public accommodation.
the ada provides a specific exemption from the requirement to make a place of public accommodation readily accessible to all disabled individuals.the exemption provides 
b elevator 
subsection a of this section shall not be construed to require the installation of an elevator for facilities that are less than three stories or have less than square feet per story unless the building is a shopping center,a shopping mall,or the professional office of a health care provider or unless the attorney general determines that a particular category of such facilities requires the installation of elevators based on the usage of such facilities.
b.the statute does not define story.however,the statute requires the attorney general to issue regulations to implement its provisions,including defining terms used in the statute,and we look to those regulations where the statute is silent.see olmstead ex rel.zimring,d b.in response to the requirements of b,the attorney general released the ada accessibility guidelines for buildings and facilities.pt,app.a.the guidelines define the term story as follows 
that portion of a building included between the upper surface of a floor and upper surface of the floor or roof next above.if such a portion of a building does not include occupiable space,it is not considered a story for purposes of these guidelines.there may be more than one floor level within a story as in the case of a mezzanine or mezzanines.
pt,app.a.the term mezzanine is defined as 
t hat portion of a story which is an intermediate floor level placed within the story and having occupiable space above and below its floor.
the district court held that the definition of mezzanine is imprecise and consequently difficult to apply to the facts of this case.laird redwood trust llc,d.the district court therefore looked beyond the plain language of the statute and interpreted the regulations using a pragmatic examination of the floor functional space and the services provided on the floor.laird,d at although we agree with the district court result,our reasoning is somewhat different.we construe the language in the statute and the regulatory guidelines to describe the second level as a mezzanine,and thus not a third story.
webster dictionary defines portion as an often limited part set off or abstracted from a whole.webster ninth new collegiate dictionary.intermediate is defined as being or occurring at the middle place,stage or degree or between extremes.webster ninth new collegiate dictionary.thus,by defining a mezzanine as t hat portion of a story which is an intermediate floor level,the guidelines distinguish a mezzanine from an ordinary floor level in two ways.pt,app.a.emphasis added.first,a mezzanine must be less than a story,as it is only a portion of one.second,a mezzanine must exist in the middle place or between extremes of a story because it is an intermediate level.
the definition also provides that a mezzanine must have occupiable space above and below its floor.pt,app.a.the word floor in this context refers to the physical barrier separating space between floor levels.the guidelines define a story as t hat portion of a building included between the upper surface of a floor and upper surface of the floor or roof next above.pt,app.a.when distinguishing a mezzanine from a separate story,however,the guidelines state that t here may be more than one floor level within a story as in the case of a mezzanine or mezzanines.pt,app.a emphasis added.a floor therefore is a physical separation of space,which contains an upper surface.a floor level,by contrast,refers not only to the physical barrier between levels,but also to the occupiable space above the upper surface of that barrier.thus,the bottom floor level of a building could not be a mezzanine because there is no occupiable space below its floor.however,the second level of a building,where there is occupiable space both below the floor lower surface the ceiling and above its upper surface,satisfies the guidelines requirement.
applying these definitions to the facts in this case,we are of opinion that the second floor level of the redwood trust building meets the definition of a mezzanine under the ada accessibility guidelines.first,the second level is less than a story by itself,because it has occupiable space only in the limited area around the large opening that allows patrons to view the dance floor below.second,the level is an intermediate floor level within a story because it is located between the first floor and the roof of the building.pt,app.a.finally,the second floor meets the literal regulatory definition of mezzanine by having occupiable space above and below its floor because there is occupiable space both on the first level below and on the second floor level itself.pt,app.a.therefore,we are of opinion and hold that the second level is a mezzanine within the meaning of the ada accessibility guidelines and summary judgment for redwood trust was appropriate.
laird also argues that redwood trust must provide elevator or lift access to the second floor under the ada accessibility guidelines applicable to restaurants and cafeterias pt,app.a.section provides that i n new construction,all dining areas shall be accessible.pt,app.a.however,i n alterations,accessibility to dining areas is not required provided that the same services and decor are provided in an accessible space usable by the general public and are not restricted to use by people with disabilities.pt,app.a.the term alteration is defined as a change to a building including remodeling,renovation,rehabilitation,reconstruction,historical restoration,changes or rearrangement of the structural parts or elements,and changes or rearrangement in the plan configuration of walls and partitions.pt,app.a.though redwood trust concedes that the renovations to the building were extensive,they are,nonetheless,renovations.there is no evidence in the record of any new construction all of the renovations involved changes to the existing structure to allow it to function as a restaurant and night club.we are of opinion that the lengthy set of terms defining alteration were intended to cover renovations,like those to the redwood trust building,that are extensive but did not involve new construction.see pt,app.a,accordingly,we find that the renovations to the redwood trust building were alterations under guideline and.we also find that the record shows no difference in the services or decor between the first and second floor dining areas.therefore,we find that the district court grant of summary judgment was proper 
in sum,we are of opinion that the language of the ada and the ada accessibility guidelines is properly construed so that the redwood trust building has fewer than three stories because the second floor is a mezzanine.we also find that the building does not violate the ada accessibility guidelines requirements for restaurants and cafeterias.therefore,although we need not rely upon the district court finding that the regulatory definitions are ambiguous,we agree that summary judgment was appropriate.see sec chenery.holding that a district court must be affirmed if the result is correct although we may rely upon a different reason 
accordingly,the judgment of the district court is 
i concur in the majority opinion but write separately to address the analysis of the dissenting opinion.the dissent would rewrite an unambiguous department of justice doj regulation.even more remarkably,the dissent would redraft this regulation by adding a specific provision that the doj clearly rejected.
the doj deliberately attempted to make its regulations consistent with model building codes whenever the dictates of the model codes were consistent with the purposes of the ada.july.despite its specific knowledge of the model codes,the doj adopted a definition of mezzanine substantially different from that of the model codes.the doj regulation defines mezzanine as 
that portion of a story which is an intermediate floor level placed within the story and having occupiable space above and below its floor.
pt,app.a.the model codes,on the other hand,define mezzanine as 
an intermediate level or levels between the floor and ceiling of any story with an aggregate floor area of not more than of the area of the room or space in which the level or levels are located.
international building code,emphasis added boca national building code,similar language.thus,the model codes contain an objective test under which a level can not be deemed a mezzanine if it is larger than of the area of the room in which it is located.the doj definition of mezzanine does not incorporate this test.
although the doj did not adopt this objective test from the model codes in its definition,it employed an almost identical phrase in another portion of its ada regulations governing new construction of dining areas.that regulation provides that an owner of a new building need not provide vertical access to a mezzanine if the area of mezzanine seating measures no more than percent of the area of the total accessible seating area.pt,app.a.thus,the doj obviously knew how to create a spatial test for determining issues of access but chose not to do so in its definition of mezzanine.
nevertheless,the dissent insists that this particular language in the model building codes creating the the doj be incorporated into the doj definition of mezzanine because the existing definition is a virtual nullity and does not helpfully define a mezzanine.i believe such a conclusion,especially under the facts of this case,is simply not correct.according to the doj definition,a mezzanine must be,among other things,a portion of a story and must be placed within the story.that is,a mezzanine can not be a story,but instead must be part of,and within,a larger story.
the dissent presumes that a floor,like one in a firehouse,with a hole cut out for a fire pole or a floor that has a drill hole is a mezzanine under the doj definition.the doj definition of mezzanine does not suggest such a conclusion.the floor that has a hole cut out for a fire as for a a separate story.that floor is not a portion of the lower story,and neither is that floor placed within the lower story.although the fire pole hole,like the staircase,connects the two floors,the two floors remain separate from each other.further,the existing definition of mezzanine is sufficient to draw a distinction between a floor that has a hole drilled in it and the type of floor involved in this the mezzanine is clearly a portion of and placed within the main story of the redwood trust building.
we are generally bound to construe a regulation according to the plain meaning of its unambiguous terms,and i concur with the majority because it faithfully does just that.the doj definition of mezzanine is not ambiguous,and based on the plain meaning of that definition the floor in question qualifies as a mezzanine.we are not free to write into the doj definition what is not there,but instead we should apply the definition as written to the facts before us.see maryland state dep t of ed.united states dep t of veterans affairs,cir giving effect to the plain meaning of a statute.
today the majority avoids the difficult task of interpreting the parameters of a poorly drafted regulation by interpreting it in a way that could not logically have been intended in doing so,the court disposes of the case before us,but creates a loophole in the ada that could have serious consequences in the future.i therefore respectfully dissent.
as an initial matter,i note that there is much in the majority opinion with which i agree.we agree that the key issue in this case is whether the elevator exemption of b applies to the redwood trust facility,specifically whether the second level of the facility is properly considered a story or a mezzanine.we also agree that a correct starting point for this determination is the department of justice doj regulations defining these two terms.see pt,app.a.most significantly,we agree that the district court functional analysis,which distinguishes a story from a mezzanine based upon the functions or activities that take place within it,is impractical and incorrect.such an approach would be virtually impossible to apply and has no basis in the regulations.howev
