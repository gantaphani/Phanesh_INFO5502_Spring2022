in an action for dangerous condition of public property,approval of an actual plan or design is required to establish the affirmative defense of government design immunity.t he public entity is immune from liability if placement of the object here,a pedestrian signal beacon was part of a plan or design which the entity reasonably gave its discretionary approval.citations.cordova city of los angeles cal th,djdar,which are not part of the approved plan or design and which are installed after the public works project is approved,do not come under the umbrella of design immunity.that is the case here.in addition,there are material triable issues of fact that a crosswalk street intersection was a dangerous condition of public property.we reverse the grant of summary judgment.
facts and procedural history 
on the afternoon of may,griselda castro,her two children diana and yazmin,and two other children in her care,alyson brito and emily brito were walking in the crosswalk at the intersection of live oak street and thousand oaks boulevard in thousand oaks.castro pressed the button to activate the pedestrian warning beacon before crossing thousand oaks boulevard and saw a vehicle stop in the westbound number two lane.pushing a baby stroller,castro and the children started to cross the street and were struck in the number one lane by a gmc safari van.the driver did not see the warning beacon or appellants.castro and the children flew into the air on impact,came to rest in the roadway,and sustained personal injuries.
city moving papers on the motion for summary judgment show that the crosswalk allows pedestrians to cross thousand oaks boulevard in a direction.thousand oaks boulevard is a four lane street with two eastbound lanes,two westbound lanes,and a center turn lane.vehicle traffic on live oak street is controlled only by a stop sign where it intersects thousand oaks boulevard in a t configuration.
between and,safety improvements were made to the as part of a city approved street rehabilitation project.the project plans,which were prepared by willdan engineering,called for the following improvements which were implemented pedestrian ahead warning signage on sidewalks posts in advance of the crosswalk a ped xing legend on the pavement regulating triangular yield lines painted on the street pavement,with yield here signage in front of a painted triple four crosswalk design with reflective markers and a yellow pedestrian sign with downward arrow at the crosswalk.a pedestrian warning beacon was listed in the project plans but removed from the plans when the city council approved the street rehabilitation project.thus,there was no council approval of the warning beacon.
after the project was completed in,city engineer,jay spurgin,authorized traffic engineering division manager john helliwell to purchase and install the pedestrian warning beacon.
summary judgment 
city claimed that the city engineer had discretionary authority to approve the beacon warning design and that the complaint was barred by the design immunity provisions of section.
appellants opposed the summary judgment motion on the theory that the warning beacon was not part of the approved project design.appellants also claimed there were triable facts that the was a dangerous condition.appellant highway and traffic expert,edward ruzak,declared that the was dangerous due to the volume of vehicular and pedestrian traffic,high traffic speed,road width and parking lanes,adjacent commercial driveways,roadway visual distractions,an obscured crosswalk warning sign,the length of the crosswalk,and the beacon warning.
the trial court ruled that the action was barred by the design immunity statute and that the warning beacon represents an additional safety feature for the crosswalk.that does not reduce the safety of the plan or design.rather it increases the safety of the intersection design.to make the city liable for adding extra safety features,defies logic and reasonable application of the design immunity.
design immunity 
we review the order granting summary judgment de novo.merrill navegar,cal th.section,subdivision b provides that a public entity is liable for injury proximately caused by the dangerous condition of its property if the dangerous condition created a reasonably foreseeable risk of the kind of injury sustained,and the public entity had actual or constructive notice of the condition a sufficient time before the injury to have taken preventative measures.cornette department of transportation cal th.
a public entity may avoid liability by raising the affirmative defense of design immunity.cornette department of transportation,supra,cal th at.section provides in pertinent part neither a public entity nor a public employee is liable under this chapter for an injury caused by the plan or design of a construction of,or improvement to public property where such plan or design has been approved in advance of the construction or improvement by the legislative body of the public entity or by some other body or employee exercising discretionary authority to give such approval or where such plan or design is prepared in conformity with standards previously so approved italics added.in order to establish design immunity,city must show a causal relationship between the plan or design and the accident,discretionary approval of the plan or design before the construction or improvement,and substantial evidence supporting the reasonableness of the plan or design.cornette department of transportation,supra,cal th at.the first two elements,causation and discretionary approval of the design,are resolved as issues of law if the facts are undisputed.alvis county of ventura th.
city argues that the city engineer had discretionary authority to approve the warning beacon addition.thousand oaks city municipal code section,entitled city engineer authority,provides,in pertinent part b the city engineer shall place and maintain,or cause to be placed and maintained,all other traffic control devices where,in the opinion of the city engineer,such official control devices are necessary to protect the public safety.appellants contend that the city engineer discretionary authority to place and maintain traffic control devices does not include the authority to approve a traffic control plan or design within the meaning of california design immunity jurisprudence.we agree with appellants.
the moving papers state that the city engineer authorized traffic engineering manager john helliwell to purchase the warning beacon and issue a work order for its installation.but no warning beacon plan or design was approved in advance of the construction or improvement.the trial court recognized this problem and ordered the parties to brief the issue of whether the city engineer had the discretionary authority to approve the round beacon if he did,where did that authority come from based on what legal source city identified no legal source other than thousand oaks city municipal code section b.
former city engineer jay spurgin,now director of public works,declared that he researched the issue and determined that the city engineer was vested with the discretionary authority to determine,design,plan and direct the placement of traffic control signals including pedestrian beacons that does not change california law.section b of the city of thousand oaks municipal court vests the city engineer with the authority to place and maintain,or cause to be placed and maintained traffic control devices the city engineer believes are necessary to protect public safety.it does not expressly grant the city engineer discretionary authority to approve the plan or design for a traffic control device.
in a second declaration,spurgin states if an expenditure is within a department financial discretion,it can be approved of within a department and does not need to go before the city council.flashing beacons,such as the flashing beacon in place on may,its recommendation,design,and usage,were within helliwell authority as traffic engineering division manager.former traffic engineering division manager john helliwell declared that he was authorized to
