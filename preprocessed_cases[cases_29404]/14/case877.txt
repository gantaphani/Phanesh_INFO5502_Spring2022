introduction 
appellant sagi plumbing is a plumbing contractor.respondent chartered construction corporation is a general contractor.respondent hired appellant to work as a subcontractor on several projects.appellant filed suit against respondent for breach of contract based on respondent failure to pay on three unrelated projects.the parties agreed to bifurcate the action and to try first the cause of action arising out of one project.after that trial was completed,appellant did nothing to bring the other causes of action to trial other than to file a notice of trial and attend a status conference.the trial court granted respondent motion to dismiss the two remaining causes of action based upon appellant failure to bring them to trial within five years.code civ.
on this appeal,the issue is whether there was a partial trial of the lawsuit for purposes of the statute because trial had been conducted on the one unrelated cause of action.we conclude that the first trial did not constitute a trial for the purposes of the remaining causes of action because each concerned a different and unrelated construction project.we also find that no theory of tolling can excuse appellant failure to bring the two causes of action to trial within five years.we therefore affirm the order of dismissal.
factual and procedural background 
on december,appellant filed suit against respondent for breach of contract.appellant alleged three separate causes of action based upon different construction projects the hollywood bowl project,the inglewood high school project,and the torrance high school project.
on june,the parties filed a stipulation that their case was related to and now consolidated with several other lawsuits filed against respondent by,inter alia,other subcontractors who had worked on the hollywood bowl project.the stipulation recites each of the aforementioned actions involves common questions of law and fact,and separate proceedings would involve duplication of effort by the court and the parties involved.the lead case in the consolidated action was the lawsuit filed by engineering,against respondent.
in march,the superior court appointed a referee to hear evidence and make a report on various issues in the consolidated action.the parties stipulated that the statute would be tolled for the period march,through the date of referee final report.
on january,the referee filed his report.
on february,the parties executed a stipulation to bifurcate the two causes of action arising out of the inglewood high school and torrance high school projects from the remainder of this consolidated action.they further stipulated that the two causes of action may be tried after the remainder of this action and by bench trial.
on march,trial commenced in the consolidated action.trial concluded on june.
on september,the parties executed a stipulation which reads whereas it has already been ordered by the court upon stipulation of the parties that the second and third causes of action of the complaint are bifurcated from the remainder of this consolidated action and,whereas the remaining portions of this consolidated case have been tried and judgment is to be entered the parties to this stipulation further agree and stipulate that the second and third causes of action of the sagi plumbing action may be severed from the remainder of this action and tried separately.at the subsequent hearing on the motion to dismiss,counsel for appellant gave this explanation for the severance after the main case regarding the hollywood bowl project went to verdict,the to get a judgment my part of the case prevented a judgment from being entered,and as a convenience to respondent,the other parties,it was severed and set for a further trial date,a continued trial date.
on october,the court ordered severance pursuant to the parties stipulation.
on october,appellant filed notice of trial.
on march,appellant attended a status conference.trial on the two severed causes of action was set for july.
on june,respondent moved to dismiss for failure to commence trial within five years.in light of the parties march stipulation that the statute would be tolled during the reference,the period to commence trial had expired in october.
appellant opposition urged that trial had commenced within five years because trial on the consolidated action arising out of the hollywood bowl project began in march before the two causes of action were formally severed from the lawsuit.appellant offered no explanation as to why it had not yet commenced trial on those two causes of action.in particular,appellant did not argue it had been impossible,impractical or futile to commence trial.
the trial court granted the motion to dismiss.its minute order states plaintiff has provided no authority for the argument that a bifurcated proceeding on separate causes of action for separate construction projects survives the rule under code of civil procedure section.there is no showing,either,that the prosecution of these claims was tolled,stayed or otherwise rendered impossible,impractical or futile.
discussion 
section provides an action shall be brought to trial within five years after the action is commenced against the defendant.section,subdivision a provides an action shall be dismissed by the court on motion of the defendant if the action is not brought to trial within the time prescribed in this article.the statute serves to prevent prosecution of stale claims where defendants could be prejudiced by loss of evidence and diminished memories of witnesses and to protect defendants from the annoyance of having unmeritorious claims against them unresolved for unreasonable periods of time.citations.lewis superior court d.
in reviewing the lower court dismissal of an action for failure to prosecute,the burden is on appellant to establish an abuse of discretion.citation.we will not substitute our opinion for that of the trial court unless a clear case of abuse is shown and unless there is a miscarriage of justice.citation.mitchell frank howard memorial hospital th,d.
appellant opening brief frames the issue as follows the issue here is not whether trial was impossible,impracticable or futile,but whether a trial actually commenced.appellant therefore adheres to the position it advanced in the trial court the statute was satisfied when trial commenced on march,on the consolidated hollywood bowl action.consistent with that approach,appellant concedes that the february bifurcation did not in itself toll the five year statute.appellant still was required to proceed within five years.t he commencement of trial of the hollywood bowl cases satisfied the statute.in a similar vein,appellant states that the october severance had no effect on the five year statute,since it was already satisfied by the march commencement of trial.
trial has commenced within the meaning of the statute if there has been a determination of any contested issue of fact or law that brings the action to the stage where a final disposition can be made.lemaire,faunce katznelson cox d.
in re marriage of macfarlane lang th,d is instructive on the question of whether in a bifurcated proceeding trial has commenced within the meaning of the statute.the case was a marital dissolution action.the husband moved to bifurcate the proceedings and for judgment on the issue of dissolving the marriage.the court granted the motion to bifurcate.after the parties presented evidence,the court ordered termination of the marriage and reserved jurisdiction over all other issues.id.at,d.thereafter,the court conducted a contested evidentiary proceeding on and decided two of the major issues of property characterization over which it had reserved jurisdiction.id.at,d.five years after the wife had filed the petition to dissolve the marriage,the husband moved to dismiss the petition for failure to bring the matter to trial within five years.the trial court granted the motion and the wife appealed.id.at,d.
the court of appeal reversed.it found that even though issues still remained to be litigated and decided in the petition,trial had commenced because the court had conducted a partial trial on co
