introduction 
defendant harbor view community association hvca appeals from the trial court denial of hvca special motion to strike the libel cause of action pursuant to code of civil procedure section all further code references are to the code of civil procedure unless otherwise indicated.section,commonly referred to as the statute provides for a special motion to strike a cause of action against a person arising from any act of that person in furtherance of the person right of petition or free speech under the united states or california constitution in connection with a public issue,subd.b.
the complaint,filed by christopher ruiz ruiz and theresa collectively plaintiffs,alleges nine causes of action stemming from the denial by hvca architectural committee of plaintiffs conceptual plans to rebuild their house,which lies within the development subject to the hvca.in the libel cause of action,ruiz alone alleges two letters written by hvca attorney defamed him.the trial court denied hvca motion to strike the libel cause of action on the ground the letters did not come within the definition of an act in furtherance of a person right of petition or free speech under the united states or california constitution in connection with a public issue under section,subdivision e.
we hold the two letters were protected speech under subdivision e of section.ruiz failed to meet his burden of proving the second letter was defamatory and either letter had been published.ruiz requested relief from the stay imposed by section,subdivision g to conduct discovery on the issue of publication,but the trial court ruling on the motion made such discovery unnecessary.in light of our conclusions that both letters were protected under the statute and the second letter was not defamatory,we reverse and remand with directions for the trial court to reconsider ruiz request for discovery on the issue only of publication of the first letter.
in august,plaintiffs purchased a house on port margate street in newport beach.they intended to raze the existing house on the site and to construct a new house.
plaintiffs house was on one of over lots in a development governed by hvca,a nonprofit mutual benefit corporation.hvca was formed in to provide community services and recreational facilities for the general use,benefit and welfare of the owners of residential lots situated within that development.among its purposes was t o examine and approve plans and specifications for dwelling houses and other structures and improvements to be erected within the development or the modification,alteration thereon additions thereto.hvca board of directors the board is vested with the exercise of its corporate powers and with control over hvca business and affairs.
plaintiffs house was,as were the others in the harbor view development,subject to a declaration of covenants,conditions and restrictions cc r recorded on september,and thereafter amended several times.the cc r established architectural controls over the development enforced by an architectural committee appointed by the board.under the cc r,n o building,fence,wall or other structure shall be commenced,erected or maintained,nor shall any exterior addition to or change or alteration therein,including exterior colors,trim,windows,roofing,patio covers and antennas,be made until the plans and specifications showing the nature,kind,shape,height,materials and location of the same shall have been submitted to and approved in writing as to harmony of external design and location in relation to surrounding structures and topography by the architectural committee.
hvca promulgated architectural committee guidelines to provide a procedural and substantive basis for homeowner applicants to construct improvements within the community in a manner which is compatible and in harmony with the existing external design of homes in the community.the guidelines purposes are to maintain the existing architectural character of this community and to attain a continuity of design,which will help maintain appearance and enhance the overall value of all properties.the guidelines require,among other things,the total square footage of all structures on a lot to not exceed percent of the proposed flat pad area of the lot.
in february,plaintiffs submitted to the architectural committee conceptual plans to erect a new house on their lot.the committee reviewed the plans on march and recommended denying them.plaintiffs learned of the denial in a march,letter from jill schwalbe of villageway management,villageway,the property manager for hvca.by means of the letter,the architectural committee requested that plaintiffs submit revised plans and identified recommended modifications,including reduction of house size.the house plaintiffs had designed for the lot exceeded the maximum square footage permitted by the architectural guidelines by at least square feet.
the march letter requested plaintiffs to provide information to villageway and directed them to contact villageway with any questions or concerns.in response,ruiz had several telephone conversations with schwalbe.ruiz did not believe schwalbe provided a meaningful explanation for the committee denial of plaintiffs plans.according to the complaint,schwalbe told ruiz the architectural committee would approve plaintiffs plans if plaintiffs could establish that other houses in the development had similar designs,features,or materials,but the committee would not compromise regarding any issue relating to the square footage limitation or the manner of its computation.
ruiz attended the next architectural committee meeting to gain insight into the committee reasons for denying my architectural plans.he asked the committee why it rejected his plans and asked how he could bring the plans within the committee standards.one committee member asked ruiz if he was an attorney.ruiz responded by asking whether being an attorney would be held against him.no one responded.according to ruiz,the same committee member said if ruiz did not agree with the committee decision,he could sell his house or sue his architect.ruiz was asked to put all of his questions to the committee in writing.ruiz contends he tried to attend subsequent architectural committee meetings,but was told the meetings were open only to those with business before the committee because homeowners prefer the privacy of these closed meetings.
ruiz attended the board meeting on june,to discuss the rejection of his architectural plans.the board also told ruiz to put any questions in writing and advised him the board intended to enforce the architectural standards as written in the guidelines.
ruiz prepared a letter to the architectural committee and the board dated july,regarding the denial of the plans and expressing the hope that an understanding and an agreement can be reached.the letter asserted the architectural committee decisions were largely arbitrary and capricious,based not upon an objective set of established criteria but upon subjective sensibilities of the committee members and the committee applied the same subjective preferences as a basis for rejecting many of the items contained in our application.the letter claimed the architectural committee had engaged in activity which was inequitable,unreasonable and improper by failing to consistently apply the percent restriction of the guidelines asserted the board had changed the architectural guidelines without notice to the homeowners and expressed grave concerns that these actions taken by the architectural committee and board of directors may expose the association to serious liability and potential damages.
the july letter requested,i n a good faith effort to establish a dialogue,that the architectural committee respond to requests for information,including production of the homeowner membership log.plaintiffs made additional requests for information from the board in a letter dated july.
hvca attorney,martin lee,responded to ruiz in a letter dated july,the july letter.the second paragraph of the july letter,which ruiz claims was libelous,stated in full initially,let me tell you how reprehensible i find it that you,as an attorney and a member of the state bar of california,while attempting to conceal your superior legal knowledge and education as an attorney,undertook to negotiate,monitor,observe,harangue,cajole and intimidate laypersons the directorship and architectural committee of the harbor view community association who you knew had no knowledge of your superior skill and knowledge as an attorney and member of the state bar.your only apparent defense to this reprehensible conduct is recited by you in your letter of july,to the effect that,when asked by the laypersons involved if you were an attorney,you refused to directly answer the query and asked if being a lawyer would be held against you.such conduct by a member of the bar is simply unconscionable.state law requires an attorney to be this is especially the case when he or she is dealing with laypersons business and professions code.as officers of the court,attorneys have a duty to deal honestly and fairly with others gionis superior court.you have egregiously violated these duties.the july letter then responded to various assertions ruiz made in the july letter.
ruiz responded to the july letter in a letter dated july.the july letter denied the accusation that ruiz had breached his ethical duties,accused the board of embark ing upon a course of action which only seems to make litigation inevitable,requested the board to provide copies of various documents and records,and asked the board to review the architectural committee decision regarding plaintiffs plans.lee and ruiz continued to trade sharply worded correspondence for the next several months,culminating in an october,letter the october letter from lee.
ruiz claims the following portions of the october letter were libelous i have been advised that you attend every single meeting of the board of directors and sit there taking what appear to be copious notes of ostensibly everything being said by everyone.while you have a right under civil code to attend directors meetings,you seem to be the only member of the harbor view community association who has ever so fully availed himself of this right.contrary to what you further say in your letter,the board of directors has spent the better part of the past six months answering your questions most of which are set forth in extremely verbose written correspondence.the directors of the harbor view community association are all unpaid volunteer homeowners.you are not the only member of the harbor view community association and your endless queries most of which appear completely frivolous are becoming more and more like the shakespearian pound of flesh that you feel you are entitled to as revenge for the ostensible temerity of the association architectural committee in not approving your architectural plans.when your architectural application was rejected,the architectural committee informed you specifically and in writing why it was being denied principally because the proposed home exceeded the maximum square footage allowed.since that time,you have made absolutely no attempt to resubmit modified plans that make the proposed home compliant with the existing architectural guidelines.instead,you have devoted an inordinate amount of time harassing the harbor view community association directorship with cockamamy sic document inspection requests and virtually stalking and staring down the directors at their regularly scheduled meetings.for you to infer that somehow the harbor view community association has been unfair to you is like the tea kettle calling the coffee pot black.fn.omitted.
proceedings in the trial court 
plaintiffs filed this lawsuit in july.their complaint alleges nine causes of action against hvca and seeks,among other things,a declaration that the denial of their conceptual plans was improper,unequitable sic,unreasonable,arbitrary and in bad faith and that hvca is barred or estopped from enforcing the architectural guidelines.the sixth cause of action,brought only by ruiz,seeks damages for libel and alleges the july letter and the october letter are libelous on their face.
on september,hvca filed its motion although directed particularly to the sixth cause of action,the motion moved to strike all such causes of action pleaded against defendant arising out of acts by defendant in furtherance of its right of petition or free speech in connection with a public issue.after filing opposition,ruiz applied ex parte for relief from the discovery stay imposed by section,subdivision g to conduct discovery related to his libel cause of action.the record does not include a ruling on the application.
on december,the trial court denied the motion on the ground hvca failed to meet its burden of making a prima facie showing that the two letters which form the basis for plaintiffs sic libel claim are covered by ccp section.hvca timely appealed.
statutory framework 
section provides for a special motion to strike a cause of action against a person arising from any act of that person in furtherance of the person right of petition or free speech under the united states or california constitution in connection with a public issue,subd.b.the legislature enacted the statute to protect defendants,including corporate defendants,from interference with the valid exercise of their constitutional rights,particularly the right of freedom of speech and the right to petition the government for the redress of grievances.schoendorf registry,th,d.
in analyzing a section motion,the court engages in a process.first,the court decides whether the defendant has made a threshold showing that the challenged cause of action is one arising from protected activity.equilon enterprises consumer cause,cal th,d.the moving defendant meets this burden by showing the act underlying the plaintiff cause of action comes within section,subdivision b.equilon enterprises consumer cause,supra,at,d.if the defendant meets this initial burden,the burden then shifts and the plaintiff must show a probability of prevailing on the claim.ibid.the plaintiff must demonstrate the complaint is both legally sufficient and is supported by a prima facie showing of facts sufficient to sustain a favorable judgment if the evidence submitted by the plaintiff is given credit.navellier sletten cal th,d.
we review de novo whether section protects the subject speech and whether ruiz demonstrated a probability he would prevail on his libel cause of action.nagel twin laboratories,th,d.
ii.did the july letter and the october letter constitute acts in furtherance of hvca right of petition or free speech in connection with a public issue 
a defendant can meet his or her burden by demonstrating the acts underlying the plaintiff cause of action fit within one of the categories of section,subdivision e.city of cotati cashman cal th,d.section,subdivision e defines an act in furtherance of the defendant right of petition or free speech in connection with a public issue to include any written or oral statement or writing made before a legislative,executive,or judicial proceeding,or any other official proceeding authorized by law any written or oral statement or writing made in connection with an issue under consideration or review by a legislative,executive,or judicial body,or any other official proceeding authorized by law any written or oral statement or writing made in a place open to the public or a public forum in connection with an issue of public interest or any other conduct in furtherance of the exercise of the constitutional right of petition or the constitutional right of free speech in connection with a public issue or an issue of public interest.
the july letter and the october letter,we conclude,fall within section,subdivision e which encompasses conduct in furtherance of the exercise of the constitutional right of petition or free speech in connection with an issue of public interest in averill superior court th,d,a panel of this court concluded the statute protects private conversations regarding a public issue.averill was decided before the legislature added subdivision e to section,but lends support to the supposition that subdivision e is intended to cover private communications on public issues.wilbanks wolk th,fn,d.section,therefore,governs even private communications,so long as they concern a public issue.id.at,d see also terry davis community church th,d subdivision e applies to private communications concerning issues of public interest.
private letters,such as the july letter and the october letter,are similar to private conversations and should be afforded the same protection.do the july letter and the october letter concern a public issue or an issue of public interest 
public interest within the meaning of the statute has been broadly defined to include,in addition to government matters,private conduct that impacts a broad segment of society that affects a community in a manner similar to that of a governmental entity.du charme international brotherhood of electrical workers th,d du charme.in that case,the court held a statement posted on a labor union local web site stating the local business manager had been removed for financial mismanagement did not come within section,subdivision e because the statement was not made in connection with an issue under consideration,the business manager having already been removed.du charme,supra,th at,d.the web site statement did not come within section,subdivision e or,the court held,because the statement was not made in connection with a public issue or an issue of public interest.ducharme,supra,at,d.
in concluding the web site statement did not fall within section,subdivision e or,the court in du charme held that in order to satisfy the public of public interest requirement of section,subdivision e and of the statute,in cases where the issue is not of interest to the public at large,but rather to a limited,but definable portion of the public a private group,organization,or community,the constitutionally protected activity must,at a minimum,occur in the context of an ongoing controversy,dispute or discussion,such that it warrants protection by a statute that embodies the public policy of encouraging participation in matters of public significance.du charme,supra,th at,d.the du charme court did not determine what limitations there might be on the size nature of a particular group,organization,or community,in order for it to come within the rule we enunciate today.ibid.
we agree with the analysis of du charme and find it applicable here.when the july letter and the october letter were written,plaintiffs and hvca were involved in ongoing disputes over approval of plaintiffs conceptual plans,the application of hvca architectural guidelines,and plaintiffs demands for information and documents.those disputes were of interest to a definable portion of the public,namely,the members of hvca,because they would be affected by the outcome of those disputes and would have a stake in hvca governance.ruiz conduct at hvca board meetings and interaction with board members affected hvca governance and therefore would also be of interest to community members.the residents of over lots were part of hvca,a large enough group to come within the requirements of du charme.the july letter and the october letter were written in the context of the disputes between plaintiffs and hvca,were part of the ongoing discussion over those disputes,and contributed to the public debate on the issues presented by those disputes.wilbanks wolk,supra,th at,d.
ruiz argues there was no issue under consideration by the board when the july letter and the october letter were written because plaintiffs conceptual plans were denied in march.in denying the plans,the architectural committee asked plaintiffs to submit new plans addressing the committee concerns.the controversy over the plans continued for months,and evolved into a controversy over hvca governance,as ruiz challenged the architectural committee decisions,accused the committee of arbitrarily enforcing the architectural guidelines,asked hvca to address various issues,and requested information and documents from the board.ruiz july,letter expressed a desire to commence a dialogue with the board the july letter and the october letter were written by hvca attorney acting on behalf of hvca the board and were part of the requested dialogue.
damon ocean hills journalism club th,d damon supports our conclusion the july letter and the october letter concerned matters of public interest.in damon,several members of a homeowners association wrote letters published in the association newsletter and made statements at association board meetings criticizing the association manager.id.at,d.the court of appeal held the statements fell within section,subdivision e because they were made in public forums the newsletter and the board meetings and in connection with an issue of public interest damon,supra,th at,d.the statements concerned the issues whether the association should switch to a professional management company and the manager competence to manage the association.id.at,d.those issues were of public interest to association members because they concerned the very manner in which this group of more than individuals would be inherently political question of vital importance to each individual and to the community as a whole.ibid.
granted,the connection between the statements and the public interest in this case is more attenuated than in damon.here,plaintiffs requests for information and documents,and ruiz conduct at board meetings,could be seen as private disputes between plaintiffs and the board,or as an effort to gather ammunition for another round of private controversy weinberg feisel,supra,th at,d.but those activities are related to and arise out of the architectural committee denial of plaintiffs conceptual plans,and concern the issue whether the architectural guidelines had been evenhandedly enforced,a matter of concern to hvca members.the focus and primary purpose of the letters concerned hvca governance and enforcement of its architectural guidelines,issues of concern to the many hvca members.
the july letter and the october letter are neither tactful nor productive.the writer would have been wise to heed anthony trollope advice that no angry letter be posted till hours will have elapsed since it was written.trollope,the bertrams vol,ch.but affording the july letter and the october letter protection furthers the statute policy of encouraging public participation in matters of public interest.accordingly,the trial court erred in concluding hvca failed to meet its burden of establishing the allegedly defamatory letters came within section,subdivision e.we turn then to the issue whether ruiz met his burden of establishing a probability of prevailing on the libel cause of action.
iii.did ruiz show a probability of prevailing on the libel cause of action 
ruiz,to meet his burden of showing a probability of prevailing on the libel cause of action,had to make a prima facie showing of facts that would,if proven,support a judgment in his favor.nagel twin laboratories,supra,th,d.
ruiz met his burden of making a prima facie showing the july letter was libelous,but the october letter was nonactionable hyperbole,epithet,and metaphor.
libel is a false and unprivileged publication by writing,printing,or other fixed representation to the eye,which exposes any person to hatred,contempt,ridicule,or obloquy,or which causes him to be shunned or avoided,or which has a tendency to injure him in his occupation.the sine qua non of recovery for defamation is the existence of falsehood.letter carriers austin,d.a statement is libel on its face if it is defamatory of the plaintiff without the necessity of explanatory matter,such as an inducement,innuendo or other extrinsic fact.
ruiz alleged the july letter and the october letter are libelous on their face.he argues the july letter falsely accused him of behaving unconscionably,violating his ethical obligations as an attorney,and bullying and deceiving the board members and the october letter falsely accused him of committing the crime of stalking.hvca counters that the letters express nonactionable opinions,hyperbole,and metaphor.
