this is a review of a decision of the occupational safety and health review commission oshrc assessing a civil penalty against lakeland enterprises of rhinelander,for willful violation of a,which requires that workers in excavation trenches be protected from.lakeland argues that the evidence collected at its excavation site should have been suppressed because the surprise inspection by a compliance officer from the occupational safety and health administration osha was conducted without a warrant.lakeland also challenges the administrative law judge alj exclusion of certain expert testimony and attacks the sufficiency of the evidence regarding the code violation and the alj finding of willfulness.we deny the petition for review.
background 
lakeland is a northern wisconsin sewer and water contractor.in august the company was engaged in an excavation project to install sewer and water lines on a public street in the mill creek industrial park development in marshfield,wisconsin.the citation at issue here arose from an august impromptu inspection conducted by chad greenwood,an osha compliance officer who was driving by the industrial park project and noticed the excavation in progress.greenwood parked his car,walked past some traffic cones blocking street traffic from the site,and observed lakeland employee ron krueger excavating a trench with a backhoe.greenwood also observed another lakeland employee,tony noth,working at the bottom of the trench.the trench contained neither a ladder nor a trench box,a device used to prop up the walls and prevent collapse.
greenwood began videotaping the scene,at which point jim gust,the project superintendent,asked him to step back and informed him that the road was closed.greenwood explained that he was an osha compliance officer and indicated the nature of the inspection while gust and greenwood were speaking,noth began climbing up one of the walls of the trench.greenwood observed loose dirt falling back into the trench,apparently unsettled by noth feet as he scaled the slope.krueger later admitted that he knew noth was not supposed to be working in the trench and that he failed to remove him.after noth climbed out of the trench,krueger told him he should not have been working in the trench without a trench box.krueger then resumed the excavation.
the slope of the trench walls concerned greenwood.sloping is a method of protecting employees from by excavating to form sides of an excavation that are inclined away from the excavation so as to prevent.b.eyeballing the trench,greenwood believed the walls were too steep and there was a fair chance they could collapse.greenwood measured the slope of the trench walls and recorded a west wall slope of degrees,an east wall slope of degrees,a north wall slope of degrees,and a south wall slope of degrees after greenwood left,lakeland employees measured the trench wall slopes and produced a different result for the south wall only lakeland measurement found the south wall to be sloped at degrees.
greenwood also measured the length and width of the trench at the surface and found that it was approximately feet wide,east to west,and feet long.however,because krueger had widened the trench in the process of grooming it after noth climbed out,the measurement overstated the width of the trench at the time noth was in it.greenwood testified the grooming process added about feet to the width of the trench.lakeland contended the trench was actually feet wide and feet long.there is no dispute the trench was approximately feet deep and feet wide at the bottom.
in addition to his other measurements,greenwood also took soil samples.not all soil is the same,and different types of soil will behave differently under the pressure of holding up a trench wall.see globe contractors,herman,cir.for instance,a trench dug in firm clay will hold up better than a trench dug in loose,sandy soil.in addition to the composition of the soil,several other factors contribute to soil relative stability,including water saturation levels,fissures,and previous digging in the soil.osha recognizes such soil differences by classifying soil into several categories.type a soil is the most stable,followed by types b and osha regulations allow trenches dug in type a soil to be sloped up to degrees horizontal to vertical walls dug in type b soil may be sloped no steeper than degrees horizontal to vertical,and in type c soil no steeper than degrees horizonal to vertical.see,subpt.p,app.
greenwood soil samples came from a spoil pile a pile of soil that had been removed from the trench.his field tests found the soil was type b.he also sent two soil samples to an osha lab,which classified one sample as type b and the other as type c.after greenwood left the site,krueger took his own soil samples and sent them to a private engineering firm,sts consultants the firm classified the soil as type later,when the trench had been filled in,sts took samples which it determined to be both type a and b soil.
based on the soil samples and greenwood measurements of both the soil quality and the trench dimensions,osha office in madison,wisconsin,issued three citations to lakeland,including the citation at issue on this permitting an employee to work in a trench without adequate protection inadequately sloped trench walls,in violation of a lakeland timely contested the citations,see c,and an alj conducted a evidentiary hearing.lakeland moved to suppress the evidence from the inspection,asserting that greenwood search of the excavation site violated the fourth amendment because it was conducted without a warrant.the alj denied the motion,concluding that lakeland had no right of privacy on the excavation site because that land and that road was a public road that they lakeland did not own,and further that it was covered by the open fields doctrine.the alj also concluded that any fourth amendment claim was waived because lakeland did not object to the inspection and ask for a warrant at the site.
on the merits,lakeland disputed both the soil type and the dimensions and slope of the trench,and also maintained that any violation of a was not willful because it had a safety program in place and had attempted to comply in good faith with the applicable regulations.greenwood testified for the secretary of labor.the secretary also called three expert witnesses two osha soil analysts and an osha engineer.krueger,gust,and lakeland president gary taylor testified for lakeland.the company also presented the testimony of thomas,a soil engineer at sts consultants harry butler,a safety consultant and a union operating engineer familiar with lakeland jobsites.the alj affirmed all three citations and held that the trench wall violation was willful.
the alj rejected the testimony of krueger,gust,and taylor as neither credible nor plausible,and accepted the secretary evidence regarding soil type and trench dimensions over the evidence produced by lakeland tests and measurements.the alj found the testing done by lakeland after the inspection was nothing more than a reconstruction of the facts,and concluded that greenwood measurements and soil tests,which were contemporaneous with the alleged violation,more accurately reflected both the trench dimensions and its soil classification.the alj also held lakeland violation of the trench wall safety regulation was willful because greenwood videotape depicted a deep,dangerous trench with steep sides,with visibly running soil krueger and gust were trained supervisory personnel with years of trenching experience and were aware of noth improper presence in the trench and lakeland had a history of trenching citations.the alj assessed a penalty of.lakeland petitioned for discretionary review by the occupational safety and health review commission.review was declined,the alj decision became the final order of the commission,and lakeland sought review in this court.see c,a,j.
ii.discussion 
fourth amendment 
lakeland argues that greenwood warrantless inspection violated the fourth amendment and that the evidence seized in the inspection should have been suppressed.the alj denied lakeland suppression motion,concl
