the town of winthrop,which is located next to boston logan international airport logan,and two local residents one from winthrop and one from east boston petition this court for review of a federal aviation administration faa order permitting the construction of a new taxiway at the airport.they argue primarily that the faa acted arbitrarily and capriciously in deciding that it did not need to prepare a supplemental environmental impact statement before issuing this final order.
petitioners concerns,as we understand them,may be grouped under three major themes.the faa has concluded that the new taxiway,along with other previously approved projects,will ease congestion at the airport,reducing the amount of time planes spend idling on the airfield and causing an overall reduction in noise and air pollution.even if that were so,petitioners fear that the faa solution for reducing delay will lead to greater use of logan,which in the long run will lead to more,not less,adverse environmental impacts.
second,they fear that the faa has not used the most current data or methodologies available,which may cast doubt on the agency benefits analysis.
third,they say that public health studies show an increasing concern about ultrafine particulate matter and that the faa should be required to continue to study this pollutant at logan,both to evaluate these possible health effects and to keep the public informed.notably,petitioners do not seek an injunction to stop the construction which has begun at logan.
we find that the faa has taken all of these concerns into account,has responded,and did not act arbitrarily or capriciously in issuing its final order.we deny the petition for review.
logan is the largest airport in new england it has a history of being one of the country airports with the most delayed flights.in the year,when million passengers and billion pounds of freight passed through the airport,logan was ranked sixth nationally for airports with the most delays,even though it was ranked eleventh for overall number of takeoffs and landings and eighteenth for passenger volume.
in,the massachusetts port authority massport,which operates logan,and the faa began studying options for improving logan operational efficiency.in,massport released a feasibility study which preliminarily analyzed different options and recommended some for further consideration.these recommended options included building a new runway runway,realigning taxiway november,building a new centerfield taxiway,simplifying taxiway and runway crossings,and adding a surcharge for use of the airport during peak demand periods.implementation of all or a subset of these options,it was believed,would significantly reduce airport delays.
in late,massport and the faa began preparation of an environmental impact statement eis regarding these potential improvements,as required by state and federal law.the national environmental policy act nepa requires that all proposals for major federal actions significantly affecting the quality of the human environment be accompanied by an eis.c.the goal of nepa is to focus attention on the possible environmental effects of proposed actions,which in turn furthers two important purposes to ensure that agencies do not make decisions based on incomplete information,and to provide information about environmental effects to the public and other governmental agencies in a timely fashion so that they have an opportunity to respond.marsh or.natural res.council,d.nepa does not prevent agencies from then deciding that the benefits of a proposed action outweigh the potential environmental harms nepa guarantees process,not specific outcomes.robertson methow valley citizens council,d 
after extensive analysis and community input,the faa filed a draft eis deis in february.in response to that draft,approximately people attended two public hearings,and the faa received approximately comment letters.the faa then compiled a supplemental draft eis sdeis to consider additional issues that document was published for comment in march.this time,approximately people attended the public hearings,and comment letters were submitted.the faa published its final eis feis in.
the eis the deis,sdeis,and feis collectively considered five project alternatives three involving some or all options considered by the feasibility study,one involving those options not requiring any construction,and one maintaining the status quo the no action alternative.the eis analyzed the operational and environmental effects of each alternative,considering both and impacts based on a range of estimated future passenger loads and fleet composition the mix of the types of aircraft using logan.
based on these findings,the faa released a record of decision rod in,setting forth its rationale for approving the following collection of options the preferred alternative 
a construction of a new runway runway 
b construction of a new centerfield taxiway 
c reconfiguration of the southwest corner taxiway system 
d extension of taxiway delta 
e realignment of taxiway november 
f reduction of instrument approach minimums for several runways 
the faa determined that this set of actions was preferable to the status quo.if no action were taken,the faa concluded,airport delays would continue to increase the preferred alternative,on the other hand,was expected to reduce delays by approximately percent.there is a relationship between delays and adverse environmental effects.delays cause airplanes to idle needlessly on taxiways,increasing harmful emissions.the preferred alternative would reduce emissions and improve ambient air quality,as compared to the no action alternative.
some local commenters have expressed concern that the construction of the centerfield taxiway,which is at the heart of the dispute before this court,would lead to an increase in flight activity,thus increasing air pollutants.the faa denies this and responds that airport capacity is primarily a factor of runway capacity,not taxiway capacity that the goal of this improvement project is to reduce delays and improve safety within logan current capacity and that the centerfield taxiway would not independently affect the total number of aircraft operations at logan.
as for noise pollution,again compared to the no action alternative,the faa found the preferred alternative would drastically reduce the number of citizens exposed to excessive noise levels,defined as db decibels dnl average sound level or higher,and reduce the number of citizens exposed in the to db dnl,which is the threshold at which the faa considers noise levels to be significant as to residential land use.however,the reduction of the highest noise levels would be achieved by redistributing aircraft throughout the airfield,so the preferred alternative would result in approximately more people being exposed to db dnl in the long term.most of those affected would be residents of chelsea and east boston.
in its rod,the faa concluded,as it had in the feis,that the centerfield taxiway would be the largest contributor to taxiway delay reduction out of all the components of the preferred alternative package and that the new taxiway would enhance airfield safety,provide small air quality benefits,and have no significant adverse noise or other environmental impact.
however,the faa deferred final approval of the construction of the centerfield taxiway,despite approving the remaining components of its preferred alternative,in order to see whether operational changes,in addition to the construction,would provide further benefits.as a mitigation measure,the faa agreed first to conduct an additional study,seeking comment from persons living around the northern side of the airfield,to consider potential beneficial operational procedures that would preserve or improve the operational and environmental benefits of the centerfield taxiway as shown in the eis.the additional study would also consider possible changes to the use of taxiway november in response to concerns from local communities.before agreeing to undertake this mitigation measure,the faa considered the impact of deferring construction of the centerfield taxiway and concluded that the potential deferment of the centerfield taxiway would have no discernable impact on the environmental benefits associated with the other components on the preferred alternative.it is the results of this additional consideration of potential mitigation benefits which is at the heart of this petition.
the faa contracted with the firm of harris miller miller hanson,experts in the field of noise and vibration control,to undertake this additional limited analysis of operational alternatives.that study hmmh report,which was published in,considered the efficiency,noise,and air quality effects of different uses of the november and proposed centerfield taxiways.it concluded that no operational action could be identified that would yield environmental benefits beyond those already anticipated by the eis for the construction of the centerfield taxiway.
with that report completed,the faa released a written reevaluation and rod in april,affirming that the data and analysis in the eis were still adequate,accurate,current and valid,concluding that the feis did not need to be supplemented,and approving the construction of the centerfield taxiway.
the circuit has already upheld the eis and rod against legal challenge,see communities against runway expansion,faa,and this case presents no issue as to the legality of those decisions.
petitioners now seek review of the written reevaluation and rod.massport has intervened as a respondent in support of the actions taken.we are told that construction of the preferred alternative is ongoing.petitioners do not seek to enjoin that construction.

as a preliminary matter,intervenor massport challenges petitioners article iii standing before this court.because article iii standing is a constitutional requirement,we address it first,but as the faa does not join in this challenge,we keep our discussion brief.

massport challenges this requirement of on the grounds that the construction of the centerfield taxiway according to the eis will have minimal if any environmental effect on the surrounding area.massport argument puts the cart before the horse it assumes the outcome on the merits in making its preliminary standing objection.
our standing discussion in save our heritage is both instructive and dispositive.in that case,local towns and preservationist organizations challenged an faa order regarding flights originating from hanscom field,outside boston.the faa argued there,as massport does here,that the faa order would have no significant environmental impact,so there would be no standing.save our heritage,at.as we explained 
we need not rule out the possibility of cases where the claim of impact is so specious or patently implausible that a threshold standing objection might be appropriate but beyond that,we think that the likelihood and extent of impact are properly addressed in connection with the merits a reasonable claim of minimal impact is enough for standing

we turn to the heart of petitioners argument that the faa decision not to compile a supplemental eis seis was arbitrary and capricious and that the hmmh report erred in its choice of noise impact modeling.we first describe the regulatory requirements for an seis before addressing petitioners three challenges to the faa decision not to undertake one here.
regulatory scheme and standard of review 
the road to final approval for an agency action is often a long one in this case it has been more than ten years since the commencement of the eis process and five years since the feis.it would undermine nepa policies if agencies in the interim were allowed to ignore material new information or circumstances which could change the environmental analysis contained in the original eis.see marsh,at.the council on environmental quality regulations implementing nepa thus require a supplemental eis if t he agency makes substantial changes in the proposed action that are relevant to environmental concerns or t here are significant new circumstances or information relevant to environmental concerns and bearing on the proposed action or its impacts.c emphasis added.that is,an seis would be required here if new information paint ed a dramatically different picture of impacts compared to the description of impacts in the eis.environmental impacts policies and procedures,faa order e chg,
the faa has,by order,imposed further requirements upon itself for airport projects.if more than three years have passed since the faa approved an feis and no major steps toward implementing the proposed action have taken place,the faa must prepare a written reevaluation to determine whether the feis remains accurate,adequate,and current.nepa implementing instructions for airport projects,faa order b c,see also faa order e requiring,after three years of no major action,a written reevaluation of the adequacy,accuracy,and validity of the feis.that is,the mere passage of time does not require preparation of an seis,only a written reevaluation.the faa also specifically committed itself in the rod to preparing a written reevaluation of whether it was necessary to prepare an seis before issuing its final decision on the centerfield taxiway,and it has done so.
if substantial change has occurred involving the earlier data or other conditions relevant to the faa prior decision,the preparation of an seis is required.faa order b c see also faa order e if,after three years,there have been significant changes in the affected environment or anticipated impacts,an seis must be prepared faa order b b requiring an seis,regardless of passage of time,if s ignificant new changes,circumstances or information relevant to the proposed action,its affected environment,or its environmental impacts becomes available.the written reevaluation determining whether it is necessary to prepare an seis need not,however,be made public.faa order b d faa order e.
while nepa requires agencies to take a hard look at the environmental effects of their planned action,even after a proposal has received initial approval,marsh,at,an agency need not supplement an eis every time new information comes to light after the eis is finalized,id.at.to require otherwise would render agency intractable,always awaiting updated information only to find the new information outdated by the time a decision is made.id.
the key question for the faa,then,is determining what constitutes significant new information,and that is a factual question requiring technical expertise.id.at.the agency resolution of this question is thus one to which a reviewing court owes considerable deference.see id.at.considerable deference is also owed to the faa determination of whether a feis remains accurate,adequate,and current,as that determination is but a variation on the same question of significance.
as a result,the faa decision not to issue an seis can not be set aside by a reviewing court unless that decision is arbitrary and capricious.id.at.see also a.an agency decision is not arbitrary and capricious if that decision was based on consideration of the relevant factors and if it did not commit a clear error of judgment.marsh,at.airport impact relief,wykle,cir.
whether the faa erred in its determination that the feis remains accurate,adequate,current,and valid 
petitioners primarily argue that the faa did not adequately consider all the requisite factors in determining whether there have been significant material changes since the rod.we start with petitioners allegation that the data underlying the eis is outdated.the relevant requirement for the faa as to preparation of an seis is whether the feis remains accurate,adequate,current,and valid.faa order b c faa order e.
as petitioners acknowledge,the rod did specifically make the finding that the feis remains accurate,adequate,current,and valid.petitioners counter to this finding is,at most,general and conclusory,providing us no grounds for critiquing the faa procedures.see save our heritage,at gauzy generalizations,in the face of specific findings and a plausible result,are not even a start at a serious assault.airport impact relief,at issues adverted to in a perfunctory manner,unaccompanied by some effort at developed argumentation,are deemed waived for purposes of appeal.these general and undeveloped arguments are waived.
nonetheless,we address petitioners criticism of the continuing validity of the eis as presented in their argument that the data no longer reflects existing environmental conditions.we disagree that the written reevaluation and rod failed to evaluate adequately the continuing validity of the data underlying the eis.the rod stated twice that the updated data analyzed in the hmmh report were consistent with and validated the earlier data and analyses in the eis.
the hmmh report,in turn,carefully compared its conclusions regarding both air quality and noise impacts with those reached earlier in the eis.the hmmh report analyses incorporated new data gathered between and.the report noted that the models,methodologies and data used in that report were similar to those used in the eis these similarities allowed for meaningful comparison.as one example of a specific comparison,the report demonstrated numerically how t he estimated annual average dnl values for the hmmh report that is,the measurement of noise very comparable to those listed in the eis.the report concluded that t he analyses reflected in this report are consistent with those performed for the eis and,t herefore,the results of the analysis on noise and air quality described in this report do not change any of the conclusions that were reached in the eis.
given this validation of its earlier data,the faa could reasonably have concluded that there was no substantial change in conditions since the data used in its eis were gathered.that is,it was reasonable to assume in these circumstances that the mere passage of time did not invalidate or render the data and analyses in the eis.
petitioners seem to assume that current in the faa regulation means literally contemporaneous.that can not be the correct reading of the requirement,as data relied on in an feis will never be current in that sense.further,such an interpretation would read out the role of the written reevaluation,as the data in a feis would by definition never be current.
rather,current should be read in conjunction with accurate and adequate and in light of the general seis standard of significant change the data remain current if there has been no major change that would cause one to expect contemporaneous conditions to vary significantly from conditions at the time the data were gathered.by validating through the hmmh report that more recent conditions generate similar data as the data used in the eis,the faa could reasonably conclude that all the data still reflected current conditions.in another recent situation where the faa determined that more recent data did not draw into question the modeling it had conducted using older data,the circuit explained 
however desirable it may be for agencies to use the most current and comprehensive data available when making decisions,the faa has expressed its professional judgment that the later data would not alter its conclusions in the eis,and it is reasonably concerned that an unyielding avalanche of information might overwhelm an agency ability to reach a final decision the method the faa chose,creating its models with the best information available when it began its analysis and then checking the assumptions of those models as new information became available,was a reasonable means of balancing those competing considerations,particularly given the many months required to conduct full modeling with new data.

to the extent that petitioners seek a more detailed description of the faa consideration of the hmmh report conclusions regarding the continuing validity of the eis data,none was required.see forest guardians forest,cir nepa imposes no obligation to use precise phrasing.airport impact relief,at a federal agency need not perform the detailed environmental analysis of an s eis before it can determine that no s eis need be prepared.such a requirement would eliminate the threshold requirements of the regulations in favor of a full seis in every case.instead,the arbitrary and capricious standard of review requires substantial deference to the agency when courts review drafting decisions like how much discussion to include on each topic,and how much data is necessary to fully address each issue.sierra club van antwerp,cir.
the faa adequately considered the continuing validity of the data underlying the feis.its determination that the data were still adequate,accurate,current,and valid was not arbitrary and capricious.
whether concerns about ultrafine particulate matter constitute significant new information 
petitioners next argue that new studies demonstrating the effects of fine and ultrafine particulate matter pm on public health constitute significant new information that the faa should have considered in an seis.see c ii.they also fault the faa for not adequately responding to and considering concerns about these health effects.
the environmental protection agency epa sets national ambient air quality standards naaqs,which define acceptable levels of certain regulated air pollutants,including pm.pm is,in turn,categorized as coarse,fine,and ultrafine.at the time of the eis,there were naaqs for coarse pm,which is pm with an aerodynamic diameter of microns or smaller.fine pm is defined as pm with a diameter of microns or smaller ultrafine pm is defined as pm with an diameter of microns or less.
the faa included coarse pm in the air pollutants it measured and analyzed during the eis process.it concluded that none of the alternatives considered would come close to violating the naaqs for,and it also found that the preferred alternative would slightly decrease emissions over the other alternatives,including the no action alternative.for example,under the no action alternative,emissions in were estimated to range from to kilograms per day,depending on airport volume under the preferred alternative,emissions would range from to kilograms per day 
petitioners point to three letters in particular,submitted in response to the draft written reevaluation,that raise questions about the adequacy of the faa consideration of the health impacts of the centerfield taxiway a letter from the massachusetts department of public health,center for environmental health a letter from the city of boston environment department and a letter from the boston public health commission,environmental hazards program.contrary to petitioners assertions,the faa did respond to these concerns,and its responses were not unreasonable.
these letters primarily urged greater data collection and analysis.they specifically expressed concern that air quality data be gathered at points closer to the airport to better measure local impact.they also argued that or compliance with na
