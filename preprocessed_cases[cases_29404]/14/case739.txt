factual and procedural summary 
on january,the hoa filed its complaint against kaufman and unknown doe defendants.in a first amended complaint,the hoa named riteway as a doe defendant as to causes of action alleging negligence and breach of a third party beneficiary contract.in june of,riteway filed a motion for summary judgment,along with a separate statement of undisputed material facts.the summary judgment motion urged,in part,that the complaint was filed after the expiration of the statute of limitations.code civ.
the summary judgment motion included several exhibits as supporting evidence.one was an excerpt of deposition testimony by judith fidler,the former president of the board of directors of the hoa.fidler admitted in her deposition testimony that there were heavy rains in which caused rain water to collect on the roofs and resulted in leaks where there had not been any leaks before,and that in a handyman applied some tar to the roof and other areas.
moreover,fidler acknowledged at the deposition receiving a letter from arnold kaufman dated june,a letter also annexed as an exhibit in support of the motion for summary judgment.the june,letter specifically mentioned leaks in fidler unit and at least two other units referred to as corn s sic unit and nancy units during the to rainy season.the letter acknowledged the particularly heavy el ni√±o rains during the past season causing leaks in fidler unit,a problem with waterproofing of the walls in another unit,and roof and deck problems,as well as stairway leaks.
the hoa filed an evidentiary objection to the letter on the ground it lacked foundation and contained hearsay.however,riteway urged that the letter should be considered because it was testified to by fidler and was not offered for the truth of the matter asserted but only on the issue of notice to the hoa.
the hoa opposition to the motion for summary judgment urged,in pertinent part,that the statute of limitations had been tolled pursuant to section.the hoa noted its exhibit k,which was the december,letter to arnold kaufman from the hoa prior counsel,who invoked the statutory tolling provision while efforts were made to resolve and repair the defective conditions prior to filing a lawsuit.additionally,the hoa cited its exhibit m,which was a signed letter agreement dated april,whereby,also pursuant to the statutory tolling provision,kaufman agreed with the hoa former counsel to extend the tolling provision until such time as either the hoa or kaufman notify the other in writing that they wish to terminate this tolling agreement.
riteway then filed a reply brief and evidentiary objections.specifically,riteway objected to the above exhibit k as hearsay and lacking a foundation and authentication,and noted that there was no declaration from the author of the letter.as to exhibit m,riteway objected that the letter agreement lacked foundation and proper authentication it did not object on hearsay grounds.
after a hearing on the motion for summary judgment,the court took the matter under submission.it thereafter granted the motion,indicating that there was no admissible evidence of tolling of the statute of limitations.the court rejected the tolling argument because it found that the letters relied upon by the hoa principally,exhibits k and m were not properly authenticated and were inadmissible.
the hoa then filed a motion for clarification or reconsideration of the order granting summary judgment.regarding the admissibility of the exhibits in question,the hoa annexed a declaration from its former counsel stellwagen explaining and verifying the validity of the letters in question which established the tolling agreement exhibits k and m.the hoa also argued that these authenticated documents were produced by its former counsel in response to subpoenas by kaufman,that counsel for kaufman served notice of deposit of the documents on all parties including riteway,and that the documents were lodged and had the effect of being verified by the producing party,pursuant to the terms of a case management agreement.
specifically,the hoa explained that the critical documents exhibits k and m were,sequentially numbered by a stamping device by the hoa and deposited in the judicially sanctioned repository for the convenient use by all the parties.pursuant to the trial court case management order,which attempted to minimize the burden on the court and the large number of other parties subcontractors with,the court provided as follows the lodging of any document in the repository shall have the effect of each such document being verified by the producing party as though produced by the party in accordance with the terms of former code of civil procedure pertaining to the production and inspection of documents this order shall be admissible to the extent necessary to prove the verification of any document produced from any party repository.
riteway opposed the motion for reconsideration asserting that the request was untimely and improper as to form.the court thereafter denied the motion for reconsideration.
on january,the court entered judgment against the hoa and in favor of riteway.riteway then filed a motion for attorney fees and submitted various billing statements.the motion relied on the attorney fees provision in the contract,which provided as follows if either party becomes involved in litigation arising out of this contract or the performance thereof,the court in such litigation,or in a separate suit,shall award reasonable costs and expenses,including attorney fees,to the party justly entitled thereto.the hoa opposed the motion for attorney fees and noted that it was not a party to the contract between riteway and kaufman.the court denied the motion for attorney fees.
the hoa appeals the judgment against it,and riteway from the order denying attorney fees.

regarding the postjudgment order denying attorney fees,absent any extrinsic evidence bearing on the interpretation of the contract providing for attorney fees,we review the language of the contract de novo.hess ford motor cal th,d.
ii.the hoa negligence cause of action is not barred because the statute of limitations was tolled.
the hoa negligence cause of action.
the operative statute of limitations for the negligence cause of action is the period applicable to an action for injury to real property.code civ,subd.b.the period begins to run when the plaintiff suspects or should suspect that the injury was caused by wrongdoing,and that someone has done something wrong to the plaintiff.mills forestex th,d.
as the supreme court explained,t he plaintiff discovers the cause of action when he at least suspects a factual basis,as opposed to a legal theory,for its elements,even if he lacks knowledge,simply put,he at least suspects that someone has done something wrong to him citation,wrong being used,not in any technical sense,but rather in accordance with its lay understanding.norgart upjohn cal th,d,italics added.a plaintiff has reason to discover the cause of action when he has reason at least to suspect a factual basis for its elements.id.at,d.a plaintiff has reason to suspect when he has notice or information of circumstances to put a reasonable person on inquiry.ibid.a plaintiff need not know the specific facts necessary to establish the cause of action such facts may be discerned through the process of pretrial discovery.however,within the applicable limitations period,a plaintiff must seek to learn the facts necessary to bring the cause of action in the first can not sit on his rights and wait for the facts to find him,but must in a timely fashion discover further facts if possible and file suit if he does.ibid.
thus,contrary to the hoa position,the statute of limitations began to run not when expert consultants completed their investigation as to causation.rather,the clock started when the hoa suspected or should reasonably have suspected that wrongdoing occurred,and the time continued to run while the hoa performed its investigation.
here,at some unspecified date in,fidler,the hoa president,noticed water intrusion and observed a handyman trying to repair roof leaks.the hoa thus had notice or information that should have prompted further inquiry through the exercise of reasonable diligence.angeles chemical spencer jones th,d.indeed,the june letter from arnold kaufman to fidler indicated that during the heavy el ni√±o rains several other units had leaks,and there were also roof and deck problems and stairway leaks.such other damage would no doubt have been revealed to the hoa with the exercise of reasonable diligence.
thus,in the present case,the statute of limitations began to run at the latest by the end of.accordingly,the period for filing claims relating to injury to real property code civ,subd.b expired at least by december,if not sooner,depending on the exact date of constructive notice,and the complaint filed on january,was therefore the statute of limitations was tolled,as discussed below.
the tolling of the statute of limitations.
if the trial court had considered the evidence submitted by the hoa,such evidence would have established an agreement between the hoa and kaufman to toll the statute of limitations,pursuant to former section,subdivision b a however,riteway contends that its evidentiary objections to documents establishing the tolling were validly sustained by the trial court.alternatively,riteway urges that the copy of the tolling agreement presented by the hoa was flawed because it referred to but did not include the preliminary list of defects required by the tolling provision and,in any event,the tolling provision as then written only applied to the builder and not to the hoa.riteway assertions are without merit,and the hoa should have been permitted to pursue its negligence cause of action against riteway.
first,the trial court erred in finding the documents establishing the tolling agreement were not adequately authenticated.all that is required to authenticate a writing is that there be evidence sufficient to sustain a finding that it is the writing that the proponent of the evidence claims it is.although a more elaborate authentication could have been presented as was done in the hoa motion for reconsideration,counsel for the hoa sufficiently authenticated the documents exhibits k and m when he declared that they were true and correct copies of documents sent by and received from prior counsel for the hoa involved in this litigation.this is not a case,for example,where the record is silent as to the authorship of the letters.see rutledge electric hose rubber company cir.
riteway cites no case authority requiring any more extensive authentication than that provided.in fact,on appeal,riteway legal discussion section of its brief is completely silent on this issue.riteway has also abandoned its hearsay claim on appeal.indeed,the documents establishing the tolling agreement constituted an admission by a party,that it had agreed not to enforce the statute of limitations.thus,the tolling documents are not rendered inadmissible by the hearsay rule.
former section,subdivision b a sets forth an automatic statutory tolling period upon filing of the requisite notice,with the language of the statute providing for a longer period when agreed to in writing by the association and the builder,and with such tolling to operate against all parties italics added.riteway assertion that the tolling provision only operates against the builder and not against a party contractor such as riteway flies in the face of the clear and unambiguous statutory language,the plain meaning of which we must follow to effectuate the legislature intent.people woodhead cal d.indeed,if the statute of limitations were tolled only against the builder and not also against party contractors and subcontractors,it would wreck havoc with the obvious intent of the tolling provision to provide additional time to resolve disputes prior to filing a lawsuit.
finally,there is no merit to riteway argument that the tolling agreement must be deemed inoperative because the hoa exhibits did not include the actual preliminary list of defects former,subd.b a,as amended by stats,ch,complained of.the december,letter from the hoa to kaufman exhibit k regarding preliminary inspection of the condominium units did note that enclosed with the letter was the preliminary defect list and summary of homeowners survey which is being submitted pursuant to civil code.because the present litigation does not involve the adequacy of the defect list,the letter reference to the existence of the list of actually providing a copy of the sufficient to establish compliance with the statute.
accordingly,the hoa sufficiently established the tolling of the statute of limitations as to the negligence cause of action,and summary judgment was erroneously granted as to that cause of action.
iii.the hoa cause of action for breach of third party beneficiary contract is substantively without merit.
the hoa cause of action for breach of a third party beneficiary contract,the contract,is subject to the statute of limitations applicable to contract actions.code civ,subd.however,even though the complaint was filed within the period of the statute of limitations for breach of a third party beneficiary contract the cause of action is substantively flawed.the cause of action is without merit because the hoa,an entity that was not even in existence at the time of the contract,simply failed to submit any evidence that it was an intended third party beneficiary of the contract.
a contract,made expressly for the benefit of a third person,may be enforced by him at any time before the parties thereto rescind it,italics added.the intent to benefit a third party must appear on the terms of the contract.bancomer,superior court th,d.as explained by case law a third party should not be permitted to enforce covenants made not for his benefit,but rather for others.he is not a contracting party his right to performa
