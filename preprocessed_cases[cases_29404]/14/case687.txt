defendant creative capital leasing group,llc cclg appeals a judgment in favor of plaintiffs brett schaffter and austin mcbride corporation,doing business as real estate consultants,entered after a bench trial.cclg contends the court erred by finding it defaulted under various agreements with third parties to purchase condominiums,thereby triggering its responsibility under a buyer broker compensation contract buyer broker contract with to pay it commissions.cclg asserts that although it refused to close escrow on the units for a reason not allowed by the purchase appreciation during the lengthy escrow periods would not make resales sufficiently was no default because the developers pursued no damages against cclg and opted to cancel the agreements.
cclg also contends the buyer broker contract with,and an identical contract with schaffter assignor,broker pickford realty,doing business as prudential california realty prudential,are void because they did not contain a date certain for their termination.further,cclg asserts prudential assignment of rights to commissions is void because it was made prematurely.we affirm.
factual and procedural background 
jack winick and his two sons owned cclg,a real estate investment company.winick is a real estate broker and cclg corporate counsel.cclg devised a strategy to purchase condominiums in downtown san diego before they were constructed on speculation they would substantially appreciate during one to escrow periods for lucrative resales.
schaffter is a real estate agent who specialized in the downtown market,and winick hired him to find desirable properties for cclg.in march cclg entered into the california association of realtors car standard form buyer broker contract with prudential,under whose broker license schaffter worked.schaffter was to represent cclg exclusively in its purchase of condominiums in the park place development in exchange for a percent commission on each unit,with a reduction for the percent commission park place paid referring brokers.under the standard contract,commissions were earned when the buyer entered into a purchase agreement,and they were payable on the close of escrow or the buyer default.
on april,cclg contracted to purchase eight units at park place for prices ranging between the high and the high.unbeknownst to schaffter,winick never intended to finalize the purchases if the market did not perform as he expected,or to pay commissions on units that did not close escrow.
in june,before construction on park place was completed,schaffter left prudential and began working as an independent contractor for,which was the broker for park place.in january cclg entered into an exclusive buyer broker contract with for schaffter representation in its purchase of condominiums in the renaissance and pacific terrace developments.the contract provided for a percent commission.
in february cclg contracted to purchase six units at renaissance,at prices ranging from the high to the low.in september cclg purchased two units at pacific terrace,at prices of and.again,winick did not intend to perform or pay commissions on units that did not appreciate as expected.
in late december schaffter learned from pacific terrace that winick sought to cancel cclg purchases.schaffter called a meeting with winick,and he informed schaffter he would not complete the pacific terrace purchases and he may not complete the renaissance purchases because of insufficient appreciation.winick advised schaffter he did not intend to pay any commissions on units that did not close escrow,and he would not have signed the buyer broker contracts had he understood commissions would be due even if cclg did not close escrow on units.
cclg did not close escrows on the renaissance and pacific terrace units,and although the developers deemed the company in default and subject to liquidated damages,they ultimately allowed it to cancel the purchases to avoid litigation.with the exception of for pacific terrace,the developers returned cclg deposits.cclg refused to pay any commissions under the buyer broker contract between it and.
cclg also missed the closing date on the park place units and the developer sent it notices of default and the intent to retain liquidated damages.after much difficulty and several months of delay,cclg finally closed escrows.park place paid prudential the percent commission,but winick refused to pay it the per cent balance on the percent commission.
as required by the buyer broker contracts,schaffter attempted to mediate his commission claims.winick,however,refused to participate.he agreed to a mediation date,but canceled it with one day notice.the parties unsuccessfully attempted to settle the matter without a mediator.
schaffter,as prudential assignee,and sued cclg for breach of contract a bench trial was held in july,and the court found in favor of schaffter and.it awarded schaffter for commissions on the park place units plus prejudgment interest.
as to the renaissance and pacific terrace projects,the court found cclg defaulted on the purchase agreements and owed commissions of percent.the court determined the sellers were ready,willing and able to sell,and cclg unilaterally chose not to close the deals.the court explained that the buyer negotiated favorable cancellations does not change the fact that the acquisition was prevented by default of the buyer.it awarded in commissions on the pacific terrace units and in commissions on the renaissance units plus prejudgment interest.judgment was entered on august.
the court later awarded contractual attorney fees of to schaffter and to.
discussion 
icclg defaults 
cclg contends the court erred by finding any default on its part,as the cancellations of its purchase agreements for the renaissance and pacific terrace condominiums were voluntary and mutually beneficial to cclg and the developers.capitalization and boldface omitted.cclg asserts the buyer and seller are not obligated to complete a transaction which is not beneficial to them,for the sole purpose of making sure a broker gets a commission.cclg also asserts that even when a buyer does default on a purchase,the buyer and seller may unwind the transaction for their mutual benefit,thereby extinguishing the buyer obligation to pay a commission under the standard form buyer broker contract.
the interpretation of a contract term presents a question of law we review independently.ins.mike tailoring th,d.we infer the parties intent from the written provisions of the contract.citation.the written provisions of a contract are to be understood in their ordinary and popular sense,rather than according to their strict legal meaning unless used by the parties in a technical sense,or unless a special meaning is given to them by usage citation.thus,if the meaning a lay person would ascribe to contract language is not ambiguous,we apply that meaning.citation.an ambiguity arises only if there is more than one construction in issue which is semantically permissible citation.ibid.
again,the buyer broker contract provides commissions are payable on the close of escrow or the buyer default.the verb default necessarily refers to a default under the buyer purchase agreement with the seller.paragraph of the six purchase agreements between renaissance and cclg provided buyer duty to cooperate.buyer understands and acknowledges that upon seller acceptance of this agreement,seller will incur carrying and other costs attributable to seller holding the property off the market,which costs will increase if buyer fails to perform all actions necessary to close escrow.accordingly,buyer agrees to cooperate with seller and shall use best efforts and diligently take any action necessary to timely close escrow,including,without limitation,promptly cooperating in good faith with buyer lender,escrow holder and the title company,and promptly providing all information requested by seller,buyer lender,escrow holder or the title company.buyer acknowledges that buyer failure to so cooperate shall constitute a default hereunder.italics added.
similarly,paragraph.of the two pacific terrace purchase agreements provided buyer shall execute all documents and deposit the same in escrow,together with all funds and any other information necessary to timely close the escrow as provided herein,or buyer shall be in default of this agreement.capitalization omitted,italics added.
it is undisputed that cclg entered into binding purchase agreements for renaissance and pacific terrace condominiums,cclg refused to close escrow on them solely because of insufficient appreciation,and the purchase agreements did not allow cancellation for that reason.
undisputed evidence also shows that when cclg refused to close escrows,pacific terrace notified cclg it was in default and subject to liquidated damages of percent of the purchase prices.spencer kemmeijer,pacific terrace sales manager at the relevant time,testified that winick made it known he was a lawyer and dealing with him was difficult.pacific terrace retained of cclg deposits as liquidated damages,but ultimately returned the remainder because of winick threat of litigation.
james milford,renaissance sales manager at the relevant time,testified the developer preferred to close the sales to cclg and considered the company in default and subject to liquidated damages,but it ultimately agreed to cancel the purchase agreements and return the deposit for any unit it could resell at an equal or higher price.within a few months renaissance resold the six units for approximately the same prices cclg agreed to pay,and perhaps higher prices on some of the units.milford explained renaissance opted not to spend the time and effort in court or in arbitration over purchase deposits.
we conclude that under the plain terms of the renaissance and pacific terrace purchase agreements,cclg defaulted and that triggered the payment of commissions under the buyer broker contract cclg cites no evidence the developers ultimate cancellation of the purchases was beneficial to them,and rather the evidence shows they merely chose to avoid litigation.in any event,a seller conduct is,of course,immaterial to determining whether the buyer defaulted.as car explains in its amicus brief,the default provision of the buyer broker contract recognizes that when a buyer defaults under a purchase agreement,it would not be fair to deny the broker the right to be paid for services rendered under the buyer broker contract.nonpayment would obviously be unfair to a performing broker regardless of whether a seller pursued damages from a defaulting buyer 
contrary to cclg view,the trial court did not rule that a buyer and a seller must complete a transaction that neither side desires to consummate,so the broker could receive his commission.rather,the court acknowledged cclg argument that buyers cancel agreements all the time,and explained there are consequences when people cancel contracts without valid reason.here,the consequence is cclg payment of commissions.
contract expiration dates 
the two buyer broker contracts state they were to expire on the date cclg purchase of the park place,renaissance and pacific terrace units closed escrow.cclg contends the contracts are void because they do not specify a date certain for their termination.cclg cites business and professions code section,subdivision f under which the real estate commissioner may discipline a broker for claiming a commission under an exclusive agreement if it does not contain a definite,specified date of final and complete termination.the statute expresses a public policy against exclusive real estate listing contracts.nystrom first nat.bank of fresno d.
cclg relies on dale palmer d,in which a listing agreement between a contractor and a broker for homes to be constructed provided it would automatically start when construction begins and continue exclusively and irrevocably with said agent until thirty days after notice of completion has been filed.id.at.the broker sold one home and received a commission,but the parties then had a dispute and the contractor hired another agent to sell the six remaining homes.the broker sued for anticipatory breach of contract and unearned commissions,and the court held the agreement was in violation of section,subdivision f because the final termination date can be computed only by reference to the happening of a future event.dale palmer,supra,at.the court also held the agreement was void ab initio,citing smith bach cal,for the general rule that where a statute prohibits or attaches a penalty to the doing of an act,the act is void.dale palmer,supra,at.
courts,however,have uniformly rejected dale palmer harsh rule when,as here,the broker seeks earned commissions.contract interpretation presents a question of law which this court determines independently.citations.a contract must be interpreted to give effect to the mutual,expressed intention of the parties.where the parties have reduced their agreement to writing,their mutual intention is to be determined,whenever possible,from the language of the writing alone.edmar th,d.the buyer broker contracts state,broker shall be entitled to the compensation provided for in paragraph above if buyer enters into an agreement to acquire property described in paragraph,on those terms or any other terms acceptable to buyer.the commissions were payable on the close of escrow or the buyer default,but under the plain language of the buyer broker contracts they were earned earlier when cclg entered into the various purchase contracts with the developers.
in wilson stearns d,the court held the lack of a specific termination date in an exclusive listing agreement did not preclude the broker from recovering earned commissions on homes he sold for a subdivider.the court distinguished dale palmer on the grounds that case involved an executory problem in that it was an action for anticipatory breach and for unearned commissions wilson stearns,at,the parties there had a dispute regarding prices and the client discharged the broker,and there was no showing the broker conferred any benefit on the client and no unjust enrichment would result.id.at.in contrast,in wilson stearns,the broker had fully performed and the client would have been unjustly enriched if he avoided payment of commissions.ibid.
the wilson stearns court relied on norwood judd d,in which the court explained the rule that the courts will not lend their aid to the enforcement of an illegal agreement or one against public policy is fundamentally sound.the rule was conceived for the purposes of protecting the public and the courts from imposition.it is a rule predicated upon sound,public policy.but the courts should not be so enamored with the latin phrase in pari delicto that they blindly extend the rule to every case where illegality appears somewhere in the transaction.the fundamental purpose of the rule must always be kept in mind,and the realities of the situation must be considered.where,by applying the rule,the public can not be protected because the transaction has been completed,where no serious moral turpitude is involved,where the defendant is the one guilty of the greatest moral fault,and where to apply the rule will be to permit the defendant to be unjustly enriched at the expense of the plaintiff,the rule should not be applied.wilson stearns,supra,d at,original italics.
in nichols const.d.nichols,the court criticized the broad language in dale palmer as holding any agreement made in violation of a statute is void.no distinction is made as to the type of agreement,or whether at the time of breach the agreement was executed or executory.nichols,supra,at.the nichols court noted the supreme court tempered the rule of dale palmer in lewis queen ball sons cal d,which explains in some cases,the statute making the conduct illegal,in providing for a fine or administrative discipline excludes by implication the additional penalty involved in holding the illegal contract unenforceable or effective deterrence is best realized by enforcing the plaintiff claim rather than leaving the defendant in possession of the benefit or the forfeiture resulting from unenforceability is disproportionately harsh considering the nature of the illegality.in each such case,how the aims of policy can best be achieved
