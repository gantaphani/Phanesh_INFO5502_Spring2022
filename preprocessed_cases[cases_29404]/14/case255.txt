after an arbitration hearing to resolve a construction contract dispute between environmental barrier company ebc and slurry systems,ssi,arbitrator franklin kral issued an award in favor of ebc in the amount of.when ssi did not pay,ebc filed suit in illinois court to confirm the award,and ssi responded by removing the case to the district court for the northern district of illinois.ssi urged the district court to vacate the arbitral award,or in the alternative,to modify it.the district court did neither instead,it confirmed the award entered by arbitrator kral.in the course of doing so,the court held that ebc had standing to enforce the arbitration clause in the contract and that the arbitrator had not exceeded his powers.on appeal,ssi is now urging us to find that ebc never obtained the right to enforce the contract arbitration clause.ssi appellate briefs present this argument as a challenge to arbitrability,based on the fact that ssi agreed to arbitrate only with ebc,not with ebc itself.this is a major shift from the way ssi presented its case first to the arbitrator and later to the district court,where it framed the issue in terms of ebc standing to pursue this arbitration.the difference is,on these facts,ssi claim.
on february,the army corps of engineers entered into a contract with ssi for work on a project to reduce flooding during heavy rains.the mccook reservoir project,as it was called,involved the construction of a reservoir ssi won the right to build the overburden cutoff wall.ssi in turn subcontracted part of its work to an entity called,using a form contract that the parties signed in april.the parties briefs recount in detail the progress of ssi and work from to we include only the facts pertinent to this appeal.
attachment a to the subcontract elaborated on article of the text,specifying that contractor and subcontractor shall jointly work together to perform all of the work together sic to minimize the overall cost of the work.attachment a also included a longer version of article,which described how the parties would allocate revenues,costs,profits,and loss and gave guidance for a final based on the actual distribution of costs.the subcontract also contained an exclusivity clause,article a broad arbitration clause covering a ny claim arising out of or related to this subcontract,article and a clause restricting assignment or,article.
the project scope and methodology changed as the work proceeded,requiring the corps at one point to suspend operations while it figured out an alternative way to finish the project.once the modifications to the prime contract were in place,ssi and resumed their joint effort to complete their portion of the work.by april,they were finished with their construction work.what remained to be done was the final reckoning of who owed whom how much this proved to be more difficult.there were,for instance,several pending change orders,and it was unclear how costs and profits would be shifted among the parties.to the extent that these financial details are relevant,we return to them later.
ebc entered the picture in september,when,for reasons unrelated to the mccook project,filed for bankruptcy in the bankruptcy court for the southern district of new york.during reorganization,ebc through two intermediary entities acquired substantially all of assets for a purchase price of million.the bankruptcy court found that ebc was the only qualified purchaser of assets.in an order dated april,the court approved the sale in accordance with the terms set forth in a letter from the intermediaries.part ii of the offer letter addressed the acquisition and set forth a list of excluded assets.the exclusions included a ll contracts for services to be performed by,except mccook,il emphasis added.in other words,the mccook contract was acquired by the intermediary,and then passed along to ebc.there was a schedule a to the offer letter that listed equipment loans and leases.this was the schedule a to which the bankruptcy court referred when it said in its order that the contracts listed in schedules a and c were executory.
the sale of the mccook contract was later reflected on schedule d to the april,bill of sale between and ebc that carried out the bankruptcy court order.the bill of sale provided that was selling all of seller accounts receivable including without limitation the accounts set forth on schedule a hereto,and contracts specified as the assumed contracts.this was a different schedule a than the one attached to the offer letter mentioned in the bankruptcy court april order.schedule a to the bill of sale lists accounts receivable and contracts that ebc was acquiring,and it includes the mccook project.thus,the fact that the bankruptcy court had described the contracts listed in schedules a and c as executory has little bearing on this case.
ssi asserts that it was not aware of bankruptcy proceedings as they were taking place.it learned about them,however,no later than june,when ebc notified ssi by letter that ebc had succeeded to rights under the subcontract.the letter contained a demand that ssi pay ebc the balance due to for the work that had performed under the subcontract.at the time,ebc believed that this balance was.it later found out that ssi had received two additional payments from the corps that it had not disclosed,totaling the discrepancy is immaterial for our purposes.
ebc june letter also noted that the subcontract between and slurry systems calls for mediation and arbitration of disputes,but it added that 
ebc preference is to resolve its claim against slurry systems amicably,if possible,without the expenditure of mediation fees and expenses which,pursuant to the contract,are to be shared equally by the parties.accordingly,we request an opportunity to meet with you within the next two weeks to discuss and hopefully resolve ebc claim.if you are unwilling to meet with us within that time,ebc will commence mediation and arbitration proceedings.
ssi did not respond positively to ebc letter.on july,ssi attorneys sent a letter to ebc counsel,expressing the opinion that all disputes between and slurry systems have been resolved,and adding that,a s a matter of fact,actually owes slurry systems,but because of liquidation,there is no point in slurry pursuing the matter.ssi letter noted ebc statement that the subcontract between and ssi calls for the mediation and arbitration of disputes,and requested that ebc provide ssi with a copy of the subcontract if you still plan to pursue this matter.
ebc did pursue the matter.after mediation efforts failed,ebc counsel called ssi counsel to discuss arbitration.the following week,in a letter dated march,counsel for ssi wrote the following note to ebc attorney 
as i stated on the phone,while i am pleased to resolve potential procedural issues by agreement,the first order of business is to determine whether your client,ebc,has any standing to arbitrate its claim against our client,ssi.
you have agreed that invoking the arbitration clause in subcontract with ssi goes with ebc fully assuming that subcontract.that requires ebc to perform fully all obligations imposed upon by the subcontract,which it has not yet done.additionally,ssi has not even consented to ebc assumption of the subcontract,and is unaware of ebc technical expertise or level of capitalization,or its ability to perform work under the subcontract.under these circumstances,ssi may be excused from accepting performances from ebc under c and other applicable laws.
the letter went on to state that it was therefore essential that ebc provide ssi with adequate assurances that it can perform its obligations under the subcontract before ebc can assume the subcontract.specifically,it demanded that ebc confirm that it is in the construction business and can handle any remedial work necessary under the subcontract that ebc provide ssi with the insurance and performance bond required by the subcontract and that ebc give ssi its financial data and biographical information,so that ssi could make an informed decision regarding whether or not to withhold ssi consent from the proposed assumption.it added that t hese issues need to be resolved now,and not in the context of an arbitration.the letter closed by warning that if it should turn out that work was defective in any way,ssi will hold ebc accountable.
the issues were not resolved,and instead ebc filed its demand for arbitration a month later,on april.the demand briefly explained the background of the parties dispute and the basis for ebc claim against ssi.ebc argued that ssi owed ebc at least and that ssi had breached the subcontract by failing to pay that amount.
at that critical juncture,ssi said nothing about the basic arbitrability of the dispute.instead,it filed an answering statement on may.in the box on the answering statement form labeled respondent answers claimant demand for arbitration as follows,ssi wrote ebc seeks additional moneys under a subcontract which has been paid in full respondent ssi denies any money is due and seeks return of overpayments and declaratory relief.the dollar amount of claim was listed as to be determined,and in the box labeled other relief sought,ssi stated its claim for a declaration that ebc assumed the subcontract and is in breach of its terms an accounting of money to be paid under the subcontract and a return of any over payments.notably,ssi did not merely answer ebc claim it also filed a counterclaim.
ssi elaborated on its position in a supplementary letter to arbitrator kral on june.the letter,which ssi sent i n order to facilitate our june,preliminary hearing,first explained that the disputes center around a construction subcontract between ssi and to build a slurry wall for the corps.it then launched directly into the dispute over payment,providing arbitrator kral with ssi version of how the parties had agreed to allocate the costs and profits.next,the letter stated that abandoned the project before it was over,and so while ebc now seeks an additional,strict application of the payment terms does not require ssi to pay the unearned windfall ebc seeks.instead,it requires ebc to pay ssi several hundred thousand dollars in overpayments.the remaining three paragraphs expanded on why ebc owed money to ssi.there is not even a passing reference to a defense of lack of arbitrability.
three days after the preliminary hearing,on june,ssi wrote another letter to arbitrator kral,this time to follow up on the subject of breaches.ssi reiterated its position that left the job before it was finished and noted that by virtue of the april,bankruptcy order,ebc was allowed to assume subcontract with ssi.ssi then argued that the bankruptcy court directed ebc,as the purchaser of asserts,to make such cure payments as are required by section of the bankruptcy code and agreed to among the debtors and respective contracting parties.ssi and had not agreed to ebc assumption of the contract,ssi continued,nor had even informed ssi of its bankruptcy.nevertheless,the letter contended,section required to do the following in order to assume the contract referring to the list of three items in ssi letter of march,to ebc.until ebc satisfied those conditions,ssi concluded,ebc can not have assumed the contract,and lacks standing to pursue this arbitration case.
at the end of the letter,ssi noted its concern that should the corps raise a future claim involving work,ebc might try to evade its responsibility by contending it is not.part of ssi relief sought in this arbitration is a declaration that ebc has in fact assumed all of obligations under the subcontract.thus,in the same letter,ssi both argued that ebc had not properly assumed the subcontract through its reference to alleged outstanding duties under bankruptcy code that prevented assumption and argued that ebc had assumed the contract.perhaps unsure of the latter point,ssi asked in its answering statement for a declaration that ebc had assumed the contract.it seems that what ssi was looking for was a ruling from the arbitrator that before ebc should be permitted to enforce rights under the subcontract,it had to assure that it also would fulfill remaining contractual obligations.once again,this was not a challenge to arbitrability it was a position premised on a procedural question of standing and on the merits of the dispute.
each party to the arbitration filed a position paper on july.in response to ssi argument that it had never consented to the assignment of rights to ebc,ebc argued that the subcontract did not require ssi consent under these circumstances.article of the subcontract provides 
the subcontractor shall not assign the work of this subcontract without the written consent of the contractor,nor subcontract the whole of this subcontract without the written consent of the contractor,nor further subcontract portions of this subcontract without written notification to the contractor when such notification is requested by the contractor.
only the first clause restricts assignment the second and third restrict further subcontracting.moreover,the restriction on assignment only requires the subcontractor to obtain the contractor written consent before assigning the work of the subcontract.the work was completed by april,a full year before the bankruptcy court issued its order approving ebc assumption of assets.the arbitrator took note of that timing in an express finding that the work of the subcontract was complete before assigned the contract to ebc.
in its position paper,ssi reiterated its belief that had repudiated the parties agreement,and that it had continuing obligations to ssi to maintain insurance coverage,provide a warranty for its work,and provide ssi with a performance bond to cover those obligations.ssi maintained its position that ebc must comply with its outstanding obligations under the contract,and that ssi therefore seeks declaratory judgment confirming that ebc has assumed the contract a declaratory judgment that ebc is in breach on terms of the subcontract,insurance,and that ebc cure those defaults as previously ordered by the courts an accounting of the moneys to be paid between the parties on the subcontract and an order requiring ebc to return to ssi the overpayments made to,believed to be in excess of footnotes omitted.ssi argument further stated that according to the bill of sale attached to the bankruptcy order,ebc did,in fact,assume the subcontract.ssi added that w hat could not do,and therefore what ebc can not do,is to selectively accept the benefits of the subcontract while rejecting the obligations.until ebc fulfilled those obligations as required by,the argument concluded,ebc lacks standing to invoke the arbitration clause in the subcontract.the rest of the argument explained why and to what extent was overpaid for its work and concluded by stating that ebc must cure all defaults before getting anything from ssi.but applying the subcontract,was vastly overpaid,and that money must be returned.
discovery ensued,followed by a arbitration hearing on august.the transcripts from the hearing reveal that the only issues addressed were who owed what and to whom.there was no discussion of standing or of arbitrability.even so,in a brief filed by ebc on october,ssi did not file a brief,ebc addressed the standing defense presented in ssi position paper 
ssi claims that ebc lacks standing to compel ssi to arbitrate ebc claim because ssi did not agree to the assignment of the subcontract to ebc,and because certain alleged cure payments were not made.generally speaking,issues of standing are for the arbitrator to decide in the first instance.
arbitrator kral award was issued on november.he recognized that a threshold issue was raised by ssi as to the standing of ebc to arbitrate this dispute under subcontract article the arbitration clause.ebc agreed that it had assumed the subcontract as evidenced by the bankruptcy court filings.he also noted that ssi standing defense was premised on its position that ebc had not assumed the subcontract properly.ebc response was that geo performance of its work on the project ended in december,and thereby the consent of ssi to the assumption is not required.the arbitrator resolved the standing question by stating that he agree d with ebc position.he went on to reject the entirety o
