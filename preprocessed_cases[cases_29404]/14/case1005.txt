in this zoning case,we determine whether a city can enforce a zoning ordinance against a property owner whose substantially completed new home has been built in violation of the ordinance,even though the city had given preliminary approval to the owner building plans.we conclude that it can.
dallas residents doug and grace vanesko wanted a larger home,so they decided to tear down their existing house and build a new one in its place on the same lot.to save money,they also decided to design the new structure themselves,without the assistance of architects and engineers,and act as their own general contractor.when submitting their building plans to the city of dallas for a permit,the vaneskos paid an additional fee for the city to do a more extensive plan review to ensure that the plans were in compliance with all city building codes and ordinances.the city approved the plans as submitted and issued a building permit.during the following year,as the new house was being constructed,city inspectors frequently visited the site without complaint.then,after the roof was framed in,an inspector advised the vaneskos that the structure was too high,in violation of the zoning ordinance rather than order the work to be stopped,the inspector recommended that the vaneskos seek a height variance from the city of dallas board of adjustment the board.the city staff and eighty percent of the neighbors surrounding the property supported the vaneskos request for a variance.the remaining twenty percent of neighbors did not actively support the variance,but neither did they object to it.nevertheless,the board denied the vaneskos variance request 
the vaneskos appealed the action of the board by application for writ of certiorari to the dallas county district court,naming as defendants the city,the board,and raj sharma,in his official capacity as the building official of the city of dallas on a stipulated record,the district court reversed the board ruling and ordered the matter remanded to the board for further proceedings consistent with the holdings of town of south padre island,texas cantu,christi,no pet.and board of adjustment mcbride,christi,no writ.a divided panel of the court of appeals affirmed.we subsequently granted the city petition for review.
as a body,the decisions of a zoning board are subject to appeal before a state district court upon application for a writ of certiorari.see.local gov t code a,b bd.of adjustment flores,christi,writ denied.the district court sits only as a court of review,and the only question before it is the legality of the zoning board order.city of alamo heights boyar,antonio,no pet.to establish that an order is illegal,the party attacking the order must present a very clear showing of abuse of discretion.city of san angelo boehme bakery.a zoning board abuses its discretion if it acts without reference to any guiding rules and principles or clearly fails to analyze or apply the law correctly.see downer aquamarine operators,walker packer,orig.proceeding.with respect to a zoning board factual findings,a reviewing court may not substitute its own judgment for that of the board.see walker,at.instead,a party challenging those findings must establish that the board could only have reasonably reached one decision.see id.at.our review is necessarily less deferential when considering any legal conclusions made by the zoning board and is similar in nature to a de novo review.see id 
the vaneskos do not dispute that their home,as currently constructed,violates the applicable height restrictions for a dwelling in an zoning area.see dallas,city code e e.under state law,however,a local board of adjustment may 
authorize in specific cases a variance from the terms of a zoning ordinance if the variance is not contrary to the public interest and,due to special conditions,a literal enforcement of the ordinance would result in unnecessary hardship,and so that the spirit of the ordinance is observed and substantial justice is done 
local gov t code a.in dallas,the board ability to grant variances is further regulated by city ordinance.see dallas,city code d.that ordinance permits the board 
t o grant variances from height regulations that will not be contrary to the public interest when,owing to special conditions,a literal enforcement of this chapter would result in unnecessary hardship,and so that the spirit of the ordinance will be observed and substantial justice done.the variance must be necessary to permit development of a specific parcel of land which differs from other parcels of land by being of such a restrictive area,shape,or slope that it can not be developed in a manner commensurate with the development upon other parcels of land in districts with the same zoning classification.a variance may not be granted to relieve a self created or personal hardship,nor for financial reasons only,nor may a variance be granted to permit any person a privilege in developing a parcel of land not permitted by this chapter to other parcels of land in districts with the same zoning classification.
while the first portion of subsection d tracks the language in subsection a of the local government code,the city ordinance adds a number of additional restrictions.first,the variance must be necessary to permit development on the land such that the land could not otherwise be developed in accordance with the applicable ordinance.second,the ordinance forbids a variance that relieves only a or personal hardship.third,financial reasons alone can not justify the issuance of a variance.finally,a variance may not be granted to offer a development privilege not available to other developers in lots.
taken together,these restrictions impose significant barriers to obtaining a variance and sharply curtail the board discretion in issuing one.nevertheless,the trial court found that all of the prerequisites for a variance set forth in subsection d of the dallas city code were met and concluded that the board clearly abused its discretion in denying the variance.in doing so,we believe the trial court substituted its own judgment for that of the board.
both the trial court and the court of appeals relied on cantu and mcbride,two cases they described as being remarkably similar to the case at bar.see at.in both cases,a property owner who was constructing a house appealed the decision of a zoning board to deny him a variance from the mandatory setback line for the property.bd.of adjustment mcbride,christi,no writ town of padre island,cantu,christi,no pet.like the vaneskos,the mcbrides and the cantus had previously sought and received approval of their building plans from the city.mcbride,at cantu,at.in mcbride,the court of appeals held that the zoning board abused its discretion in denying the variance because the undisputed facts showed that a hardship would exist and that the exception would not adversely affect other interests.at.although the factual findings in cantu were disputed,the court of appeals reached a similar result after reviewing the record of the proceedings before the zoning board.at.
while cantu and mcbride bear some factual resemblance to the instant case,particularly in the sense that the property owners sought and received city approval of their building plans,neither case involved a zoning ordinance as restrictive as the dallas ordinance.the governing ordinance in mcbride permitted a variance for other extraordinary and exceptional situations or conditions of such piece of property.corpus christi,zoning ordinance.the ordinance governing in cantu merely incorporated the provisions of chapter of the local government code.town of south padre,code of ordinances.as the dissent below correctly noted,
neither ordinance specifically prohibited variances for or personal hardships,nor did they specify that a variance must be sought to resolve a hardship arising from a restrictive condition relating to the area,shape,or slope of the parcel.thus,the ordinances governing mcbride and cantu were significantly broader than the dallas code provision applicable here,and could be read as authorizing variances where the landowner built on the basis of an permit w e
