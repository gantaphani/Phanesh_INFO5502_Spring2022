introduction 
essex property trust,essex,applied for a conditional use permit to construct an apartment building in an industrial area of irvine,california the city.the city issued a negative environmental declaration and a conditional use permit.royalty carpet mills,royalty,filed a petition for writ of mandate challenging the city actions,alleging the city failed to comply with the california environmental quality act ceqa when it issued the negative declaration and the conditional use permit without preparing an environmental impact report eir.the trial court granted the city motion to dismiss the petition.the court concluded that although the petition was timely filed,it was not timely served.we affirm.
as a general principle,if two different statutes of limitation apply to a particular claim,then the shorter period controls over the longer one,unless the statutes can be harmonized.here,two different statutes apply to the period for service of royalty petition,and can be harmonized.government code section,subdivision c e applies generally to challenges to a conditional use permit,and requires personal service within days after the challenged public agency action.public resources code sections and apply specifically to challenges to a conditional use permit on the ground of noncompliance with ceqa.public resources code section,subdivision a states personal service of the petition shall be made within business days after the filing of a petition challenging the public agency action the petition must be filed no later than days after the agency posts a notice of determination pub.resources code,subd.b,which is required no later than five working days after the decision is made,subd.a.therefore,under the public resources code any petition challenging a public agency action under ceqa must be personally served no later than about days giving leeway for working days after the agency action.however,under case law,unchanged by the legislature,service of a petition may be perfected beyond the time set forth in the public resources code upon a showing of good cause.board of supervisors superior court th,d.here,the petition was served on the day after the city approval of essex conditional use permit.
the legislative policies of both ceqa and government code section support a short period by which a party may challenge a public agency action regarding a conditional use permit.the legislature provided that the period of government code section is an absolute,beyond which relief for failure to serve a petition can not be granted.unless this statutory is applied to this case,there would be no time after which service of the petition would be untimely,assuming good cause supported an extension of time under the public resources code.that result would be inconsistent with the legislative purposes of the statutes at issue.
therefore,we hold that the limit on service contained in government code section operates as a limitations bar,notwithstanding the city agreement to extend the nominally shorter limitations period contained in public resources code section.the trial court correctly dismissed royalty petition.we also hold the trial court did not err in denying royalty motion for leave to amend.any amendment would have been futile because the proposed amended petition challenged the same public agency action on the same grounds,sought the same relief,and suffered the same dispositive defect.
statement of facts 
the facts are drawn from royalty petition.as with a demurrer to a complaint in a civil action,when a trial court considers a motion to dismiss a petition for writ of mandate it assumes the truth of the petition allegations.code civ,grace cal.emp.com.cal d.
royalty manufactures carpeting at a plant located in an industrial area of the city.essex sought to construct a apartment complex the project near royalty plant.essex applied for a conditional use permit to build the project.
on september,the city department of community development issued an initial study and a notice of intent to adopt a negative declaration for the project.the department of community development found an eir did not need to be prepared because revisions to the project made or agreed to by the applicant would avoid or mitigate the effects of the project to a point where clearly no significant effects would occur royalty submitted extensive comments objecting to the construction of an apartment complex so close to its industrial operations,identifying inadequacies in the city initial study and proposed negative declaration,and arguing the proposed mitigation measures for the project failed to fully mitigate the potentially significant adverse impacts on public health and safety.
the city planning commission denied the application for a conditional use permit for the project.the planning commission found the requested findings of mitigation could not be made,the proposed residential development of the site was not compatible with the surrounding industrial land uses,and the information in the negative declaration did not sufficiently address the environmental issues raised by the public comments or support a finding that all impacts were mitigated to a less than significant level.
essex appealed the denial of its application for a conditional use permit to the city council and submitted additional information that had not been included in the initial study or the negative declaration.royalty again objected to the issuance of a conditional use permit.
on may,the city council passed a resolution adopting a mitigated negative declaration and approving a conditional use permit for the project.on may,six working days later,the city filed and posted a notice of determination for the project.
on june,royalty filed and served the city and essex by mail with a notice of commencement of proceedings,a verified petition for writ of mandate,and a request for preparation of the record of proceedings.on june,royalty personally served the petition,a summons,and other documents on essex.
on friday,august,the city attorney faxed a letter to royalty demanding dismissal of the petition because the city had not been personally served with the petition or the request for preparation of the record of proceedings.on monday,august,royalty personally served the petition and request on the city.
on september,royalty filed a motion for an extension of time to personally serve the petition on the city to and including august,pursuant to code of civil procedure section,subdivision b,and the equitable powers of the court under board of supervisors superior court,supra,th,d.
on september,the city filed a motion to dismiss,arguing royalty failed to personally serve the petition within the time periods of either government code section,subdivision c e,or public resources code section,subdivision a.
the parties stipulated royalty motion for an extension of time should be granted with respect to relief from the failure to personally serve the city within business days of the filing of the petition,under public resources code section,subdivision a.the parties also stipulated that relief would be without prejudice to the city argument the petition was not personally served within days after the conditional use permit was approved by the city,as required by government code section,subdivision c e.
on december,the trial court granted the motion to dismiss the petition because royalty had not personally served the city within the time period specified in government code section,subdivision c e.the court minute order states,in relevant part by the terms of government code section,subdivision c,the subject time period runs days after the legislative body decision.that time period expired while the petitioner calls its case a pure ceqa proceeding,the petition itself shows that the matter is an action to attack,review,void,or annul any decision on the matters listed in government code s ection relating to conditional use permits.
royalty sought leave to file an amended petition.the trial court denied the motion for leave to amend,and entered judgment denying the petition for writ of mandate.

royalty argues the trial court erred by determining the statute of limitations applicable to challenges to conditional use code section,subdivision c e applied in this case.royalty contends the proper statute of limitations is set forth in ceqa,at public resources code sections,subdivision b,and,subdivision a.under either the government code or the public resources code,royalty timely filed its petition.the alleged failure to timely serve the petition is at issue here.
government code section 
government code section sets forth the limitations period for filing and serving a petition challenging a conditional use permit n o action or proceeding shall be maintained in any of the following cases by any person unless the action or proceeding is commenced and service is made on the legislative body within days after the legislative body decision e to attack,review,set aside,void,or annul any decision on the matters listed in sections and,or to determine the reasonableness,legality,or validity of any condition attached to a variance,conditional use permit,or any other permit,subd.c e.after expiration of the limitations period,all persons are barred from any further action or proceeding,subd.e see travis county of santa cruz cal th,d.
even if a petition is timely filed under government code section,subdivision c,if it is not personally served as required by statute,the petition must be dismissed.wagner city of south pasadena th,d gonzalez,supra,th at,d.in beresford neighborhood city of san mateo d,the petitioners filed a complaint days after the meeting at which the city council granted an application for certification of an eir,permit approvals,a zoning variance,and general plan amendments.that complaint was never served on the city.ibid.the petitioners filed and served a first amended complaint days after the city council meeting.ibid.the court of appeal concluded the claims relating to applications for conditional use permits and variances were barred because t he city was not served within days of its decisions approving the permits and residential planned development variance,and establishing the conditions for such approval.id.at.
government code section explicitly acknowledges other limitations periods may apply.except under certain circumstances not relevant to this appeal,this section shall not affect any law prescribing or authorizing a shorter period of limitation than that specified herein,subd.g.by this language,the legislature recognized other more specific statutes could exist which prescribe shorter limitations periods than that in former section,subdivision c,and any such other,more particular,provision should hold sway whenever applicable.the legislative awareness apparent in subdivision g is consistent with the legislative intent underlying former section restrict the time within which local zoning decisions may be challenged in the courts.citation.gonzalez,supra,th at,d.
public resources code sections and 
public resources code section provides,in relevant part any action or proceeding to attack,review,set aside,void,or annul the following acts or decisions of a public agency on the grounds of noncompliance with this division shall be commenced as follows b any action or proceeding alleging that a public agency has improperly determined whether a project may have a significant effect on the environment shall be commenced within days from the date of the filing of the notice required by subdivision a of section.public resources code section,subdivision a requires that a notice of determination be filed within five working days after the local agency approves the project.
public resources code section,subdivision a provides,the complaint or petition shall be served personally upon the public agency not later than business days from the date that the action or proceeding was filed.until the petition is properly served,the trial court does not have jurisdiction over the public agency.public resources code section,subdivision a,read in light of the numerous other ceqa procedural provisions which require prompt prosecution and encourage speedy resolution of ceqa matters,does include the requirement for jurisdictional service of the petition in ceqa proceedings.board of supervisors superior court,supra,th at,d.however,dismissal is not mandatory if the petitioner fails to effect service within the statutory time period.id.at,d.therefore,the city was permitted to,and stipulated to,extend the time to challenge the failure to comply with the service requirements of public resources code section,subdivision a.
interplay between the statutes 
royalty argues the trial court erred in applying government code section,subdivision c e.royalty contends that because public resources code section,subdivision a is the more specific statute of limitations,it controls,and the two statutes can not be reconciled.for the following reasons,we conclude this argument does not have merit.government code section,subdivision c e applies generally to challenges to a conditional use permit.public resources code sections and apply specifically to challenges to a conditional use permit on the ground of noncompliance with ceqa.thus,challenges under the public resources code constitute a subset of general challenges to conditional use permits.public resources code section,subdivision b,and government code section,subdivision c e relate to the same limitations period applicable to claims that a public agency improperly issued a conditional use permit.both government code section,subdivision c e and public resources code section,subdivision a relate to the time period within which service of a petition challenging issuance of a conditional use permit must be made.
the legislative policy behind both government code section and ceqa is the prompt resolution of challenges to the decisions of public agencies regarding land use.see travis county of santa cruz,supra,cal th at,d,the express and manifest intent of section is to provide local governments with certainty,after a short period for facial challenges,in the validity of their zoning enactments and decisions board of supervisors superior court,supra,th at,d ceqa challenges encourage speedy resolution.
