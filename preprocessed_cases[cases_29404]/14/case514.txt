background 
plaintiff even zohar construction remodeling,sued defendants bellaire townhouses,llc,samuel fersht and the fersht family living trust for breach of contract and related claims arising out of a project to develop a condominium in north hollywood.defendants unsuccessfully petitioned to compel arbitration and then failed to file a responsive pleading to the complaint.thereafter,the clerk entered defendants default,and the court entered a default judgment in the amount of.
defendants subsequently filed an application under section b for relief from default.defendants titled their application one for mandatory relief,thereby invoking the aspect of section b that requires a court to grant relief when the application is accompanied by an attorney sworn affidavit attesting to his or her mistake,inadvertence,surprise,or neglect,unless the court finds that the default was not in fact so caused the same provision authorizes discretionary relief when a judgment,dismissal,order,or other proceeding is taken against a party or a party legal representative through his or her mistake,inadvertence,surprise,or excusable neglect.ibid.
accompanying the application was the affidavit of defendants attorney,daniel gibalevich.in that sworn statement,attorney gibalevich attributed the default primarily to errors by his staff.he declared that,at the time defendants responsive pleading was due,he had to spend substantial amounts of time away from the office on personal matters.i believed,he continued,that i had sufficient staff to assure competent handling of client files.my associates were instructed to notify me immediately of issues that would require my personal attention.it appears that my staff failed to maintain this file in accordance with this firm policies and procedures.due to my frequent absences,i failed to file and serve the responsive pleading it is clear that my mistake and excusable neglect resulted in the entry of defaults and default judgments against the defendants.plaintiff opposed the motion with evidence that its attorney had repeatedly informed gibalevich,by mail,and fax,of the impending default.plaintiff also contended that gibalevich and defendant fersht had allowed the default to be taken as part of a practice of avoiding defendants obligations to contractors by delaying payment and driving up legal fees and costs.
the superior court denied defendants motion for relief from default,expressly finding gibalevich declaration not credible.at the hearing on the motion,the court had criticized the declaration as too vague and conclusory and as fuzz ing up the issue of gibalevich own responsibility.the court repeated this criticism in its order,describing the declaration as entirely too general in light of plaintiff showing,and as failing to show that gibalevich is solely at fault in not filing a timely responsive pleading.moreover,the court continued,attorney gibalevich tries to have it both ways by speaking vaguely of his own fault while also claiming excusable neglect.he has not demonstrated excusable neglect.
days later defendants filed a second notice of motion for mandatory relief under section to vacate defaults and default judgments.accompanying the renewed motion was a second affidavit by gibalevich,in which he offered a different explanation for his failure to file a responsive pleading.that failure,he now asserted,had resulted from preoccupation with efforts to secure the return of other clients files seized from his office as part of a criminal investigation.i nvestigators with the los angeles district attorney office,gibalevich declared,had served a search warrant at his office as part of an investigation focused on medical providers and not on me or my practice.o ne of my associates,savransky,resigned his position right after the search.that left me and gina akselrud as the only attorneys shouldering this heavy load.gibalevich continued in my effort to secure the return of my client files,i engaged shkolnikov,a criminal defense attorney.i volunteered to assist him in his research and drafting efforts.i spent all of my time on efforts to return my client files.i researched and wrote many drafts of the motions that were filed.this consumed me.i was working on this most of the day,every day.when i was in front of the computer,i thought of nothing else.i began to obsess over my reputation and the disclosures that i had to make to judges and opposing counsel alike.i have to confess,gibalevich concluded,that this feeling of embarrassment is the reason why i failed to set out these facts in the declaration previously filed.
gibalevich associate attorney akselrud submitted a declaration confirming the search,gibalevich and her own frequent absences from the office to make court appearances to continue hearings and trials,and gibalevich obsession with securing the return of his clients files.akselrud did not,however,confirm or mention gibalevich earlier sworn statement that his staff had failed to maintain the file in the instant case.attorney shkolnikov also submitted an affidavit stating that gibalevich had devoted all of his time and effort to assisting shkolnikov in recovering the seized files.
the superior court stayed execution of the default judgment to allow time to consider defendants renewed motion for relief from default.in the hearing on that motion,the court stated gibalevich,you are presenting an entirely different story with this application than you have presented to the court originally.you tried to blame it on a miscalendaring when the evidence is that your office received multiple,multiple notices before the defaults were entered in all different kinds of ways.and frankly,your story about being obsessed with this search warrant for the entire period of time is just not credible.you originally told the court you had to be out of the office for substantial periods of time.now you say you conducting all kinds of research on your computer in your office.you not credible,gibalevich.you could have presented all of that with your original affidavit these are not new facts.in response,gibalevich argued that the facts supporting a renewed motion do have to be new facts.under section b,they have to be different facts.they do have to be new facts.
ruling on defendants second application under section b,the superior court once again rejected gibalevich explanations.attorney gibalevich,the court observed,first blamed the default and default judgment entered against defendants on the lawyers he employed in his office.when he lost the first motion,the court continued,gibalevich filed another motion.the second motion fails to comply with the requirements of section b.in this motion,attorney gibalevich changed his story and blamed the default and default judgment on his having become obsessed with the consequences of a search warrant executed on his office by the los angeles county district attorney.neither the search warrant nor its consequences concerned the files of the defendants in this action.moreover,t he associate in gibalevich office did not support the claim in attorney gibalevich first declaration that she failed to maintain the defendants file or notify gibalevich of the entry of default and default judgment against defendants.
even while concluding defendants had not satisfied the requirements of section,the superior court nevertheless granted their renewed application for relief from default.the court explained that it felt bound to follow standard microsystems winbond electronics th,d standard microsystems,which the court understood as holding that section b takes precedence over section,and that relief under section b based on an attorney affidavit of fault is mandatory where no part of the fault is shown to be attributable to the attorney clients.standard microsystems,at,d.on this basis the court vacated the defaults and default judgment and directed the clerk to file defendants answer to the complaint.
plaintiff appealed,and the court of appeal reversed.the court declined to follow standard microsystems,supra,th,d,criticizing that decision as undermin ing the legislature goal to limit repetitive motions and to provide an important incentive for parties to efficiently marshall their evidence in the first instance.quoting garcia hejmadi,supra,th at,d.in this instance,the court of appeal observed,gibalevich declaration failed to adequately explain why he had not included the facts about the search warrant execution and his response thereto in his first declaration information about those events was obviously in gibalevich possession when he filed the first motion for relief from default and the relevance of the events if true was patent.gibalevich only explanation for not having presented this information earlier was that he was embarrassed.the trial court did not find this explanation credible.that finding a finding defendants do not contest is binding upon us.citation.given the inadequacy of the defense showing,the trial court did not abuse its discretion in finding that defendants had failed to establish the predicates for relief under section,subdivision b.based upon that finding,the court of appeal concluded,the trial court should have denied defendants renewal motion for lack of jurisdiction.accordingly,the court of appeal reversed the superior court order granting relief from default and directed the court to reinstate the defaults and the default judgment.
we granted defendants petition for review.
ii.discussion 
as noted,the court of appeal held defendants failure to comply with section required the trial court to reject their renewed application for relief from default.the court of appeal was correct.
the question whether section governs applications under section b for relief from default is one of law.we answer such questions through de novo review.american nurses torlakson cal th,d.although defendants argued in the superior court that their renewed application satisfied section,they have abandoned that position.now defendants simply contend section does not apply,and for that reason they had no obligation to present new or different facts,circumstances,or law,as section b provides.
our fundamental task in construing sections and,or any legislative enactment,is to ascertain the intent of the lawmakers so as to effectuate the purpose of the statute.day city of fontana cal th,d.we begin as always with the statute actual words,the most reliable indicator of legislative intent,assigning them their usual and ordinary meanings,and construing them in context.if the words themselves are not ambiguous,we presume the legislature meant what it said,and the statute plain meaning governs.on the other hand,if the language allows more than one reasonable construction,we may look to such aids as the legislative history of the measure and maxims of statutory construction.in cases of uncertain meaning,we may also consider the consequences of a particular interpretation,including its impact on public policy.wells learning foundation cal th,d.
in this case,the parties disagree less over what sections and mean than over how the two statutes interact.while plaintiff contends section governs all renewed applications for relief from default,including applications under section b,defendants contend the two statutes conflict and that section b takes precedence.under these circumstances,two principles of statutory construction are especially relevant.first,a court must,where reasonably possible,harmonize statutes,reconcile seeming inconsistences in them,and construe them to give force and effect to all of their provisions pacific palisades bowl mobile estates,llc city of los angeles cal th,d.second,all presumptions are against a repeal by implication ibid,including partial repeals that occur when one statute implicitly limits another statute scope of operation schatz allen matkins leck gamble mallory llp cal th,d.thus,we will find an implied repeal only when there is no rational basis for harmonizing two potentially conflicting statutes citation,and the statutes are irreconcilable,clearly repugnant,and so inconsistent that the two can not have concurrent operation.ibid.applied to the case before us,these principles require us to favor a reasonable construction that gives full effect to both sections b and.with that cautionary preface we turn to the statutory language.
section b contains two distinct provisions for relief from default.the first provision,presented here only for context,is discretionary and broad in scope the court may,upon any terms as may be just,relieve a party or his or her legal representative from a judgment,dismissal,order,or other proceeding taken against him or her through his or her mistake,inadvertence,surprise,or excusable neglect.b.the second provision is mandatory,at least for purposes of section,and narrowly covers only default judgments and defaults that will result in the entry of judgments.this provision,the one here at issue,declares as follows notwithstanding any other requirements of this section,the court shall,whenever an application for relief is made no more than six months after entry of judgment,is in proper form,and is accompanied by an attorney sworn affidavit attesting to his or her mistake,inadvertence,surprise,or neglect,vacate any resulting default entered by the clerk against his or her client,and which will result in entry of a default judgment,or resulting default judgment or dismissal entered against his or her client,unless the court finds that the default or dismissal was not in fact caused by the attorney mistake,inadvertence,surprise,or neglect.b.
the general underlying purpose of section b is to promote the determination of actions on their merits.see zamora clayborn contracting group,cal th,d.the additional,more specific purposes of section b provision for relief based on attorney fault is to relieve the innocent client of the burden of the attorney fault,to impose the burden on the erring attorney,and to avoid precipitating more litigation in the form of malpractice suits.metropolitan service casa de palms,th,d see assem.com.on judiciary,analysis of bill reg.sess,as amended.to protect the opposing party,a court that grants relief based on an attorney affidavit of fault must direct the attorney to pay reasonable compensatory legal fees and costs to opposing counsel or parties.b.the court may also order the offending attorney to pay a penalty of no more than and a similar amount to the state bar of california client security fund,subd.c a,b.
section,which governs applications for reconsideration and renewed applications,appears in a chapter of the code of civil procedure pt,tit,ch,setting out rules generally applicable to motions and orders.one of those rules,section,subdivision b,provides a party who originally made an application for an order which was refused in whole or part,or granted conditionally or on terms,may make a subsequent application for the same order upon new or different facts,circumstances,or law,in which case it shall be shown by affidavit what application was made before,when and to what judge,what order or decisions were made,and what new or different facts
