as a general rule,a local governmental agency is entitled to receive written notice of a claim against it for money or damages prior to the filing of a legal action.the statutes governing this notice requirement include two types of claims procedures,one statutory,and one contractual et.the question posed in this appeal is whether a claimant,having complied with a contractually mandated claims procedure,must also present a statutory claim prior to filing an action.in the published portion of this opinion,we conclude that the two procedures are intended to be parallel,not sequential we therefore hold that if a claim is governed by a claims procedure prescribed by contract,the presentation of an additional,statutory claim pursuant to sections and is not required prior to filing a lawsuit unless it is expressly mandated by the contract.
in the unpublished portion of the opinion,we conclude that the public works contract entered into between arntz builders arntz and the city of berkeley the city did not require that arntz present a section claim before filing its action against the city.accordingly,the trial court erred in entering judgment against arntz for failure to file a statutory claim.
factual and procedural background 
on april,arntz and the city entered into a contract for the restoration and expansion of the berkeley central library.the original contract price for the construction work was,but the price was ultimately increased to after a change order change order.the contract,as amended by change order,provided that the work was to be substantially completed by june,with a final completion date of july.the city retained the library project managers lpm as the city project manager with authority to make decisions and take actions binding the city on matters pertaining to the contract.
sections and authorize local agencies such as the city to include in any written agreement provisions governing the presentation of any or all claims arising out of or related to the agreement,and provide that the claims procedure established exclusively governs the claims to which it relates.pursuant to this authority,paragraph of document of the contract paragraph set forth the claims procedure for disputes arising under the contract.paragraph provided that if the contractor disagreed with the city decision on a dispute concerning work to be performed,payment,time extensions or compliance with contract procedures,the contractor sole and exclusive remedy is to file a claim in accordance with this paragraph the claims procedure warned that failure to furnish notice and file a claim within the requisite time limitations resulted in the contractor waiving its right to the subject claim.
the claims procedure had several facets.
first,the contractor was required to provide written notice of any dispute with the city concerning any work to be performed,payment,or time extensions b efore commencing the disputed work,or within seven calendar days after such demand is made or instruction is given,whichever is earlier the city was to review this notice and provide a decision.
if the contractor disagreed with the city decision as to the disputed work,it then had seven days to notify the project manager that a formal claim would be filed.the claim itself had to be filed within days of receiving the city decision,together with specifically enumerated documents and justifications.after reviewing the claim and supporting documents,the city would make a final determination.
if the contractor disagreed with the final determination,and the claim was for less than,the contract provided for a meet and confer session and,for any unresolved matters,presentation of a government code claim,as set forth in paragraph of section of the contract paragraph.a disputed claim that exceeded was not subject to paragraph.for these claims,the contract required mediation as a condition precedent to litigation.
finally,the contract provided that c ompliance with the notice and claim submission procedures described in this paragraph is a condition precedent to the right to commence litigation,file a government code claim,or commence any other legal action.no claim or issues not raised in a timely protest and timely claim submitted under this paragraph may be asserted in any government code claim,subsequent litigation,or legal action.
as disputes arose in the course of the work,arntz did not submit claims in the format required by paragraph.instead,it took the approach of submitting requests for information rfi and change orders.with rfi,the city would respond to arntz questions about plans,specifications or details on the project.change orders would result if the rfi entailed additional work beyond that called for in the contract.in change order,dated april,the parties entered into a settlement of all potential claims then pending by arntz against the city as of february.under change order,the contract price was increased by,the time for substantial completion was extended from december,to june,and arntz agreed to waive any claims then pending with the exception of certain claims listed in paragraph of change order.
change order was effective april.arntz subsequently continued to submit rfi and change orders to address issues encountered in the construction process,including changes in materials to be used,costs,and scheduling.in its communications between july and may,lpm continually advised arntz that if it disagreed with an lpm determination,it was required to comply with the contract claims procedure of paragraph or it would waive its rights to pursue additional compensation.
the renovation of the library was substantially completed in march.on april,lpm wrote to arntz stating that arntz had not yet complied with the contract claims procedure and reminding arntz of its obligation under paragraph.lpm further advised arntz that the city was not waiving any of its rights under the contract as to the claims procedure.
on may,lpm notified arntz that it had yet to receive a single claim in compliance with the contract claims procedure.the city urges arntz builders to review carefully government code sections and that apply to this procedure.the claims procedure is an exclusive remedy and arntz builders has and continues to waive its claims by not following it.arntz responded by suggesting that a meeting be scheduled to address the outstanding claims because it believed that the claims procedure was a waste of time and money on may,the city informed arntz that it would continue to insist upon the contract claims procedure to resolve any disputes.on may,lpm sent arntz a detailed response to the various outstanding change orders.lpm indicated that the city did not currently owe arntz any payment and that the city would continue to assess liquidated damages in the amount of per day until the work on the library was complete.in the letter,lpm noted that arntz had waived its rights to compensation on several items but that it could request permission to file a late claim pursuant to section.
on june,arntz submitted a notice of government claim with the city indicating that it and its subcontractors claimed damages resulting from work they performed on the library restoration project.on june,the city rejected the claim,informing arntz that it did not comply with the requirements of the contract claims procedure,and directing arntz to submit a claim in the requisite format.
after reviewing this response,arntz counsel realized that we had made a mistake apparently of filing this notice of government code claim hence,on july,arntz submitted a request for time extension compensation and a request for mediation pursuant to paragraph.the request sought costs of for prime contractor and subcontractor claims.the city thereafter informed arntz that its request did not conform to the requirements of the contract for claims,including the required claims certification.in particular,arntz had not provided a time impact evaluation explaining why more time was needed nor had it detailed justifications for its change requests.the city reiterated for the umpteenth time that arntz needed to follow the contract claims procedure.
on august,the city wrote to arntz counsel stating,again,that it did not recognize the july,time extension request as a claim under the contract.the city noted that it would consider a proper claim,compliant with the contract if submitted on or before october.
by this time,counsel for arntz had reviewed the contract and interpreted it to mean that if the claim was for more than,arntz did not have to file a contract claim or a government code claim and that only mediation was required.nevertheless,arntz submitted a second request for time extension and compensation dated october,and a demand for mediation dated october,the october claim.the documents indicated that the claim was submitted pursuant to the terms of the contract and also requested mediation.the claim sought additional payments of.this included subcontractor claims in excess of million.
this time,the city did not object to the timeliness or form of the claim but responded on the merits,invit ing dialogue on the disputed issues.the city took the position that arntz owed the city liquidated damages in the amount of for late completion,for failure to complete the library project punch list,for the rental cost of substitute library facilities,and for failure to submit daily reports.the city also noted that certain subcontractors had filed stop notices and lawsuits,and that the necessary withholdings under civil code section for the stop notices was.consequently,the city maintained that it was authorized to withhold at least from arntz which exceeded any claim by arntz for retention and outstanding progress payments.the city expressed its desire to promptly resolve these matters and stated it would correspond separately regarding proposed mediators and mediation protocol.
on november,the city sent arntz a proposal for mediation that would include all subcontractors who had filed stop notices.some of the subcontractors were opposed to mediation but the city and arntz moved forward with selecting a mediator and setting a date for the mediation and document review.because some of the subcontractors were resisting mediation,arntz suggested that it might file an action against the city in order to consolidate the various actions that had been filed by the subcontractors.on april,arntz informed counsel for the city that it was preparing a complaint against the city and was attempting to consolidate the subcontractor actions.
on may,arntz sought clarification from the city regarding its position on arntz complaint and whether the city intended to pursue mediation.on may,the city informed arntz that it would waive the mediation requirement in paragraph to allow arntz to file a complaint against the city.the city letter also stated that it was waiving only the mediation requirement and no other notice,substantiation,or other process contained in the claims provision or otherwise in the contract that is a condition precedent to the contractor filing suit as against the city.the letter went on to explain that the city expected to mediate the case at the end of the summer and that the waiver was for the limited purpose of allowing arntz to file its lawsuit and consolidate the actions.
on may,arntz filed a complaint against the city for breach of contract,and against lpm for negligence.the city answered the complaint on june,asserting as one of its affirmative defenses that the complaint was barred because arntz failed to comply with section et.on september,the court granted arntz motion to consolidate the complaint with the subcontractor actions.
the mediation that had been initially scheduled for may ultimately took place on june,and july.the parties were unable to settle the matter.
in november,the city filed a motion for summary judgment and in the alternative summary adjudication raising several issues including that arntz breach of contract cause of action was barred because arntz did not timely file a government code claim.arntz also moved for summary adjudication,arguing that the city was estopped from asserting that it had not complied with the government code claim requirements.the court denied the motions,finding that triable issues of fact existed as to arntz compliance with the government code claim requirement.the court granted the city motion for summary adjudication on two issues,ruling that arntz june,notice of government claim was filed before a cause of action accrued and was,therefore,properly rejected by the city and the city letter of may,did not constitute an express waiver of the government code claim requirements.
a court trial thereafter proceeded on the issue of whether arntz complied with any applicable government code claim requirements.in a lengthy judgment and statement of decision,the trial court construed both the statutes and the contract to require arntz to present a section claim in addition to complying with the contractual claims procedures.the court also ruled that the october claim did not substantially comply with section,and was not a claim as presented under section because it did not present a claim ripe for litigation nor did it threaten litigation consequently,the court concluded that section barred arntz complaint due to its failure to present a timely section claim judgment was entered and arntz appealed.

iii.discussion 
the city contends both the law and the contract require arntz to complete two claims procedures before filing a lawsuit the claims process required by the contract,including mediation,and the subsequent presentation of a claim in compliance with section.arntz,on the other hand,argues that the contractual claims procedure authorized by section supplants the claims presentation required by sections and.arntz contends also that the contract did not require presentation of a section claim for disputed amounts over.
we examine,first,the language of the statutes governing the two procedures.in construing those statutes,the fundamental rule is that a court should ascertain the intent of the legislature so as to effectuate the purpose of the law.citation.an equally basic rule of statutory construction is that courts are bound to give effect to statutes according to the usual and ordinary meaning of the language employed in framing them.citation.although a court may properly rely upon extrinsic aids,it should first look to the words of the statute to determine the legislature intent.where the words of the statute are clear,the court should not add to or alter them to accomplish a purpose that does not appear on the face of the statute or from its legislative history.citation.irvine th,d.
we conclude that the legislative intent of these statutes can be ascertained from the ordinary and usual meaning of their language.we nonetheless provide,as well,a brief discussion of the legislative history as an informative context.
a.the tort claims act 
the legislative history 
in,the california law revision commission the commission issued a report recommending an overhaul of the government claims laws and procedures.the commission concluded that the law of this state governing the presentation of claims against governmental entities is unduly complex,inconsistent,ambiguous and difficult to find,that it is productive of much litigation and that it often results in the barring of just claims.recommendation and study relating to the presentation of claims against public entities cal.law revision com.a presentation of claims.the commission,therefore,drafted for the legislature consideration a comprehensive and streamlined statutory scheme that would govern claims against local entities.in describing the principal features of the legislation,the commission set forth,first,the basic scheme that no suit may be brought against a governmental entity on a cause of action to which the statute is applicable until a written claim relating thereto has been presented to the entity and time has been allowed for action thereon by its governing body.id.at a.
the report noted,however,that this general rule would not govern the presentation of all claims against all governmental entities.presentation of claims,supra,at a.for example,the commission proposed to exclude claims against the state,because of the state already existing comprehensive claims process.id.at pp.a to a.as to local public entities,the new general claims statute would apply only to claims for money or damages,and would exempt specific claims,such as those for tax exemptions and refunds,for principal and interest on bonded indebtedness,and for public employee salaries,expenses and allowances.id.at a.
the commission also proposed the authorization of a separate procedure to govern claims arising out of contracts with local entities.described as a nother exception to the coverage of the proposed statute,it was devised to grant authority to local public entities to include special provisions in written contracts governing the presentation,consideration and payment of claims arising thereunder,thus permitting a desirable flexibility in contract situations.presentation of claims,supra,at a.this exception was created in recognition of the fact that claims arising out of contractual disputes may require greater or lesser notice and opportunity to investigate,depending upon the subject matter and complexity of the contract.id.at a.
the commission proposed statute provided that t he governing body of a local public entity may authorize the inclusion in any written agreement of provisions governing the presentation of any or all claims arising out of or related to the agreement and the consideration and payment of such claims.a claims procedure established by an agreement made pursuant to this section exclusively governs the claims to which it relates,except that the agreement may not require a shorter time for presentation of any claim than the time provided for a statutory claim.presentation of claims,supra,at a.the commission stated intent was to permit public entities to waive by contract compliance with the claims statutes as to causes of action founded upon express contract id.at a.
the commission proposed statutory scheme was adopted,with modifications not germane to our analysis,in.stats,ch.over the years,the statutes have been modified and amended in various ways,but the core structure remains the same.the basic requirement is that a claim against a local entity must be presented in accordance with section prior to the filing of a lawsuit.excepted from that basic requirement,inter alia,are certain types of claims,such as tax refunds,public employee salaries and expenses,and bond payments,and alternative claims procedures provided for by contract or ordinance.
this structure supports the conclusion that the contractual claims procedure was intended to provide an alternative to,rather than an addition to,the statutory claim an examination of the statutes and their interplay bears out this conclusion.
the statutory language 
section provides that a local public entity may include in its contracts provisions governing the presentation of any or all claims arising out of or related to the agreement and the consideration and payment of such claims.section provides that a claims procedure established by agreement made pursuant to section exclusively governs the claims to which it relates italics added.the only exception to this exclusive governance clause is that,in certain circumstances,the rules governing the presentation of late statutory claims must be available to contractual claimants as well.ibid.
section requires that claims governed by contract must conform to claims governed by statute in two ways both contractual and statutory claimants are subject to the same statute of limitations for filing an action on a claim,and both contractual and statutory claimants can sue only on that portion of a claim that has been rejected by the local entity and not waived by the claimant.as explained by the commission,section makes applicable to claims governed by contractual claims procedures the same statute of limitations section and the same general rules limiting suit on a claim section as apply to claims governed by other claims procedures.recommendation relating to sovereign immunity,revisions of the governmental liability act cal.law revision com.revisions of governmental liability act.
thus,sections,and,taken together,enunciate the following precepts local agencies are authorized to include in a contract claims procedures that will exclusively govern the claims specified in the contract,except that the contractual claims procedures must conform to statutory claims procedures in three and only three particulars time for filing suit on a claim,limitations on the scope of a claim that can be sued upon,and access to late claim procedures in certain circumstances.these principles convey the intent to allow local agencies to develop their own claims procedures for contractual disputes as an alternative to the section claims requirements.if these statutes were interpreted to require as the city argues that all claimants must comply with contractual procedures and with statutory procedures,then the conforming requirements of sections and would be rendered superfluous.
further elucidation of legislative intent is found in section.that statute makes clear that the statutory claims presentation requirement found in section does not apply to contractual claims.section provides,no suit for money or damages may be brought against a public entity on a cause of action for which a claim is required to be presented in accordance with chapter section and chapter section until a written claim therefor has been presented to the public entity and has been acted upon by the board this section,by its terms,does not apply to contractual claims procedures,which are found in chapter et.see recommendation relating to sovereign immunity,claims,actions and judgments against public entities and public employees cal.law revision com.instead,section provides that local entities may include a requirement in the contract that a claim be presented and acted upon as a prerequisite to suit thereon italics added.these two provisions can be harmonized only if the contractual and statutory claims procedures are understood to be parallel and not sequential.
in sum,both the history and the language of the tort claims act lead us to conclude that the legislation was designed to authorize the imposition of a contractual claims procedure as an alternative to the statutory claims procedure.we detect no legislative intent,nor any practical need,to require presentation of a statutory claim after a claimant has complied with a local entity contractual claims procedure 
the core purposes of the claims statutes are to give the governmental entity an opportunity to settle just claims before suit is brought,and to permit the entity to make an early investigation of the facts on which a claim is based,thus enabling it to defend itself against unjust claims and to correct the conditions or practices which gave rise to the claim.presentation of claims,supra,at a and see,city of ontario superior court th,d purpose of claims presentation requirement is to provide the public entity an opportunity to investigate facts while the evidence is fresh,to settle meritorious cases without the need of litigation,and to make appropriate fiscal planning decisions.a contractual claims procedure will amply serve those purpose
