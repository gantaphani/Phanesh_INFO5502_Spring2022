in this case,we consider california public records act,et the act,generally calling for disclosure of a public agency records,and the statutory exception,applicable where the public interest in nondisclosure clearly outweighs the public interest in disclosure.more specifically,we face questions concerning the availability and timing of public disclosure of competitive proposals submitted to a public agency as part of a process of qualifying and negotiating for a public contract,lease,or other project.as will appear,consistent with analogous federal law and the majority of statutes and decisions in other states,we conclude that public disclosure of such proposals properly may await conclusion of the agency negotiation process,occurring before the agency recommendation is finally approved by the awarding authority.we will reverse the contrary judgment of the court of appeal.
the following uncontradicted facts are taken largely from the court of appeal decision.on november,the city of los angeles department of airports,also known as los angeles world airports lawa,issued a request for proposals rfp for the lease of a parcel of land at van nuys airport.situated on the parcel is a complex consisting of three hangars,two office buildings,and a fuel farm.proposers were told to submit proposals by december,although the date was later extended to february.the rfp provided that all proposals will become the property of lawa and a matter of public record.
under the rfp,lawa would select the successful proposal based on a number of criteria or qualifications,including the proposed rent and concession fees,the proposed use of the property,financial capability and responsibility,management qualifications and experience,general reputation to conduct aeronautical services,scope of aviation services to be provided and other such factors as lawa deems appropriate.the rfp also provided that lawa could reject any or all proposals,could advertise for new proposals,or could proceed otherwise.additionally,lawa could elect to negotiate with the proposer s found to have submitted the best proposals following negotiations,lawa would submit a proposed lease to the reviewing authority,the board of airport commissioners the board and,following the board approval of a proposed lease exceeding five years,to the los angeles city council.prior to the board approval,the public would have five days to review these proposals and the proposed lease.lawa received eight proposals in response to its rfp.
on april,after the deadline for submitting proposals had passed,but before lawa had negotiated with or selected the successful proposer,petitioner,a law firm engaged in aviation related business,submitted to the airport division of the los angeles city attorney city attorney a request under the act for copies of all proposals submitted in response to the rfp.on may,lawa airport property manager,jess romo,informed petitioner that lawa would provide it with copies of the proposals after lawa had concluded negotiations with the yet to be named successful proposer.
romo letter noted the practice of most governmental agencies to make rfp proposals available for public review at the time the contract is presented to the awarding authority,the board for award.more precisely,proposals are first available for review when the awarding authority agenda containing the contract to be awarded is published.this practice allows for the public to obtain the information prior to the awarding authority consideration and award of the contract.importantly,it also allows the governmental entity,on behalf of its residents and taxpayers,to complete the negotiations without the proposers knowing each other price and terms.to make proposals available for public review prior to this time would seriously impact the government ability to negotiate a fair and cost effective proposed contract.
on may,petitioner filed a mandate petition in superior court.see.a hearing was set for september.in the meantime,on june,after the deadline for submitting proposals had passed,the city attorney provided petitioner with the names of the companies that had submitted proposals,but did not provide copies of the proposals themselves.the city attorney opined that disclosing the information at that time would irretrievably corrupt the process and harm not only the respondents,but also city taxpayers who may not receive the best value in return for the expenditure of their tax dollar,because the successful proposer could gain a negotiating advantage if it knew the details of the unsuccessful proposals.
the city attorney referred petitioner to section f of the los angeles administrative code,which relates to competitive bidding.that section provides proposals shall be opened and their contents secured to prevent disclosure during the process of negotiating with competing proposers.the proposals shall be opened publicly,but only the names of the proposers shall be revealed.adequate precautions shall be taken to treat each proposer fairly and to insure that information gleaned from competing proposals is not disclosed to other proposers.prices and other information concerning the proposals shall not be disclosed until a recommendation for award is made to the awarding authority.
on june,lawa mailed letters to all the bidders announcing that its evaluation panel was recommending castle cooke aviation services as the firm for the project.lawa told the unsuccessful proposers that if they wanted to provide additional information they could do so by completing a public comment card.under the provisions of the rfp,if any person wanted to submit a protest concerning the award it was required to do so by of the fifth business day after the issuance of a notice of intent to award the lease.any such protest had to contain a full and complete statement specifying in detail the grounds of the protest and the facts in support thereof.
although lawa request to negotiate with castle cooke aviation services was placed on the agenda for the july,meeting of the board,it declined to approve the award at that time.rather,the board deferred its decision and returned the matter to lawa to evaluate all scenarios of all proposals for the highest and best return to lawa prior to presenting an agenda item to the board.lawa staff scheduled meetings with three proposers in.
on september,the trial court issued its tentative decision to deny petitioner mandate petition.the court cited government code section,and stated its tentative view that disclosing contents of the proposals prior to the ultimate selection of the successful proposer would adversely impact the city negotiating position.the mandamus petition was heard september.on october,the court issued its decision denying the petition pursuant to government code section because the public interest in nondisclosure clearly outweighs the public interest in disclosure.
the court of appeal,by a vote,disagreed with the trial court,finding that the city has failed to demonstrate there is a clear overbalance in favor of delaying disclosure.the majority felt that the city reasons for nondisclosure were vague and speculative,and that the public had a significant interest in knowing,prior to completion of the negotiating process,whether lawa had acted properly and in accordance with its own guidelines.
the court of appeal majority also reasoned that the city concern about the possibility of proposers changing their proposals was unfounded because proposers were not permitted to change their proposals after the submission deadline had passed,the city enjoyed an enormous negotiating advantage in being able to reject any proposals deemed unsuitable,and the city negotiating position could not be hurt by permitting proposers to know that other competitive proposals were waiting in the wings.the majority concluded that the public had a legitimate interest in knowing during the negotiating process,whether the city had acted in accordance with its guidelines,or instead had improperly favored certain proposers.
in his dissent,justice mosk stated that substantial evidence supported the trial court findings that little if
