the trial court granted class certification of approximately concrete drivers employed by graniterock on or after january.the court designated two subclasses,the first being defined as all concrete drivers employed by granite rock company on or after january,who signed a graniterock form entitled on duty meal period agreement.the second subclass was defined as all concrete drivers employed sic granite rock company on or after january,who either never signed a granite rock form entitled on duty meal period agreement or who later provided a written notice purporting to revoke the agreement.
the class action was tried without a jury,and the court returned a verdict in favor of graniterock.the court found that graniterock did not violate labor laws in its meal period policies.
statement of the facts and case 
the concrete that granitrock produces is a perishable product that can not be stored.it is mixture of rock,sand and cement.when water is added to the mixture,it creates a chemical reaction that causes the mixture to harden.for this reason,when there is concrete in the drum of a mixer truck,the drum must rotate at all times to prevent hardening.in addition,freshly batched concrete must be poured within minutes to ensure its structural integrity.one of the duties of the concrete mixer drivers is to monitor the rotation of the truck drum.
graniterock provided its concrete mixer drivers with the option of signing an meal period agreement pursuant to industrial wage commission iwc wage order,which states when the nature of the work prevents an employee from being relieved of all duty and when by written agreement between the parties an paid meal period is agreed to.iwc wage order,subd.c.iwc wage order requires that such agreement must be revocable by the employee at any time.ibid.
the meal period agreement that was provided to and signed by plaintiffs provides i understand that i may revoke this waiver agreement at any time by providing at least one working day advance notice to my manager of my decision.graniterock represented at trial that one day notice was the shortest amount of time for it to process a revocation of the agreement and provide an meal period.
graniterock also advised the concrete drivers that if they did not sign an meal period agreement and were asked to work through a meal,they would receive one hour of special pay called code pay,in addition to any pay required by the collective bargaining agreements.code pay equaled one hour of pay.
all concrete drivers acknowledged receiving and reviewing this policy.drivers were also notified of their right to a,meal period through iwc wage order and other mandatory state and federal postings at each graniterock branch.the drivers testified that they understood that they could revoke the meal period agreement at any time.the evidence at trial showed that only three graniterock drivers revoked their meal period agreement,and each of those drivers received an meal period and code pay.
prior to trial,plaintiffs brought a motion for summary adjudication of graniterock affirmative defense of the existence of the meal period agreement.the court found that the notice provision contained in the meal period agreement failed to satisfy the requirement in wage order,section c that the agreement allow employees to revoke the agreement at any time.because the agreement was not legally compliant in its revocation provision,the court found the agreement invalid as a matter of law.
following trial,the court found that plaintiffs failed to prove that the drivers were forced,expected,or trained to involuntarily sign meal period agreements or to miss meal periods against their will.the court noted that numerous drivers testified that despite signing an meal period agreement,they understood that they could get a meal at any time without revoking their meal period agreement.for example,driver bruce nicholson understood he could ask for an meal at any time because it was in the handbook and it was told to us.kelly sohns knew she could ask for time off without revoking her meal period agreement.brian sheridan testified that anytime we want lunch all we have to do is ask for it.richard walrod knew he could have asked for lunch off on the same day,but chose not to.
following consideration of the evidence at trial,including the testimony of numerous concrete mixer drivers and dispatchers,the court concluded that plaintiffs had not proven that graniterock forced any driver to forgo an meal period.the court stated graniterock has affirmatively notified its employees that they are entitled to a meal period free from its control through its policies,postings and communications.graniterock did nothing to interfere with drivers ability to take an meal period.rather,drivers did not take meal periods because they did not want them.no one went hungry they ate during their downtime.while dispatchers did not ask each employee every day whether wanted an meal period,every driver stated that if asked would say did not want one.the law does not require that the dispatchers ask each day because that would be an exercise in futility.the court further found that plaintiffs failed to prove that the drivers were forced,expected,or trained to involuntarily sign meal period agreements or to miss meal periods against their will.
the trial court entered judgment in favor of graniterock and plaintiffs filed this appeal.in addition,graniterock filed a of the trial court grant of plaintiffs motion for summary adjudication of graniterock affirmative defense related to the meal period agreement.

plaintiffs appeal 
plaintiffs raise two distinct arguments on appeal.first,plaintiffs argue as they did in the trial court that granitetock failed to meet its legal obligation to provide a lunch period to its concrete mixer drivers.in addition,plaintiffs assert a new argument on appeal that graniterock offered illegal financial incentives to induce its mixer drivers to forgo their meal period in lieu of increased pay.
standard of review 
the trial court factual findings are subject to limited appellate review and will not be disturbed if supported by substantial evidence.williams saunders th.when a trial court factual determination is attacked on the ground that there is no substantial evidence to sustain it,the power of an appellate court begins and ends with the determination as to whether,on the entire record,there is substantial evidence,contradicted or uncontradicted,which will support the determination.bowers bernards d,original emphasis omitted.as long as there is s
