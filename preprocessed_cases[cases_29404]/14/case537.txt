in this case,we address the application of the state prevailing wage law pwl see,et to private construction of a million animal control facility in long beach the city.the society for the prevention of cruelty to animals of los angeles built the facility,but it was partly funded by a million grant from the city that was expressly limited to project development and other preconstruction expenses.section requires that workers employed on public works be paid not less than the general prevailing rate of per diem wages for work of a similar character in the locality in which the public work is performed 
when the present contract was executed in,public works was defined as including construction,alteration,demolition,or repair work done under contract and paid for in whole or in part out of public funds,subd.a,italics added.as we observe,after the agreement was executed,and after the city grant money was used for preconstruction expenses,a amendment to section,subdivision a,was adopted to include within the word construction such activities as the design and preconstruction phases of construction,including inspection and land surveying work,items the city partly funded in this case.
we first consider whether the project here is indeed a public work within the meaning of section and former section.we will conclude,contrary to the court of appeal,that under the law in effect when the contract at issue was executed,a project that private developers build solely with private funds on land leased from a public agency remains private.it does not become a public work subject to the pwl merely because the city had earlier contributed funds to the to assist in defraying such preconstruction costs or expenses as legal fees,insurance premiums,architectural design costs,and project management and surveying fees.
this conclusion completely disposes of this case.we leave open for consideration at another time important questions raised by the parties,including whether,assuming the project indeed was a public work under section,it should be deemed a municipal affair of a charter city and therefore exempt from pwl requirements,and whether the pwl is a matter of such statewide concern that it would override a charter city interests in conducting its municipal affairs.resolution of these important issues is unnecessary and inappropriate here because the present project was not a public work subject to the pwl.
the following uncontested facts are largely taken from the court of appeal opinion in this case.the department of industrial relations department appeals from a judgment granting a petition for writ of mandate filed by the city.the city had sought to overturn the department determination that an animal shelter project financed in part with city funds and built on city lands was subject to the pwl.
in,the city entered into an agreement with,under which the city agreed to contribute million to assist in the development and preconstruction phases of a facility within city limits that would serve as an animal shelter and administrative headquarters.it would also provide kennels and office space for the city animal control department.the agreement required the city funds to be placed in a segregated account and used only for expenses related to project development,such as investigation and analysis of the property on which the shelter was to be built,permit,application,filing and other fees and charges,and design and related preconstruction costs.was specifically precluded from using any of the city funds to pay overhead,supervision,administrative or other such costs of the organization.
the city owned the land on which the facility was to be built,but leased it to for per year.the city in turn agreed to pay a year as rent for the space occupied by its animal control department.the agreement further provided it was interdependent,with lease and agreements between the parties with respect to the city land on which the project would be built.the agreement further stated that i f either the lease or is terminated then this agreement shall automatically terminate,without notice.finally,the agreement provided i f there is a claim relating to the payment of wages arising from the construction described herein,the city shall pay percent of all costs,expenses,penalties,payments of wages,interest,and other charges related to the claim,including attorneys fees and court or administrative costs and expenses.
the record shows a portion of the city financial contribution was spent on such preconstruction expenses as architecture and design,project management,legal fees,surveying,and insurance.the city estimated that an additional in architectural,legal,development and insurance expenses would be required for completion.the dissent observes that some of these additional funds may have been spent after actual construction began.the dissent cites a letter from the city indicating that by the time construction began,some additional funds had yet to be spent.dis.opn.d at,at.the record is unclear,however,if or when such funds were actually paid.but as we previously noted,the city agreement with required the city funds to be used only for project development,design and related preconstruction costs,and the issue before us is whether the term construction includes such activities.assuming some limited city funds were spent during construction,the record fails to demonstrate they were used for construction.
the project itself was completed in at a cost of approximately million.evidence obtained from the showed the project was intended to serve all of los angeles county and parts of orange county.animals from all these areas,not just from long beach,would be housed at the shelter.in addition,the facility would also house the headquarters.
section states in relevant part n ot less than the general prevailing rate of per diem wages for work of a similar character in the locality in which the public work is performed shall be paid to all workers employed on public works.in,when the present contract was executed,public works was defined as c onstruction,alteration,demolition,or repair work done under contract and paid for in whole or in part out of public funds,subd.a,italics added.the term construction was undefined.as discussed below,a amendment to section,subdivision a,adopted several years after the city executed its contract with and made its limited contribution,now includes within construction such activities as the design and preconstruction phases of construction,including inspection and surveying.
acting on an inquiry by a labor organization,the department began an investigation to determine whether the project was a public work under former section and was therefore subject to the prevailing wage rates that section mandated.the city argued that the project was not a public work,but even if it was,the prevailing wage law did not apply because it was strictly a charter city municipal affair.the department concluded the project was a public work and the city status as a charter city did not exempt it from the pwl.this determination was affirmed on an administrative appeal.the city filed a petition for a writ of mandate under code of civil procedure section,challenging the department decision that the pwl applied to the shelter project.the trial court granted the writ,and the department filed a timely appeal.the court of appeal reversed,concluding that the project was a public work under former section and section,the project was not a municipal affair exempt from the pwl,and even if the project was a municipal affair,the pwl was a matter of statewide concern,precluding exemption under the municipal affairs doctrine.concluding the shelter project was not a public work as then defined,we will reverse the judgment of the court of appeal.
discussion 
before proceeding with our analysis,we set out some established principles that will help guide our decision.in lusardi construction aubry cal th,d,lusardi,we spoke regarding the pwl general intent and scope.we observed that t he legislature has declared that it is the public policy of california to vigorously enforce minimum labor standards in order to ensure employees are not required or permitted to work under substandard unlawful conditions,and to protect employers who comply with the law from those who attempt to gain competitive advantage at the expense of their workers by failing to comply with minimum labor standards.citation.the overall purpose of the prevailing wage law is to protect and benefit employees on public works projects.citation.lusardi,supra,cal th at,d,italics added.
lusardi continued by observing that t his general objective subsumes within it a number of specific goals to protect employees from substandard wages that might be paid if contractors could recruit labor from distant areas to permit union contractors to compete with nonunion contractors to benefit the public through the superior efficiency of employees and to compensate nonpublic employees with higher wages for the absence of job security and employment benefits enjoyed by public employees.citations.lusardi,supra,cal th at,d.
in conducting our review,we must exercise our independent judgment in resolving whether the project at issue constituted a public work within the meaning of the pwl.mcintosh aubry th,d mcintosh.we have acknowledged that the pwl was enacted to protect and benefit workers and the public and is to be liberally construed.see lusardi,supra,cal th at,d.the law does,however,permit public agencies to form alliances with the private sector and allows them to enter into leases of public lands and to give financial incentives to encourage private,nonprofit construction projects that provide public services at low cost see,mcintosh,supra,th at,d international brotherhood of electrical workers board of harbor commissioners d.lease to private developer to construct oil and gas facilities and pay royalties not public work under former section.
courts will liberally construe prevailing wage statutes citations,but they can not interfere where the legislature has demonstrated the ability to make its intent clear and chosen not to act citation.mcintosh,supra,th at,d.here,we must determine whether the city contract with truly involved construction that was paid for in part with public funds.
the city observes that its million donation to was neither earmarked nor used for actual construction of the facility.the city agreement with specifically designated the contributed funds for preconstruction costs.those funds were in fact spent on architectural design,project management,legal fees,surveying fees,and insurance coverage.the city contends that,when the agreement was executed in,construction meant only the actual physical act of building the structure.
the city notes that only in,several years after the agreement was signed and after the city had contributed its funds to the project,did the legislature amend section,subdivision a,by adding a sentence stating for purposes of this paragraph,construction includes work performed during the design and preconstruction phases of construction including,but not limited to,inspection and land surveying work.stats,ch.the city views the foregoing amendment as a prospective change in the law,not a simple restatement of existing law.
the department,on the other hand,argues that the term construction would encompass the planning,design,and phases of a project,which would include architectural design,project management,and surveying.the city financial contribution to the project paid for all these items.in the department view,the amendment to section,subdivision a,merely clarified existing law.as will appear,we think the city argument makes more sense.
the court of appeal observed that the department position is supported by the common meaning of the word construction,citing a dictionary that defines construction as t he act or process of constructing.american heritage dict.college ed,italics added see also priest housing authority d.construction ordinarily includes the entire process required in order to erect a structure,including basements,foundations,and utility connections.but that definition begs the question whether the construction process includes the preconstruction activities involved here.other dictionaries give the word a more literal interpretation.
for example,webster third new international dictionary,page,gives a primary definition of construction as t he act of putting parts together to form a complete integrated object.oxford english dictionary ed,page,defines the word as the action of framing,devising,or forming,by the putting together of parts erection,building.thus,contrary to the court of appeal statement,dictionary definitions do not strongly support the department position.
the court of appeal also relied on the department own regulations and rulings interpreting and implementing the pwl.it noted that the department has defined construction as including field survey work traditionally covered by collective bargaining agreements,when such surveying is integral to the specific public works project in the design,preconstruction,or construction phase,tit,subd.c.the total project cost was approximately million.the record does not clearly show whether the minimal surveying work paid for out of the city donation met the collective bargaining and integral work elements of the department regulation.neither the court of appeal nor the briefs explore these aspects of the regulation.
in any event,assuming that regulation applies here,although we give the department interpretation great weight,people ex rel.lungren superior court cal th,d,this court bears the ultimate responsibility for construing the statute.when an administrative agency construes a statute in adopting a regulation or formulating a policy,the court will respect the agency interpretation as one of several interpretive tools that may be helpful.in the end,however,the court must independently judge the text of the statute.agnew state bd.of equalization cal th,d,quoting yamaha of america state board of equalization cal th,d.
the court of appeal also relied on the attorney general opinion citing the department regulation with apparent approval.but the question whether that regulation comported with the pwl was not before the attorney general,who was asked only whether the pwl applied to engineering firm employees whom the city hired to perform services that the city engineer ordinarily performed.that issue involved determining whether the work was performed under contract or carried out by a public agency with its own forces.as the opinion recites,the inquiry assumes that the work in question is a public work within the meaning of former section and section,supra,at.indeed,the attorney general conclusion was that the pwl applied to the engineering firm employees except with respect to such duties which do not qualify as a public work.id.at,italics added.thus,the opinion seems inconclusive for our purposes.in any event,as with the department own regulations,the attorney general opinions are entitled to considerable weight,but are not binding on us,state of cal.ex rel.state lands com.superior court cal th,d.
as noted,the city relies in part on the amendment to section,subdivision a,defining construction to include work performed during the project design and preconstruction phases.the city views the amendment as a change in existing law.it relies on an august,letter from the amendment author,senator john burton,seeking to respond to interested parties concerns regarding its operation.the letter recites that the amendment was intended only to operate prospectively and therefore will only apply to contracts for public works entered into on and after the effective date of the legislation which will be january.reg.sess.the present contract was executed in.
although letters from individual legislators are usually given little weight unless they reflect the legislature collective intent quelimane stewart title guaranty cal th,fn,d,metropolitan water dist.imperial irrigation dist.th,d,the burton letter was presented,prior to the bill enactment,to the full senate,which carried his motion to print it in the senate daily journal.indeed,the letter is printed and included under the n
