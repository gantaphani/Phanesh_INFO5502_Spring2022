in this case involving california occupational safety and health act labor code,et,tit,et,appellant overaa construction also known as overaa appeals from the trial court denial of a petition for writ of administrative mandamus code civ,in which overaa sought annulment of an administrative decision penalizing overaa,as controlling employer at a multiemployer construction site tit,for a violation of a safety regulation requiring a protective system for excavations deeper than five feet.
respondents on appeal are the appeals board the board,which issued the challenged decision after reconsideration,and the department of industrial relations,division of occupational safety and health the division,which cited overaa for the violation 
overaa contends the board improperly concluded it was immaterial whether overaa acted with reasonable diligence.overaa contends requires only the exercise of reasonable diligence by general contractors for hazards created by subcontractors,and allowing the regulatory violation to stand would impose a strict liability standard upon a general contractor.
we shall conclude that overaa fails to show grounds for reversal because the board properly held that the division did not bear the burden of proving,as an element of a prima facie case of a general violation,that the employer knew,or in exercising reasonable diligence should have known,of the violation the board was not called upon to decide whether reasonable diligence could be raised as an affirmative defense to a general violation,because overaa did not tender it despite incentive and opportunity to do so in response to being cited for a serious violation and the record demonstrates a lack of reasonable diligence by overaa 
accordingly,we shall affirm the judgment.
factual and procedural background 
overaa entered a public works contract with dublin san ramon services district to make improvements to a wastewater treatment plant.overaa subcontracted the electrical work to.
overaa contract with dublin san ramon services district contained provisions making overaa responsible for all work safety at the site,including work by subcontractors,and specifically for excavation safety overaa designated its superintendent,robert burke,as the competent person tit,a to supervise work safety.
after an inspection on february,division inspector clifton cooper issued to overaa a citation and notification of penalty,alleging a serious violation of title,section,which provides in part protection of employees in excavations.each employee in an excavation shall be protected from by an adequate protective system designed in accordance with section b or c except when a excavations are made entirely in stable rock or b excavations are less than feet in depth and examination of the ground by a competent person provides no indication of a potential.tit,a.
the division cited overaa for the violation pursuant to title,section,which authorizes citation against a controlling employer who is responsible by contract or actual practice for safety on the worksite.the division characterized the violation as serious and sought a civil penalty of.
the citation and notification of penalty stated the controlling employer failed to exercise the authority needed to protect workers from possible while they were working in an excavation at building d,located at dublin san ramon wastewater treatment plant,address.the employees were observed working at a depth of outside and a depth measured at inside,without any type of protective system.the controlling employer knew of the unprotected excavation for more than a week and took no action to direct the employer to provide a protective system for its exposed employees.
overaa protested the citation by filing an appeal,which stated as specific grounds for the appeal that the safety order was not violated,and the serious classification was incorrect.where the appeal form stated,explain any other reasons for appeal or issues to be raised on appeal.affirmative defenses must be specifically stated,overaa responded,general contractor overaa was not aware of the unprotected excavation.
at the hearing before the administrative law judge alj,inspector cooper testified he arrived for the inspection around and observed a employee working in the trench.cooper measured the distance from the top of the concrete surface slab to the deepest part of the trench several feet behind the worker at five feet,six inches.the soil was in poor condition because it rained for several days before the inspection.there was no protection against a.
cooper testified to his opinion that overaa should be cited as controlling employer b ecause they did exercise control and due diligence really in having the subcontractor protect its employees by,you know,putting in a protective inaudible.cooper added that overaa had the responsibility to oversee the excavation and authority to direct subcontractors on safety matters,by contract and by actual practice,and a competent person would have checked the excavation daily,particularly because of the rainy weather.
burke testified he was responsible for safety on the worksite,including work done by subcontractors,and would direct subcontractors to correct safety hazards.he was aware of the trench and checked it daily and believed it was less than five feet deep,but he did not check it on february,before the inspector arrived.burke and foreman,shayne holderby claimed the inspector did not actually measure the depth of the trench the alj disbelieved burke and holderby on this point,and burke further testified as follows 
do you know what the depth of the trench is in the area where this individual is standing in exhibit number a photograph taken by the inspector 
not exactly in feet and inches,it less than the five feet.
q.how do you know that 
well,i was out there prior to him being in there,prior to that day,at that time it was over five foot sic,
all right.ahead 
and making an observation of the man standing in there,and where his shoulder height is and relation to the concrete edge,it would be over five foot sic.
all right.so is it your testimony that as best you can recall,prior to february,you were aware of this trench or the area of this trench that depicted in exhibit 
and prior to february,you had drawn some conclusion regarding its depth 
and that was what 
less than the five foot sic.
burke believed shoring was not required because the excavation was less than five feet deep.
holderby testified he measured the depth as less than five feet.however,he did not include the thickness of the concrete surface slab.
in a written decision in august,the alj rejected overaa appeal.the alj expressly found cooper testimony more credible than that of burke and holderby regarding cooper actions.the alj also noted board precedent dalton construction company,app,decision after reconsideration required depth to be measured from the top of the surface slab.however,the alj reduced the classification of overaa violation from serious to general,because the division failed to prove a substantial probability of serious physical harm or death.the alj assessed a civil penalty of 
overaa filed with the board a petition for reconsideration,arguing overaa was not aware of the violation,did not create or subject its own employees to the hazard,was required as controlling employer merely to act reasonably,had acted reasonably by continuously evaluating operations and ensuring that conducted daily inspections of the trench.overaa also argued the trench was less than five feet deep.
on april,the board issued a decision after reconsideration,affirming the alj decision.the board decision stated in part 
employer maintains that the division incorrectly cited employer under section fn,ante because employer management representative did not have knowledge of the violation.employer position is that a controlling employer can only be held liable for violations it did not create where it is demonstrated by substantial evidence that a management representative of the general contractor had knowledge that an employee was exposed to a hazard in violation of any requirement enforceable by the division.
by its terms,the applicability of section is not conditioned upon a controlling employer knowledge of the violative condition.
employer next urges through out its petition that section be reasonably interpreted and applied to require a showing that a controlling employer can only be liable if it failed to exercise due diligence in discovering the violative condition.employer contends that federal law places the burden on the division to demonstrate that the employer failure to discover the violative condition was due to a lack of due diligence.
although federal courts may require proof of due diligence in discovering the violative condition,california is entitled to promulgate and interpret its own law.federal law does not preempt a state right to exercise its own sovereign powers over occupational safety and health provided that the state law is more stringent.the appeals board is not persuaded that the federal authority sufficiently sic cited by employer addresses the purposes of the california act.
the board also rejects employer suggestion that section must be interpreted as including a reasonableness standard to ensure that strict or absolute liability is not imposed upon the controlling employer.a modification of the express substantive terms of the established regulation is not within the board authority.
the board has strictly construed section c in the past.the plain reading of section c compels an interpretation that an employer who has responsibility,by contract or actual practice,for safety and health conditions at the worksite,is a controlling employer subject to citation for violation of a safety order.the regulation does not include the word reasonably nor does it contain any adjective defining the standard expected of the controlling employer in detecting or correcting hazardous conditions.
the board fails to see how employer use of a due diligence standard ensures as safe a workplace under the act as the division interpretation.employer interpretation would frustrate the affirmative duties of an employer under the act.an employer could potentially escape liability by pleading it did not have knowledge of information available to it at the time the violation was discovered.under this scenario,employer interpretation would bring about a defense which is deferential sic detrimental to the obligation mandated by the safety orders including the contractual safety responsibilities assigned to employer.
since the act is aimed at promoting a safe working environment for all employees by holding the controlling employer liable for detecting work site violations,we decline to interpret the regulation in a way that contravenes the purposes of the act.
based on these findings,the division does not need to establish that employer knew of the violation or,in exercising reasonable diligence,could have known of the section a violation in order for employer to be liable as a controlling employer under section.fns.omitted.
the board affirmed the alj decision finding a general violation of section,subdivision a and assessing a civil penalty of.
overaa filed in the trial court a petition for a writ of administrative mandamus.after consideration of briefs,declarations,and oral argument,the trial court initially indicated it would remand to the board to clarify whether the board decided the affirmative defense of due diligence.thereafter,the court reexamined the board decision and concluded the board decision did not contain any determination precluding overaa from raising an affirmative defense to a citation holding overaa responsible as a controlling employer for a safety order violation.therefore,concluded the trial court,remand was not necessary.
on october,judgment was entered,denying overaa petition for writ of mandate.the judgment said substantial evidence supported the board decision,and the board acted within its authority and discretion.the judgment further stated the board reasonably determined the division did not have to demonstrate overaa lack of knowledge of the violation or lack of due diligence in discovering the violation in order to make a prima facie case the board did not determine and had no occasion to determine whether diligence could be asserted as an affirmative defense,because overaa did not properly raise it at the administrative level although the board decision was ambiguously worded in places,in context it merely addressed the division prima facie showing,not any affirmative defense and had overaa raised the defense,it would have failed in light of the evidence in the administrative record establishing that overaa should have known of the violation in the exercise of due diligence.
overaa appeals from the judgment.
discussion 
standard of review 
our function on appeal is the same as that of the trial court in ruling on the petition for the writ.we must determine whether based on the entire record the board decision is supported by substantial evidence and whether it is reasonable.citations.where the decision involves the interpretation and application of existing regulations,we must determine whether the administrative agency applied the proper legal standard.citation.since the interpretation of a regulation is a question of law,while the administrative agency interpretation is entitled to great weight,the ultimate resolution of the legal question rests with the courts an agency expertise with regard to a statute or regulation it is charged with enforcing entitles its interpretation of the statute or regulation to be given great weight unless it is clearly erroneous or unauthorized.citations.the appeals board is one of those agencies whose expertise we must respect.citation.citation.however,a n administrative agency can not alter or enlarge the legislation,and an erroneous administrative construction does not govern the court interpretation of the statute.citation.rick electric occupational safety health appeals bd.th,d.

ii.no legal error in board decision 
overaa claims the issue on appeal is whether a general contractor,as a controlling employer,can be cited under for a general violation which was not created by and did not affect employees of the general contractor,regardless of and notwithstanding the general contractor exercise of due diligence.overaa claims the board so held in this case,overturning its own past precedents and such a holding imposes strict liability on general contractors.
as we discuss post,the administrative record in this case clearly shows a lack of due diligence by overaa.but setting that point aside for the moment,we shall explain that overaa misstates the issue and reads too much into the board decision.
the only issue before the board,hence the only issue decided by the board,was whether the division had the burden to prove lack of reasonable diligence by overaa as an essential element of the division prima facie case in order to establish a general violation of.
the board correctly decided the division did not have to prove lack of reasonable diligence by overaa.when the division alleges a serious violation as it initially did in this case,section fn,ante authorizes the employer to assert reasonable diligence as an affirmative defense.thus,section,subdivision b,states that a serious violation shall not be deemed to exist if the employer can demonstrate that it did not,and could not with the exercise of reasonable diligence,know of the presence of the violation,subd.b.
there would be no need for section statutory authorization for employers to assert diligence as an affirmative defense if lack of diligence were an element of the division prima facie case.
no parallel provision addresses employer diligence in the context of a general as opposed to serious violation.overaa offers no reason as to why the division should have a heavier burden in proving a general violation than it has in proving a serious violation.this case does not require us to decide whether diligence would constitute an affirmative defense to a general violation,because overaa did not adequately raise the issue,overaa had opportunity to produce evidence of diligence as a defense to being cited for a serious violation,and the evidence here clearly shows an absence of diligence,as we discuss post 
overaa notes section fn,ante expressly states its codification of the regulation identifying citable employers including controlling employer is declaratory of existing law and should not be interpreted as changing the law.overaa argues the legislation was not intended to abrogate the former policy,retained in the current legislation,that employers shall use practices reasonably adequate to make the workplace safe and do everything reasonably necessary to protect the life,safety,and health of employees.section similarly states no employer shall fail or neglect to do everything reasonably necessary for employee safety.we have said,t hese general statutes do not require an employer to take all conceivable steps to ensure safety,nor forbid an employer from adopting practices or methods which might conceivably result in harm to an employee.particularly given the employment at issue herein prison workers,no guaranty of safety is possible.california correctional supervisors organization,department of corrections th,d employee organization challenging employer staffing practices failed to prove abuse of discretion.
however,none of the authorities cited by overaa compels the conclusion that the division has the burden of proving an employer lack of reasonable diligence.
assuming for the sake of argument that the federal occupational safety and health act et would place the burden on federal enforcement agencies to show an employer lack of diligence,california is not precluded from establishing more stringent standards for.united air lines,occupational safety health appeals bd.cal d.overaa complains the board should explain why the federal standard should not be followed.the reason is that the california statutes do not support the position advanced by overaa.
as indicated,overaa did not assert reasonable diligence at the administrative hearing before the alj,though it had every opportunity and incentive to do so because the citation was for a serious violation.by the time the case got to the board,the alj reduced the severity from serious to a general violation.no statute makes reasonable diligence an essential element or an affirmative defense to a general violation.it would be illogical to conclude that the division must prove the employer lack of diligence regarding a general violation,even though the division has no such burden for a serious violation.
overaa claims the board imposed a strict liability standard by saying that title,section fn,ante should be strictly construed and is not conditioned upon a controlling employer knowledge of the violative condition.however,title,section merely identifies the types of employers who can be cited.the regulation does not operate in a vacuum but rather within the framework of the other relevant regulations and statutes.thus,the fact that title,section is not conditioned on the employer knowledge does not mean that controlling employers are strictly liable.
we recognize that portions of the board decision suggest the board viewed the employer reasonable diligence as immaterial to a general violation even if raised as an affirmative defense.thus,the board said the board fails to see how employer use of a due diligence standard ensures as safe a workplace under the act as the division interpretation.employer interpretation would frustrate the affirmative duties of an employer under the act.an employer could potentially escape liability by pleading it did not have knowledge of information available to it at the time the violation was discovered.under this scenario,employer interpretation would bring about a defense which is deferential sic detrimental to the obligation mandated by the safety orders including the contractual safety responsibilities assigned to employer.since the act is aimed at promoting a safe working environment for all employees by holding the controlling employer liable for detecting work site violations,we decline to interpret the regulation in a way that contravenes the purposes of the act.fn.omitted.
however,the board continued based on these findings,the division does not need to establish that employer knew of the violation or,in exercising reasonable diligence,could have known of the section a violation in order for employer to be liable as a controlling employer under section.
the question of reasonable diligence as an affirmative defense rather than an essential element of the division prima facie case was not in issue before the board.therefore,any comments suggestive of affirmative defense were unnecessary to the decision.
since overaa did not assert diligence as a defense in this case,we need not decide whether an employer reasonable diligence constitutes an affirmative defense to a general violation of 
overaa and its amici curiae argue that subsequent decisions cite this precedential overaa board decision as broad authority for the proposition that the controlling employer reasonable diligence is immaterial.however,no other case is before us in this appeal.moreover,as the parties acknowledge,one of the cited cases is currently being litigated in court,and another was an alj decision for which the board ordered reconsideration.
in a footnote,overaa suggests an irregularity in the membership of the board when it heard this case.we disregard this point,made perfunctorily in a footnote without development.placer ranch partners county of placer th,fn,d.
our conclusions that overaa failed to assert diligence at the administrative level and overstates the board decision render it unnecessary for us to address overaa arguments that the board improperly imposes a strict liability standard on general contractors,which is contrary to the legislative intent and could result in a less safe workplace.
we conclude overaa fails to show any error regarding any question of law.
iii.substantial evidence 
even though the division was not required to prove lack of diligence and overaa failed to raise diligence as a defense,overaa in the conclusion of its appellate brief asks this court either to find that overaa acted with due diligence or to remand for additional by the board.even if we were to entertain an argument improperly presented in the conclusion of a brief cal.rules of court,rule,overaa argument clearly lacks merit.
first,we observe the administrative record shows a lack of reasonable diligence by overaa.the evidence at the administrative hearing showed burke was aware of the excavation but did not measure it when work started on february,despite rainy weather,which obviously could affect the depth by loosening soil at the bottom of the trench.bur
