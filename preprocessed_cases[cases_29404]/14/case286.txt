the occupational safety and health review commission oshrc held that the secretary of labor secretary worksite policy for controlling employers controlling employer citation policy violated agency regulation a.the controlling employer citation policy provides that the occupational safety and health administration osha may issue citations to general contractors at construction sites who have the ability to prevent or abate hazardous conditions created by subcontractors through the reasonable exercise of supervisory authority regardless of whether the general contractor created the hazard creating employer citation policy or whether the general contractor own employees were exposed to the hazard exposing employer citation policy.the secretary filed a petition for review.we grant the petition,vacate oshrc order and remand for further proceedings.
background 
because the development of the controlling employer citation policy provides the framework and context for this case,we start with a historical review of the policy before detailing the relevant factual background.
a.the development of the controlling employer citation policy 
congress enacted the occupational safety and health act of osh act to establish a comprehensive regulatory scheme designed to assure so far as possible safe and healthful working conditions for every working man and woman in the nation.martin oshrc,d quoting b.the osh act assigns distinct regulatory tasks to two different administrative actors the secretary and oshrc.id.the secretary,through osha,creates and enforces workplace health and safety standards.see delegation of authority and assignment of responsibilities for occupational safety and health programs,delegating authority to osha.if the secretary determines that an employer failed to comply with such a standard,the secretary may issue a citation and assess a monetary penalty,martin,at.oshrc carries out the adjudicatory functions of the osh act.b martin,at.
the osh act describes an employer duties as follows 
a each employer 
shall furnish to each of his employees employment and a place of employment which are free from recognized hazards that are causing or are likely to cause death or serious physical harm to his employees 
shall comply with occupational safety and health standards promulgated under this chapter.
subsection a creates a general duty running only to an employer own employees,while subsection a creates a specific duty to comply with standards for the good of all employees on a worksite.see marshall knutson constr,cir united states moines,cir teal dupont de nemours,cir brennan oshrc,cir.
prior to the osh act,the secretary had promulgated health and safety standards for construction sites for federally funded and federally assisted projects under the construction safety act of,incorporated into.as part of osha inception,congress authorized the secretary to adopt numerous preexisting federal standards,including those of the construction safety act,as osha standards without rulemaking during a period of two years.a see sections have been merged into a single section,see,june.in may,the secretary used his authority to adopt these established construction standards as osha standards when he promulgated a,the regulation at issue in this case,which provides 
the standards prescribed in part of this chapter are adopted as occupational safety and health standards under section of the act and shall apply,according to the provisions thereof,to every employment and place of employment of every employee engaged in construction work.each employer shall protect the employment and places of employment of each of his employees engaged in construction work by complying with the appropriate standards prescribed in this paragraph.
a see adopting other preexisting federal standards.
nine days before the secretary issued this regulation,osha published its first field operations manual.this manual established the secretary worksite policy,a policy that indicates which employers at a construction site osha could cite for violations.according to this worksite policy,osha may cite employers who exposed their own employees to hazardous conditions or who created a hazardous condition endangering employees whether his own or those of another employer osha,field operations manual,at may.hence,the manual initial worksite policy adopted the creating employer and the exposing employer citation policies,but not the controlling employer citation policy 
initially,oshrc narrowly construed the worksite policy.in city wide tuckpointing serv,oshrc held that the secretary could not issue a citation to a subcontractor who created a hazard but whose own employees were not exposed to or affected by the hazard.osahrc.in gilles cotting,a scaffold used by a subcontractor had collapsed and killed two of the subcontractor employees.osahrc.none of the employees of the general contractor,gilles cotting,used or was affected by the scaffold.nevertheless,on january,the secretary issued gilles cotting a citation because as general contractor it had control of the job site id.at.this was the first time the secretary issued a citation based on the controlling employer theory.on review,oshrc found that congress intended that the obligations of a were predicated upon the existence of an employment relationship because a imposes duties only on each employer.id.at.thus,oshrc held that an employer is responsible for the safety and health of only those employees who work for the employer.because gilles cotting own employees were not directly affected by the scaffold violation,oshrc vacated the citation.other oshrc cases reaffirmed the city wide and gilles decisions that the intent of the osh act is to place responsibility for maintaining safe working conditions upon those employers who have endangered their own employees hawkins constr,osahrc,accord martin iron works,osahrc hrh constr,osahrc.
by,two federal courts of appeals began to question these oshrc decisions.for example,in brennan oshrc,the second circuit rejected oshrc interpretation of a and stated that a was in no way limited to situations where a violation of a standard is linked to exposure of his employees to the hazard.at.there,the court held that a permitted the secretary to issue citations based on the controlling employer and creating employer citation policies,rejecting the prohibition imposed on these policies by city wide and gilles.id.likewise,in oshrc,the seventh circuit noted in dicta that a lthough it is not necessary for a decision in the present case,we are not at all sure that a general contractor,who has no employees of his own exposed to a cited violation is necessarily excused from liability under the osh act,cir.
in light of these decisions,oshrc retreated from its position in city wide and gilles.see,bna oshc,cch oshd may,we find ourselves in general agreement with the principles enunciated in the cogent opinions of the second and seventh circuit courts of appeals.oshrc announced its revised position that a contractor who has either created a hazard or controls a hazardous condition has a duty under a to comply with osha standards even if the contractor own employees are not exposed to the hazard.id.at grossman steel aluminum,bna oshc,cch oshd may.
in,oshrc stated 
a lthough not an issue in this case,we are constrained to mention this commission position with respect to the third possible situation.under this third set of circumstances,we are dealing with a contractor that has either created a hazard or controls a hazardous condition and the only employees having access to the hazard are those of different contractors engaged in the common undertaking.we consider such a contractor to have a duty under a to comply fully with the standards furthermore,we note that typically a general contractor on a multiple employer project possesses sufficient control over the entire worksite to give rise to a duty under a of the act either to comply fully with the standards or to take the necessary steps to assure compliance.
bna oshc at.
in grossman steel,oshrc asserted 
the general contractor normally has responsibility to assure that the other contractors fulfill their obligations with respect to employee safety which affect the entire site.the general contractor is well situated to obtain abatement of hazards,either through its own resources or through its supervisory role with respect to other contractors.it is therefore reasonable to expect the general contractor to assure compliance with the standards insofar as all employees on the site are affected.thus,we will hold the general contractor responsible for violations it could reasonably have been expected to prevent or abate by reason of its supervisory capacity.
bna oshc at.
throughout this period,the secretary continued to address the worksite policy.in,after oshrc city wide and gilles decisions,osha altered its field operations manual such that the worksite policy included only the exposing employer citation policy.osha,field operations manual.in april,after the decisions by the second and seventh circuits,the secretary sought to implement an osha regulation for its worksite policy that would include the creating employer and the controlling employer citation policies.the secretary requested public comment on such a proposed regulation.citation guidelines in worksites request for public comment notice.however,before the comment period ended on may,oshrc had decided anningjohnson and grossman steel,which allowed the secretary to issue citations based on the creating employer and controlling employer citation policies.after these decisions,the secretary discontinued his efforts to promulgate through informal rulemaking an osh act regulation for the worksite policy.
after,the secretary occasionally altered the worksite policy.in,the correcting employer citation policy was added.it allowed osha to issue citations to the employer responsible for correcting the hazard even if its own employees were not exposed to the hazard.osha,field operations manual osha instruction cpl.in,the worksite policy was amended to add the creating employer and the controlling employer citation policies.osha,field inspection reference manual osha.the current osha manual was published in,and its worksite policy contains the same four citation employer,correcting employer,creating employer and controlling the version.see osha,field inspection reference manual osha instruction cpl.
since and grossman steel,general contractors have challenged the secretary authority to cite them for violations when their own employees are not exposed to any hazards related to the violations.see,universal constr,oshrc,cir challenging the controlling employer citation policy carbone constr.oshrc,cir same ibp,herman,same knutson,at same moines,at challenging the creating employer citation policy beatty equip.leasing sec y of labor,cir same.in knutson,this circuit held that a general contractor,as the controlling employer,has a duty under a to protect not only its own employees from safety hazards but all the employees engaged at the worksite.at.but see melerine avondale shipyards,cir holding that a does not extend employers responsibility beyond their own employees.we,therefore,have found that the secretary has statutory authority for the worksite policy,including the controlling employer citation policy.see knutson,at.
recently,the united states court of appeals for the district of columbia circuit has questioned whether the secretary controlling employer citation policy violates osha regulatory framework.see anthony crane rental,reich,see also ibp,at.in anthony crane,the court stated in dicta that it is not clear to us that the worksite doctrine is consistent with the secretary own construction industry regulation,a t he language of is in marked tension with the worksite doctrine at.however,because it was unnecessary to the outcome of the case,the court indicated that we leave to a later date the critical decision of whether to apply the worksite doctrine where an employer has been cited under the construction industry regulations of.id.at.to date,the only court to have addressed this issue has held that the secretary worksite policy did not exceed the scope of a.comm r of labor weekley homes.
factual background 
in this case,summit contractors,summit was the general contractor for the construction of a college dormitory in little rock,arkansas.because summit had subcontracted the entire project,it had only four employees at the construction site a project superintendent and three assistant superintendents.summit subcontracted the exterior brick masonry work to all phase construction,all phase.on two or three separate occasions,summit project superintendent had observed all phase employees operating without personal fall protection on scaffolds that lacked guardrails.the project superintendent had advised all phase to correct these problems.however,when all phase employees moved the scaffold to another location,they would again work without fall protection and without guardrails.
in june,an osha compliance safety and health officer observed all phase employees working on scaffolds over ten feet above the ground without fall protection or guardrails in violation of g vii.although it is undisputed that none of summit employees were exposed to any hazard created by the scaffold violation,the osha officer issued summit a citation for violation of g vii based on the controlling employer citation policy 
summit contested the citation,and the matter was referred to an administrative law judge alj.summit argued that a places a duty on employers to protect only its own employees,not those of any subcontractor.therefore,according to summit,a precludes the secretary from citing controlling employers whose own employees were not exposed to the hazardous condition.the alj upheld the citation and rejected summit position because a does not prohibit application of an employer safety responsibility to employees of other employers.
oshrc granted review and issued three separate opinions.although one of these opinions agreed with the alj,the other two held that a requires each employer to protect only its own employees and thereby precludes the controlling employer citation policy.therefore,oshrc vacated the citation,and its decision became the final order.because the alleged violation occurred in arkansas,the secretary filed a petition for review in our court pursuant to b.the secretary argues that the plain language of a does not preclude the controlling employer citation policy and that the courts should give deference to the secretary interpretation of the regulation.hence,we are required to address the critical decision recognized by the circuit.see anthony crane,at.

regulatory interpretation 
in examining the meaning of a,our inquiry begins with the regulation plain language.we look to see whether the language at issue has a plain and unambiguous meaning with regard to the particular dispute in the case.see robinson shell oil,d.the court will avoid an interpretation of a regulation that renders some words altogether redundant.united states alaska,d internal quotations omitted see ass of home builders defenders of wildlife,d cautioning against reading a regulation in a way that makes part of it redundant.we also should avoid a regulatory construction that would render another part of the same regulation superfluous.united states stanko,cir quoting united states,cir see ass of home builders.at,d avoiding an interpretation that would render part of the regulation superfluous jewett comm r,d same dryden lou budke arrow fin,cir same.any interpretation of a generally should conform to the accepted rules of grammar.see,dep t of hous.urban dev.rucker,d rejecting an interpretation of a statute that runs counter to basic rules of grammar.applying these construction rules,we must now determine whether a precludes the secretary from adopting the controlling employer citation policy.
the first sentence of a indicates that osha adopted the federal construction standards and that these standards now apply to all construction sites covered under osha rather than only federally funded and federally assisted construction contracts.the second sentence states 
each employer shall protect the employment and places of employment of each of his employees engaged in construction work by complying with the appropriate standards prescribed in this paragraph.
a.the subject of this sentence is each employer,the verb is shall protect,and the objects are employment and places of employment.the rest of the sentence contains prepositional phrases a preposition serves to link an object a noun or noun equivalent to another word in the sentence to show the relationship between them.chicago manual of style,ed.in this case,the preposition of serves to link the objects,employment and places of employment,to each of his employees.hence,grammatically reconstructed,the language of the regulation requires that an employer shall protect the employment of each of his employees part and that an employer shall protect the places of employment of each of his employees part.
in this case,the prepositional phrase of each of his employees serves as an adjective that narrows the meaning of employment and places of employment.see id.at a prepositional phrase can be used as a noun,an adverb,or an adjective id.at discussing limiting adjectives.because the term of each of his employees limits the term employment,part provides that an employer shall protect only the employment of his employees.stated differently,part provides that an employer shall protect only his employees however,this is not the end of the analysis.in part,the term of each of his employees limits the term places of employment such that the employer shall protect the places of employment where the employer actually has employees.see reich simpson,gumpertz heger,cir holding that the plain language of a establishes a duty of employers to protect only those construction sites where they have employees.unlike part,part of the regulation does not limit the employer duty to protect only the employer own employees.therefore,the plain language of part does not preclude an employer duty to protect the place of employment,including others who work at the place of employment,so long as the employer also has employees at that place of employment.see weekley homes,at.
summit contends that the regulation requires the employer to protect only his employees.because the creating employer,correcting employer and controlling employer citation policies permit osha to issue citations to employers when their own employees are not exposed to the hazard,summit reading of a effectively precludes these policies and only permits the exposing employer citation policy.although part may support this interpretation,part must provide something different to avoid being superfluous to part.summit argues that part requires the employer to protect only his employees at their places of employment.this interpretation creates two problems.first,summit interpretation is contrary to the grammatical construction of the sentence because it requires the term each of his employees to be the object of the sentence,rather than a prepositional phrase that modifies the actual objects of the sentence.second,summit interpretation would make the term places of employment redundant of the term employment and,therefore,superfluous.under summit interpretation,part provides nothing different from or in addition to part instead,it makes the term places of employment a subset of the term employment.granted,there will be times in which the protection of employment will not be directly related to the protection of a place of employment.for instance,an employee could be exposed to a dangerous condition during the course of employment but away from the worksite.however,the opposite is not true.summit can not provide and we can not envision a situation where the protection of a place of employment will not be directly related to or encompassed by the protection of employment.to give some independent meaning to the term place of employment would require the employer to protect others who work at that place of employment so long as the employer also has employees at that place of employment.therefore,we reject summit interpretation and conclude that a is unambiguous in that it does not preclude osha from issuing citations to employers for violations when their own employees are not exposed to any hazards related to the violations.
even if we were to find summit interpretation to be reasonable and that a was therefore ambiguous,we would defer to the secretary interpretation nonetheless.summit contends that we should not give deference to the secretary interpretation of a because the secretary did not adopt the controlling employer citation policy contemporaneously with the regulation and has not had a consistent worksite policy since a was enacted.see advanta usa,at.however,summit conflates the issues.we defer to the secretary interpretation of her regulation,a,and not the secretary interpretation of her worksite policy the secretary application of the worksite policy is only relevant to the extent that it sheds light on the secretary interpretation of a.
first,the secretary did not initially interpret a as limiting an employer responsibility to its own employees.contemporaneous with the enactment of the regulation in may,osha issued its first field operations manual that authorized the agency to cite employers who created a hazardous condition endangering employees whether his own or those of another employer osha,field operations manual,at may.by adopting the creating employer citation policy,osha held employers responsible for osha violations even when their own employees were not exposed to any hazards related to the violations.osha also started to issue citations based on the controlling employer theory only eight months after the promulgation of a.see gilles,osahrc at.
nonetheless,summit argues that the secretary did not initially intend a to extend an employer liability beyond the employer own employees because a did not adopt when it adopted the construction standards of the construction safety act.section is a regulation of the construction safety act published in subpart b of that contains language specifically extending an employer liability beyond its own employees.when the secretary issued a,the regulation adopted the standards published in subpart c and later subparts of,which do not include.see,c discussing which parts of are adopted.however,without more,the secretary failure to adopt does not prove that the secretary interpreted a to preclude her from extending an employer liability beyond its own employees,especially when the secretary adopted the creating employer citation policy in the osha field operations manual and started to issue citations based on the controlling employer theory shortly after the regulation was enacted.
second,we disagree with summit contention that the secretary has not consistently applied her interpretation of a over time.although the secretary altered the worksite policy to include only the exposing employer citation policy in its osha field operations manual,the secretary appears to have done so in response to oshrc city wide and gilles decisions,which held that the creating employer and controlling employer citation policies violated a.nonetheless,even after adopting this new worksite policy,the secretary continued to challenge the city wide and gilles decisions.see martin iron works,osahrc at hrh,osahrc at hawkins,osahrc at.the secretary had also requested public comment on a proposed regulation adopting the creating employer and the controlling employer citation policies.the secretary appears to have done this in response to various federal court of appeals decisions indicating that a does not preclude the creating employer and the controlling employer citation policies.see brennan,at,at.the secretary abandoned the informal rulemaking process after oshrc adjudications in and grossman steel,which established the creating employer and the controlling employer citation policies and held that the policies did not violate a thus,the secretary actions during this time period may provide insight into the secretary,oshrc and several courts interpretations of a,but they do not provide insight into the secretary interpretation of a.therefore,because there is no evidence in the record that the secretary has ever interpreted a to preclude her from holding an employer liable for osha violations that do not affect its own employees,we defer to the secretary reasonable interpretation that a does not preclude the controlling employer citation policy.
we find that the plain language of a does not preclude the secretary controlling employer citation policy.even if the regulation were ambiguous,we would defer to the secretary reasonable interpretation.therefore,oshrc abused its discretion in determining that the controlling employer citation policy conflicted with a,a legal conclusion that was not in accordance with the law.
alternative arguments 
summit argues that the controlling employer citation policy is premised on an expansive definition of employer and employee in violation of the supreme court direction in nationwide mutual insurance darden,d.in darden,the supreme court held that when congress leaves the term employee insufficiently clear,courts are to construe the term according to the conventional relationship as understood by agency doctrine.id.at.based on statements by commissioner cleary in his dissenting opinions,summit believes that the controlling employer citation policy is premised on a broad definition of employer and employee rather than the definition.after the city wide and gilles decisions,commissioner cleary contended for a broad worksite policy because t he definitions of employee and employer do not expressly require that ordinary relationship be adhered to.the term employee can not be construed solely according to common law concepts of master and servant.james roberts soule steel,osahrc,cleary,comm r,dissenting in part see hawkins,oshrc at cleary,comm r,dissenting t he employees of a subcontractor should be considered the employees of the general,or prime contractor,for purposes of the osh act.summit contends that oshrc adopted commissioner clearly broad definition of employer and employee when it decided and grossman steel.
summit misconstrues and grossman steel.nothing in those opinions remotely indicates that oshrc relied on a broad definition of employer or employee.rather,oshrc premised the controlling employer citation policy upon a,which,unlike a,does not base an employer liability on the existence of an relationship,bna oshc at grossman steel,bna oshc at see knutson,at.therefore,the controlling employer citation policy is not premised on an expansive definition of employer or employee and does not conflict with the darden decision.see sec y of labor trinity,cir holding that the worksite policy did not violate darden.
summit also argues that the secretary has no legal authority for the controlling employer citation policy.however,we held in knutson that a provides statutory authority for the controlling employer citation policy.knutson,at.we are bound by this decision unless the en banc court or the supreme court reaches a different result.see united states kent,cir a panel of this court is bound by a prior eight circuit decision unless that case is overruled by the court sitting en banc.quotation omitted alteration in original patterson tenet healthcare,cir t his rule does not apply when the earlier panel decision is cast into doubt by a decision of the supreme court.
nonetheless,summit raises a novel argument asserting that a limits an employer duty to provide a safe workplace for only his employees.section a uses the term occupational safety and health standards,which is defined as a standard which requires conditions reasonably necessary or appropriate to provide safe or healthful employment and places of employment.summit claims that employment must mean the common law relationship.see darden,at.therefore,according to summit,the duty expressed in a can not extend beyond the common law relationship.see ibp,at raising this argument in dicta.but see trinity,at rejecting a similar argument.
this argument contains the same defect as summit argument with respect to a.specifically,to make both terms meaningful,the use of the term places of employment must provide something different than the term employment.we agree that the term places of employment limits the employer duty to worksites where he has employees.however,it is not limited to only the employment of his employees because that interpretation would render the phrase places of employment redundant of employment and,therefore,superfluous.see ass of home builders.at jewett,at.dryden,at.
alternatively,summit contends that the controlling employer citation policy violates b because it would increase the employer liability at common law.the statute provides that n othing in this chapter shall be construed to supersede or in any manner affect any workmen compensation law or to enlarge or diminish or affect in any other manner the common law or statutory rights,duties,or liabilities of employers and employees under any law with respect to injuries,diseases,or death of employees arising out of,or in the course of,employment.b.the federal courts have held that this provision does not create a private cause of action and prevents federal preemption of state tort law and worker compensation schemes.gade solid wastes mgmt.ass n,d holding that b prevents federal preemption of state tort law and worker compensation schemes lindsey caterpillar,cir same am.fed of gov t employees,rumsfeld,holding that b does not create a private cause of action crane conoco,cir same ries passenger,cir holding that b prohibits private causes of action including the use of a violation of an osha regulation to establish negligence per se.because the controlling employer citation policy neither creates a private cause of action nor preempts state law,the policy does not violate b by increasing an employer liability at common law.
finally,summit and the amici argue that the controlling employer citation policy is an policy that is counterproductive to the goals of the osh act.it is uncertain what potential benefits are gained in citing both a subcontractor and a general contractor for a single osha violation when the general contractor had informed the subcontractor of the violation on prior occasions.although a general contractor plays a role in setting safety standards at worksites,osha is an intricate and regulatory regime such that each employer on a worksite may be uniquely situated to know of the very specific regulatory requirements affecting its particular trade.therefore,the controlling employer citation policy places an enormous responsibility on a general contractor to monitor all employees and all aspects of a worksite.however,these policy concerns should be addressed to congress or to the secretary and not to the courts.see.dep t of revenue piccadilly cafeterias,d i t is not for us to substitute our view of policy for the legislation which has been passed by congress.quotation omitted powerex reliant energy,d it is a policy debate that belongs in the halls of congress,not in the hearing room of this court.
iii.conclusion 
because we conclude that oshrc holding was contrary to law,we grant the secretary petition,vacate oshrc order and remand for further proceedings consistent with this opinion 
i concur in the panel majority the court analysis that a incorporates the requirements of a within the governance imposed by the occupational safety and health act of osh act i also concur in the court fundamental grammatic interpretation of a i disagree,however,with the court conclusion that the regulation,as the court construes it,is sufficiently ambiguous to require this court to defer to the secretary of labor decision to overrule the carefully reasoned decision of the occupational safety and health review commission commission vacating summit occupational safety and health administration osha controlling employer citation.accordingly,i dissent.
with regard to the last sentence of a,which reads e ach employer shall protect the employment and places of employment of each of his employees engaged in construction work by complying with the appropriate standards prescribed in this paragraph,the court says 
the subject of this sentence is each employer,the verb is shall protect,and the objects are employment and places of employment.the rest of the sentence contains prepositional phrases a preposition serves to link an object a noun or noun equivalent to another word in the sentence to show the relationship between them.chicago manual of style,ed.in this case,the preposition of serves to link the objects,employment and places of employment,to each of his employees.hence,grammatically reconstructed,the language of the regulation requires that an employer shall protect the employment of each of his employees part and that an employer shall protect the places of employment of each of his employees part.
ante at alteration in original.i fully agree with this analysis as far as it goes.the court neglects,however,to note that the prepositional phrase of each of his employees is further limited by the words engaged in construction work.
the court then correctly states,
the prepositional phrase of each of his employees serves as an adjective that narrows the meaning of employment and places of employment.chicago manual of style,a prepositional phrase can be used as a noun,an adverb,or an adjective id.at discussing limiting adjectives.because the term of each of his employees limits the term employment,part provides that an employer shall protect only the employment of his employees.stated differently,part provides that an employer shall protect only his employees.however,this is not the end of the analysis.in part,the term of each of his employees limits the term places of employment such that the employer shall protect the places of employment where the employer actually has employees.see reich simpson,gumpertz heger,cir holding that the plain language of a establishes a duty of employers to protect only those construction sites where they have employees.
ante at footnote omitted.
the court then advances a puzzling and unsupported extension of regulatory intent gleaned from these words.without further grammatic analysis or support from other inferences,the court posits that 
u nlike part,part of the regulation does not limit the employer duty to protect only the employer own employees.therefore,the plain language of part does not preclude an employer duty to protect the place of employment,including others who work at the place of employment,so long as the employer also has employees at that place of employment.
ante at emphasis added citation omitted.this statement is draws no nourishment from the words of a.the issue here is,of course,not what duty an employer may decide to impose upon himself but rather what an employer is required to do to avoid an osha sanction.part unambiguously requires summit to protect the places of employment of summit employees engaged in construction work for summit.nothing more,nothing less indeed,i find no words that support the idea that this sort of bureaucratically created ambiguity is the stuff of deference that should be accorded the secretary in disputes she has with the commission.
the court attempts to buttress the analysis with equally unsupported interpretive exercises.the court says,for instance,f irst,summit interpretation that it can be cited only for violations by its own employees is contrary to the grammatical construction of the sentence because it requires the term each of his employees to be the object of the sentence,rather than a prepositional phrase that modifies the actual objects of the sentence.ante at.this is incorrect summit interpretation clearly and correctly retains of each of his employees as an adjectival limitation on one or the other of the sentence objects employment or places of employment.the court then states,s econd,summit interpretation would make the term places of employment redundant of the term employment and,therefore,superfluous.ante at.this analysis is likewise incorrect.as properly construed there is no redundancy at all between the terms employment and places of employment.employment refers to an individual personal involvement with his or her daily work.places of employment refers to geographic locations at and around the construction site.but,the court argues,u nder summit interpretation,part provides nothing different from or in addition to part instead,it makes the term places of employment a subset of the term employment.ante at.the court also states,
an employee could be exposed to a dangerous condition during the course of employment but away from the work site.however,the opposite is not true.summit can not provide and we can not envision a situation where the protection of a place of employment will not be directly related to or encompassed by the protection of employment.
ante at.this is also incorrect,summit can provide easily envisioned situations that refute the court contention.
first,the words engaged in construction work will make it extremely unlikely that employment away from the work site will be in any way governed by a.and even if it is,protection of such work would not displace places of employment regulations.
the osh act provides a complicated,interrelated and complex set of rules that apply to sundry work situations.individual mastery of the osh act myriad upon myriad of details is very likely impossible.the osh act imposes safety regulations involving the individual worker that require,for instance,protective clothing,respirators and safety equipment of every kind.these regulations protect a particular worker physical being and may or may not do so in conjunction with particular places at the job is,operations at discrete geographic locations on the premises.
this particular dispute is illustrative of my point.the court notes that a subcontractor employees were working ten feet or more above ground on scaffolding without the guardrails required by osha rules.the guardrail requirement is a rule directed toward the place of,working upon scaffolds.if the employees were interior walls or blowing loose insulation into building spaces,osha rules almost certainly would require face masks,and probably,respiration protection equipment,although i concede that i have not specifically researched the applicable rules.this type of personal,individual equipment would be protection of employment.
another hypothetical situation comes to mind.assume a furnace is being installed during construction of a new power plant,and the furnace burners and interior portions need to be fired up,tested,inspected and adjusted by specially trained personnel.other employees may also be worki
