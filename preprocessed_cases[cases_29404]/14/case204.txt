on march,white oak delivered a development plan to the washington township planning commission which proposed a residential condominium development on the property the proposal.the proposal called for a planned unit development pud and included to units.at units,the proposal equated to a density of five units per acre.the prices of the units would start in the low range.
on march,white oak presented the proposal to the washington township trustees during a regular meeting.defendants janie wills and alan hanselman were both trustees at the time.wills asked whether the development was going to be section or low income housing.
on march,white oak presented the proposal to the washington township zoning commission.danny bolend e r,the chairman of the zoning commission,drafted and distributed a letter to residents claiming that the zoning commission had recommended denial of the development,and that the residents should urge the trustees to deny it as well.bolender specifically distributed the letter to those residents living directly adjacent to the property,on wardlow road and shroufe road in washington township.bolender himself owns property on wardlow road.
in a letter dated may,the trustees and the zoning commission denied the proposal.the denial was based on the intensity of use provision in the zoning resolution,which states 
section.intensity of use 
every lot districted as commercial or industrial shall have a minimum of three acres.
every lot districted as residential shall have a minimum of three acres if the dwelling is connected to an sewage disposal system,or a minimum of one acre if the dwelling is connected to a public sanitary sewer system.
the letter states s ince your proposed development plan does not conform to the washington township zoning regulations,it can not be approved as it is now set forth.if you wish to submit a revised plan that does not violate the washington township zoning regulations,please do so.
on may,white oak attended another trustee meeting and protested the denial.white oak challenged the defendants interpretation of the zoning resolution,arguing that the intensity of use provision did not support defendants denial of the proposed development.white oak argued that the intensity of use provision does not prohibit dwellings,as long as each dwelling sits on one or three acres,depending on its sewer.white oak pointed out that the definition of dwelling in the zoning resolution includes multiple family dwellings 
structure,or portion thereof occupied or intended to be occupied exclusively for residential purposes.
single family detached,independently standing structure occupied or intended to be occupied exclusively for residential purposes by one family or housekeeping unit.
multiple family detached,independently standing structure occupied or intended to be occupied exclusively for residential purposes by more than one family or housekeeping unit.
as such,white oak argued that the intensity of use provision imposes no limitations on the number of units that can be included in a dwelling.
on june,the trustees held another meeting.during the meeting the trustees voted to close shroufe road from the luke property on back.this action would effectively eliminate access to the property because shroufe road into the property,and the luke property is the last property before the property on shroufe road.
on june,the trustees voted to pass resolution,which asks the brown county commissioners to vacate shroufe road at the mark.the brown county commissioners subsequently denied the request.
on july,the trustees voted to rescind the tif agreement.the vote came following a motion by bolend e r,who was in the audience.defendants maintain that the tif agreement was rescinded because the original developer was required to provide the township with an unconditional,irrevocable letter of credit,but no letter of credit was ever issued.white oak maintains that bolend e r met secretly with wills and hanselman and discussed rescinding the tif.wills and hanselman deny that these meetings took place.
white oak brings its claims pursuant to,the fair housing act,et,et,and ohio law.white oak claims the zoning resolution is unconstitutional on its face defendants have violated the fair housing act defendants violated its substantive and procedural due process rights the township has violated ohio law by acting outside its statutory authority defendants engaged in a civil conspiracy in violation of ohio and federal law wills and hanselman have publicized matters which place white oak in a false light and wills and hanselman have defamed white oak.white oak also seeks a declaration that the zoning resolution is unconstitutional on its face.
subsequently,the parties filed a stipulation of partial dismissal of claims in which the parties dismissed white oak claims for false light invasion of privacy and defamation without prejudice.

white oak argues that the zoning resolution is facially vague in both substance and procedure.
in association of cleveland firefighters city of cleveland,cir,we set forth the applicable law governing vagueness challenges 
we have recognized that the vagueness doctrine has two primary goals to ensure fair notice to the citizenry and to provide standards for enforcement by officials.with respect to the first goal,the supreme court has stated that a statute which either forbids or requires the doing of an act in terms so vague that men of common intelligence must necessarily guess at its meaning and differ as to its application,violates the first essential of due process of law.connally constr.with respect to the second goal,the supreme court stated that if arbitrary and discriminatory enforcement is to be prevented,laws must provide explicit standards for those who apply them.a vague law impermissibly delegates basic policy matters to officials for resolution on an ad hoc and subjective basis.grayned city of rockford.
id.at first and third internal citations omitted.
white oak asserts that the zoning resolution allows it to build multiple family dwellings on its residential property and,alternatively,that the applicable provisions are vague.according to white oak,article v,section a limitation on dwellings in a residential district to single family dwelling s conflicts with the definitions section of article iii.that section defines dwelling generally,then subdivides the term into single family dwelling and multiple family dwelling,providing definitions for each.
white oak reliance upon article iii general definitions as authorization to construct multiple family dwellings is misplaced.the more specific and relevant permitted uses in article v,section a unambiguously restricts dwellings in a residential district to those that are single family dwelling s.we need not settle for the canon of statutory construction expressio unius est exclusio alterius the mention of one thing implies the exclusion of another to infer that multiple family dwellings are prohibited because section b of article v says so prohibit s a ny other use not specifically permitted in this section.
even assuming that the definitions section has some relevance,it fails to support white oak interpretation.the definition for dwelling does not indicate that the term should be understood to encompass both single and multiple family dwellings each time the word dwelling appears generally in the zoning resolution.in fact,article v,section a illustrates the fallacy of such a reading.in that provision,the terms single family dwelling and dwelling appear in a single phrase,and dwelling clearly refers to single family dwelling only 
permitted uses 
one single family dwelling subject to lot size requirements,dwelling size requirements,and all other requirements as set forth herein.
emphasis added.
white oak reliance upon the intensity of use in article iv,section a is likewise erroneous.that section sets forth different acreage requirements for lots supporting dwelling s.specifically,each lot housing a dwelling connected to an sewage disposal system must have a minimum of three acres,and each lot housing a dwelling connected to a public sanitary sewer system must have a minimum of one acre per lot.although the general term dwelling appears in this clause,and dwelling is not expressly delimited to single family dwelling,it is apparent that its purpose is to prescribe the minimum acreage for each lot containing a dwelling,not to specify the type s of dwellings single multiple family permitted on each lot.indeed,the provision revealingly falls beneath the lot size.while the definitions and intensity of use provisions are certainly not models of clarity multiple family dwelling could be deleted from the definitions,and dwelling could more accurately be replaced with single family dwelling in the intensity of use lot size requirements,the constitution prohibition against excessive vagueness does not invalidate every statute which a reviewing court believes could have been drafted with greater precision.rose locke.
white oak additional argument that the zoning district regulations are vague because they allegedly permit construction of only one single family dwelling in a residential district is unavailing.white oak interpretation would produce an absurd cap at one single family dwelling in an entire residential district.when the permitted uses limitation is read in conjunction with the intensity of use lot size requirements,a harmonious construction devoid of vagueness is achieved.
white oak also argues that the zoning resolution procedures for obtaining approval to construct a new dwelling are vague.its complaints concern the processes for obtaining a zoning construction certificate and submitting an application for development.the zoning resolution requires a zoning construction certificate for all new dwellings,and the procedure for obtaining this certificate is as follows 
applications for zoning construction certificates are obtained from the zoning inspector or his designee.
every application shall be accompanied by a sketch or drawing indicating the location of all buildings and structures to be erected in relation to all property lines,street lines and.for applications involving dwellings,the sketch or drawing must also indicate the location of flood plains.
every application shall include the proper sewer or septic permit,as applicable,and that permit will be verified by the zoning inspector with the appropriate agency.
within ten days after receipt of an application,the zoning inspector shall either approve or disapprove the application in conformance with the provisions of this resolution.
zoning construction certificates shall be issued only in conformity with the provisions of this resolution unless the zoning inspector receives written order from the board of zoning appeals deciding an appeal,conditional use or variance.
regarding developments,the zoning resolution provides,in full 
developments 
commencing with the effective date of this amendment,land divided from the original lot of record into three or more lots for the development of dwellings will be considered a development.
a development must be platted accurate site layout or paper survey before an application for development is filed with the zoning inspector.
if the board of trustees approves the application for development,the development as defined in the application may proceed.
the lots per the application must be surveyed and recorded,and the comparison of the recorded lots with those described in the application approved by the board of trustees,prior to zoning certificates or zoning redistrict changes being issued or approved.
if there are declared roads in the application,then those roads must be built to minimum county standards for public transportation and their construction approved by the board of trustees prior to zoning certificates or zoning district changes being issued or approved for the lots fronting those roads.
according to white oak,the zoning construction certificate process is vague because it contains no guidance as to when in the development process the zoning construction certificate applies and does not specify whether the zoning inspector or the property owner must apply for the certificate.emphasis in original.the provisions addressing the application for development are also allegedly vague because they do not identify the content or timing of any such application,the zoning resolution makes no other reference to any such application,and t here is also no attempt to correlate the application for development with the zoning construction certificate.
ironically,white oak vagueness challenge to these procedures is nebulous in itself.white oak discussion is perfunctory,and we hold that the issue is forfeited.united states robinson,cir we have cautioned that issues adverted to in a perfunctory manner,unaccompanied by some effort at developed argumentation,are deemed waived,and that it is not sufficient for a party to mention a possible argument in the most skeletal way,leaving the court to put flesh on its bones.citation and internal quotation marks omitted.
in any event,while the procedures may not qualify as standards for precision,they are not constitutionally infirm.significantly,the applicant has fair notice of,and need not speculate about,whether his proposed development will be approved before he begins construction and makes significant expenditures.although imperfect,the procedures sufficiently detail the requirements,process,and timing for obtaining approval of a plan of construction.
white oak argues that the density,zoning construction certificate,and application for development procedures are void for vagueness because they permit arbitrary and unbridled discretion ary enforcement.this argument is without merit.
the heart of white oak argument is its refrain,already rejected,that the township denial of its proposed housing development was arbitrary.however,we agree with the district court that t he limit of one single family dwelling is objective and does not permit ad hoc,discriminatory enforcement of the zoning resolution.
moreover,the township officials do not have unbridled discretion in the enforcement of the challenged zoning laws.as already discussed,the provisions relating to the zoning construction certificate and the development section are not unconstitutionally vague.those provisions mandate that the zoning inspector grant or deny a zoning construction certificate w ithin ten days after receipt of an application,and the inspector decision must be in conformance with the provisions of this resolution.apart from its amorphous allegations,white oak fails to explain adequately how the challenged provisions permit arbitrary and discriminatory enforcement.accordingly,white oak attempt to void the zoning resolution,or portions thereof,for vagueness fails.
next,white oak argues that the township rejected its proposed development for unlawful,discriminatory reasons,in violation of the fair housing act,et fha.according to white oak,trustee wills inquiry at the march,trustees meeting,in which she asked whether the proposed development would be section or low income housing,and trustee dotson deposition testimony characterizing the community concerns about subsidized housing within the proposed development as a big issue demonstrate unlawful discrimination based upon income or race.
the fha makes it unlawful t o discriminate against any person in the terms,conditions,or privileges of sale or rental of a dwelling,because of race,color,religion,sex,familial status,or national origin.b.as an initial observation,we note white oak lack of evidence and implausible argument that condominium units starting in the low range qualify as housing.even if the development transitioned to or subsidized housing after construction,the plain language of the fha does not prevent discrimination based on low income,and white oak cites no authority that says otherwise 
to clear this hurdle,white oak recasts its argument as a allegation,arguing that a prohibition against housing would have a disproportionately adverse impact on minority groups.it asserts that t his court has recognized the racial impact of preventing low income or public housing,relying upon united states city of parma,cir.in city of parma,we affirmed the district court ruling that the housing practices within a cleveland suburb ran afoul of the fha because a series of actions by the city of parma had both the purpose and effect of maintaining parma as a virtually community within metropolitan cleveland,an area where a n extreme condition of racial segregation exists.id.at citations and internal quotation marks omitted.however,the evidence of record in city of in the present a pervasive pattern and practice of racial discrimination in housing decisions by parma officials,including parma small fraction of one per cent black population compared to the black population in the cleveland metropolitan area,parma reputation for hostility toward blacks,statements of elected officials of parma which were either overtly racist or were found to have racist meanings,and a history of challenged housing decisions,all of which were based on a desire to keep minorities out of the community and had an acute and foreseeable segregative effect on this virtually city.id.at citation and internal quotation marks omitted.
in stark contrast to city of parma,there is no evidence in the present case suggesting an unlawful discriminatory intent or impact on the basis of race.washington township is a rural area.white oak has presented no evidence about the minority population in or near washington township and,more specifically,about the possible impact the prohibition on dwellings would have on minority populations in the township.white oak assumes,without any evidentiary support,that minorities will be adversely affected.
for these reasons,we hold that the district court properly granted summary judgment to the township on white oak fha claim.
white oak argues additionally that the zoning resolution blanket prohibition on housing violates the equal protection clause of the fourteenth amendment to the united states constitution.it relies upon the supreme court decision in village of arlington heights metro.housing dev,u.and the district court ruling in dews town of sunnyvale,d.white oak reliance on both cases is misplaced.neither case holds that a prohibition against housing is a per se equal protection violation,and both cases address as applied equal protection challenges,rather than a facial equal protection claim like the one white oak asserts.
white oak cites village of arlington heights for the proposition that a racially discriminatory intent or purpose behind prohibiting multiple family housing is a violation of the equal protection clause of the fourteenth amendment.however,the holding in village of arlington heights that r espondents simply failed to carry their burden of proving that discriminatory purpose was a motivating factor in the village decision to rezone land from to classification,id.at,undermines white oak claim of discrimination.moreover,the village of arlington heights court identified a list of sources that might provide evidence of discriminatory intent t he historical background of the challenged decision t he specific sequence of events leading up to the challenged decision d epartures from the normal procedural sequence s ubstantive departures,particularly if the factors usually considered important by the decisionmaker strongly favor a decision contrary to the one reached and t he legislative or administrative history id.at footnote omitted.white oak facial challenge ignores these sources.had it asserted an equal protection challenge,the scant evidence of record would fail to tilt any of these factors in white oak favor.
dews held that a city ban on apartments and zoning requirement violated the equal protection clause because a discriminatory intent could be inferred from the disproportionate harm to,as evidenced by statistical and survey data,d at,the perpetuation of racial segregation,id.at,the lack of a legitimate,bona fide governmental interest,id.at,the availability of less discriminatory alternatives to existing zoning,id.at,and the considerations set forth in village of arlington heights,id.at.again,white oak facial equal protection challenge does not address these factors.
in a nutshell,the authorities upon which white oak relies hold that a racially discriminatory intent is required to support an equal protection claim.however,white oak has wholly failed to demonstrate that the zoning resolution prohibition against dwellings,on its face,discriminates on the basis of race,and it has provided no evidence remotely suggesting that the township rejection of its proposed development was motivated by a racially discriminatory purpose.in addition,white oak cites no authority that a zoning prohibition against developments,particularly in a rural area,constitutes a per se equal protection violation,and no such authority exists.
therefore,we hold that the district court properly granted summary judgment in the township favor on white oak equal protection claim.
white oak challenges the district court dismissal of its substantive du
