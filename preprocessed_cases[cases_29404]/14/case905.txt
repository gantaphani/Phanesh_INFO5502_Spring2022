government code section,subdivision b all undesignated section references are to this code requires that a local government agency approve by ordinance or resolution any fee increase for building permits and other services,and section,subdivision a requires that any challenge to a fee increase be commenced within days of the effective date of the legislation or the effective date of any automatic adjustment increase.in this case,we conclude that the trial court erroneously applied the limitations period to a claim that a local government agency improperly increased such fees without having the increase approved by resolution or ordinance and we reject the argument of the local agency that its regulatory scheme provided for automatic adjustment of its fees.accordingly,we reverse the judgment and remand the matter to the trial court for further proceedings on this issue.we also conclude that the limitations period barred all challenges to an original resolution setting forth a schedule for such fees and we affirm that part of the judgment.
factual and procedural background 
in,the city of encinitas the city adopted ordinance the ordinance,which requires that building permit fees be set by a resolution of the city council,but authorizes the city building official to set the determination of value or valuation of particular types of planned structures.the city building official carries out this authorization by assigning a valuation known as the valuation multiplier to different categories of structures,based on the type of building and its expected occupancy.the ordinance gave the city building official complete discretion on setting the valuation multipliers.
in,the city council approved resolution the resolution,which included a schedule of fees that would be charged for the city building department services,including issuing building permits and conducting building inspections.the fee schedule listed a range of building values and provided a method for calculating the various permit and inspection fees based on the monetary value of the proposed building.the city calculates permit and other fees owed on the development of a particular structure by multiplying the square footage of the proposed building by the valuation multiplier attributable to the structure type and occupancy category of the proposed building.the city provides informational handouts to building permit applicants to assist them in calculating the amount of fees that will be charged for a proposed structure.
homebuilder barratt american incorporated barratt sued the city and its city council for a refund of building permit fees the city charged in connection with barratt development of three residential neighborhoods.barratt alleges it paid the city over in fees in connection with the three residential developments.the city calculated the amount of the fees using valuation multipliers set forth in a schedule issued by the san diego area chapter of the international conference of building officials icbo in a document entitled building valuation multipliers for effective date august.however,the icbo valuation multipliers varied from those used by the city in the resolution and barratt alleges this change increased the fees applicable to its developments.
in october,barratt filed this action seeking a fee refund under section of the mitigation fee act the act.in its complaint,barratt asserted that the fees charged under the resolution violated the law because,among other things,the fees exceeded both the estimated reasonable and actual costs to the city of providing the service for which they were charged,in violation of sections and,the amount of the fees was not submitted to,or approved by,a popular vote of of electors eligible to vote on the issue,as required under sections and,and the increase in fees from those set forth in the resolution was not approved by city council ordinance or resolution,as required under section,subdivision b.
at trial,the city contended that barratt claims were barred by the applicable statute of limitations and,pursuant to the parties stipulation,the trial court conducted trial on that issue first.in a bench trial,the court concluded that barratt claims were in accordance with the limitations period set forth in section and it entered judgment in the city favor.barratt appeals.
all challenges to the resolution are untimely under section 
barratt asserts that the fees charged under the resolution are improper because the resolution did not include a valuation multiplier schedule or an independent standard by which the city building official was required to set the valuation multiplier and it seeks a refund of fees paid to the city under the resolution.the trial court concluded that the limitations period contained in section barred barratt claims.we affirm this conclusion as to these claims because the plain language of the statutes supports it.
we examine the words of a statute to give them their usual and ordinary meaning and construe the statutory words and clauses in the context of the statute as a whole.people murphy cal th,d.the plain language of a statute governs if it is unambiguous and does not involve an absurdity.people ledesma cal th,d.
section establishes procedures for any party to protest the imposition of any fees levied on a particular development project by a local agency,subd.a hill city of fresno th,d hill.this section requires a local agency to provide a project applicant written notice of the amount of the fees,indicating that the applicant has days to protest the fees,subd.d.any party who files a protest may then file an action attacking the imposition of the fees within days after delivery of the city notice,subd.d.
barratt contends the limitations period of section applies to this action and that the statute never began to run because the city failed to provide the required written notice.however,we conclude that section,which applies to lawsuits challenging the decision of a local agency to promulgate or change a fee and requires that such an action be commenced within days of the effective date of the legislation or any automatic adjustment increase sets forth the applicable limitations period,subd.a see hill,supra,th at,d.
barratt challenges the resolution under sections and.section,which expressly applies to building permits and inspection fees,subd.d,specifies that any judicial action or proceeding challenging a fee there under is subject to the requirements of section,subd.e.similarly,section,which specifies that fees associated with building inspections and building permits shall not exceed the estimated reasonable cost of providing the service for which the fee is charged,subd.a also specifies that a judicial action or proceeding to challenge a fee charged under an ordinance or resolution shall be brought pursuant to s ection,subd.c.
in contrast,section only applies to fees,dedications,reservations,or other exactions imposed on a development project,as defined in section,subd.a.section defines a fee and expressly excludes from this definition fees for processing applications for governmental regulatory actions or approvals,the fees at issue in this action,subd.b.thus,the plain language of the applicable statutes shows that the limitations period contained in section does not apply to barratt claims.utility cost management indian wells valley water dist.cal th,d,concluding that the plain meaning of section supported its application to a claim seeking a refund of capital facilities fee charges.
barratt points out that section does not specifically cite to subdivision b of section,contending that the application of section should not be limited by the definition of fees contained within subdivision b of section.however,this argument ignores the specified purpose of section,which is to provide definitions for certain terms,including a fee.see.the legislative counsel has similarly concluded that section does not include fees associated with plan check or inspection fees.ops.cal.legis.counsel,development fees.
based on the foregoing,we reject barratt assertion that section applies to this action and agree with the t
