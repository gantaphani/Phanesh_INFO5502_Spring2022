cynthia burch challenges an order granting summary adjudication in favor of premier homes,llc premier homes,custom home builders,custom home builders,scott warren,and daniel sahar in a construction defect action.the defendants argued that the right to repair act,et provides the exclusive remedy for a homeowner seeking damages for construction defects and precludes common law causes of action for negligence and breach of implied warranty.custom home builders,warren,and sahar also argued that they owed burch no duty of care and that they could not be liable for breach of implied warranty because they were not parties to any contract with her.
we hold that the right to repair act does not provide the exclusive remedy for a homeowner seeking damages for construction defects that have resulted in property damage,as here.in addition,we also conclude that custom home builders,warren,and sahar failed to negate a duty of care owed to burch as a prospective purchaser and failed to negate an implied warranty in favor of burch as a third party beneficiary of the construction contract.we therefore conclude that the court erred by summarily adjudicating the counts for negligence and breach of implied warranty in favor of the defendants.
factual and procedural background 
factual background 
custom home builders,a general contractor,built a single family residence in pacific palisades area of los angeles pursuant to a written construction contract with premier homes,the developer.the residence was not built specifically for burch,but instead was built to be marketed to the general public.after the construction was completed and the home was put on the market,burch purchased it from premier homes pursuant to a written sales contract.warren and sahar are the principals and owners of both custom home builders and premier homes.
burch filed a complaint against premier homes,custom home builders,warren,sahar,and others in december.she filed a third amended complaint in august.she alleged in her third amended complaint that the home suffered from numerous construction defects.she also alleged that premier homes and custom home builders were the alter egos of the individual defendants.she alleged counts for breach of the sales contract negligence breach of implied warranty unjust enrichment breach of party beneficiary and other counts.
burch alleged in her second count for negligence that the defendants breached their duty of care in connection with the construction,resulting in deficient construction.she specified several defects that allegedly have resulted in property damage.she alleged in her third count for breach of implied warranty that premier homes contracted with custom home builders for the construction and that custom home builders was aware that a party such as burch would purchase the property.she alleged that the defendants impliedly represented to her,as a third party beneficiary,that they had used reasonable skill and judgment in the construction and alleged that they breached such implied warranty.
summary adjudication 
custom home builders,warren,and sahar jointly moved for summary judgment or summary adjudication of several counts.premier homes also separately moved for summary judgment or summary adjudication.the defendants argued that the right to repair act established a statutory action for violation of the standards set forth in the act as the exclusive remedy for damages for construction defects and abrogated common law claims for damages for construction defects.
custom home builders,warren,and sahar also argued with respect to the negligence count that they had no contractual or other relationship with burch and owed her no duty of care.they argued,with respect to the count for breach of implied warranty,that they could not be liable for such a breach because they were not parties to any contract with burch.they also argued that an implied warranty could arise only in connection with the sale of goods and that they did not enter into a sales contract with burch or sell her any goods and therefore could not be liable for breach of implied warranty.
the trial court granted summary adjudication in favor of custom home builders,warren,sahar,and premier homes on the second count for negligence and third count for breach of implied warranty,among other counts.at the hearing on the motions,the court cited civil code sections and in support of its ruling.the court denied summary adjudication of the fifth count for breach of party beneficiary,stating in a minute order that there was a triable issue whether plaintiff is a third party beneficiary of the contract between premier homes and custom home builders.
petition for writ of mandate 
burch petitioned this court for a writ of mandate in may challenging only the summary adjudication of the second and third counts.we issued an order to show cause.
fourth amended complaint 
meanwhile,burch moved for leave to file a fourth amended complaint.the trial court granted the motion,and burch filed a fourth amended complaint in september adding a new tenth count for damages pursuant to the right to repair act.she alleges in the tenth count that the defendants breached their duty of care and caused defects that violate the standards set forth in civil code section or are otherwise actionable pursuant to civil code section.she lists the same defects previously alleged in the second count for negligence and realleged in the fourth amended complaint in a negligence count against other defendants.she does not reallege the counts for negligence and breach of implied warranty against the defendants who successfully moved for summary adjudication of those counts.
contentions 
burch contends the right to repair act does not provide the exclusive remedy for damages for construction defects,and the trial court erred by summarily adjudicating her counts for negligence and breach of implied warranty on this basis and custom home builders,warren,and sahar failed to negate the existence of a duty of care and an implied warranty.
discussion 
standard of review 
summary adjudication of a cause of action is appropriate only if there is no triable issue of material fact as to that cause of action and the moving party is entitled to judgment on the cause of action as a matter of law.code civ,subd.f.a defendant moving for summary adjudication of a cause of action must show that one or more elements of the plaintiff cause of action can not be established or that there is a complete defense,subd.p.if the defendant makes that initial showing,the burden then shifts to the plaintiff to show that a triable issue of material fact exists.ibid.
we review the trial court ruling de novo,liberally construe the evidence in favor of the party opposing the motion,and resolve all doubts concerning the evidence in favor of the opposing party.miller department of corrections cal th,d.we must affirm a summary adjudication if it is correct on any ground that the parties have had an adequate opportunity to address on appeal,regardless of the trial court stated reasons.johnson united cerebral children foundation th,d western mutual ins.yamamoto th,d see,code civ,subd.m.bell cox,th.
contrary to the defendants argument,burch filing of a fourth amended complaint after the trial court ruling did not render moot her challenge to the ruling.burch has shown no intention of abandoning her counts for negligence and breach of implied warranty against the defendants and need not reallege those summarily adjudicated counts in each amended complaint in order to avoid a waiver.national union fire ins.of pittsburgh,pa cambridge integrated services group,th,held that the plaintiff need not reallege in an amended complaint a count to which a demurrer had been sustained without leave to amend in order to challenge the ruling on appeal.
the right to repair act does not preclude the counts for negligence and breach of implied warranty 
the california supreme court in aas superior court cal th,aas,held that deficiencies in residential construction were actionable in tort only if they caused property damage or personal injury.the legislature enacted the right to repair act in abrogating the holding in aas by allowing the recovery of damages for specified defects resulting in only economic loss.liberty mutual ins.brookfield crystal cove llc th,liberty mutual greystone homes,midtec,th.the act sets forth construction standards the violation of which constitutes a deficiency in construction for which a builder,as defined in the act,and to some extent a general contractor and others,can be held liable to a homeowner without the need to show property damage or other injury.the act also prescribes a nonadversarial prelitigation procedure for the parties to follow in an attempt to resolve the dispute,litigation procedures for claims under the act,and the measure of damages.
civil code section states that in any action for damages arising out of or related to deficiencies in residential construction,a builder liability,and to some extent the liability of a general contractor and others,is limited to liability for violation of the construction standards set forth in the right to repair act,except as specifically stated in the act.civil code section prescribes the measure of damages for violation of the standards set forth in the act.civil code section,subdivision a states,except as provided in this title,no other cause of action for a claim covered by this title or for damages recoverable under section is allowed.in addition to the rights under this title,this title does not apply to any action by a claimant to enforce a contract or express contractual provision,or any action for fraud,personal injury,or violation of a statute civil code section specifically excepts from the limitation of liability under the act any defect that causes damage.
thus,the right to repair act abrogates the holding in aas,supra,cal th,by providing a remedy for particular residential construction defects that cause no property damage.the act,however,does not limit or preclude common law claims for damages for construction defects that have caused property damage.liberty mutual,supra,th at.liberty mutual examined the act and its legislative history and concluded that the act does not provide an exclusive remedy and does not limit or preclude common law claims for damages for construction defects that have caused property damage.id.at.we agree.
burch alleged in her second count for negligence in her third amended complaint that the defendants breached their duty of care resulting in deficient construction,including but not limited to specified defects that caused property damage.she alleged in her third count for breach of implied warranty that the defendants breached an implied warranty with respect to the construction.both counts allege common law claims for damages for construction defects,including defects allegedly resulting in property damage.we conclude that the right to repair act does not preclude such common law claims and that the summary adjudication of the second and third counts on this basis was error 
the defendants failed to establish the absence of a duty of care 
custom home builders,warren,and sahar also argued in their motion for summary adjudication that they had no contractual or other relationship with burch,owed her no duty of care,and therefore could not be liable for either negligence or breach of implied warranty.we first will address the negligence count.
the existence of a duty of care is an essential element of a negligence cause of action.bily arthur young cal th,bily.whether a duty of care exists in a particular case is a question of law for the court to decide.ibid.the existence of a duty of care in the absence of privity of contract is a policy question that depends on the balancing of several factors,including the extent to which the transaction was intended to affect the plaintiff,the foreseeability of harm to the plaintiff,the degree of certainty that the plaintiff suffered injury,the closeness of the connection between the defendant conduct and the injury suffered,the moral blame attached to the defendant conduct,and the policy of preventing future harm,quoting biakanja irving cal d,biakanja.
bily involved an action for professional negligence brought by investors against an accounting firm that had prepared an independent audit of a client financial statements.bily,supra,cal th at.bily focused on three central concerns with allowing all merely foreseeable third party users of audit reports to sue the auditor on a theory of professional negligence id.at the auditor could face potential liability far out of proportion to its fault the class of plaintiffs in such an action,generally more sophisticated business lenders and investors,could control and adjust the risks by contract rather than rely on tort liability and potential liability to third parties would more likely result in an increase in the cost and decrease in the availability of audit services,rather than more careful audits.id.at.in light of these considerations,bily held that an auditor liability for negligence in connection with performing an audit of a client financial statements is limited to the client.id.at.
biakanja,supra,cal d,involved a negligence action against a notary public who prepared a will in which the plaintiff was named as the sole beneficiary.the will was denied probate because it lacked proper attestation.as a result,instead of receiving the entire estate under the will,the plaintiff received only of the estate by intestate succession.id.at.applying the six factors listed above biakanja factors,biakanja stated that the defendant must have been aware that the plaintiff would suffer a loss if the will were declared invalid,and the plaintiff would have received the entire estate but for the defendant negligence.id.at.the defendant clearly was not qualified to draft a will and supervise its execution,and by doing so he had engaged in the unauthorized practice of law,a misdemeanor.id.at.biakanja concluded that the defendant owed the plaintiff a duty of care despite the lack of privity of contract.ibid.
stewart cox cal d applied the biakanja factors in holding that a concrete subcontractor was liable to homeowners for the negligent construction of a swimming pool,despite the lack of privity of contract.id.at.the plaintiffs had settled with the general contractor who agreed to construct the pool for them.id.at.stewart stated that the subcontractor work was intended to benefit the plaintiffs as owners and that it was foreseeable that they would suffer property damage if the pool was not sound.there was no doubt that the plaintiff suffered serious damage caused by escaping water,and the trial court found based on ample evidence that the injury resulted from the defendant negligence.id.at.stewart concluded that the subcontractor should not be exempted from liability if negligence on his part was the proximate cause of the damage to plaintiffs.ibid.
sabella wisler cal d held that a developer and contractor who built a home for the purpose of offering it for sale to the public was liable to the purchasers for negligent construction.id.at.the house was negligently constructed on insufficiently compacted filled land.id.at.applying the biakanja factors,sabella stated that although the house was not built specifically for the plaintiffs,they were members of the class of prospective homebuyers for which the defendant built the house.sabella,supra,at.thus as a matter of legal effect the home may be considered to have been intended for the plaintiffs,and wisler owed them a duty of care in construction.citation.ibid.the harm to prospective homebuyers was foreseeable,it was undisputed that the house was seriously damaged,and there was a close connection between the defendant negligence and the injury suffered.ibid.finally,the prevention of future negligent construction of buildings upon insufficiently supportive material would not be furthered by exempting defendant wisler from liability for his negligence.citations.id.at.
custom home builders,warren,and sahar as the parties moving for summary adjudication had the initial burden to present evidence showing that burch could not establish an element of her negligence count.in our view
