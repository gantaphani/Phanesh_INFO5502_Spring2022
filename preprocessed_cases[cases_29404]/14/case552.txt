the california department of transportation caltrans and papich construction company,papich appeal from the trial court issuance of a writ of mandate to vacate the award of a public works contract to papich.the trial court granted the writ on grounds caltrans erroneously rejected a bid by desilva gates construction lp desilva as nonresponsive,and erred by awarding the contract to papich despite papich failure to comply with a material requirement of the information for bids.on appeal,caltrans and papich argue desilva bid was nonresponsive because desilva impermissibly changed its list of subcontractors.appellants also argue caltrans had discretion to waive papich mistake in failing to acknowledge the addendum to the information for bids.
on our own motion,we requested that the parties address whether this case has become moot.based on the parties representations,we conclude this case remains justiciable.
desilva has elected not to file a respondent brief.nonetheless,we examine the record on the basis of appellant brief and reverse only if prejudicial error is found.baldwin baldwin d,jarvis d.walker porter d.in this case,we conclude the trial court did not err.desilva disclosure of a subcontractor performing work amounting to only of one percent of the total value of the contract was not required by the public contract code or caltrans information for bids.the additional information was accurate,albeit unnecessary,and did not render desilva bid nonresponsive.by contrast,caltrans initially declared papich bid to be nonresponsive and then waived papich mistake and determined the bid to be responsive.we conclude caltrans abused its discretion by awarding papich the contract.accordingly,we affirm the trial court issuance of the writ of mandate.
factual and procedural history 
caltrans information for bids 
in july,caltrans issued an information for bids on a construction project estimated to cost million to widen a section of highway in tulare county.the invitation for bids contained a section regarding disclosure of subcontractors that instructed bidders as follows 
c subcontractor list in the subcontractor list,list each contractor to perform work in an amount in excess of of percent of the total bid or,whichever is greater et the subcontractor list must show the name,address,and work portions to be performed by each subcontractor listed.show work portion by bid item number,description,and percentage of each bid item subcontracted.on the subcontractor list you may either submit each subcontracted bid item number and corresponding percentage with your bid or fax these numbers and percentages to within hours after bid opening.failure to do so results in a nonresponsive bid.italics added.
on september,caltrans issued an addendum to the information for bids.specifically,the addendum indicated that bids would be opened on september,instead of september,project plan sheets,and were revised,and items,and in the bid book bid item list were revised as well.the addendum concluded by advising potential bidders to submit bids for this work with the understanding and full consideration of this addendum.the revisions declared in this addendum are an essential part of the contract.
the submitted bids 
caltrans received and opened nine bids on september.security paving company,security submitted the lowest bid for.desilva submitted the bid by offering to perform the work for.desilva bid included the names and description of work by all subcontractors slated to perform work exceeding of one percent of the bid amount.the same day,desilva faxed to caltrans additional information within hours of bid opening hour subcontract list.desilva hour subcontractor list included all steel fence,a subcontractor not listed in desilva bid.all steel fence was listed as performing fences,gates,railing work work that constituted all of bid item numbers and as well as one percent of bid item number.cumulatively,all steel fence was estimated to perform worth of work.papich submitted the bid,proposing to perform the work for.papich bid did not acknowledge or accept the addendum to the information for bids.
caltrans assessment of the bids 
caltrans determined security bid to be nonresponsive for revision of its subcontractor list after a protest by desilva on september.on september,desilva became the apparent low bidder.
on september,caltrans sent a letter to papich noting the company failed to acknowledge addendum dated september,on the signature page of its bid proposal.caltrans considers the addendum to be a material amendment to the contract and is unable to identify in papich bid submittal that it considered and agreed to be bound to the terms of said addendum.a bidder failure to acknowledge a material amendment to the contract renders its bid nonresponsive.unless papich is able to provide documentary evidence that it establishes it considered and agreed to be bound by the requirements of addendum its bid may be rejected.
in the same letter,caltrans noted papich listed subcontractors truesdell corporation and viking construction as each performing one hundred percent of several of the same tasks,including removal of unsound concrete,preparing concreted bridge surface,rapid setting concrete patch,and five more tasks.in the letter,caltrans cured the problem by stating that i f papich is awarded contract,it must perform these tasks with its own forces to comply with section.
on september,papich sent a response letter stating it is the intent of papich to provide,as requested,evidentiary proof of receipt attachment and acknowledgement included with the bid book attachment of addendum for the above mentioned contract.papich also contends that the information provided by caltrans in addendum was reviewed,understood and utilized in the preparation of our bid proposal for this contract.papich also agrees to be bound by the requirements of addendum.
on september,desilva sent a letter to caltrans noting desilva had inadvertently supplied caltrans with additional information on the subcontractor list above and beyond what was required.desilva explained it had not listed all steel fence as a subcontractor in its bid because the value of the bid items it would perform was less than of one percent of the bid and the information for all steel fence included on the subcontractor list submitted within hours of the bid was additional information that was not required.
on october,papich challenged desilva bid as having changed the subcontractor list.
on october,caltrans rejected desilva bid as nonresponsive and explained since desilva originally decided to self perform fences,gates and railing,but subcontracted those items to all steel fence,on the revised bid list received on september,caltrans finds your bid is nonresponsive.caltrans will proceed to award the contract to the lowest responsible bidder provided all requirements are met.
on october,desilva protested caltrans determination that its bid was nonresponsive and protested papich bid.on november,caltrans agreed with part of the protest and determined papich bid to be nonresponsive.caltrans informed papich that its bid is nonresponsive because it failed to properly submit the subcontractor list.however,on december,caltrans rescinded its determination based on its conclusion that some of the items separately listed as structure excavation,structure concrete,and structure backfill were parts of what was otherwise described as bridge work.caltrans december,letter to papich did not address papich failure to acknowledge the addendum to the information for bids.
on december,caltrans rejected desilva protest and explained no unfair advantage was granted to papich by asking for evidentiary documentation proving it considered and agreed to be bound by the addendum.also on december,caltrans sent a letter to desilva affirming its determination desilva bid was nonresponsive and awarding the contract to papich.
issuance of the writ of mandate and subsequent appeal 
in january,desilva filed a petition for writ of mandate in which it requested that the trial court invalidate caltrans award of the contract to papich.caltrans and papich opposed the petition.the trial court issued a statement of decision in which it explained caltrans erred in determining desilva bid to be nonresponsive and in waiving papich failure to agree to the addendum to the information for bids.papich objected to the statement of decision,and the trial court overruled the objections.
in august,papich and caltrans timely filed notices of appeal after the trial court granted a peremptory writ to set aside the contract.
in september,desilva filed in this court a petition for relief from the automatic stay created by the appeal taken by caltrans and papich.desilva requested immediate relief in the form of an order staying performance of the contract at issue in this case.caltrans and papich opposed the petition.papich opposition rested,in part,on its assertion that w rit relief has not proved to be a particularly effective remedy either.by the time a final determination is made,the work is typically completed,or underway to the point,as here,that it makes little sense to stop because of the expense involved in halting a major project.
this court denied desilva petition for relief from the automatic stay on october.

in wilson,supra,th at page,the appellate court held completion of a public works project prior to the appeal mooted the legal challenge to validity of contracts under which the project was carried.based on the possibility that completion of the public works construction in this case moots the present appeal,we inquired of the parties whether this court can still grant effective relief in the event appellants prevail.caltrans,papich,and desilva responded and represented to this court that the construction project remains underway and,as a consequence,this court may still grant effective relief.we accept the representations by all parties that this matter has not become moot.more importantly,we agree with caltrans that the case presents issues on appeal that are of public importance and likely to recur.thus,we proceed to consider the issues on the merits.
rejection of desilva bid as nonresponsive 
caltrans and papich contend desilva bid was properly rejected as nonresponsive to the information for bids because of the difference in subcontractors listed in the original bid and in the hour subcontractor list.we reject their contentions.
lowest responsible bidder with responsive bid 
caltrans was required to award the contract at issue in this case to the lowest responsible bidder.requiring that,if the estimated cost for public construction project exceeds,the district or agency shall solicit bids in writing and shall award the work to the lowest responsible bidder or reject all bids.a bid is responsive if it promises to do what the bidding instructions require.mcm,city county of san francisco th.thus,a responsive bid must conform to the public agency specifications for the contract.bay cities paving grading,city of san leandro th,bay cities paving.
as part of a responsive bid,bidders on public construction contracts must list subcontractors who will provide work above a certain threshold amount.as pertinent to this case,the public contract code requires any bid for construction of any public work or improvement list,in the bid or offer to perform the work,t he name,the location of the place of business,and the california contractor license number of each subcontractor who will perform work or labor or render service to the prime contractor in or about the construction of the work or improvement in an amount in excess of of percent of the prime contractor total bid or,in the case of bids or offers for the construction of streets or highways,including bridges,in excess of of percent of the prime contractor total bid or ten thousand dollars,whichever is greater,subd.a.subdivision b of section specifies that t he prime contractor shall list only one subcontractor for each portion as is defined by the prime contractor in his or her bid.
on appeal from a judgment that resolves a challenge to the award of a public contract,our function is the same as the trial court to decide whether the public entity decision is supported by substantial evidence.our review is limited to an examination of the proceedings to determine whether the public agency actions were arbitrary,capricious,entirely lacking in evidentiary support,or inconsistent with proper procedure.there is a presumption that the public agency actions were supported by substantial evidence we may not reweigh the evidence and must view it in the light most favorable to the public agency actions,indulging all reasonable inferences in support of those actions.ghilotti construction city of richmond th,ghilotti.
desilva hour subcontractor list 
as the trial court noted,t he parties do not dispute whether desilva was required to list all steel fence in its bid or hour subcontractor list it was not.here,the information for bids echoed the requirement of section that every bidder on the contract in this case disclose every subcontractor slated to perform more than of one percent of the work.under desilva bid of,of one percent amounts to.desilva hour subcontractor list included work by all steel fence amounting to constituting less than of one percent of desilva bid.even so,caltrans notified desilva its bid was nonresponsive on grounds desilva did not list all steel fence in its original bid submission.caltrans asserted it assumed desilva gates originally decided to self perform fences,gates and railing so that subsequent delegation of the work to all steel fence constituted a material change in the bid.
desilva bid was responsive 
desilva bid was responsive to caltrans information for bids and complied with the public contract code.papich and caltrans do not dispute desilva had no legal requirement to list all steel fence in its bid.thus,when caltrans initially opened bids on september,there were no grounds for declaring desilva bid to be nonresponsive.accordingly,desilva bid became nonresponsive only if the submission of desilva hour subcontractor list ran afoul of the information for bids or the public contract code.
although desilva hour subcontractor list was not exactly the same as its subcontractor list on the original bid,all steel fence was not slated to perform more than of one percent of the total contract amount.thus,the disclosure of all steel fence scope of work in desilva hour subcontractor list constituted additional information that was accurate but unnecessary.the listing of all steel fence was not deceptive,indicated no shift of work from another subcontractor to all steel fence,and showed no attempt by desilva to flout the requirements of the information for bids.notably,the information for bids did not prohibit the listing of subcontractors performing work amounting to less than the threshold disclosure amount of of one percent.because nothing prohibited the additional but unnecessary disclosure of subcontractors,desilva bid was not re
