factual and procedural background 
dpr is the prime contractor on a university project for the design and possible construction of the ucsf medical center at mission bay,which includes an energy center,an outpatient building,and a hospital.
the initial bidding 
in august,dpr solicited bids for the mep work on the project,which was to be awarded in two phases an immediate subcontract for preconstruction services,and a subsequent change order for construction services,to be awarded if the university decided to proceed with actual construction.subcontractors were invited to bid on six individual bid packages and one alternative combination package 
energy center heating,ventilation,air conditioning hvac plumbing 
outpatient building hvac plumbing 
hospital plumbing 
bp alt an alternate combination of any or all of,
all facilities electrical 
for each package,bidders were to submit prequalification materials,a best value questionnaire bvq,a lump sum preconstruction bid that included labor rates,and an option percentage fee for future construction.the project was to be awarded based on the best value method of competitive bidding.according to a selection process set out in the bid solicitation,dpr and the university would prequalify bidders,determine a total bvq score for each prequalified subcontractor,based on its financial condition,relevant experience,demonstrated management competency,labor compliance,and safety record,subd.g conduct a blind bid opening,and identify the best value bid,subd.b by applying a formula to the lump sum preconstruction bid,labor rates,and option percentage and dividing the result by the bidders bvq scores.the instructions to bidders provided b idders submitting bids will be announced and all cost or price information will be secured until the completion of the qualifications evaluation.final evaluation of the best value contractor shall be done in a manner that prevents cost or price information from being revealed to the committee evaluating the qualifications of the bidders prior to completion and announcement of that committee decision.
sci submitted bids for and,but not.southland submitted bids for both and,along with a letter offering the university a substantial discount if it was awarded both we feel there will be certain synergies and less staff required to perform the phase one work if we are awarded both and bid packages together.as such,we are pleased to offer a deduct of from our combined and quotes.
four days after the blind bid opening on october,dpr notified all bidders that in the best interest of ucsf,it was rejecting all bids and conducting a rebid.
dpr requested resubmission of bids in accordance with amended instructions to bidders that invited bids on through from the initial bidding,as well as the following alternative combination packages 
bp,energy building hvac plumbing 
bp,hospital plumbing hvac wet 
bp,hospital hvac wet and dry 
the amended instructions to bidders indicated that bp,had been added as a new bid package alternate.the instructions provided mechanical subcontractors can only bid on the bid package alternates if a stand alone bid package is submitted.subcontractors were allowed to submit a rebid only on the bid packages for which they had submitted a bvq in the initial bidding.sci submitted a protest,contending this requirement precluded it from bidding on bp,because it had not bid earlier on and that the rebid instructions favored subcontractors who had bid initially on both and.sci asked that dpr withdraw the new package or permit sci to bid on.sci also asked dpr to explain by example the method of selection of the successful bidders,including how the bvq score is applied to single entity bids versus alternate bids.this needs to be clearly defined before the bid.for example how will you compare the combination of,and with bp,in conjunction with 
dpr revised the instructions to bidders shortly thereafter to allow subcontractors who had bid initially on either or to submit a bid on the other package.the revised instructions to bidders gave subcontractors the option to submit additional bvq information for bp,and advised them that if no new information was submitted,bvqs for and would be reviewed and reevaluated for the combination package.sci withdrew its protest the next day,noting that the revised instructions took care of our concerns.dpr and the university never responded to sci request for an explanation of how the individual packages would be compared with the alternative combination packages.
the best value bid in the rebid was to be determined by a different formula than the one set out in the initial instructions to bidders.the formula for the rebid incorporated the same components,including the lump sum preconstruction cost,labor rates,and option percentage,but in the rebid,the preconstruction cost,which had been weighted in the initial bidding by a multiplier of as it reflects a greater importance,was weighted by a multiplier of only.the formula also factored in an representing the monthly cost to the university if the preconstruction process extended beyond one year,weighting it by a multiplier of.as in the initial bidding,the best value bid would be determined by dividing the result of the formula calculation by the bidder bvq score.
in the rebid,sci submitted bids for and,as well as a team bid for,along with a letter guarantee ing that if selected as the successful bidder sci can perform two of the total bid packages bid.sci did not submit a bid for bp.only two bids were submitted on this package,one from southland and one from acco engineered systems acco.southland and acco did not submit additional bvq information specifically for bp,noting they were relying on their bvqs for and.the same four subcontractors submitted bids for and,including southland,acco,and sci.
less than a half hour after sci president,richard schram schram,dropped off sci bid for,he received a telephone message from dpr asking whether sci had bid on bp.schram told his secretary to inform dpr that sci had not bid on this package.later that day,dpr regional manager for the bay area,george pfeffer pfeffer,called schram again,asking whether he intended to bid on bp.schram said he did not 
on november,the blind bid opening was conducted by two dpr employees and a university representative,yvonne kyrimis kyrimis.the sealed bids were commingled,and each was placed into an envelope marked with a letter.the bidders were assigned different letters for each bid package.identifying each bidder by letter only,kyrimis read off the bid figures to a dpr employee,who entered them into the computer.kyrimis testified that she was the only person who saw the bid amounts associated with each bidder name and that she did not reveal this information before the public bid opening.
pfeffer and two university representatives,lisa henderson henderson and stuart eckblad eckblad the committee then selected the bid packages that would be awarded.the committee decided to award a contract on the alternative combination package,bp,instead of and.at the time of their decision,committee members knew the identities of the bidders on each package and had received a spreadsheet that showed the bid amounts but identified each bid only by letter the committee did not know which bid each subcontractor had submitted.pfeffer testified that the committee did not have the bvq scores at that time and did not know the best point value,subd.b.
on december,dpr announced only that four bid packages had been selected bp,energy building bp alt,dry and wet and electrical.the lowest responsible bidders on these packages were not yet identified.dpr indicated that the identities,bids,and best value scores of the bidders would be announced december,and that the final bidding results would be posted the following day.
later that day,schram sent dpr an email message,asking is it your intent to open and report all bvq scores for all bid packages and,specifically,whether and would be scored,combined,and compared with bp,in order to determine the best value score and bidder.original underscoring.the next day,sci submitted a formal protest regarding the bidder selection process.
on december,dpr announced the bidders identities,bids,and bvq scores for the selected bid packages.the following day,the university computed the bids and posted the results.southland was the lowest responsible bidder on bp,as its bid offered the lowest cost per quality point best value ratio for that package.
sci protest 
sci maintained in its protest that the bid documents do not allow for a unilateral of bid packages and that it easily could have submitted a combination bid for bp,if the bid documents had documented that dpr could bid packages.sci noted that s ince all bids were to be considered under the best value criteria,it was not necessary to submit a combination bid.sci asked that its individual bids for and be combined and compared to the bids for.the university referred sci protest to eckblad,who was director of the office of design and construction at ucsf medical center.eckblad overruled the protest,noting that the bid instructions allowed dpr and the university to choose alternates in the university best interest.
a week later,on december,sci sent a written to the construction review board,which appointed a hearing officer to decide the matter.schram,pfeffer,and kyrimis testified at the hearing on the protest.pfeffer explained the decision to rebid the project,the selection process,and the reasons bp,was selected.he said there was a wide variance in the initial preconstruction bids,indicating bidders had different ideas about what was required.pfeffer said he was aware of southland offer to discount the price on a combination package,but denied that this was the reason for the rebid.he said dpr and the university decided they needed to add new information to the bid instructions and threw the bp,package in as an option since we were anyway.
pfeffer said dpr and the university knew before the bid documents were finalized and the project went out to bid that they wanted to retain the fewest number of subcontractors possible while maintaining a competitive environment.in his experience,the project would cost more overall if there were several different entities of overhead in coordination.dpr and the university structured the packages in sort of a fine line to get the proper amount of competition yet not have many different plumbing contractors on site,many different mechanical or many different electrical subcontractors on site.we wanted to limit the number of people going through the design assist process and coordinating pfeffer said the committee decided to select bp,in order to avoid coordination issues between multiple subcontractors and maximize the level of competition on other bid packages since some bidders could not accept contracts on all the packages they bid.pfeffer denied that he had steered work to any subcontractor in particular.he acknowledged that the committee knew at the time of the bid package selection that southland and acco were the only two bidders on bp,and that,if selected,this package would be awarded to one of the two.he said the committee did not know which bid was southland.pfeffer indicated that he had not tried to determine the identity of the bidders within each package,had not instructed anyone else to make this determination,and was not aware of anyone who had done so.
on january,the hearing officer denied sci protest,concluding the university was not required to select bid packages based on best value,had reserved the option to select bid packages,and had disclosed this to prospective bidders.he found that the university had selected bp,before learning bidder identities and bvq scores,did not know the identity of the low bidder when it selected this bid package,and therefore had applied a blind bidding process.he dismissed as m ere speculation sci contention that dpr and the university were able to determine the amount each bidder was bidding by comparing bvq with the known bidders names and information.he concluded that the university would have compromised the blind bidding system if it had compared sci bids for and against the bids for bp.the hearing officer found no evidence of bias or favoritism in the bid package selection or low bidder determination,noting it was undisputed that the decisionmakers had found bp,in the university best interest,that it was important to them to award the maximum work to one contractor to minimize overlap and conflicts in design development and construction,and that they had the discretion to do so.he found no evidence that schram mistaken belief it was not necessary to bid on bp,was caused by a communication from the university or the bidding documents.
sci petition for a writ of mandate 
sci filed a petition for a writ of mandate code civ,compelling the university to award it a contract for the mechanical and plumbing work on the energy center and outpatient building and setting aside the contract with southland.the trial court denied the petition,concluding sci had not met its burden to show that the university had abused its discretion or acted contrary to law or that its findings were not supported by substantial evidence.sci filed a timely notice of appeal from the order denying the petition 
discussion 
sci contends the trial court decision should be reversed and the contract with southland set aside because the university did not comply with the competitive bidding requirements governing the university award of a public contract

ii.did the university violate competitive bidding requirements 
controlling legal principles 
we begin our analysis with the statutory requirements that govern the university award of a public contract.the university must award any contract for a project to the lowest responsible bidder or else reject all bids,subd.b.under a pilot program that took effect january,the university may identify the lowest responsible bidder on the basis of the best value to the university best value method,subds.a,c stats,ch.bill,effective,repealed.the best value method requires that the contract be awarded to the bidder offering the best combination of price and qualifications,based upon objective criteria,subd.c see,subd.g qualifications include financial condition,relevant experience,demonstrated management competency,labor compliance,and safety record.
when the university relies on the best value method,as it did in this case,it must adopt and publish procedures and required criteria that ensure that all selections are conducted in a fair and impartial manner,subd.c.these procedures must comply with statutory provisions requiring 
a bid solicitation that notifies prospective bidders of the c riteria the university will consider in evaluating bids,the methodology it will use in evaluating bids,and the relative importance of each of these criteria,subds.a c 
the evaluation of bidder qualifications based solely on these criteria and the assignment of a qualifications score to each bid,subd.a and 
identification of the bidder determined to be the best value to the university best value contractor by dividing each bidder price by its qualifications score in order to determine the bid that provides t he lowest resulting cost per quality point best value ratio,subds.a b.
subd.c.the selection procedure used by the university also must preclude the disclosure of cost or price information to the committee evaluating bidder qualifications before completion and announcement of its decision,subd.d,subd.c.the procedure the university adopts in accordance with these provisions shall be mandatory for the university,subd.c.
sci contends the university violated section,subdivision c by failing to award the contract for the mechanical and plumbing work on the energy center and outpatient building to the best value contractor,subd.b,and by failing to adopt and publish procedures and required criteria that ensure its bid selections were fair and impartial,subd.c.in evaluating these contentions,we interpret and apply the competitive bidding statutes from a practical rather than a hypothetical standpoint,with reference to the factual circumstances of the case.ghilotti,supra,th at accord,mcm,supra,th at.we consider them in light of the purpose for which they were enacted to invit e competition,to guard against favoritism,improvidence,extravagance,fraud and corruption,and to secure the best work or supplies at the lowest price practicable ghilotti,supra,th at,citing domar electric,city of los angeles cal th,domar konica,supra,d at to eliminate favoritism,fraud and corruption avoid misuse of public funds and stimulate advantageous market place competition.they should be so construed and administered as to accomplish such purpose fairly and reasonably with sole reference to the public interest.ghilotti,supra,th at,citing domar,supra,cal th at.these provisions are strictly construed by the courts,and will not be extended beyond their reasonable purpose.ibid.
b.did the university violate section,subdivision b 
sci maintains that southland was not the best value contractor,subd.b for the mechanical and plumbing work on the energy center and outpatient building because sci bids and bvq scores for and,when considered together,offered the lowest cost per quality point for this scope of work we find no merit in this contention.section,subdivision b requires only that t he award of the contract shall be made to the best value contractor.the university decided to award a contract on bp,and it is undisputed that southland was the best value contractor for this package.although the scope of work was the same for bp,and the combined individual packages,the university distinction between these packages was not arbitrary.only bp,ensured that a single subcontractor would perform the mechanical and plumbing work on both the energy center and the outpatient building,as the university desired.even if sci prevailed on both and individually,the university could not have ascertained that both packages would be awarded to the same subcontractor without improperly identifying the bidders and the amounts of their bids.the university had discretion to set the project specifications,including the scope of work for each bid package.see associated builders,supra,cal th at,public agency is afforded considerable latitude in setting bid specifications,and these will be upheld if substantial evidence shows they are in furtherance of legitimate government interests.sci provides no authority that nullifies this policy decision based on its conclusion that a different packaging offered a better value 
having concluded that the university did not violate section in awarding a contract on bp,to southland,we turn to sci remaining assertions of error.
c.did the university violate section,subdivision c 
sci also contends the university failed to adopt and publish procedures and required criteria that ensure that all selections are conducted in a fair and impartial manner,subd.c.by its plain meaning,section,subdivision c requires fairness in both the procedure for selecting the best value bid and the substantive basis for the bid selection.in addition,this provision requires the university to disclose to prospective bidders how the best value bid will be selected,including the bid selection procedure and the determinative factors in that decision.ibid.sci contends the university violated this provision by selecting the bid packages to be awarded based on undisclosed criteria and in a manner that allowed it to predetermine the outcome of the bid selection.we agree.
section required publication of the bid package selection criteria.
section,subdivision c provides for a fair and impartial bid selection by requiring the university to act in accordance with established procedures and criteria.the publication requirement serves this objective,not only by informing prospective bidders of how the bid selection will be made,but also by establishing a clear,public,selection standard that prevents manipulation of the outcome and justifications.in this case,the university did not inform prospective bidders of the primary criterion on which it relied in selecting the bid purported advantage of using fewer contractors to perform the mep it did not disclose the importance this factor would play in the bid package selection.the university also failed to provide any explanation of how the alternative and individual bid packages would be compared,even after sci requested this information.the question before us is whether this information,which relates to the selection of bid packages,falls within the procedures and required criteria that must be published to prospective bidders under section,subdivision c.we conclude that it does.
on its face,the statute mandates publication of the procedures and criteria necessary to ensure that all selections are conducted in a fair and impartial manner,subd.c.it follows that information regarding the procedure and criteria for selecting bid packages bid package selection information must be disclosed to the extent the bid selection would otherwise be unfair or its integrity would be compromised by nondisclosure.we conclude publication of the bid package selection information was necessary to a fair and impartial bid selection in this case.first,the bid selection turned on a criterion that was not disclosed to bidders.the record demonstrates that the university desire to award as much of the work as possible to a single subcontractor was a threshold criterion it applied in evaluating bids and that this factor was largely determinative of the best value bid.although the concerns driving the selection of a specific bid package do not directly determine whether a particular bid will prevail,the university desire for less contractors coordinating with each other was the decisive factor in determining whether the bids on the individual packages would be considered at all.the failure to disclose this information left bidders in the unfair position of having to guess what would satisfy the university needs.see konica,supra,d at acceptance of a bid deviating from precise bid specifications.second,this information was material to the decision of prospective bidders contemplating a bid on bp.sci knew it could be bound by its bids on both and.but sci did not bid on an alternative package with the same scope of work,believing it could be awarded and,if its combined best value ratios on these packages were less than those on bp.although the university did not prevent or discourage sci from bidding on the alternative package,sci lacked material information in deciding which packages to bid the university intent to award the work in the fewest packages possible.a contractor is placed at a competitive disadvantage,not only when undisclosed information undermines its ability to bid on a common basis,but also when the nondisclosure is material in deciding whether to submit a bid in the first instance.see mcm,supra,th at noting that a bid deviation from specifications must be capable of facilitating corruption or extravagance,or likely to affect the amount of bids or the response of potential bidders.schram testified that sci would have bid on the alternative package if it had known how the university would evaluate the packages for the same reasons,the university failure to disclose material information about the bid package selection procedure and criteria negatively impacted competition on bp.indeed,sci scores on and suggest that the university failure to disclose the procedures and criteria for selecting a bid package may have resulted in a higher cost to the public.see domar,supra,cal th at p erhaps the most important goal of competitive bidding is to protect against insufficient competition to assure that the government gets the most work for the least money.
the university challenges this construction of section,subdivision c,contending for the first time at oral argument that the phrase required criteria refers exclusively to the factors considered in evaluating the qualifications of bidders.see,subd.g defining qualifications.the university maintains,accordingly,that its intent to award the work to the fewest subcontractors possible,a decisive factor in the bid selection,was not one of the criteria required to be disclosed to bidders.assuming the university has not waived this argument by failing to assert it in the trial court and in the briefing on appeal,we reject the university interpretation of the statute on its merits.see baugh garl th,points not raised in the trial court may not be raised for the first time on appeal lyons chinese hospital th,fn.waiver of right to raise issue that was not presented until oral argument on appeal.nothing in section,subdivision c limits required criteria to the criteria to be used in evaluating bidder qualifications,and the statutory scheme supports a broader reading.first,section,subdivision c a requires the university to identify and describ e in its bid solicitation the c riteria that it will consider in evaluating bids.the legislature could have required identification and description of the qualifications to be considered in evaluating bidders,as it did elsewhere in the statutory scheme,but it did not.see,subd.a requiring the university to evaluate the qualifications of the bidders based solely upon the criteria set forth in the solicitation documents city of port hueneme city of oxnard cal d,quoting people town of corte madera d,where a statute,with reference to one subject contains a given provision,the omission of such provision from a similar statute concerning a related subject is significant to show that a different intention existed.moreover,in enacting section,subdivision c,the legislature could have required the university,i n order to implement this method of selection,to simply follow the procedures specified in the statutes and identify the statutory qualification criteria on which it intended to rely.instead,the legislature imposed a higher obligation the adoption and publication of procedures and required criteria that ensure that all selections are conducted in a fair and impartial manner,subd.c.
the university also speculates that sci decided not to bid on the alternative package because it preferred a contract on instead of and having lost this gamble,may not now be relieved of its tactical mistake.our holding turns,however,on the impact of the university procedure on the public interest,not the loss to sci.ghilotti,supra,th at competitive bidding laws must be viewed in light of the public interest,rather than the private interest of a disappointed bidder.moreover,the information the university failed to disclose would have impacted the analysis of any reasonable subcontractor deciding whether to bid on bp.sci was not provided the information necessary to accurately assess the risk that it would not be awarded either or and weigh this risk against its alleged preference for.
the procedure permitted the university to influence the bid selection.
the university selection procedure also does not satisfy section,subdivision c because it permitted the university to manipulate the bid selection in favor of or against particular bidders.as pfeffer of dpr conceded,at the time the committee selected bp,it knew the identity of the bidders on each package and specifically,that if selected,this package would be awarded to either southland or acco.with this information,the committee could purposefully exclude certain bidders and favor others by simply selecting a bid package.indeed,in selecting the combination package,the committee eliminated sci without considering the best value ratios on the individual packages and effectively insured that southland or acco would be awarded the contract.while southland and acco were two of four bidders on each of the individual packages,they were the only two bidders on bp.the committee selecting the bid packages did not need to know bidder identities.the university contends that the bid instructions provide for the announcement of bidder identities on each package to ensure the timeliness of the bids and that this information is necessarily revealed in the prequalification process and bvq evaluations.even if these contentions are true,however,there is no requirement that the bid package be selected by the same decisionmakers that prequalified subcontractors or evaluated the bvqs.
at the time of its decision,the committee also had a spreadsheet setting out the figures making up each bid,including each bidder hourly labor rates for various employees.sci contends that this information enabled the committee to determine specifically which bid was southland.substantial evidence does not show the committee knew what southland labor rates were.there is no evidence any committee member knew which bidder submitted each bid in the initial bidding.although the record demonstrates that each committee member received a spreadsheet after the initial bidding that sets out each bidder hourly rates,the bidders are identified only by letter.nonetheless,selection of a bid package with knowledge of both the identities of bidders on that package and the bid figures creates at least the appearance of unfairness and a lack of impartiality,particularly since this was a rebid on the project.in any case,disclosure of price information to the committee selecting the bid packages was not necessary.pfeffer testifie
