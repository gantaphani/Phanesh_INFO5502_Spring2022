background 
for construction of a sports playing field for the unified school district in california,the school district wanted to use a synthetic turf similar to a fieldturf installation in a local park.the request for proposal rfp,prepared by the architect for the school district,specified pro series soccer synthetic grass system manufactured by fieldturf or approved equal.the rfp specifications included features that characterized the fieldturf product,including the fiber denier,fiber height,fiber tufting,porous secondary backing,and infill layering system of sand and rubber.the documents describing the procurement obligations for california public projects state that when a product is referenced in a rfp by the manufacturer name,all standard materials and features of that product are deemed to be inherently specified.section of the document that set forth the obligations of the bidding parties provided,in pertinent part 
whenever,in contract documents,any material,process or specified patent or proprietary name by name of manufacturer is indicated,such name shall be deemed to be used for purpose of facilitating description of material process desired,and shall be deemed to be followed by words or equal.
sportfields,a competing producer of synthetic turf,complained to the school district that the specifications sole sourced fieldturf product,pointing out that california law does not favor sole source procurement.the school district responded that the specifications would be revised to ensure competitive bidding.a sportfields sales representative met with the school district to discuss sportfields product perfecturf,which does not use a sand and rubber layered infill or have a porous secondary backing,as required by the specifications as then written.sportfields also demonstrated an installation of perfecturf to school district representatives.fieldturf in turn suggested tests the school district should perform to compare the qualities of the various products,and stressed the superiority of the fieldturf product.the fieldturf product is covered by fieldturf united states patents entitled process of laying synthetic grass,and entitled synthetic turf.
the bid specifications were amended.addendum added the requirement of an infill that included cryogenic rubber,which is an element of the fieldturf product and the fieldturf patent claims.addendum removed the language fieldturf or approved equal,and added the requirement that the sand must be dust free,rounded silc sand,an additional element of fieldturf patent claims.addendum also required the bidder to state that the bid product did not violate any other manufacturer patents.the specifications stated that substitutions were permitted,but required express approval.
sportfields complained that the amended specifications still did not clearly permit substitute products.the architect for the school district stated that it was too late to change the specifications,but that sportfields should do the best it could and submit a bid anyway.sportfields,fieldturf,and others bid on the project.the school district announced that sportfields was the lowest bidder and that the project would be awarded to sportfields.the sportfields bid identified no substitution and requested no departure from the specifications,and contained no statement about patent infringement.
fieldturf then wrote to sportfields and the school district,stating that sportfields bid was an infringing offer to sell under a whoever without authority makes,uses,offers to sell,or sells any patented invention,within the united states during the term of the patent therefor,infringes the patent.fieldturf stated that it would enforce its patents against sportfields and the school district.the school district then rejected all of the bids,withdrew the rfp,and made further changes in the specifications.the new rfp replaced the sand and rubber infill with an infill,which was a departure from the fieldturf patents,and did not mention fieldturf or approved equal.fieldturf did not rebid,and the project was awarded to sportfields.
fieldturf then sued sportfields for patent infringement based on the first bid,as an offer to sell under a,and also charged sportfields with the torts of intentional interference with prospective economic advantage,and unfair competition under california law.sportfields denied infringement and filed counterclaims charging fieldturf with intentional interference with prospective economic advantage and unfair competition.the district court held in favor of sportfields on its defense of noninfringement and on its counterclaims and awarded attorney fees to sportfields.fieldturf appeals.
infringement 
in,a was amended to include offer to sell as a ground of infringement,in order to harmonize this aspect of united states law with that of other nations.see rotec,mitsubishi,discussing the policies underlying the offer of sale provision.a bid to supply a product specified in a rfp is a traditional offer to sell.see restatement second of contracts cmt.f,ill.a bid to supply goods to the government is an offer which is irrevocable upon the opening of bids.in rotec,at,this court observed that the supreme court in pfaff wells electronics,d applied traditional contract law principles to the aspects of b,and reasoned that traditional contract law should also govern an offer of sale under a.
the district court held that,on consideration of all the surrounding circumstances,sportfields bid,while undoubtedly an offer of sale,was not an offer to sell the fieldturf patented product because sportfields intended to sell its perfecturf product and the school district knew that sportfields legally could not and would not provide an infringing product.fieldturf argues that even if sportfields intended to change the product after it won the bid,this does not save sportfields from infringement because sportfields presented an unqualified offer of sale of the product of the specifications as then written in the rfp,and the bid did not contain the required statement that the bid product differed from the specifications.sportfields replies that it always intended that the product that would be installed would be sportfields perfecturf,and provided testimony to that effect.fieldturf argues that such testimony can not alter the clear terms of an unambiguous written document.fieldturf argues that sportfields made an unqualified offer to sell a product that met the school district specifications as then presented,and thus on its face infringed the fieldturf patents.fieldturf argues that the district court erred in considering the identity of the product that sportfields actually expected to provide,in deciding whether the offer was an infringement of the patent.
we conclude that the district court did not err in law,in considering the nature of the sportfields product that was intended and understood to be the product that would be installed,in holding that the bid was not an offer to sell an infringing product.the school district representatives were aware that sportfields product differed from that of,fieldturf emphasized those differences in its communications to the school district.the district court was not required to ignore these and other facts that showed that sportfields intended to offer and to install its perfecturf product,which is conceded not to literally infringe fieldturf patent claims.it is also relevant that when fieldturf complained to the school district that sportfields bid
