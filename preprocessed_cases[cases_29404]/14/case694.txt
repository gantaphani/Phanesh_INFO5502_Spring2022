background 
madden,an electrician employed by a subcontractor at a home construction site,sued summit view,the general contractor,for injuries he sustained on july,in a fall from a raised unenclosed patio at the site.madden form complaint asserted a single cause of action for premises liability against summit view,based on the allegation that his injuries were proximately caused by summit view negligence in maintaining,managing,and operating the subject premises.summit view answer included an affirmative defense based on privette and toland.
summary judgment motion 
by motion for summary judgment,summit view asserted that it was entitled to judgment as a matter of law under the line of cases,based in substance on the following undisputed facts 
busch electric was working as a subcontractor on the construction of a home for a and welsh,and madden was employed as busch electrical foreman for the project.summit view was the general contractor.under a subcontract between summit view and gary tschantz construction,gary tschantz was the project supervisor.however,madden sequenced and directed his own work at the welsh project.summit view did not control the methods busch used for its work nor did it control the method or means or provide any materials for madden work.
madden was injured when he fell from a raised patio while pulling some electrical wire for installation in the home.he had worked in the area where the fall occurred many times before.madden left the area of the installation and was walking backwards in an effort to untangle a knot of wire when the fall occurred.there were no witnesses to the fall.madden does not know how high off the ground he was at the time of the fall.
in opposition to summit view motion,madden cited the following facts,among others,that he contended were undisputed and created triable issues of material fact regarding summit view defense 
a summit view officer,tom berry,was at the project site two or three times a week,while tschantz was there just about every day.tschantz did not consider jobsite safety to be part of his work as project supervisor and that subject was never discussed with him.tschantz was unaware that anybody at the jobsite had been hired by the summit view representative to be responsible for site safety.tschantz was not familiar with california occupational safety and health act regulations relating to fall protection,which required railings to be provided on all unprotected and opens sides of elevated platforms or other elevations of seven and feet or more.
the elevated patio was about eight feet wide,to feet in length,and between two and eight feet high,depending on the slope of the land that ran adjacent to it.about a year before the accident,a subcontractor had built the retaining wall for the patio,but the patio floor remained covered with dirt until june,when the patio was cemented over.between the time the retaining wall was built and patio was cemented over,the patio was used as a walkway and platform for workers on the project,including tschantz,berry,and madden.no railing was put in place along the unprotected retaining wall side of the patio until after madden accident.tschantz would have required summit view approval to install a railing.
the trial court granted summary judgment to summit view,and this timely appeal followed.
ii.discussion 
standard of review 
on appeal after a trial court has granted summary judgment,we review the record de novo to determine whether the evidence submitted for and against the motion discloses material factual issues warranting a trial.merrill navegar,cal th,d,guz bechtel national,cal th,fn,d.
summary judgment is properly granted when no triable issue of material fact exists and the moving party is entitled to judgment as a matter of law.code civ,subd.c.a defendant moving for summary judgment bears the initial burden of showing that a cause of action has no merit by showing that one or more of its elements can not be established or that there is a complete defense.code civ,subds.a,o.once the defendant has met that burden,the burden shifts to the plaintiff to show that a triable issue of one or more material facts exists as to that cause of action or a defense thereto.code civ,subd.p.there is a triable issue of material fact if,and only if,the evidence would allow a reasonable trier of fact to find the underlying fact in favor of the party opposing the motion in accordance with the applicable standard of proof.aguilar atlantic richfield cal th,d,fn.omitted.
b.the doctrine 
defendant brought its motion for summary judgment on the theory that madden suit is barred as a matter of law by privette and its progeny,a series of cases that have defined and limited the circumstances in which an independent contractor employee may recover in tort from the party hiring the contractor.in privette,the supreme court examined whether a hired contractor employees may seek recovery based on the theory of peculiar risk from a nonnegligent hiring party for injuries caused by the negligent contractor.privette,supra,cal th at,d.the peculiar risk doctrine had developed as an exception to the general rule that a person who hired an independent contractor was not liable to third parties for injuries caused by the contractor negligence in performing the work.id.at,d.it had been applied by the courts when the contracted work was deemed to pose some inherent risk of injury to others.id.at,d.the theory underlying the exception was that a private landowner who engages in inherently dangerous activity on his land should not be able to insulate himself from liability for injuries to others simply by hiring an independent contractor to do the work.ibid.in the event of the contractor insolvency,the peculiar risk exception would allocate the loss to the person for whose benefit the job was undertaken.id.at,d.by spreading the risk of loss to the person who primarily benefited from the hired work,the courts also sought to promote greater workplace safety.ibid.the peculiar risk doctrine was gradually expanded to allow the hired contractor employees to seek recovery from the nonnegligent property owner for injuries caused by the negligent contractor.id.at,d.
the privette court rejected the extension of the peculiar risk doctrine to the contractor employees.the court reasoned that when the person injured by negligently performed contracted work is one of the contractor own employees,the injury is already compensable under the workers compensation scheme and therefore the doctrine of peculiar risk should provide no tort remedy,for those same injuries,against the person who hired the independent contractor.privette,supra,cal th at,d.because the workers compensation scheme shields an independent contractor from tort liability to its employees,applying the peculiar risk doctrine to the independent contractor employees would illogically and unfairly subject the hiring person,who did nothing to create the risk that caused the injury,to greater liability than that faced by the independent contractor whose negligence caused the employee injury.toland,supra,cal th at,d,summarizing the holding of privette.the scope of the privette doctrine has been held to include claims that the hirer failed to take special precautions toland,at,d,and that the hirer was negligent in hiring the contractor whose negligence caused the injury camargo tjaarda dairy cal th,d.
in hooker department of transportation cal th,d,hooker,the court considered whether the hirer of an independent contractor could be held liable for injuries to the contractor employee resulting from the contractor negligence under the theory that the hirer retained control of the work but negligently exercised that control the high court held in hooker that a hirer of an independent contractor was not liable to an employee of the contractor merely because the hirer retained control over safety conditions at a worksite,but was liable to such an employee insofar as its exercise of retained control affirmatively contributed to the employee injuries.millard biosources,th,d millard summarizing hooker.in such cases,the liability of the hirer is not vicarious or derivative in the sense that it derives from the act or omission of the hired contractor,but is direct.hooker,at,d,see also mckown stores,cal th,d,hirer is directly liable to an employee of an independent contractor when hirer provision of unsafe equipment affirmatively contributes to the employee injury.
in hooker,the widow of a deceased crane operator who had been employed by a general contractor hired by the california department of transportation caltrans to construct an overpass,sued caltrans for negligently exercising its retained control over jobsite safety.hooker,supra,cal th at,d.the caltrans construction manual provided that caltrans was responsible for obtaining the contractor compliance with all safety laws and regulations,and caltrans onsite engineer had the power to shut the project down because of safety conditions and to remove employees of the contractor for failing to comply with safety regulations.id.at,d.the plaintiff husband died after the crane tipped over when he attempted to operate it without reextending the crane outriggers.id.at,d.he had retracted the outriggers in order to allow caltrans and other vehicles to use the narrow overpass.id.at,d.the plaintiff alleged that caltrans was negligent in permitting traffic to use the overpass while the crane was being operated.id.at,d.
although the court found that the plaintiff in hooker had raised triable issues of material fact as to whether caltrans retained control over safety conditions at the worksite,she failed to raise triable issues of material fact as to whether caltrans actually exercised the retained control so as to affirmatively contribute to the death of her husband.hooker,supra,cal th at,d.the court stated a general contractor owes no duty of care to an employee of a subcontractor to prevent or correct unsafe procedures or practices to which the contractor did not contribute by direction,induced reliance,or other affirmative conduct.the mere failure to exercise a power to compel the subcontractor to adopt safer procedures does not,without more,violate any duty owed to the plaintiff.id.at,d.under the standard approved in hooker,a general contractor contributes to an unsafe procedure or practice by its affirmative conduct where the general contractor is actively involved in,or asserts control over,the manner of performance of the contracted work.citation.such an assertion of control occurs,for example,when the principal employer directs that the contracted work be done by use of a certain mode or otherwise interferes with the means and methods by which the work is to be accomplished.citations.citation.id.at,d,italics omitted.
hooker also states that an omission may constitute an affirmative contribution in some circumstances a ffirmative contribution need not always be in the form of actively directing a contractor or contractor employee.there will be times when a hirer will be liable for its omissions.for example,if the hirer promises to undertake a particular safety measure,then the hirer negligent failure to do so should result in liability if such negligence leads to an employee injury.hooker,supra,cal th at,fn,d.
applying these standards to the facts before it,the hooker court held while the evidence suggests that the crane tipped over because the crane operator swung the boom while the outriggers were retracted,and that the crane operator had a practice of retracting the outriggers to permit construction traffic to pass the crane on the overpass,there was no evidence caltrans exercise of retained control over safety conditions at the worksite affirmatively contributed to the adoption of that practice by the crane operator.there was,at most,evidence that caltrans safety personnel were aware of an unsafe practice and failed to exercise the authority they retained to correct it.hooker,supra,cal th at,d,italics added.
c.the trial court decision 
the trial court granted summit view motion in explicit reliance on the analysis in hooker.the court stated although there is a triable issue as to whether summit view retained control over general safety conditions at the site,no evidence was presented that would establish that summit view affirmatively contributed,by direction,induced reliance or other affirmative conduct,to madden injuries.no evidence was presented that summit view directed that a railing not be installed around the raised patio,nor that the presence or absence of such a railing was an issue that summit view even considered prior to the incident.the absence of the railing was open and obvious,so there was no induced reliance.under the circumstances of this case,summit view conduct was nothing more than a mere failure to exercise a power to require the installation of a safety railing.as such,summit view did not affirmatively contribute to madden injuries.
in comparison to caltrans argument for summary judgment in hooker,summit view claim here would seem to be at least as meritorious.
it was undisputed that summit view was the general contractor and madden was an employee of the subcontractor at the welsh construction site.it was undisputed that summit view had no control over the methods and supplied none of the materials that madden employer used for its electrical work at the site.consistent with the line of cases,these facts were sufficient to shift the burden to madden to produce evidence that summit view nonetheless retained control over safety conditions and practices at the site,and that it contributed by its affirmative conduct to an unsafe condition or practice that caused madden injury.
retained control 
the evidence in hooker showed that caltrans retained significant control over safety conditions,as shown by the express reservation of control in its construction manual and by its placement of an engineer onsite with the power to punish subcontractors and their employees for noncompliance with safety requirements.hooker,supra,cal th at,d.in contrast,madden produced virtually no evidence here that summit view retained control over general safety conditions at the welsh site.summit view entered into an oral contract for tschantz to act as a project supervisor.however,tschantz did not understand his responsibilities to include jobsite safety,and that subject was not even discussed between him and summit view.in addition,a summit view representative was on the site every other day or so,but as far as tschantz knew the representative did not have anyone present at the jobsite to do safety supervision.thus,madden evidence showed only that summit view retained control in the sense that,through berry and tschantz,it provided general supervision over the entire construction job.however,we will assume without deciding that a jury could reasonably infer from this general supervisory power that summit view also retained control over safety conditions,whether it chose to exercise that control or not.see rest d torts,com.b,quoted at fn,ante.
affirmative conduct 
madden theory is that his injury was proximately caused by the absence of a guardrail along the open side of the patio.under hooker,the issue is whether there is any evidence in the record that summit view contributed to that condition by its affirmative conduct.like the trial court,we find no such evidence.
first,there is no evidence that summit view or its agents directed that no guardrailing or other protection against falls be placed along the raised patio,or that it acted in any way to prevent such a railing from being installed.madden asserted as an undisputed fact that no railing was in p
