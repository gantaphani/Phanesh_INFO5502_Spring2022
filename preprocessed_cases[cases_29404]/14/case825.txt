in this workplace safety enforcement action,petitioner,contracting company is an asphalt paving company that leased jeff moreno,one of its longtime employees,to manhole adjusting,manhole,as a roller operator.while working at manhole worksite,moreno was fatally injured when he was thrown from his roller because it lacked an operable seatbelt.
real party in interest,the department of industrial relations division of occupational safety and health division,cited for a serious violation of the employer safety provisions set forth in title of the california code of regulations hereafter regulations.the citation alleged that failed to have an injury prevention program in which it instructed moreno to refuse to work at the secondary site until he was given a roller with an operative seatbelt and failed to conduct periodic monitoring of the site to determine compliance with its program.appeal of the citation was denied by respondent occupational safety and health appeals board board and by the trial court.code civ.
on appeal,contends there is no legal basis for a theory of responsibility,moreno was not its employee when he was fatally injured,labor code section,subdivision h eliminated the primary employer obligation to provide safety training to an employee who works under the direct supervision of another employer,and there is insufficient evidence to support the finding that injury prevention program did not satisfy the regulations.
we shall conclude that,as a primary employer of moreno,was required by section to establish,implement and maintain an effective injury prevention program for employees leased to a secondary employer.the program must include training applicable to the work for which the employee is leased and the monitoring of the secondary employer to ensure that the safety program is implemented.in this case,moreno should have been instructed by to refuse to operate a roller for manhole without an operable seatbelt.
accordingly,we find no error and shall affirm the judgment.
factual and procedural background 
a.the violation 
is an asphalt paving contractor who had employed jeff moreno for years as a roller operator.moreno was still on payroll in october,but he had been without work for a number of days and was not receiving compensation for his time off work.
during this time,manhole,another paving contractor,requested to provide it with two qualified roller operators.contacted moreno,an experienced roller and heavy equipment operator,and advised him about the manhole job.after moreno indicated he would be willing to work for manhole,agreed to rent moreno to manhole for three days.
on october,the first day of the job,moreno was operating a heavy roller on a steep grade when another roller,further up the grade,went out of control and rammed the rear end of moreno roller.moreno was thrown to the pavement and into the path of his roller rear wheels,resulting in fatal injuries.at the time of the accident,moreno was not wearing his seatbelt.the board found t he leased roller moreno was operating at the time was equipped with a seat belt,but it was unusable because the metal tip of the belt,which slides into the locking receptacle,was missing.
after his death,paid moreno family for his work at manhole and billed manhole for moreno wages and benefits,as well as a substantial rental fee that almost doubled the wages moreno was under manhole exclusive direction and control while he worked at its site.
knew moreno would be assigned to work as a heavy roller operator but it had no agreement with manhole concerning enforcement of its injury prevention program at the site.nor did inspect the site before moreno began working and it had no system in place for making periodic inspections or to otherwise ensure such inspections were made.injury prevention program contained no provision requiring that an employee assigned to work under the direction and control of another employer must be instructed that if he reasonably believes the work to which he is assigned exposes him to a dangerous condition,he should refuse to perform the work until the danger is abated.nor was moreno so instructed when he was assigned to work for manhole.
citation and appeal 
the division,which is vested with primary responsibility for administering and enforcing the california occupational safety and health act of the act et rick electric,occupational safety health appeals bd.th,d,cited for a serious violation of section of the regulations.
the citation alleged moreno was not wearing a seatbelt at the time he was ejected from his roller,had no system for a secondary worksite to ensure employees compliance with safe practices required by its own injury prevention program and section a of the regulations,and had no system of periodic monitoring to ensure compliance with safe work practices and conditions as required by section a of the regulations.the citation proposed a civil penalty of.
an administrative law judge alj granted appeal of the citation.the board then granted the division petition for reconsideration and reversed the decision of the alj and ruled in favor of the division.
filed a petition for writ of administrative mandate seeking an order directing the board to set aside its decision after reconsideration.code civ.the trial court denied the petition and filed a timely appeal from the ensuing judgment.
discussion 
imoreno was primary employee 
section,subdivision a requires that every employer establish,implement,and maintain an effective injury prevention program.the board has interpreted this provision and the related regulations to require that a primary employer provide safety training to an employee it has leased to a secondary employer that directly supervises and controls the work of the employee at a secondary worksite.in re optical coating laboratory,cal.osha,wl in re petroleum maintenance company cal.osha,may,pemco ii in re manpower cal.osha,may.
contends there is no legal basis for a dual employer theory of responsibility and there is no substantial evidence that moreno was its employee at the time of his fatal accident because he was not working under its direct supervision and control at that time.
the board and the division argue that waived the first claim by failing to raise it before the board and the trial court and there is substantial evidence to support the board finding that was moreno primary employer at the time in question.
we agree with the board and the division on both points.has forfeited the first claim.however,because it is pertinent to our substantial evidence discussion,we shall address it.
as stated,the board found the employment relationship between moreno,and manhole was one of dual employment,in which was moreno primary employer and manhole was his secondary employer.upon review of this finding,we apply the same standard of review used by the trial court in ruling on the petition for the writ.
we determine whether based on the entire record the board decision is supported by substantial evidence and is reasonable.davey,supra,d at.rick electric,california occupational safety and health appeals,supra,th at,d.under this standard,we will not disturb the board findings if they are reasonable,even if the evidence is susceptible of opposing inferences.brietigam industrial acc.comm.cal d.
we review the board findings in light of the statutory definitions governing an employment relationship.the act defines employee as every person who is required or directed by any employer to engage in any employment or to go to work or be at any time in any place of employment,subd.a.the act defines employer by inclusion of the definition in section,which defines employer for purposes of the workers compensation law.section provides in pertinent part that an employer is e very person which has any natural person in service,subd.c.
pertinent factors include the payment of a wage or salary and whether the employer has the right to exercise control over the employee.brietigam industrial acc,supra,cal d at.the fact an employer does not exercise its right of control is not dispositive on the question of an employment relationship because it is the right to control and not the exercise of that right that is the test.ibid supportive services workers comp.appeals bd.d.
the instant case involves dual employers,a concept that has long been recognized in the area of worker compensation in which employers may be joint or general and special.see employers liability assurance industrial acc.comm.of california cal,brassinga city of mountain view th,d supportive services workers comp.appeals,supra,d at.
because the definition of employer used in the act is that stated in the law governing worker compensation,we must assume the legislature intended that the term employer be given the same meaning under both worker compensation and worker safety law.department of revenue acf industries,d,mercer department of motor vehicles cal d.we shall therefore treat the cases construing regulation section as equally applicable to section 
in the context of worker compensation,the court in brassinga city of mountain view,supra,th at page,d,stated that dual employment occurs when an employer sends an employee to do work for another person,and both have the right to exercise certain powers of control over the employee in such case,that employee may be held to have two original or general employer and a second,the special employer.ibid.
applying these principles,we find there is substantial evidence to support the finding that was moreno primary employer at the time of his death.moreno had been employed by for approximately years when manhole contacted and requested to borrow a roller operator.at that time,although moreno was without work and was not receiving an hourly wage from,he remained on payroll and had not been laid off.
randy franklin,safety and risk manager,acknowledged that moreno was still technically an employee of the company and that the company expected him to resume working for it directly as soon as work was available.as explained at the hearing and at oral argument,it is customary in the industry for a company that is short of manpower to call another company to borrow an employee who is not working.
after manhole made its request for two roller operators,contacted moreno and entered manhole request on a form entitled equipment rental dispatch info.the accident report prepared by also stated that moreno was rented to manhole adjusting as a roller operator italics added,as did its daily work report and the invoice sent to manhole for moreno services.
the fact manhole contacted and in turn contacted moreno raises an inference that moreno was employee.this inference is strengthened by the fact that issued a payroll check to moreno family for moreno work at manhole and billed manhole for its costs,including moreno wages and benefits,and a substantial rental fee that was almost as much as moreno wage.these circumstances show that considered moreno to be its employee and that retained the right to direct him to perform work or go to a place of work.by waiting for to call him back instead of insisting on formal when out of work,moreno demonstrated continuing reliance upon and commitment to his employment relationship with.this benefited by allowing it to retain a valuable employee rather than lose him to another company.
however,maintains that because it did not require or force moreno to work for manhole,it did not have the right to control him.this argument was rejected in harris chisamore d.in so doing,the court looked to section,which uses the word permit with reference to employment.no employer shall require,or permit any employee to go or be in any employment or place of employment which is not safe and healthful.italics added.the word permit also appears in section,subdivision b,which defines employment to include any trade,enterprise,project or work in which any person is engaged or permitted to work for hire italics added.
as stated,section,subdivision a defines employee to mean every person who is required or directed by any employer to engage in employment or work.the dictionary defines directed to mean subject to regulation by a guiding and supervising agency.webster new internat.dict.by contrast,the definition of the word require includes the imposition of a compulsion or command upon as a person to do something.id.at.
when construing the words of a statute,we give meaning to each word if possible and avoid a construction that would render a term surplusage.moyer workmen comp.appeals bd.cal d.in light of this rule of construction and the labor code use of the word permit in the context of the employment relationship,we hold that the word directed in section,subdivision a means to give supervision or direction rather than to force or compel.
the evidence satisfies this definition.because moreno risked possible layoff,he was not in a good position to refuse work at manhole worksite.not surprisingly,he decided to resume his status as a paid employee of by agreeing to work under manhole direct supervision and control pursuant to a lease agreement between and manhole.in light of the industry custom for one company to lease its employee to another company that is short on manpower,the substantial rental fee received for moreno,and its classification of him as equipment to be leased,can not credibly argue that moreno was not its employee.accordingly,we reject its claim of error.
contends section,subdivision h hereafter subdivision h,places responsibility for providing an injury prevention program exclusively on the employer who has direct supervision and control over the employee.from this premise it reasons that,because it was not directly supervising moreno,it had no obligation to provide injury prevention training to him for hazards at manhole worksite.the board and division counter that subdivision h did not alter the primary employer general responsibility to provide injury prevention training for all of its employees,including those that work for a secondary employer.we agree with the latter view.
subdivision h provides that t he employer injury prevention program,as required by this section,shall cover all of the employer employees and all other workers who the employer controls or directs and directly supervises on the job to the extent these workers are exposed to worksite and job assignment specific hazards.nothing in this subdivision shall affect the obligations of a contractor or other employer that controls or directs and directly supervises its own employees on the job.
consistent with the rules for statutory construction,we first set forth the statutory and regulatory framework to which subdivision h was added.an employer general responsibilities with respect to injury prevention programs are set forth in subdivision a of section.subdivision a requires that e very employer shall establish,implement,and maintain an effective injury prevention program,which shall include inter alia,a system for identifying and evaluating workplace hazards,including scheduled periodic inspections to identify unsafe conditions and work practices,subd.a,methods and procedures for timely correction of unsafe or unhealthy conditions and practices,subd.a,a n occupational health and safety training program designed to instruct employees in general safe and healthy work practices and to provide specific instruction with respect to hazards specific to each employee job assignment,subd.a,the employer system for communicating with employees on occupational health and safety matters including provisions designed to encourage employees to inform the employer of hazards at the worksite without fear of reprisal,subd.a,and a system for ensuring that employees comply with safe and healthy work practices,subd.a.subdivision c requires the employer to provide such training to all employees when the training program is first established,all new employees,and all employees given a new job assignment 
in pemco ii,supra,the board set forth the training obligations that arise under sections through when the primary employer principal business is the supplying of labor to secondary employers,or the supplying of labor is the primary employer principal obligation under its agreement with the secondary employer,and the primary employer has no right in its relationship with the secondary employer to direct the contract employees in the work to be done or how to do it.the board noted that sections through place primary responsibility for employee safety and health upon the employer,which includes the primary employer.the board concluded that t o meet these labor code responsibilities,the primary employer is required to determine with particularity the work which a contract employee will be called upon to perform for the secondary employer.it shall maintain an accident prevention program and send out only employees who are trained to do the work it is the responsibility of the primary employer to instruct contract employees in the use of personal protective equipment required for the work to which they are to be assigned.contract employees must know that if they reasonably believe a job to which they are assigned by the secondary employer is dangerous,they shall refuse to do the work until the danger has been abated,and that such refusal will not result in sanctions against them by the primary employer.
because pemco ii involved the obligations of a primary employer when it supplies labor to a secondary employer,the board did not determine the extent and scope of the training and inspection responsibilities of the secondary employer.it was in this context that in the legislature added subdivision h to section.stats,ch.it contains no words of exception that limit an employer obligation to establish and implement an injury prevention program.to the contrary,the text states that an employer injury prevention program,as required by this section,shall cover all of the employer employees and all other workers who the employer controls or directs and directly supervises on the job to the extent these workers are exposed to worksite and job assignment specific hazards.italics added.
it is apparent from the language and organization of subdivision h,that directly supervises modifies other workers under the control and supervision of an employer and not employees.because this provision applies to both the employer employees,without regard to direct supervision,and all other workers subject to the employer direct supervision,it codifies pemco ii holding with respect to primary employers while making clear that a secondary employer has similar obligations to employees it directly supervises.moreover,the second sentence,which states that n othing in this subdivision shall affect the obligations of a contractor or other employer that controls or directs and directly supervises its own employees on the job,makes clear that a secondary employer training obligations to its primary employees remain the same,subd.h.
in sum,subdivision h serves to impose training obligations on a secondary employer who directly supervises contract employees employed by another employer.it in no way alters the established training obligations of an employer to primary employees,whether or not the employer leases those employees to or from another employer.
this conclusion is also consistent with the legislative history subdivision h was added by assembly bill in.the legislative counsel digest states that the bill would additionally require that all contract workers be included in the secondary employer injury prevention program to the extent they are exposed to worksite and job assignment specific hazards.legis.counsel,assem.bill reg.sess.stats,summary.it says nothing about eliminating the primary employer existing obligation to provide such training.
legislative committee reports and analysis also uniformly indicate that the need for assembly bill arose because existing law at the time neglected the safety needs of contracted employees who work with an employer own workers.the provision was therefore intended to expand the employer mandated injury prevention program responsibilities to include not only its own employees,but all other workers whom it controls or directs on the job.assem.com.on labor and employment,on assem.bill reg.sess.as introduced.according to an analysis by the senate committee on industrial relations,the purpose of the bill was to require an employer injury prevention program to cover workers employed by others if the workers are controlled or directed and supervised on the job by the employer and are exposed to worksite and job assignment hazards.com.on industrial relations,com.on assem.bill reg.sess.july,at see also assem.com.on labor and employment,republican analysis on assem.bill reg.sess.april,the bill requires secondary employers to broaden their injury prevention programs to include contract employees,if supervised by the employer.
moreover,it is well established that a proviso that limits the scope of a general provision must be strictly construed so that any exception must fall fairly within its terms.people ex rel.san francisco bay conservation development com.town of emeryville cal d.section,subdivision a is a broad provision that requires every employer to provide specific instruction with respect to hazards specific to each employee job assignment.therefore,to the extent subdivision h restricts those requirements,it must be strictly construed.subdivision h has no clear words of limitation.because the manifest purpose of assembly bill was to clarify the training obligations of secondary employers and not to alter the existing obligations of primary employers,we reject proposed construction.
nevertheless,adopts the argument of the alj,who found it unrealistic to expect an employer that rents employees to other employers to learn enough about the hazards specific to the secondary employers facilities and job assignments to provide the rented employees with effective safety training.we disagree.
under section,subdivision a,the primary employer general training responsibilities include general safe and healthy work practices and specific instruction with respect to hazards specific to each employee job assignment.according to pemco ii,supra,t o meet these labor code responsibilities,the primary employer is required to determine with particularity the work which a contract employee will be called upon to perform for the secondary employer.it shall maintain an accident prevention program and send out only employees who are trained to do the work 
we need not determine whether,in some hypothetical case,it is unrealistic to expect a primary employer to learn the hazards specific to a secondary jobsite,because in this case the work moreno performed for was the same work he was directed to perform for manhole.thus,the same general safety hazards and precautions were applicable and no additional expertise or knowledge was required.indeed,had a rule in its injury prevention program covering its primary employees relating to the specific hazard in question and instructed its operators to wear a seat belt when operating an asphalt roller.thus,because the subject was covered in training program,it was not beyond its area of expertise.
also argues that under worker compensation law,when a worker is injured while working for a different employer,that person is only entitled to compensation benefits from that employer,not from both employers.it asserts that the same principle should operate for workplace safety responsibility.
while we agree the same principle should operate in both areas of the law,argument is flawed because it is based on the erroneous view that liability under worker compensation law is limited to one employer.it is not.kowalski shell oil cal d,when general and special employment exist,the injured workman can look to both employers for worker compensation benefits brassinga city of view,supra,th at,d.
for these reasons,we conclude subdivision h does not relieve a primary employer of its responsibilities for providing general safety training to its employee when it leases that employee to a secondary employer.
injury prevention program failed to satisfy the cited regulation 
contends it did not violate section and section of the regulations hereafter section and section because it had an effective injury and prevention program,which was not deficient under the
