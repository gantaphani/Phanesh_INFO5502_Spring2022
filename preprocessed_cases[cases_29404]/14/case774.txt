disregarding multiple staff recommendations to the contrary,the town of woodside town issued a permit to steve jobs authorizing the demolition of a mansion of historic significance to permit the construction of a smaller single family residence.the town council council,like the planning commission,found that the proposed alternatives to the demolition identified in an environmental impact report eir are not feasible and that overriding considerations justify approval of a conditional demolition permit despite the adverse impact on the environment.upon a petition by respondent uphold our heritage heritage,a private group of preservationists,the superior court concluded that these findings are not supported by substantial evidence and issued a writ of mandate directing the town to set aside its approval of the demolition permit.the town and jobs have jointly appealed.we are not unsympathetic with the manner in which the town has attempted to strike a balance between the competing interests in permitting the property owner to improve his property as he wishes and preserving as much of the historical resource as possible.nonetheless,based on our independent review of the administrative record,we must agree with the trial court that the town feasibility findings are not supported by substantial evidence.we therefore shall affirm the judgment.
factual and procedural history 
in,jobs purchased a single family home,known as the jackling house,in woodside.the house is square feet,has rooms,bedrooms and bathrooms,and is situated on a site of approximately six acres on a rolling,forested landscape.the mansion was built in for daniel jackling,who was a key figure in the american copper industry.the house was designed by george washington smith,a leading architect in the spanish colonial revival style in the united states and contains many unique copper fixtures reflective of jackling work in the mining industry.
jobs lived in the house for approximately years and then rented it to others for several years.since the house has been vacant and been permitted to deteriorate.in february,jobs applied to the town for a permit to demolish the house.the town consulted an expert who determined that the building qualifies as an historical resource under the california environmental quality act ceqa pub.resources code,et so that the preparation of an eir was required before a permit could be issued 
an eir was prepared by town staff,including the planning director,town attorney,and an outside legal consultant hired for her experience in matters relating to historic preservation.the eir concludes that demolition of the house would result in significant impact to the cultural resources of the state.the demolition of the house would mean that the physical characteristics of the structure that convey its historical significance the exterior and interior design and the presence of the structure as an example of the spanish colonial revival style architecture,and the association of the structure with a historical figure would not be present.the eir suggests as mitigation measures that prior to demolition,the applicant should develop historical and photographic documentation of the structure and that the applicant should use a qualified salvage company to remove and store features of the home that are identified as significant by an architectural historian.nonetheless,the eir concludes that the implementation of these mitigation measures would retain only a small portion of the house architectural significance and for that reason,the measures would not reduce the impact of demolition to less than significant on the historic resource.
the eir provided five alternatives to the requested demolition permit.these are 
no project alternative.this alternative would involve the withdrawal of the project being analyzed,and the resulting impacts would generally be a continuation of the existing conditions on the project site.
historic rehabilitation of the jackling house.this alternative would involve rehabilitation and restoration of the jackling house to allow for the potential habitation of the home and to maintain the structure historic significance under this alternative,all features,finishes,and spaces would be retained while allowing for upgrades and changes to the kitchens and bathrooms.the estimated cost to implement alternative is approximately million.
historic rehabilitation of the jackling house and new addition.this alternative would involve the rehabilitation of the jackling house with modifications to the existing design to create a more conventional floor plan,especially to the second floor.as part of this alternative,an addition to the house would be constructed,composed of three major use areas a new living area with entertainment room,an office suite,and a fitness area.the estimated cost to implement alternative is approximately million.
relocation and historic rehabilitation of the jackling house.this alternative includes relocating the jackling house to another portion of the project site and rehabilitating the house as described under alternative the estimated cost to implement alternative is approximately million.
relocation and historic rehabilitation of the jackling house.this alternative includes relocating the jackling house to an unknown location and rehabilitating the house as described in alternative i t would cost about million to rehabilitate the house and additional site work.the estimated cost to implement alternative would be at least million,but the exact total cost can not be estimated because there is not a specific target site.
the eir was forwarded to the town planning commission with the staff recommendation to deny the demolition permit.the staff concluded that the proposed demolition was inconsistent with the town goals of preserving the rural character and natural beauty of the town and encouraging the maintenance,rehabilitation,and improvements to existing buildings and structures.after a public hearing,however,the planning commission adopted a resolution approving the demolition of the house subject to certain conditions.the planning commission found that the project alternatives are not feasible and that,while demolition of the jackling house would have significant unavoidable environmental impacts,the town interest in conserving its open space resources outweighed the impacts to the historic resource.
heritage appealed the decision of the planning commission to the council,raising the same issues that are disputed in this litigation,and the council considered the application de novo.the council received a report from its staff recommending denial of the permit on the ground that the alternatives listed in the eir are feasible and received considerable additional input at a public hearing.ultimately,the council adopted a resolution certifying the eir and authorizing the demolition permit subject to certain conditions the council found that none of the alternatives identified in the final eir are feasible.alternative no project fails to meet the project objectives and does not protect a historic resource.alternative renovation is economically unjustifiable.alternative renovation plus addition is both economically unjustifiable and an enlargement of an already structure.alternative moving on site is economically unjustifiable,results in an enlargement of building mass on the site,and may compromise the historic resource.alternative moving is economically unjustifiable,physically impossible,and will severely compromise the historic resource.the council issued a statement of overriding considerations,finding that as conditioned,the project will provide a public benefit in implementing the town general plan.
heritage filed a petition for a writ of mandate in the superior court,alleging that t here is no substantial evidence to support the town conclusion that the alternatives to the demolition of the jackling estate are infeasible and that t here is no substantial evidence to support the town conclusion that specific overriding economic,legal,social,technological,or other benefits of the project outweigh the significant effects on the environment.the trial court agreed with both contentions and entered judgment granting the petition for writ of mandate.the court ordered the town to set aside the approval of the demolition permit and the statement of overriding considerations.the town and jobs jointly filed a timely notice of appeal.
discussion 
the petition for a writ of administrative mandamus,as framed by the pleadings,is relatively narrow in scope.heritage has not challenged the adequacy of the eir.it contends only that substantial evidence does not support the town findings that the alternatives to the proposed demolition identified in the eir are not feasible and that overriding considerations justify approving the permit notwithstanding the adverse and unmitigated environmental impacts.on appeal,appellants dispute the contrary conclusions reached by the superior court and argue that both findings are supported by substantial evidence.see also fn,ante.

economic feasibility 
the council found that alternatives through were not economically feasible.appellants contend that these findings are supported by evidence that the cost of restoration was estimated to range from million,based on the analysis in the eir,to between and million,as estimated by jobs.they also cite statements at the hearing made by councilmember tanner,a contractor,who inspected the property and determined that the cost to restore the house would be incredible.he explained that the house was suffering from substantial dry rot.anything that was exterior that was on wood dry rotted.and it would go back inside the main part of the structure.and you really had to take them apart all the time and fix them.the standards back then for building were,they were for high maintenance.so,whoever had this,buys this house if they wanted to restore it or whatever happens to it,it would be a very high maintenance home and not seismically correct.
the trial court concluded that this evidence was insufficient.the court explained,there is no evidence of any economic analysis whatsoever to compare the cost of the proposed alternatives which costs are estimated in the eir,except for alternative versus the cost of the proposed project,the estimated cost of the new residence.the purpose of the project is to tear down a single family residence in order to build a single family residence.no costs of building the new residence were provided to the town council because jobs has declined to provide any design,plans,or specification of the new residence until after his demolition permit is granted.thus,there is no cost comparison or analysis supporting any of these findings that each of the alternatives are economically unjustifiable.that the alternatives may cost millions of dollars is not enough information as it has no context.it is certainly possible that jobs may ultimately seek to build a house which costs more than simply rehabilitating the existing house he previously lived in for years.all of this is unknown to the town council,and thus their finding of economic infeasibility is not supported by substantial evidence,and was arbitrary and capricious.boldface omitted.
we agree with the trial court that the council finding that the alternatives are not economically feasible is not supported by substantial evidence,at least with regard to alternatives and as noted by the trial court,the feasibility of the alternatives must be evaluated within the context of the proposed project.the fact that an alternative may be more expensive or less profitable is not sufficient to show that the alternative is financially infeasible.what is required is evidence that the additional costs or lost profitability are sufficiently severe as to render it impractical to proceed with the project.citizens of goleta valley board of supervisors,supra,d at,italics added.while an eir need not analyze every imaginable alternative or mitigation measure,it should evince good faith and a reasoned analysis.los angeles unified school dist.city of los angeles,supra th at,d san francisco ecology center city and county of san francisco d.ceqa guidelines,subd.c.
the fact that rehabilitation may cost between and million is insufficient to support a reasonable inference that this alternative is not economically feasible.without some information concerning the cost of constructing a new residence on the property,it is not possible to determine whether the cost of renovating the existing historic structure is reasonable or feasible.indeed,so far as the present record reflects,it may be less expensive to renovate and preserve the existing structure than to build a new square foot residence suitable for the area.if the cost of renovation exceeds the cost of new construction,it is the magnitude of the difference that will determine the feasibility of this alternative.see preservation action council city of san jose th,d city finding that alternative was infeasible because it would produce a competitive disadvantage was not supported by substantial evidence where neither the eir nor the administrative record contained any data about the size of other home improvement warehouses in the area with which the applicant would compete.there is no evidence in the record on which such a determination can be made.
in requiring such an evaluation,we do not imply any disagreement with appellants that jobs personal wealth or ability to shoulder the costs of the proposed alternatives is irrelevant.in maintain our desert environment town of apple valley th,d,the court rejected the claim that the financial wherewithal of the project applicant bears upon the feasibility of mitigation measures and project alternatives.id.at,d.ceqa should not be interpreted to allow discrimination between project applicants for an identical project based upon the financial status of the applicant.id.at,d.the court explained,economic unfeasibility is not measured by increased cost or lost profit,but upon whether the effect of the proposed mitigation is such that the project is rendered impractical.citation.the fact that a project costs too much to be profitable or can not operate at a profit so as to render it impractical does not hinge on the wealth of its proponent.no proponent,whether wealthy or not,is likely to proceed with a project that will not be economically successful.but,if the project can be economically successful with mitigation,then ceqa requires that mitigation,regardless of the proponent financial status.id.at,d.accordingly,the question is not whether jobs can afford the proposed alternative,but whether the marginal costs of the alternative as compared to the cost of the proposed project are so great that a reasonably prudent property owner would not proceed with the rehabilitation.see san franciscans upholding the downtown plan city and county of san francisco,supra,th at,d applying prudent person standard to determine economic feasibility of proposed alternatives.
appellants contend that because the project involves a single family residence intended to be used as a family home,rather than a commercial enterprise,extensive cost information is not required to support the finding of economic infeasibility.they argue that d eterminations under ceqa are controlled by a rule of reason,and what is reasonably practical under relevant circumstances.while the feasibility of constructing a single family home for personal use involves a certain degree of subjectivity,some context is nonetheless necessary.it may be sufficient to show that the cost of rehabilitating the existing house would be significantly more than the cost of building a new home of a quality appropriate to the area,or that the cost of the proposed alternative is so great that the property owner could never expect to recover the investment on resale.for example,in san franciscans upholding the downtown plan city and county of san francisco,supra,th at pages,d,the court noted that the experts who analyzed the alternative plans independently concluded that,even after taking into account all possible monetary incentives for historic preservation,the substantial costs of rehabilitating and preserving the emporium building would be millions of dollars more than the value the building could thereafter generate in its existing configuration,through any plausible usage,whether retail,office or residential.under these circumstances,the building has no remaining market value.see also sequoyah hills homeowners city of oakland th,d evidence of economic infeasibility included project sponsor comments on its market had rejected the concept of a project because the houses would be necessarily more expensive than those of the proposed project,and would defeat the project objective of providing the the least expensive housing for the vicinity.
it is not necessary to identify every conceivable means of establishing the lack of feasibility in a residential context,as the record in this case does not contain any such evidence.jobs has not submitted any estimates or other evidence indicating the likely cost of his proposed replacement home and there is no evidence of the average cost of building a square foot home in woodside.see,environmental council of sacramento city of sacramento th,d economic feasibility of mitigation measures is tied to the relevant conditions in the local real estate market.likewise,no analysis of the local real estate market has been performed.the record simply does not support the council finding that alternatives and are not economically feasible.
legal feasibility 
appellants contend that even if the alternatives are economically feasible,substantial evidence supports a finding that the alternatives are not legally feasible.appellants recognize that the council did not expressly find that the proposed alternatives are not legally feasible,but suggest that the council concern that it lacked the power to compel jobs to restore the existing structure implies a finding of legal infeasibility.we need not decide whether such a finding can be implied,because any such finding would not be defensible.
appellants contend that because the town can not compel jobs to restore jackling house or to sell his property,the alternatives are not feasible because they are not capable of being accomplished in a successful manner.the willingness of the applicant to accept a feasible alternative,however,is no more relevant than the financial ability of the applicant to complete the alternative.to define feasible as appellants suggest would render ceqa meaningless.
contrary to appellants argument,association of irritated residents county of madera th,d and foundation for san francisco architectural heritage city and county of san francisco d.do not support their interpretation of legal infeasibility.both are cases of economic infeasibility.in the first case,the court held substantial evidence supported the county finding that a reduction in the size of a proposed dairy project was economically infeasible.the dairy owner testified at the hearing that he did not believe the reduced size alternative would be feasible and the court found that his testimony,the lender letter and the economic analysis constitute substantial evidence supporting the board finding that the alternative is not economically feasible elimination of all profit and loss of construction financing adequately proves that the alternative is not viable.association of irritated residents county of madera,supra,at,d.in the second case,the
