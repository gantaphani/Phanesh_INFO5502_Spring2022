background 
bjc health systems,hired kci as a general contractor to build phase i of a campus integration project project,which entailed building the north campus parking garage.kci,the louis building and construction trades council,and all building trades affiliates signed a project agreement.local signed the project agreement as well.the project agreement included the following clause in section 
the collective bargaining agreement cba in effect between the unions executing this agreement and the employer or its subcontractors executing this agreement are applicable to the work,except as such cba may be modified by the provisions of this agreement the employer and its subcontractors acknowledge that in performing work,including local fabrication of custom millwork and casework,and local deliveries of construction material and equipment,they will utilize employees who are represented by unions affiliated with the building trades.
emphasis added.the project agreement also contained section to prevent work stoppage 
the unions and employees will not strike,nor engage in any picketing,sitdowns,slowdowns,sympathy strikes,or other refusals to work nor will employer or its subcontractors lock out the employees during the performance of the project.this no strike pledge includes jurisdictional disputes and contract expirations.the unions will not recognize any picket lines for or as a result of a jurisdictional dispute,sympathy strike,contract expiration or informational picket.
emphasis added.the project agreement also contained numerous other clauses sections,to make clear the parties intended to avoid work stoppages.finally,the project agreement included an arbitration clause section.
kci contracted with material service company msc to provide concrete for the project,because msc was able to supply the special concrete needed for the sophisticated project.msc employed local members to deliver the concrete to the project site,and no local members actually worked on the site other than to deliver construction material to the site.as far as this court can determine,msc never signed the project agreement.however,msc did enter into a collective bargaining agreement with local.
when the collective bargaining agreement between msc and local expired during the term of the project,local struck msc for approximately eight weeks in the summer of.during the strike,local members refused to deliver concrete for msc to the project site.because kci was unable to get local members to deliver the concrete for msc,msc management employees delivered the concrete.in response,local demanded kci cease and desist from using members to deliver concrete to the project site,concluding kci violated section and all other sections of the project agreement that may refer to union employees by accepting the delivery of concrete in trucks driven by persons other than employees who are represented by unions affiliated with the building trades.
kci filed a grievance against local for breaching the project agreement clause,section,by not delivering the concrete for msc to the project site.the grievance proceeded to a arbitration,with the first phase addressing liability and the second phase addressing damages.during the liability phase,kci contended local breached the clause by refusing to deliver concrete to the project site.local contended the project agreement did not apply to msc because msc was a supplier and the project agreement only applied to kci and its subcontractors.kci presented evidence at the hearing local did not.
in its opening statement to the arbitrator,kci discussed the interaction between sections and of the project agreement.kci recognized it ultimately agreed to the union request that teamster local would make all deliveries of construction materials and equipment to the job site.kci also made the following point in addition to sections and,the language of the entire agreement is controlling with regard to one simple fact,and that fact is the union got all the work,and the only thing kci got out of this whole particular thing is that the project would have no interruptions.rick grebel grebel,kci president,testified at the hearing that the project agreement sole purpose obviously is to have no work stoppages.in exchange for no work stoppages,basically the job is done a hundred percent union.when asked what two essential provisions of the project agreement kci contended local violated,grebel explicitly referenced sections and.
the arbitrator sustained kci grievance against local for violating its pledge.before enforcing the clause,the arbitrator concluded msc was a subcontractor as that term is used in the project agreement,such that the project agreement covers msc and its deliveries of construction material.the arbitrator then used section to conclude local violated its pledge contained in section 
so far as appears,local has steadfastly asserted the exclusive right to deliver all incoming materials on the site,and it steadfastly made deliveries in advance of the strike.for its part,kci recognized local exclusive delivery right as stemming directly from the same negotiations which produced local no strike pledge.having thus achieved the right to exclusive deliveries,and having accepted the benefits of such right in practice,local can not now be heard to deny its obligation to make deliveries under the same agreement.
emphasis added.based on these conclusions,the arbitrator,on january,issued an award on liability holding local refusal to deliver concrete to the project site violated the project agreement clause.
during the damages phase of the arbitration proceedings,the arbitrator awarded to kci based on local breach of the project agreement.in its damages award,the arbitrator confirmed his liability finding by reiterating his conclusion that a supplier of materials,msc can reasonably be viewed as a subcontractor under relevant case authorities,under the language of the agreement article and by virtue of the parties performance of the agreement in practice.during the arbitration proceedings,local never argued or intimated that section was an unlawful hot cargo agreement.
local then filed suit in federal court on july,seeking to vacate the arbitrator liability and damages awards in kci favor.local contended the arbitration awards failed to draw their essence from the project agreement.kci counterclaimed,seeking to confirm and enforce the arbitration awards.over six months after filing its federal suit,and more than two years after the arbitrator liability award,local amended its complaint on january,to add a hot cargo defense,contending for the first time that section of the project agreement is a hot cargo agreement that violates public policy.local later filed a motion for summary judgment,and kci filed a for summary judgment.
concluding the arbitration awards did not violate public policy and drew their essence from the project agreement,the district court granted kci motion for summary judgment,and entered an order confirming the arbitration awards.the district court concluded local hot cargo defense failed for three reasons.first,the district court determined local sandbagging tactics of failing to raise the issue to kci or before the arbitrator were improper local invoked section for its benefit and should not be heard to complain about its enforceability for the first time here in an effort to avoid payment of damages.the district court specifically held local can not withhold factual and legal arguments during arbitration and then raise them for the first time during enf
