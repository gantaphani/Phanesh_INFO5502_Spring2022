the secretary of the navy navy appeals the decision of the armed services board of contract appeals board finding in favor of joint venture cath on of claims for an equitable adjustment in contract price.joint venture,asbca,bca,board opinion.the navy asserts that the board erred in concluding that a resident officer in charge of contracts roicc,who was also the project manager pm during the performance period,had the authority to commit the government to compensable contract changes.because the contract explicitly reserved authority to modify the contract to the contracting officer co,the roicc did not have actual express or implied authority to direct the contractor to perform compensable contract changes,and we reverse the board conclusion as to claims,and.however,we affirm the board decision on claim because that claim is independently sustainable based on a differing site condition,which the navy does not appeal.finally,we remand claims,and to the board to determine whether the roicc directives on these claims were ratified.
background 
on september,cath and the navy entered into a fixed price contract for external renovation of a historic dental research facility at the great lakes naval training center in illinois.the contract incorporates by reference several standard government clauses including federal acquisition regulation far changes clause,which provides that the co may,at any time,make changes in the work within the general scope of the contract by written order designated as a change order.far also provides that for any change affecting the contractor cost or time of performance under the contract whether or not changed by any such order,the co shall make an equitable adjustment and modify the contract in writing.the contract also includes far differing site conditions april,which requires that a contractor give written notice to the co of subsurface,latent,or unknown physical conditions at the site that differ materially from those indicated in the contracting documents.after such notice,the co shall investigate the site conditions and if they do materially differ and cause an increase in the cost of or time required for completion of the contract an equitable adjustment shall be made under this clause and the contract modified accordingly by the.additionally,the contract incorporates naval facilities engineering command navfac clause contracting officer authority june and navfac clause government representatives june.the contracting officer authority clause reserves authority to the co to bind the government to any contract,modification,change order,letter or verbal direction to the contractor,and the government representatives clause indicates that while the engineer in charge eic will be designated by the contracting officer as his authorized representative responsible for monitoring performance and technical management,in no event will any modification of the contract by anyone other than the co bind the government.
before work under the contract began,a preconstruction conference was held,as required by contract specification section summary of work,paragraph,entitled preconstruction conference.paragraph states that the conference will be held with the co to develop a mutual understanding relative to the administration of the contract.the preconstruction conference attendees included numerous individuals from cath and the navy,including both the roicc pm and eic.although the contract required that the co attend the preconstruction conference,the co was not present.
during the preconstruction conference,the navy set forth its detailed guidelines for contract administration in a presentation that designated the roicc pm to administer the contract and stated that all correspondence should be addressed to the attention of ken active roicc pm.the presentation directed the contractor to use the requests for information rfi form routinely and i f necessary,forward rfi to navy pm for action.the presentation included two slides related to contract modification which state m odifications are written alterations to the contract which may change the work to be performed the contract price and time and n o work is to be performed beyond the contract requirements without written notification from the roicc.another slide related to disputes directed the contractor to submit a request for equitable adjustment to the roicc if it feels a contract modification is required and i f the roicc sees no entitlement,or the contractor does agree with the entitlement,the contractor has the right to request a contracting officer final decision,using the procedures outlined in the disputes clause but that t he contractor must proceed diligently with the work while awaiting the final decision.
cath began work under the dental facility contract on january.soon thereafter,cath received a letter from the navy that reassigned the administration of the contract to eic tim meland and indicated that all correspondence regarding the contract should be sent to meland attention.in response to this letter,cath submitted a rfi seeking documentation of assignment of authority and the level of authority of meland,among others.the navy responded to this rfi with respect to meland as follows 
tim meland.project manager serves as the government construction manager on all assigned projects.responsible for construction management and contract administration on assigned projects while providing quality assurance and technical engineering construction advice.provides technical and administrative direction to resolve problems encountered during construction.a project manager analyzes and interprets contract drawings and specifications to determine the extent of contractors responsibility.prepares coordinates correspondence,submittal reviews,estimates,and contract modifications in support to ensure a satisfactory and timely completion of projects.
during the course of the project,meland and his successor received numerous rfis from cath that requested clarification of the contract requirements and gave notice of site conditions that may require deviation from the contract specifications with a request for a decision.in each case,the roicc pm signed the response to the rfi.when necessary,the pm asked for the input,which was also provided to the contractor in the pm response.some of these responses included a preprinted statement that the response is a contract requirement,which the pm marked.
after cath renovation work under the contract was deemed substantially complete,it submitted a cumulative request for a contract modification and several adjustments to the pm,in accordance with the procedure for equitable adjustment requests set forth in the preconstruction conference presentation.the pm responded,indicating we will thoroughly review the submitted documentation and will formally respond in writing at a future date.after the roicc office failed to act on the request for five months,cath submitted a certified request in december.
a co issued a page final decision on july,detailing each claim and finding entitlement to an equitable adjustment for claims.in this decision,the co recommended that cath and the roicc office negotiate the amount cath is entitled to for its meritorious claims and asked that cath request for a final decision on those claims be held in abeyance subject to further discussions with the roicc.cath attempted on several occasions to meet with the navy to reach an agreement as to the amount cath should receive for these claims,but despite the co direction in the july decision letter,inexplicably,the navy refused to meet with cath.
when this appeal was brought before the board,it was cath position that only an accounting was needed for these twelve claims because of the co confirmation that cath was entitled to recover on those claims.the board similarly viewed the july decision as a concession to entitlement and issued a show cause order requesting the navy to explain why entitlement should not be granted to cath on those twelve claims.the navy responded that the july,decision was not a determination of entitlement.in a memorandum dated may,the board indicated that the final decision clearly concede s entitlement on these items,leaving only quantum to be resolved and stated that the government interpretation to the contrary was unreasonable.shortly thereafter,the navy issued a second final decision two pages in length denying all of cath claims,including the twelve claims the co previously determined had merit.unlike the first,this second final decision contained no discussion of individual claims,but rather stated that because no additional data had been provided,the claims were denied for lack of entitlement.the board then considered entitlement and damages for each claim anew.
the navy argued for the first time on appeal that the co did not direct the work set forth in the claims for equitable adjustment and that under the contract only the co has the authority to change the scope of work or authorize compensable changes.in an order dated august,the board sustained in whole or in part of cath claims.board opinion,op.at.with respect to all but one of the claims that the navy has appealed to this court,the board determined that the roicc pm directed changes that resulted in costs beyond those required by the contract and that these changes were compensable because the delegation of authority clause in the contract gave him responsibility for construction management and contract administration.the board concluded that meland,as the pm,had express actual authority to resolve minor problems that arose during the project based on the navy rfi response,which indicated that he was responsible for construction management and contract administration and that he was authorized to provide technical and administrative direction to resolve problems encountered during construction.board opinion,op.at quoting urban pathfinders,asbca bca at.additionally,the board sustained entitlement to recover for claim under the contract differing site condition clause,far.
the secretary timely appealed the board decision.see g b.this court has jurisdiction under a.
the navy appeals the board equitable adjustment of the contract price with respect to claims,and to demonstrate entitlement to an equitable adjustment,cath must prove that the contract was modified by someone with actual authority.where a party contracts with the government,apparent authority of the government agent to modify the contract is not sufficient an agent must have actual authority to bind the government.see trauma serv.group united states.such actual authority may be express or implied from the authority granted to that agent.we must determine whether meland had express or implied authority to bind the government to contract modifications he approved,or whether these changes were ratified by the.
express authority 
with respect to contracts for supplies and services,the federal government has given the authority to enter into and modify contracts to only a limited class of government employees contracting officers.see a vesting agency heads with authority to contract for supplies and services and mandating that c ontracts may be entered into and signed on behalf of the government only by contracting officers only contracting officers acting within the scope of their authority are empowered to execute contract modifications on behalf of the government.in addition to possessing authority to enter into a contract on behalf of the government,contracting officers have the authority to,among other things,administer the contract and ensure the contractor compliance with the contract terms.see.
when authorized,the contracting officer may delegate some of its authority to certain designated representatives,who act on behalf of the government during contract administration.see john cibinic,ralph nash,james nagle,administration of government contracts ed.in this case,a limited delegation of authority occurred.the contract entered into by the navy and cath contains a clause that states that the contracting officer may designate a contracting officer representative cor to perform specific technical or administrative functions.see.it also contains a clause entitled government representatives jun,which states that t he contract will be administered by an authorized representative of the contracting officer.that clause goes on to state that the project engineer in charge is an authorized representative of the contracting officer and is responsible for monitoring performance and the technical management of the effort required hereunder,and should be contacted regarding questions or problems of a technical nature.
it is very clear,however,that the contracting officer limited delegation of authority to the eic did not include the authority to make contract modifications,nor could it have.for one thing,such a delegation was prohibited by a department of defense regulation,which states that a contracting officer representative cor m ay not be delegated authority to make any commitments or changes that affect price,quality,quantity,delivery,or other terms and conditions of the contract.indeed,this express limitation on the cor authority was incorporated into a clause of the contract itself,which,likewise,states that t he cor is not authorized to make any commitments or changes that will affect price,quality,quantity,delivery,or any other term or condition of the contract.see.
moreover two other clauses in the contract made it clear to cath that the contracting officer was the only person with the authority to make changes to the contract.the same clause that designates the eic as an authorized representative of the contracting officer provides that 
i n no event,however,will any understanding or agreement,modification,change order,or other matter deviating from the terms of the contract between the contractor and any person other than the contracting officer be effective or binding upon the government,unless formalized by proper contractual documents executed by the contracting officer prior to completion of this contract.
and yet another clause of the contract,entitled contracting officer authority jun,states emphasis added 
in no event shall any understanding or agreement between the contractor and any government employee other than the contracting officer on any contract,modification,change order,letter or verbal direction to the contractor be effective or binding upon the government.all such actions must be formalized by a proper contractual document executed by an appointed contracting officer.the contractor is hereby put on notice that in the event a government employee other than the contracting officer directs a change in the work to be performed or increases the scope of the work to be performed,it is the contractor responsibility to make inquiry of the contracting officer before making the deviation.payments will not be made without being authorized by an appointed contracting officer with the legal authority to bind the government.
the contract is clear,only the co had the authority to make modifications.meland did not have the express authority to bind the government to contract modifications.
ii.implied authority 
the issue of implied authority is a much closer case.the government is not without blame for the confusion surrounding the contract in this case.for example,the contract required the co to attend the preconstruction conference during which the navy explained contract administration procedures.the co did not attend.at that meeting the navy presentation included a slide that stated 
contract modifications 
modifications are written alterations to the contract which may change the work to be performed the contract price and time.oral modifications will not be used.
bilateral contractor and the roicc have agreed upon an adjustment to the contract 
unilateral roicc can direct the contractor to take some action under the contract 
no work is to be performed beyond the contract requirements without written notification from the roicc 
cath dutifully complied with the navy directions for contract administration presented in the preconstruction conference through the entire process.the problem is that these navy directives contradicted the c
