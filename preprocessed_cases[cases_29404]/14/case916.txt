factual and procedural background 
from about through,presley designed,developed,constructed,marketed and sold residential condominiums in a common interest development known as windham project presley conveyed to each buyer of a project condominium title to a living unit and an undivided fractional interest in the common areas appurtenant to the living unit.presley formed association to manage,maintain,and repair project common areas.presley filed a declaration of covenants,conditions and restrictions ccr that provides association with the authority and duty to maintain and repair the common areas provides association with an easement over the common areas for the purpose of maintaining and repairing the common areas prohibits owners from constructing,reconstructing,or refurbishing any part of the common areas,except for exclusive use common areas,without association permission and provides that each owner must be a member of association and pay assessments to association for its repair of the common areas.

implied warranties and privity of contract generally 
a warranty is a contractual term concerning some aspect of the sale,such as title to the goods,or their quality or quantity.the warranty may be express citation or implied citation.witkin,summary of cal.law ed.sales.implied warranties are based on implied representations rather than on promises.lord,williston on contracts ed.implied warranties may be created by statute or case law.see,pollard saxe yolles dev.cal d.pollard established an implied warranty of reasonable workmanship in design and construction that applies to the sale of newly constructed real property.id.at.pollard stated 
the doctrine of implied warranty in a sales contract is based on the actual and presumed knowledge of the seller,reliance on the sellers skill or judgment,and the ordinary expectations of the parties.citation.in the setting of the marketplace,the builder or seller of new unlike the manufacturer or merchandiser of implied representations,ordinarily indispensable to the sale,that the builder has used reasonable skill and judgment in constructing the building.on the other hand,the purchaser does not usually possess the knowledge of the builder and is unable to fully examine a completed house and its components without disturbing the finished product.further,unlike the purchaser of an older building,he has no opportunity to observe how the building has withstood the passage of time.thus he generally relies on those in a position to know the quality of the work to be sold,and his reliance is surely evident to the construction industry.therefore,we conclude builders and sellers of new construction should be held to what is impliedly the completed structure was designed and constructed in a reasonably workmanlike manner.id.at,fn.omitted,italics added.
the general rule is that privity of contract between the plaintiff and defendant is required in an action for breach of either express or implied warranty and that there is no privity between the original seller and a subsequent purchaser who is not a party to the original sale.citations.burr sherwin williams cal d.a demurrer is properly sustainable in an action predicated upon a breach of an implied warranty when lack of privity between plaintiff and defendant is disclosed on the fact of the complaint.citation.anthony d.exceptions to the privity requirement have been established in cases involving foodstuffs,drugs and pesticides klein duchess sandwich,cal d,gottsdanker cutter laboratories d.arnold dow chemical th,d.furthermore,an expansion of the privity concept has been established for certain employees who are injured while using dangerous products purchased by their employers.peterson lamb rubber cal d.peterson stated t he term privity itself appears to be of uncertain origin and meaning and to have been developed by the courts and applied in various contexts.citations.one of the customary definitions is that privity denotes mutual or successive relationship to the same thing or right of property it implies succession.citation.thus,in the present context,the employe e had the successive right to the possession and use of the grinding wheel handed over to him by his,and,we believe,should fairly be considered to be in privity to the with respect to the implied warranties of fitness for use and of merchantable quality upon which recovery is here sought.ibid.
association contends the trial court erred by concluding that because there was no contract between association and presley and the common areas were not conveyed to association by presley,association did not have the requisite privity of contract with presley to state a cause of action against presley for breach of implied warranty with respect to the common areas.association argues section statutorily provides the requisite privity.
we independently construe statutory law,as its interpretation is a question of law on which we are not bound by the trial court analysis.citations.lazar hertz,supra,th at,d.the fundamental goal of statutory construction is to ascertain the intent of the legislature so as to effectuate the purpose of the statute.renee superior court cal th,d,wilcox birtwhistle cal th,d.in construing a statute,our first task is to look to the language of the statute itself.citation.when the language is clear and there is no uncertainty as to the legislative intent,we look no further and simply enforce the statute according to its terms.citation.additionally,however,we must consider the statutory language in the context of the entire statute citation and the statutory scheme of which it is a part.phelps stostad cal th,d.if the statutory language is clear and unambiguous,there is no need for construction,nor is it necessary to resort to indicia of the intent of the legislature lungren deukmejian cal d.if the language permits more than one reasonable interpretation,however,the court looks to a variety of extrinsic aids,including the ostensible objects to be achieved,the evils to be remedied,the legislative history,public policy,contemporaneous administrative construction,and the statutory scheme of which the statute is a part.citation.after considering these extrinsic aids,we must select the construction that comports most closely with the apparent intent of the legislature,with a view to promoting rather than defeating the general purpose of the statute,and avoid an interpretation that would lead to absurd consequences.citation.wilcox,supra,at,d.
section,subdivision a provides 
an association established to manage a common interest development shall have standing to institute,defend,settle,or intervene in litigation,arbitration,mediation,or administrative proceedings in its own name as the real party in interest and without joining with it the individual owners of the common interest development,in matters pertaining to the following

section formerly section was originally enacted in in response to friendly village community,silva hill constr.d,which held a condominium owners association could not pursue a construction defect action against a grading contractor because the association did not own,possess,or have the right to possess,the common area property allegedly damaged and therefore lacked standing to sue.id.at.see orange grove terrace owners bryant properties,d.section does not limit the theory of liability an association may pursue.orange grove stated 
we perceive no reason for distinguishing between the association and other similarly situated plaintiffs with respect to the recovery it may seek once its standing is established.section does not suggest that the association recovery is limited to damages caused by negligent acts occurring during the association existence.in fact,the cases and textwriters suggest just the opposite,assuming that section empowers an association to bring an action against a developer for damages to common areas arising out of defective workmanship or materials.citations.orange grove terrace owners,supra,at.
applying the rules of statutory construction,we conclude section statutorily provides association with the requisite privity to state a cause of action against presley for breach of implied warranty with respect to the common areas of a condominium owned by a member of the association.the relevant language of section,subdivision a provides 
an association established to manage a common interest development shall have standing to institute litigation in its own name as the real party in interest and without joining with it the individual owners of the common interest development,in matters pertaining to d amage to the common areas.italics added.
because section grants an association standing to sue as a real party in interest for damage to a common interest development common areas,we conclude the plain meaning of section language provides association with the requisite privity for maintaining a cause of action for breach of implied warranty for alleged damage to the common areas within the project.section provides every action must be prosecuted in the name of the real party in interest,except as otherwise provided by statute.a real party in interest is generally defined as the person possessing the right sued upon by reason of the substantive law.citation.killian millard d.the question of standing to sue is one of the right to relief and goes to the existence of a cause of action against the defendant citation.payne united california bank d.t he real party in interest is the party who has title to the cause of action,the one who has the right to maintain the cause of action.vaughn dame construction d.a real party in interest is the owner of the cause of action.id.at.for example,s omeone who is not a party to a contract has no standing to enforce the contract or to recover damages for wrongful withholding of benefits to the contracting party.hatchwell blue shield of california d.therefore,because section provides that associations have standing to sue in their own names as real parties in interest for damage to common areas,it deems associations to be owners of causes of action for damage to common areas with the right to relief for that damage.section language gives associations the right to maintain causes of action for damage to common areas,including causes of action for damage based on an alleged breach of implied warranty.because section gives associations the right to maintain breach of implied warranty causes of action as real parties in interest,its plain meaning necessarily includes the grant to associations of status as parties with the requisite privity of contract.
to the extent section language is ambiguous and reasonably susceptible of alternative meanings,we nevertheless conclude extrinsic aids support our conclusion that the legislature intended section to give associations the right to maintain as real parties in interest causes of action for breach of implied warranty for damage to common areas,including the requisite privity of contract.the parties do not cite,and we are unaware of,any legislative history regarding section or former section that discusses or otherwise relates to causes of action by associations for breach of implied warranty absent relevant legislative history,we consider the statute apparent purpose and public policy factors.the rationale for allowing homeowners associations to bring suit under section is that if the association does not have standing,the costs of prosecution of the case would not be a common ex
