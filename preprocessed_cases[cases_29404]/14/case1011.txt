background 
plaintiffs,lisa shannon,timothy shannon,brian connelly,susan west,shapour arami,bruce fischer,and james torongo,own homes covered with a boise cascade exterior composite wood siding product.the siding was installed on the homes when they were built between and.while five of the plaintiffs are subsequent purchasers,fischer and torongo are the original owners of their homes.boise cascade began manufacturing its composite siding about but has not manufactured,sold,or marketed the siding since.
plaintiffs filed a putative class action suit,asserting,inter alia,a claim under the consumer fraud and deceptive business practices act act ilcs et west,alleging that boise cascade composite siding was defective in that it was subject to rotting,buckling,warping,wick moisture,and general failure.plaintiffs complaint further alleged that boise cascade deceptively advertised the composite siding,falsely representing that the siding was of inherent good quality,durable,low maintenance,and looked and performed comparably to natural wood siding.the complaint also avers that boise cascade fraudulently and deceptively failed to disclose that its siding performed poorly in the field,with a high rate of failure,was sensitive to moisture,and required highly particularized maintenance.
admissions in all of the plaintiffs depositions established that none had received any representations regarding the siding from boise cascade.an illustrative example is plaintiff connelly,who testified that he purchased his home in.at the time of the purchase,he did not know who manufactured the siding and he was not aware of any advertising,literature,or other representations about the siding.lisa and thomas shannon,west,and arami did not know the siding was a boise cascade product.before purchasing their homes,they were aware that siding damage was present.fischer and torongo,the two plaintiffs who purchased new homes,reviewed brochures prepared by the builder containing representations about the siding.those representations were from the builder and were not consistent with boise cascade product literature.the complaint did not allege that any named builder,architect,or engineer had received boise cascade product literature,or that any plaintiff,in making a decision to purchase a home,communicated in any way with any builder,architect,or engineer who had received boise cascade product literature.no evidence was proffered at the summary judgment hearing relating to the distribution of product literature to anyone.moreover,prior to the summary judgment hearing plaintiffs did not request leave to amend their complaint to allege that they relied on builders,architects,or engineers who had been deceived by boise cascade product literature.
the circuit court granted boise cascade summary judgment,stating that seven of the eight plaintiffs neither saw,heard,or otherwise were aware of the defendant advertising,and finding that the claimed damages were not proximately caused by the alleged deceptive advertising.the circuit court refused to enter summary judgment against an eighth plaintiff,jack babel,who bought his home new in,knew the siding was manufactured by boise cascade,and had read some of boise cascade publications prior to making his purchase.babel claim is not at issue in this appeal.
following a supreme court rule a finding by the circuit court that there was no just reason to delay enforcement or appeal a,plaintiffs appealed,arguing that the circuit court improperly analyzed the elements of a cause of action under the act,in particular the concepts of materiality and proximate causation.the appellate court reversed,holding that the circuit court construed the act too narrowly by requiring privity,some sort of direct contact between the plaintiffs and the representations made by boise cascade.boise cascade,d at.according to the appellate court,the act created a new cause of action,affording consumers broad protection by prohibiting any deception or false promise.boise cascade,d at.the appellate court further held that the circuit court erred in its conclusion that there was no proximate causation.boise cascade,d at.according to the appellate court,w here reasonable minds could differ whether the defendant conduct was a substantial factor in bringing about the injury,the matter is for the jury to decide.boise cascade,d at.
justice turner dissented.he believed that the majority failed to address the actual proximate cause theory advanced by plaintiffs in this case.boise cascade,d at,turner,dissenting.the plaintiffs theory,as alleged in the complaint,posited that in the absence of the promotion and marketing activities of boise cascade a market would not have been developed for composite wood siding and thus the siding would not have been sold in the state of illinois and therefore it would not have been installed on the residences of plaintiffs and the other members of the class.
boise cascade sought leave to appeal to this court and,while the petition was pending,we filed our opinion in oliveira amoco oil.oliveira involved a putative class action against a gasoline company under the act,where plaintiff alleged that amoco engaged in a deceptive advertising campaign for its premium gasolines,resulting in consumer fraud.in oliveira,this court rejected the plaintiff market theory of proximate causation that was almost identical to the theory pleaded by plaintiffs here.oliveira,at.we then vacated the appellate court judgment and directed that court to reconsider its judgment in the light of oliveira.shannon boise cascade,supervisory order.
plaintiffs then sought leave from the appellate court to amend their complaint rs,to allege that certain unspecified architects,code promulgating bodies,materials suppliers,builders and homeowners relied on boise cascade representations.the proposed amendment did not allege,however,that any of the builders,material suppliers,architects,or other third parties actually involved in the plaintiffs homes were aware of the alleged misrepresentations.it reiterated the market theory of proximate cause as set out in their original complaint.leave to amend was denied.
the appellate court distinguished oliveira,stating that the oliveira plaintiff was solely concerned with price and did not complain that the product involved was defective.d at.further,according to the appellate court,i t is sometimes possible to rely on misrepresentations without reading the documents in which such misrepresentations are made.purchasers of homes employ builders,architects,and engineers to examine the product literature for them and it is a mistake to say that home purchasers do not rely on that product literature.d at.
justice turner again dissented,arguing that oliveira controlled.d at,turner,dissenting.in particular,he found the majority insouciance to our decision in oliveira vexing.d at,turner,dissenting.we granted boise cascade petition for leave to appeal and now reverse the judgment of the appellate court.
summary judgment is proper where the pleadings,depositions,and admissions on file,when viewed in the light most favorable to the nonmoving party,reveal that there is no genuine issue as to any
