introduction 
this is a principally a takings case.in dolan city of tigard,d and nollan california coastal commission,d,the united states supreme court adopted what is called a nexus and rough proportionality test to be applied in an exaction case when a public entity conditions approval of a proposed development on the dedication of property to public use.see monterey del monte dunes at monterey,d.the united states and california supreme courts have only applied the nollan dolan nexus and rough proportionality test when an adjudicative decision is made in the case of an individual developer request for approval of a project.san remo hotel city and county of san francisco cal th,d,see lingle chevron,d.
plaintiff,action apartment association,challenges the june,enactment of ordinance which modified existing requirements on housing construction.plaintiff argues ordinance,on its face,constitutes an unlawful uncompensated taking.plaintiff asserts the decision of the united states supreme court in lingle chevron,supra,at page.expands the nexus and rough proportionality test beyond the scope of an individual adjudicative decision.plaintiff argues that the nexus and rough proportionality test applies in the case of a facial challenge to a land use regulation not only when conducting judicial review of an adjudicative decision made in the case of an individual developer request for approval of a project.thus,plaintiff argues it is entitled to a trial on its takings claim utilizing the nexus and rough proportionality test.also,plaintiff argues ordinance could not be operative without prior review by the california department of housing and community development pursuant to government code section,subdivision b.we disagree with both of plaintiff challenges to ordinance and affirm the judgment.
ii.the verified complaint 
on september,plaintiff filed its verified complaint which sought to invalidate ordinance.named as defendants are the city of santa monica the city and its city council the council.on june,the council adopted ordinance which amended santa monica municipal code sections,and.according to plaintiff,an association of owners of developed and undeveloped properties,the ordinance modified the options for meeting affordable housing requirements.the ordinance imposed requirements on developers constructing ownership housing projects in a residential district.under those circumstances,absent a waiver,the developer was required to construct affordable housing on the site of the development or at another location.
in the first cause of action for an unlawful taking under the federal and state constitutions,plaintiff alleged the requirements to build subsidized affordable housing units were not roughly proportional to any impact that might occur from the construction of new or replacement condominium units there was no nexus between the construction of new or replacement condominium units and the need for subsidized housing defendant had failed to demonstrate any nexus or rough proportionality between the construction of new or replacement housing and a significant need for more subsidized housing and market forces were not responsible for an absence of affordable housing within defendant boundaries.thus according to plaintiff,on its face,ordinance violated the takings clauses of the fifth amendment of the united states constitution and article i,section of the california constitution because there was an absence of a nexus between the construction of market rate residences and a shortage of affordable units defendants had conducted no study which verified the existence of any rough proportionality between the construction of new or replacement homes and a significant increased need for subsidized housing builders and buyers alike were not responsible for the purported lack of affordable housing in the city and to the extent the buyers nor builders of housing have the responsibility to house the city workforce,that obligation should not be disproportionately incurred by the purchasers of new housing.
the first cause of action alleged the lack of a nexus between the construction of housing within the city of santa monica and a shortage of affordable units within the city of santa monica means that the affordable unit and related conditions found in city of santa monica ordinance no.violate the takings clause of the fifth amendment to the united states constitution and the takings clause of article i,section,of the california constitution.in addition,plaintiff alleged the ordinance failed to advance any substantial governmental interest and thus further violated the state constitution takings clause.hence,plaintiff sought a declaration that the ordinance violated the federal and state constitutional takings clauses.
the second cause of action alleged defendants had failed to determine whether there was a reasonable relationship between the use of the fee and the type of development upon which the fee would be imposed.additionally,defendants failed to determine there was a reasonable relationship between the need for the public facility and the type of project upon which the fee was imposed.therefore,plaintiff alleged ordinance violated government code sections through.
the third cause of action sought a declaration that ordinance violated government code sections and.according to plaintiff,by reason of ordinance alone and in combination with the city zoning codes and related height,setback,and parking requirements,it was now physically and economically infeasible for property owners to build new or replacement condominium housing.also,because of the city zoning code,there were limits on the number of condominium units that could be placed on a single lot.because of the density limits and the onsite affordable housing construction requirements created by ordinance,a builder could no longer physically take advantage of the maximum density bonus provided by state law.thus,because ordinance,standing alone or in conjunction with the city zoning code,created a constraint on the production of new housing as such it must be approved by the california department of housing and community development.ordinance was never submitted to the state department of housing and community development for review or approval,thereby violating government code sections and.
the fourth cause of action alleged ordinance affected property rights and failed to advance a legitimate governmental interest.further,ordinance discouraged the construction of new or replacement housing thereby exacerbating the shortage of affordable housing in the city.because ordinance failed to advance any governmental interest,it was violative of the federal and state constitutional due process clauses according to plaintiff.the fifth cause of action realleged the factual allegations in the preceding causes of action.according to the complaint,without the issuance of a writ of mandate,plaintiff members aforementioned constitutional and statutory rights would be violated.plaintiff thus sought a writ of mandate enjoining defendants from enforcing ordinance.
the prayer for relief sought a declaration that ordinance violated the takings clauses of the federal and state constitutions the state and federal constitutional due process clauses and government code sections through,and.also,the prayer for relief sought a determination pursuant to government code section,subdivision b and code of civil procedure sections through that the affordable housing requirements in ordinance were invalid.moreover,the prayer for relief sought the issuance of a peremptory writ of mandate and an attorney fees award.
iii.defendants demurrer and judicial notice request 
on april,defendants demurred to the complaint.as to the first cause of action,defendants asserted that no regulatory takings cause of action was stated because the substantially advance test does not apply to such a claim heightened scrutiny under the nexus and rough proportionality tests can not apply to a facial challenge to a regulatory enactment of general application such as ordinance and there was no allegation plaintiff members had exhausted their administrative remedies or it would be futile to do so.as to the second cause of action,defendants argued no claim could be stated for a violation of the fee mitigation act,et as no fee was imposed even if the obligation to build affordable housing was a fee,no validation action can be pursued pursuant to government code section and any challenge to a fee was barred by the failure to comply with government code section.defendants argued that demurrer should be sustained to the third cause of action for declaratory relief because government code section,subdivision b requires any action to review housing element conformity to be brought in a code of civil procedure section mandate petition no analysis was required by the department of housing and community development because ordinance was not part of an adoption or update of the city housing element the state department of housing and community development did not have the authority to approve a municipal ordinance and plaintiff cause of action is moot because the city had met its regional housing needs assessment fair share target set forth in the housing element.
as to the fourth cause of action,defendants argued that no facial due process violation was pled because the substantially advance test is inapplicable to ordinance and there were insufficient facts pled showing it was egregiously arbitrary and irrational.further,defendants asserted,t here is a reasonable relationship between the obligation to construct affordable housing units as imposed by ordinance no.and the need for such housing caused by the subject development.moreover,defendants argued plaintiff members had failed to exhaust their administrative remedies or that it would be futile to do so.finally,as to the fifth cause of action,defendants argued the mandate claim was premised on the unlawful takings,fee mitigation act,and due process causes of action which had no merit they had no ministerial duty to perform any act and they had not failed to exercise discretion under a proper interpretation of the law.
defendants filed a lengthy judicial notice request concurrently with their demurrer.defendants sought judicial notice of separate documents.those documents indicate the following.pursuant to a initiative,santa monica city charter section required that at least per cent per year of all newly constructed housing be permanently affordable by low and moderate income residents 
according to a december,report to the mayor and the council,charter section resulted from the adoption of proposition r in the november,election.in march,the council adopted ordinance which required that in most instances a developer of multifamily housing build affordable units on site.on july,the council replaced ordinance with ordinance,the affordable housing production program,which was codified in municipal code chapter.
the december,report to the mayor and the council indicated that in fiscal year and,only percent of multifamily units constructed in that year complied with charter section.that low percentage of affordable housing units did not comply with charter section.further,in fiscal years and,it was anticipated that only percent of newly constructed total units would be affordable to low and moderate income households.as noted,charter section required that least per cent per year of all newly constructed housing be permanently affordable to low and moderate families.municipal code section required the council to take action to insure compliance with the minimum construction requirements in charter section.
on april,the council adopted ordinance.ordinance was adopted in response to state legislation which gradually increased the the density bonus to percent and expanded its availability to senior mobile home parks,community apartment developments,and stock cooperatives mandated reductions of set aside requirements for construction of affordable units permitted a developer to request a waiver of development standards if necessary to make a project feasible mandated that a municipality grant concessions to a developer unless certain findings were made and required that cities adopt ordinances implementing the new changes in statewide law.in accord with state law,ordinance modified the city existing density bonus regulations and low and moderate housing construction requirements and otherwise complied with recent statewide housing enactments.other documents were attached which identified actions by other counties and cities to modify their housing policies.finally,the judicially noticeable materials indicated that housing and community development department certified that the city housing element was in full compliance with california housing element law.
defendants also sought judicial notice of the relevant provisions of the municipal code.municipal code chapter set forth the requirements for the city affordable housing production program.in order to secure a development permit,a project developer has the following options provide on site affordable housing units in accord with municipal code section provide affordable housing units pursuant to section pay an affordable housing fee in accordance with municipal code section or acquire land for affordable housing pursuant to municipal code section.
municipal code chapter contains a waiver or adjustment provision.municipal code section permits an applicant for permission to build a project to request an adjustment or waiver if the requirements of chapter effectuated an unconstitutional taking or would otherwise have an unconstitutional application to the property.in order to secure an adjustment or waiver,a request must be filed with the director of resource management at the same time as the applicant files the project application.the applicant has the burden of presenting substantial evidence to support the request and must set forth in detail the factual and legal basis of the claim.according to municipal code section,in ruling on an adjustment or waiver application,the resource management director or the city council on appeal assumes the applicant is subject to the affordable housing requirement in chapter the applicant would benefit from the inclusionary incentives in chapter and elsewhere in the municipal code and the applicant is obligated to provide the most economical affordable housing units in terms of construction,design,location,and tenure.
finally,defendants lodged the administrative record pertinent to the adoption of ordinance.on may,the city council considered issue relating to affordable housing.in a report bearing the same date,city staff related the city was committed to producing affordable law rather than construct affordable units,most developers elect to pay the affordable housing fee and there is thus a relationship between the amount of fees collected which are then used to produce affordable low or moderate income housing stock.the report further stated if the affordable housing fee were increased,there would be additional funds available to leverage greater low and moderate income housing construction one way to increase low and moderate income housing construction would be to defer,reduce,or waive the collection of other construction permit fees or assessments and other options designed to increase low and moderate income housing construction included streamlining the development permitting process or even amending proposition finally,the may,report contained an analysis of the various legal options available to the city.the report contained attachments detailing technical questions raised when evaluating affordable housing issues.the report recommended the council discuss various affordable housing strategies consistent with decisions of the united states and california supreme courts and courts of appeal.
a july,report prepared for a council meeting on that date stated that city staff had previously been directed on november,to evaluate affordable housing production in order to meet the goals imposed by proposition r.the report recommended increasing developer fees and permitting an applicant to secure a waiver of or reduction of requirements imposed by the city affordable housing program.attached to the july,report was a july,report detailing the nexus between new market rate developments in the city and the need for affordable housing.
on october,ordinance was presented to the city council for first reading consideration.the proposed ordinance amended municipal code sections,and in chapter by modifying the calculation,adjustment,and payment timing of the affordable housing fee adjusting the affordable housing definitions and establishing a waiver and adjustment process.ordinance was adopted on november.
iv.plaintiff opposition 
plaintiff argued that ordinance constituted a taking subject to the nexus and rough proportionality tests discussed in lingle chevron,supra,at page.dolan city of tigard,supra,at pages.and nollan california coastal commission,supra,at pages.additionally,plaintiff challenged the imposition of the burden of persuasion on the developer in municipal code section the provision permitting an applicant to secure a waiver or adjustment of the minimum low and medium cost housing construction requirements.plaintiff argued that it should be given the opportunity at a trial to demonstrate defendants could not justify the alleged uncompensated takings resulting from the adoption of ordinance.
as to the third cause of action for alleging a violation of government code section and,plaintiff contended that it had set forth the requirements for a traditional mandamus claim.plaintiff argued that ordinance was in essence a de facto amendment to the city housing element which must be submitted to the state department of housing and community development.since these allegations were alleged in the third cause of action,plaintiff argued that demurrer should be overruled.finally,plaintiff contended mandate claims were stated by reason of the allegations concerning the alleged uncompensated takings and the state housing element law.
defendants reply 
as to the takings arguments,defendants contended there is no heightened scrutiny of generally applicable economic legislation ordinance is generally applicable economic legislation and the waiver provision in municipal code section prevents plaintiff from making a facial challenge to ordinance.
vi.discussion 
plaintiff argues that ordinance is a facially invalid exaction subject to the heightened scrutiny nexus and rough proportionality test.according to plaintiff,sufficient facts were alleged to require a trial on the nexus and proportionality issues.defendants argue that because plaintiff challenge is a facial attack and not raised on the context of an adjudication of an individual development request,judicial review of ordinance utilizing the nexus and rough proportionality test is not in order.further,defendant argues that plaintiff assertion ordinance was a de facto amendment to the city housing element requiring review by the department of community housing and development is without merit.
plaintiff facial constitutional claims are without merit 
the nature of a facial challenge 
our supreme court has defined a facial challenge is a statute thusly in discussing the standard for evaluating a facial constitutional challenge to a statute,we stated in tobe city of santa ana cal th,d,a facial challenge to the constitutional validity of a statute or ordinance considers only the text of the measure itself,not its application to the particular circumstances of an individual.citation.to support a determination of facial unconstitutionality,voiding the statute as a whole,petitioners can not prevail by suggesting that in some future hypothetical situation constitutional problems may possibly arise as to the particular application of the statute rather,petitioners must demonstrate that the act provisions inevitably pose a present total and fatal conflict with applicable constitutional prohibitions.citations.id.at,d,original italics and ellipsis.california teachers state of california cal th,d.in the context of a facial takings claim,a party attacking a statute must demonstrate that its mere enactment constitutes a taking and deprives the owner all viable use of the property at issue.preservation council,tahoe regional planning agency,d suitum tahoe regional planning agency,fn,d.the united states supreme court has defined a facial takings claim as an uphill battle and difficult to demonstrate.hodel virginia surface mining reclamation,d.
takings jurisprudence 
there are two types of compensable and regulatory.brown legal foundation of,d palazzolo rhode island,d.when an owner property is taken,in whole or in part,by government for a public purpose,there is a categorical duty of compensation.brown legal foundation of,supra,at.preservation council,tahoe regional planning agency,supra,at.further,there are two types of compensable regulatory takings.the first type of compensable regulatory taking occurs when a property owner is deprived of all economically beneficial or productive use of the property.lucas south carolina coastal council,d santa monica beach superior court cal th,d.generally speaking,the second type of compensable regulatory taking occurs when a complex set of factors are considered including the character of the government action in terms whether it is a physical invasion or an accommodation of the benefits and burdens of economic life to promote the common good in large part,the regulation economic effect on the landowner and the extent to which the regulation interferes with distinct expectations.lingle chevron,supra,at.palazzolo rhode island,supra,at.san remo hotel city and county of san francisco,supra,cal th at,d.in the context of this second form of regulatory taking,the appraisal of these complicated factors is to prevent,in the framework of this case,plaintiff members from unfairly bearing public burdens which the body politic as a whole should be compelled to accept.armstrong united states,d san remo hotel city and county of san francisco,supra,cal th at,d.
aside from these general takings principles,there is a special rule initially developed in nollan california coastal commission,supra,at pages.which is applicable to land use by governments that landowners dedicate portions of their property as a condition of securing development permits.the united states supreme court identified a two part test to be applied in exaction cases.first,there must exist an essential nexus between the legitimate state interest the government asserts will be furthered by the condition of a development permit and the exaction itself.dolan city of tigard,supra,at.nollan california coastal commission,supra,at.second,there must exist a rough proportionality between a development restriction imposed on a landowner and the extent of the impact the state imposed development condition is supposed to mitigate.this part of the test in an exaction case was articulated in dolan city of tigard,supra,at page.thusly we think a term such as rough proportionality best encapsulates what we hold to be the requirement of the fifth amendment.no precise mathematical calculation is required,but the city must make some sort of individualized determination that the required dedication is related both in nature and extent to the impact of the proposed development.see lingle chevron,supra,at.san remo hotel city and county of san francisco,supra,cal th at,d.
the two pronged test does not apply to plaintiff facial challenge to ordinance 
plaintiff argues that it is entitled to assert a facial challenge to ordinance utilizing the test.both the united states and california supreme courts have explained the two part test developed for use in land exaction takings litigation applies only in the case of individual adjudicative permit approval decisions not to generally applicable legislative general zoning decisions.monterey del monte dunes at monterey,supra,at.santa monica beach,superior court,supra,cal th at,d,see lingle chevron,supra,at.in san remo hotel city and county of san francisco,supra,cal th at page,d,our supreme court explained the sine qua non for application of scrutiny is thus the discretionary deployment of the police power in the imposition of conditions in individual c
