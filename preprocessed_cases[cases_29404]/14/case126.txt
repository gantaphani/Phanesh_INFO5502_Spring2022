the main question presented in these appeals is whether new hanover county,north carolina,acted ultra vires in collecting fees on behalf of the new hanover county water and sewer district from a subdivision developer,tommy davis construction,for water and sewer services that the water and sewer district did not provide and had no concrete plans or immediate ability to provide.davis construction had arranged to have a privately owned utility,aqua north carolina,provide water and sewer services to the subdivision.
the district court ruled that the county acted ultra vires in collecting the fees on behalf of the water and sewer district and ordered both the county and the successor to the water and sewer district,the cape fear public utility authority,to refund the fees in the amount of,together with prejudgment interest.the court also awarded davis construction attorneys fees and costs.for the reasons that follow,we affirm.
in the course of developing becker woods,a residential subdivision with lots,located on cape fear in the southern part of new hanover county,davis construction arranged to have aqua nc provide water and sewer services to each lot in the subdivision.aqua nc was and remains the only utility offering those services in that part of the county,and it therefore provided water and sewer services to the existing subdivisions surrounding becker woods.
in february,davis construction applied for building permits from the county for a few of the lots in the subdivision.a county employee advised davis construction that it was required to pay impact fees to the water and sewer district before the county would issue the building permits.the county board of commissioners had created the water and sewer district as a public utility in to provide water and sewer services to the unincorporated areas of the county.the water and sewer district,however,did not offer service throughout its entire jurisdiction.portions of the county,including the area where becker woods was located,were instead served by private water and sewer utilities,such as aqua nc.even though the water and sewer district did not offer service to every area within its jurisdiction,it nonetheless assessed,and the county collected,impact fees for all new development in every area,including the becker woods subdivision,relying on an ordinance that required a ll new development obtaining a certificate of occupancy to pay a facility fee based on average daily flow as a o sewer charge.new hanover county,code b.according to the county,the impact fees were used to develop the county wastewater infrastructure with the goal of providing expanded service coverage in the unincorporated areas of new hanover county.
davis construction objected to the fees because the water and sewer district was not going to be providing water and sewer services to its subdivision and it had already paid impact fees to aqua nc.after objecting repeatedly,davis construction paid the fees under protest so that it could proceed with the subdivision development.between march and july,it paid in impact fees to build houses on lots.
in,the county and the city of wilmington began the process of consolidating their separate water and sewer systems with the creation of the cape fear public utility authority.the authority was incorporated in,and on july,it assumed all the rights and liabilities of the water and sewer district and began operating the region public water and sewer infrastructure.during this same period,the authority and the county also changed the prior policy and began assessing and collecting impact fees only when a customer applied to the authority for service.accordingly,when davis construction thereafter applied for a building permit for another lot in becker woods,the county did not collect an impact fee because aqua nc,not the authority,was going to provide the water and sewer services.davis construction subsequently requested that the authority refund the impact fees that it had previously paid,but,on june,the authority denied that request.
davis construction commenced this action against the authority in the superior court of new hanover county on december,seeking a refund of the impact fees it had paid to the water and sewer district in and,along with interest and attorneys fees.by an amended complaint,it added the county as a defendant,and the county removed the action to federal court.the amended complaint alleged that the defendants actions in collecting impact fees were ultra vires and violated davis construction right to due process under the and north carolina constitutions.
on the parties for summary judgment,the district court ruled in favor of davis construction on july,concluding that the defendants collection of impact fees from davis construction for the becker woods development was an ultra vires act beyond their statutory authority.the court also rejected the defendants defenses that davis construction claims were barred by the statute of limitations and the doctrine of laches.the court ordered the defendants to refund to davis construction,together with prejudgment interest of from july,the date of davis construction last impact fee payment.the court entered judgment on july,and subsequently awarded davis construction attorneys fees of and costs of.
these appeals from the judgment and from the award of attorneys fees followed.
as an initial matter,we address the defendants contention that the district court erred in refusing to dismiss davis construction claims as untimely.they contend that the district court incorrectly concluded that the catchall year statute of limitations provided by.applies to davis construction ultra vires claim.they argue that the claim is instead barred by the statute of limitations set out in n.for claims based upon a liability created by statute.alternatively,they argue that the ultra vires claim is barred by either the limitations period that applies to an action against a local unit of government upon a contract,obligation or liability arising out of a contract,express or implied,or the limitations period for an action for any other injury to the person or rights of another,not arising on contract and not hereafter enumerated,id.as to davis construction federal and state due process claims,they contend that those claims are barred by the statute of limitations provided by.and finally,they contend that,even if davis construction claims are found to have been filed within the applicable limitations period,the claims are nonetheless barred by the equitable doctrine of laches.
to begin,we agree that davis construction federal due process claim is barred by the statute of limitations provided by.although davis construction complaint does not expressly invoke in alleging the federal due process claim,that statute provides the basis for the cause of action when a plaintiff sues a state actor for the deprivation of rights secured by the constitution,and municipalities and other local government entities are included among those persons to whom applies.collins city of harker heights,citing monell new york city dep t of social,see also hughes bedsole,cir noting that,because the fourteenth amendment does not create a cause of action,a plaintiff claim under the fourteenth amendment merges into her claim because merely creates a statutory basis to receive a remedy for the deprivation of a constitutional right.the statute of limitations for all claims is borrowed from the applicable state statute of limitations for actions,even when a plaintiff particular claim does not involve personal injury.wilson garcia,see also wallace kato.and we have applied wilson to conclude that claims arising in north carolina are limited by the period for personal injury actions set forth in.advertising city of raleigh,cir.
