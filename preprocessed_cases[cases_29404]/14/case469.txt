storer and sons storer petitions for review of the citation it received from the occupational safety and health administration osha,alleging that it had violated the occupational safety and health act of osh act or act by failing to protect its employees from two fall hazards as they performed masonry work.storer contested the citation,which required the secretary of the united states department of labor secretary,from whom osha receives its rulemaking and enforcement authority,to prove the violation at a hearing before an administrative law judge alj of the occupational safety and health review commission commission the citation was affirmed by the alj and ultimately by the commission,which denied review of the alj decision.storer claims the secretary erroneously interpreted the applicable osha regulations.we agree in part accordingly,we vacate the commission order and remand to that body for further proceedings consistent with this opinion.
the osh act is designed to assure so far as possible safe and healthful working conditions for every working man and woman in the nation,and generally obligates an employer to furnish a workplace free from recognized hazards that are likely to cause death or serious physical harm.a.in furtherance of the act overriding objective,the secretary is authorized to promulgate and enforce workplace safety regulations,see id.b,which authority she has largely delegated to osha.mcnulty sec y of labor,citing.see also am.wrecking sec y of labor.osha compliance officers inspect workplaces regularly and,if warranted,issue citations for violations of osha regulations.mcnulty,at.
at issue are osha regulations designed to provide fall protection for construction workers,see,specifically,the protective measures required when an employee performs overhand bricklaying while on a scaffold.id.g vi.paragraph g of section provides that e ach employee on a scaffold more than feet m above a lower level shall be protected from falling to that lower level.id.g.section g vi requires that an employee doing overhand bricklaying from a supported scaffold shall be protected from falling from all open sides and ends of the scaffold except at the side next to the wall being laid by the use of a personal fall arrest system or guardrail system.id.g vi.the meaning of the exception is the central issue in this case,as becomes clearer below.
storer is a masonry contractor operating in ohio and michigan.it has been doing business for over years and currently has approximately to employees on its payroll.in may storer was hired by bostleman corporation the general contractor to perform the masonry work for the construction of a farmer jack grocery store,located at the corner of cherry and bancroft streets in toledo,ohio.four masons and three mason tenders carried out the work,which involved erecting the building,walls and ultimately putting a brick veneer on the building when completed,the building measured feet wide and feet long and its walls were comprised of approximately concrete blocks.
while farmer jack was under construction,two osha compliance officers,todd jensen and walter visage,paid an unannounced visit to the site.on june,jensen and visage drove past the farmer jack observed what they thought were potential fall returning to their office from an inspection at another location.their observations prompted them to investigate further accordingly,they parked their car on a side street at a distance of yards from the site and used a handheld video recorder to document what they saw.
they observed at least five storer employees on a scaffold laying the concrete blocks of the building wall.the employees were not tied off,that is,they were not using a personal fall arrest system and the scaffold lacked guardrails.the scaffold,which was located at the top of a mezzanine level approximately feet above ground and which was inside the building footprint consisted of two frames each approximately six feet tall.the employees stood on the bottom frame while they worked,which put them approximately six feet above the mezzanine level.the placement of the scaffold required the masons to lay the concrete blocks by the overhand bricklaying method that is,after setting each concrete block in mortar,the masons had to lean over the wall in order to strike the joints,work the mortar into the interstices between the blocks using a concave tool on the wall face because the scaffold faced the inside of the wall under construction.
from their vantage point,jensen and visage identified two potential fall hazards that the employees working on the scaffold were exposed to.the first was a window opening in the wall under construction.they recorded storer employees laying concrete blocks near the window opening the video shows one employee standing in front of the opening and another walking by it.the second hazard was the materials staging area,the area used to store both the concrete blocks to be installed and a large vat of on the scaffold at the western end of the wall and running perpendicular to it.one employee stood at the edge of the scaffold next to the mortar vat while another lifted concrete blocks onto the staging area from below.both window opening and the materials staging unguarded,that is,there was no fall protection.the osha officials then decided to inspect the farmer jack site they spoke with members of both bostleman and storer management as well as a consultant to bostleman and they measured the distance to the ground from the two open areas.according to their measurements,the window opening in the wall exposed the storer employees to a fall of feet and those employees in the materials staging area risked a fall of feet.
on august,osha cited storer,alleging that storer had violated g by failing to provide fall protection for its employees on the scaffold.the citation proposed a penalty for storer repeat violation.storer contested the citation,which triggered the hearing before the alj.see c.
on march,the alj held a hearing in toledo,after which he affirmed the citation.see sec y of labor storer sons,cas.bna,wl,at,alj.before the alj,storer contended that it was exempt from having to protect its employees from the two fall hazards identified by jensen and unguarded window opening and materials staging the employees were performing overhand bricklaying.id.at.in his decision,the alj agreed that storer employees were performing overhand bricklaying but concluded that the overhand bricklaying exception offered storer no defense because the employees were not laying blocks at the window opening or in the materials staging area id.at.storer additionally maintained that it had complied with the fall protection standard by establishing a controlled access zone caz on the mezzanine level.id.at.the alj disagreed,explaining that,under the governing regulations,the use of a caz as an alternative means of fall protection is not applicable in this case.id.at.the alj therefore affirmed the citation and assessed a penalty.id.at.
storer petitioned the commission for discretionary review of the alj decision,see,but the commission declined and instead,on september,adopted the alj decision.see j.storer petition for review of the commission order is now before us pursuant to a.
the resolution of this case is governed by the ordinary standard of review of an administrative agency action with one exception.see mcnulty,at montgomery kone,sec y of labor.we review the actions of two separate entities charged with different regulatory functions under the osh act the secretary promulgates and enforces regulations while the commission exercises the and adjudicatory authority.montgomery kone,at.we will not disturb the commission factual findings if they are supported by substantial evidence on the record considered as a whole,a mcnulty,at we also leave its legal conclusions intact unless they are arbitrary,capricious,or otherwise not in accordance with law.a mcnulty,at.an agency interpretation of its own regulations is entitled to substantial deference and even receives controlling weight unless it is plainly erroneous or inconsistent with the regulation.here,only the secretary interpretations receive this level of deference because she alone has authority to make enforcement decisions and to render definitive interpretations of osha regulations.mcnulty,at citing martin occupational safety health review comm n,d.the commission has no more authority to depart from the secretary interpretations of osha regulations than do we,loewendick sons,reich,and its interpretation of the osha regulations is treated like that of the nonpolicymaking district court.martin,at.at molineaux united states.storer does not contest the findings of fact the interpretations at issue were advanced by the secretary before the commission and in her brief to us see secretary brief at respondent br.at.
keeping these principles in mind,we turn to storer two claims.storer first alleges that the commission affirmance of the osha citation for violating the fall protection standard at the window opening can not stand because it erroneously interprets the exception contained in section g vi.second,storer challenges the commission affirmance of the osha citation for the violation of the fall protection standard at the materials staging area,asserting that the commission erroneously concluded that storer did not meet the fall protection requirement by establishing a caz on the mezzanine level.
the commission agreed with the secretary that storer did not fit section g vi exception from fall protection for overhand bricklayers working on a scaffold next to the wall being built because its employees were not engaged in overhand laying of concrete blocks at the window opening.storer sons,wl,at.storer charges that,in so concluding,the commission effectively eliminate d the exception.petitioner br.at.in storer view,the exception means just what it says no fall protection is required at the side next to the wall being laid,including at any opening in the wall.id.the secretary views the matter differently.
in her brief,the secretary supplies a more thoroughgoing explication of the exception than the one she put forth before the commission.respondent br.at.the secretary now explains that the exception reflects a practical accommodation and is thus limited to the situation in which the presence of a guardrail between the mason and the wall being laid would interfere with or prevent the process of setting and mortaring the masonry.id.at internal quotation omitted.accordingly,the secretary tells us,if there is an opening where wall is not being laid,then no deviation from the mandate that each employee performing overhand bricklaying shall be protected from falling is justified.id.at internal quotation omitted.the secretary further asserts that storer finds an unlimited exemption in a mere parenthetical,which swallow s the general requirement for fall protection and is without practical or policy justification,does not promote worker safety,and must be rejected.id.at.
we believe the secretary interpretation does not sensibly conform to the purpose and wording of the regulation.see martin,at.at quoting.pub.serv,at.at.section g vi provides that an employee performing overhand bricklaying from a scaffold must be protected from way of a personal fall arrest system or a guardrail from all open sides and ends of the scaffold except at the side next to the wall being laid.g vi emphasis added.under the plain language of the regulation,then,an employer need not provide fall protection for an overhand bricklayer at the side of the scaffold next to the wall being laid.id.when osha promulgated the regulation in,it explained that p aragraph g vi of the final rule provides that fall protection,a personal fall arrest system or guardrail be provided on all open sides and ends of scaffolds from which employees are performing overhand bricklaying operations related work,except those sides and ends next to the wall being laid.safety standards for scaffolds used in the construction industry,final rule,available at wl.
the secretary,however,interprets the exception to mean that fall protection is required at the side next to the wall being laid except where it would interfere with or prevent the performance of the masonry work see secretary brief at respondent br.at.by reading paragraph g vi to require fall protection at the side next to the wall being laid except where it would impede masonry work being performed there,the secretary inverts the plain language of the exception,which unmistakably says that is the one place that fall protection is not required.because the secretary interpretation is incompatible with the exception plain language,we can not accept it.see thomas jefferson shalala,d loewendick sons,at.
the secretary maintains that her interpretation is supported by the preamble to the regulation,which states in part,t he requirements for fall protection will apply at openings such as openings in the walls of the structure surrounding the platform.at.read in its entirety,however,the preamble provides that p aragraph g does not apply where there are no open sides or ends on the scaffold,but will apply at openings such as hoistways,elevator shafts,stairwells,or similar openings in the scaffold platform,or openings in the walls of the structure surrounding the platform.id.emphasis added.thus the preamble refers to the fall protection requirement applicable to openings in a scaffold that is otherwise completely enclosed,not to the fall protection required for overhand bricklayers working at the side of a scaffold next to the wall being laid.id.moreover,in contrast to that part of the preamble applicable to a completely enclosed scaffold,the portion of the preamble dealing specifically with paragraph g vi is unqualified it provides simply that fall protection must be provided on all open sides and ends of scaffolds except those sides and ends next to the wall being laid.see id.emphasis added.
the secretary also contends that the unlimited exemption storer advocates would deny fall protection to all masons working on scaffolds and is without practical or policy justification.respondent br.at.regarding the secretary first contention,not only does the secretary distort storer seeks to do only what the words of the exception allow it to do,see g vi but storer can hardly be blamed if osha wording falls wide of its mark.diamond roofing occupational safety health review comm n,cir if a violation of a regulation subjects private parties to criminal or civil sanctions,a regulation can not be construed to mean what an agency intended but did not adequately express.the secretary may be dissatisfied with the regulation current formulation if so,osha can amend or eliminate it.but she can not do so by ascribing a meaning to words they simply do not have.as to the secretary second allegation,it is her own interpretation that disregards the policy justifications supporting the exception.as the secretary recognizes,see respondent br.at,two practical considerations undergird the exception from the fall protection standard for overhand bricklayers working at the side of the scaffold next to the wall being laid first,the use of a conventional fall protection system often is infeasible second,such a system may itself pose a fall hazard.osha has explained that 
w hile the use of guardrails,body belts,body harnesses,and safety nets is allowed during overhand bricklaying,the use of such systems often is not feasible.guardrails pose obvious interference problems and safety nets can not be attached to many or other brick walls as such walls are not capable of supporting the loads imposed by a net system.body systems often become entangled in close quarters and in those cases where suitable anchorages can be found,lanyards and lifelines pose serious tripping hazards to the mason tenders who could themselves trip and go over the edge 
according to osha own observations,then,requiring fall protection along the side of the scaffold next to the wall being laid,except where the bricklayers are in fact working at any moment as the secretary interpretation purports to require,raises a serious feasibility issue and may even increase the fall hazard
