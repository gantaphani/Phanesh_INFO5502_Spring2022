paul zugehoer,the defendant below,appeals from superior court final judgments of conviction of three counts of home improvement fraud.zugehoer makes two claims on appeal.first,he argues that his convictions must be vacated because a he was not charged with committing any acts amounting to criminal conduct and b the superior court declined to instruct the jury on fraudulent conversion,an essential element for a conviction of home improvement fraud.second,zugehoer contends that he was improperly charged with three counts of home improvement fraud under a statute that permitted the state to establish harm through one of three methods therefore,the three counts should have been merged into a single count at sentencing.although we find no error requiring that zugehoer convictions be vacated,we do conclude that the three counts of home improvement fraud were legally merged into one.we therefore remand to the superior court for resentencing on a single count of home improvement fraud.
zugehoer owned and operated absolute equity,a contracting firm that specialized in the clean up and renovation of structures damaged by fire.on february,paul and christine berkeley lost their historic home,located in middletown,delaware,to a fire.zugehoer had contracted with a firm that alerted him that a fire had been reported at the berkeleys home.a day or so after the fire,zugehoer went to the berkeleys home and left his business card with someone at the house.receiving no response to the card,zugehoer returned to the property the next day,where he met with berkeley and discussed potential renovations to the property.
zugehoer and berkeley spent considerable time that day assessing the damage and the work required to restore the house and the property.the berkeleys had already obtained a renovation estimate from a baltimore based contractor.berkeley told zugehoer that that estimate was well above the amount his insurance company would cover.zugehoer assured berkeley that because he had lower overhead costs than an company,he could complete the renovations for the amount berkeley insurance carrier would pay.
on february,berkeley signed a work authorization for zugehoer to begin renovations,and the insurance company issued the first of a series of checks to rebuild the house.zugehoer called the berkeleys insurance company to notify the insurer that he was the renovation contractor,verify the amount of coverage,and confirm that he needed a cash advance.on february,berkeley wrote zugehoer a check for.zugehoer immediately began demolition work and with a company that specialized in repairing flood damage.several days after zugehoer began the project,he was issued a second check by the insurer in the amount of.
after renovations began,zugehoer entered into a formal contract with the berkeleys,which provided for an initial deposit of,followed by five monthly payments of,and a final payment of at completion.the project was to be completed within one year.on february,the berkeleys wrote zugehoer a second check for,and on the following day they gave zugehoer a check for.those two checks,together with the february check,comprised the initial deposit.by the end of february,most of the demolition had been completed,emergency services had been provided,temporary electricity had been set up,and some initial plumbing and heating had been installed.at that point,the berkeleys were pleased with the work being done on the project.absolute equity also furnished electricity and plumbing for a trailer and a barn on the berkeleys property for the couple to live service not covered by the construction contract.
in march,zugehoer fell behind schedule because of inclement weather,although he did complete additional demolition and erect some of the framing.on march,the berkeleys paid zugehoer,from which they deducted to be deposited on kitchen appliances.
in april,zugehoer crew continued framing the house and,by the end of the month,had installed plywood on the roof.the berkeleys made another payment to zugehoer,although that payment was a few weeks late.by then the berkeleys had become concerned that the progress on the job was not commensurate with the money they had already paid to zugehoer.the berkeleys asked zugehoer for an accounting summary of the project.in early may,zugehoer gave the berkeleys a summary sheet showing absolute equity expenditures for materials and subcontractor fees.berkeley noticed inaccuracies,and asked zugehoer for an accounting summary of the fund and the project.zugehoer acknowledged that there were errors,and produced a second summary the next day.he did not,however,provide any receipts.the berkeleys remained suspicious and contacted the subcontractors directly.to their dismay,the berkeleys learned that most of the subcontractors had not been paid the amounts listed on zugehoer summary,and that zugehoer still owed the subcontractors money.
it turned out that,in fact,zugehoer had spent the money the berkeleys paid him for personal items.in february,zugehoer spent almost on personal expenditures,including a ring for his wife.in march,zugehoer purchased a harley davidson motorcycle.in april,zugehoer personal expenditures amounted to almost.in may,zugehoer spent almost on personal expenses.in all,from february through may,zugehoer spent nearly.by the end of may zugehoer personal and business bank accounts had either negative or minimal balances.
the berkeleys contacted the architect,joseph turnowchyck,who offered to meet with zugehoer and the subcontractors to discuss the status of the project.zugehoer attended the meeting,which took place on either may or,without knowing in advance that the subcontractors would be attending as well.zugehoer left the meeting saying,i out of here.you hear from my lawyer.
the berkeleys then sent letters to zugehoer and the subcontractors informing them that they were off the job.the berkeleys hired another contractor to complete the renovations,and within a year,the project was completed for about the balance of the original contract with zugehoer.several subcontractors who had not been paid placed mechanics liens on the berkeleys home,which required the berkeleys to pay additional amounts in settlement of those claims.
on october,zugehoer was arrested and indicted on four counts of home improvement fraud and two counts of writing a bad check over.on april,the state entered a nolle prosequi to one count of home improvement fraud and to both counts of writing a bad check.the case went to trial that same day,but ended in a mistrial.the following week,the case was retried and the jury convicted zugehoer of all three counts of home improvement fraud.on december,the superior court sentenced zugehoer to six years incarceration,suspended after one year for level iv work release.this appeal followed.
discussion 
zugehoer was properly charged and the jury was properly instructed on the essential elements of home improvement fraud.
zugehoer contends that the indictment failed to charge him with conduct constituting a crime,an error that the superior court compounded by refusing to instruct the jury that it must find fraudulent conversion to render zugehoer conduct unlawful.this court will review a refusal to give a particular instruction that is,an instruction is given but not with the exact form,content or language requested for an abuse of discretion.because zugehoer never raised below his claim that the indictment was defective for failure to charge criminal intent,that claim will only be reviewed on appeal for plain error 
b contains five subsections that prescribe different methods by which home improvement fraud can be perpetrated the prefatory language of section b incorporates the intent element for theft specified in.section,in turn,sets forth two separate avenues to establish the requisite intent.section a provides that a person is guilty of theft when the person takes,exercises control over or obtains property of another person intending to deprive that person of it or appropriate it.section b states that a person is guilty of theft if the person,in any capacity,legally receives,takes,exercises control over or obtains property
