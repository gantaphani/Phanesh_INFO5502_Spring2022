appellant tejon real estate,llc,the owner of a vacant lot in los angeles,contends the trial court erred in sustaining the demurrer of respondent city of los angeles city to appellant complaint and dismissing the underlying action.appellant had engaged in discussions with city representatives concerning the conditions under which it could obtain an extension of water service to its lot,and whether installation of a fire hydrant would be required prior to building a residence.having obtained informal opinions from city and fire department representatives concerning the cost of the water extension and the necessity of the hydrant,appellant initiated an action for declaratory relief,seeking interpretation of the department of water and power rules governing water and electric service dwp rules and the fire code.we conclude an action for declaratory relief is not appropriate to review an administrative decision moreover,the action was unripe,as appellant had failed to exhaust administrative remedies or obtain a final administrative determination.accordingly,we affirm.
factual and procedural background 
appellant original complaint alleged that it owned a vacant lot described as unimproved and zoned for a single family residence.the lot is located on an unpaved portion of harriman avenue,approximately feet from the closest water main and fire hydrant.appellant alleged that it desired to build a residence on the lot and had been informed by a fire department representative that a building permit would not be approved unless there was a fire hydrant within feet of the proposed structure.in addition,appellant allegedly received a written estimate from the dwp stating that the cost of extending the water main to the lot would be appellant alleged that the requirements outlined by the representatives were not authorized by law,and that it was dwp obligation to provide water service at its own expense,rather than make it impractical for an owner of a lot to build on the lawfully subdivided lot,because of the expense of obtaining water and fire protection appellant sought a court interpretation of dwp rules,in particular rule,governing e xtensions of the department water distribution system which are necessary to make water service of a permanent character available to applicants 
the city demurred contending that the case was not ripe,and that appellant had failed to exhaust the administrative process as it had not submitted plans,applied for a permit or obtained an official decision from the city.moreover,to the extent appellant contended it had received a final administrative decision,administrative mandamus rather than declaratory relief was the appropriate remedy.the demurrer was sustained with leave to amend,and appellant filed a first amended complaint fac.
in the fac,appellant alleged that its inquiries to city and fire department personnel represented a complete application for water service to the subject lot and that the letter it received in response to its inquiry represented the official action and final determination on its application by dwp.appellant conceded it had not applied for a building permit,but contended the cost of providing water service to the lot was not dependent on the use of the property.appellant further contended that applying for a building permit would be a waste of funds because the lot was in an area where homes do not sell for enough money to make it practical to start spending an unknown amount of money to seek permits as long as the cost of water remains at.
appellant quoted a dwp rule applicable to a water main extension on an unimproved street,not in a new subdivision,which was not at grade level.although it denied harriman avenue was not at grade level,appellant sought to rely on this provision,contending it prohibited charging the owner for the extension w here in the opinion of the chief engineer of water works,the estimated revenue from the service to be provided does not justify the additional cost necessary for local distribution facilities.quoting dwp rules,rule.in addition,appellant alleged that a fire hydrant and water supply was not required,because the applicable provisions of the fire code state that its requirements pertain unless otherwise determined by the chief.quoting fire code,see also supplemental fire protection equipment or systems shall consist of f ire hydrants which shall be installed in accordance with section,or as required by the chief.appellant alleged that before it could be charged for the service extension,there must first be a reasonable opinion by the dwp that,the estimated revenue from the service to be provided does not justify the additional cost necessary for local distribution facilities,that the fire chief had the authority to be flexible as to the location and flow rate of fire hydrants,and that the fire code does not require a hydrant within feet of a building,or gallons per second,with psi remaining,as the city staff is requiring,because the c hief has the authority to determine otherwise,which authority must be exercised reasonably.
in the prayer for relief,the fac requested a declaration determining whether a service connection could be used,instead of a main extension,and still provide adequate water for a permit for a single family residence on the subject lot and whether a standard,single outlet fire hydrant,located directly in front of plaintiff lot,fed by a inch service connection,would be a project which should be approved by the fire chief,if the proposed house had a garage with fire rated walls and ceiling,and if all roofs were covered with class a fire rated covering,with stucco covering all exterior walls,and with automatic fire sprinklers inside all portions of the house and garage,with a box to hold a yard hose,to bring water within feet of the house,or
