this case comes before us on certified questions from the united states court of appeals for the fifth circuit.pursuant to article v,section of the texas constitution and texas rule of appellate procedure,we answer the following questions 
does texas recognize claims,may a contractor assert a claim against an owner on a subcontractor behalf when there is no privity of contract between the subcontractor and the owner 
if the first question is answered in the negative,then the remaining question need not be reached.however,if the first question is answered in the affirmative,the following question must be reached 
what are the requirements,if any,that need to be satisfied for a contractor to assert a claim on behalf of its subcontractor when there is no privity of contract between the subcontractor and the owner,and who holds the appropriate burden of proof 
interstate contracting city of dallas,cir,certified questions accepted.march.
these are difficult issues of first impression for this court.privity of contract,as a necessary predicate to suit on a contract,has a long and settled history in this state.the parties here contest the extent to which the privity requirement may be maintained in a jurisdiction that recognizes claims.we believe that contractual privity and claims are compatible.we also conclude that,although the arguments against claims are certainly not without merit,they are not sufficiently compelling to dissuade us from joining the majority of state and federal jurisdictions that have considered the issue.
we hold that texas recognizes claims.consequently,if the contractor is liable to the subcontractor for damages sustained by the subcontractor,pursuant to a agreement the contractor can bring an action against the owner for the subcontractor damages.if the owner contests the contractor suit on grounds that the contractor is not liable to the subcontractor for the claimed damages,the owner bears the burden of proof.
on september,plaintiff city of dallas the city and defendant interstate contracting corporation icc entered into a fixed sum contract for the construction of levees around a city water treatment plant the excavation of two areas to create storm water detention lakes and miscellaneous work including trash removal,surveying,and linear depth checking.icc entered into two written subcontracts with mine services,msi for the levee construction and the excavation of the storm water detention lake.
the material excavated for the lakes was to be used,to the extent it met specifications,to construct levees.the levees were to consist of random fill,with a pi range of to in october,msi began by mobilizing,surveying,and dewatering the interior borrow lake ibl.the ibl was one of the borrow sites the city designated as a source of fill material.shortly after work began,msi discovered that the materials in the ibl differed from what it expected.the excavated material consisted primarily of low plasticity sand and other material.
due to the lack of suitable material,msi was forced to manufacture fill material by mixing sand with the limited quantities of clay.the contract was silent on the issue of manufacturing fill material.manufacturing material substantially decreased msi productivity and increased its costs.the parties discussed using fill from other sites that msi believed were not designated as borrow sites under the contract.but using these sources was more expensive than the manufacturing process,and therefore,msi persisted in manufacturing fill.
icc informed the city of msi increased work on march.on may,the city indicated it would deny any claim,contending that manufacturing fill was beyond the scope of the contract.icc subsequently sought msi direct costs from the city and the city of its protests.the city eventually informed icc that its may decision was its final determination.the city,through the claims process,also denied claims for costs regarding trash removal,linear depth checking,surveying,and extended performance.msi performed of all field work,and all of the claims presented,except the trash removal,were injuries to msi.
the original subcontract between msi and icc provided,in part 
in the event subcontractor has a claim for which the owner may be responsible,the contractor,in its sole discretion,may initiate with the owner,at the subcontractor expense and which shall include attorney fees,any dispute or claim procedures provided for in the contract documents for the use and benefit of subcontractor otherwise subcontractor shall have full responsibility for the preparation of its claims and shall bear all expenses thereof,including attorney fees.
contractor shall be liable to subcontractor only to the extent of the amount,if any,actually awarded as a result of the disputes sic process subcontractor shall be entitled only to the amount,if any,actually awarded as a result of the disputes process and such amount when received by contractor from the owner shall satisfy and discharge contractor from any and all liability to subcontractor for or on account of the acts or omissions of the owner or its architect or engineer.
hence,icc was given the sole discretion to bring a claim against the city on behalf of msi at msi expense.if such a suit was brought,msi agreed to release icc from further liability in exchange for whatever icc recovered from the city.
icc filed this suit on behalf of msi against the city for breach of contract,quantum meruit,breach of implied warranty,and fraudulent inducement.prior to the commencement of this action,on november,icc and msi entered into a detailed claims presentation and prosecution agreement the agreement concerning msi claims for significant project costs overruns due to the city failure to disclose anticipated difficulties.the agreement provides,in pertinent part 
ii.recitals 
msi represents that its claim is based on the conduct of the city and that it has no other claims against interstate except msi claim that is the subject of this agreement.
interstate and msi agree that it is in their mutual best interests for interstate and msi to pursue a claim against the city of dallas in the name of interstate the claim.the claim shall consist of msi claim in the estimated amount of plus a markup for profit and overhead for interstate and interstate own costs claim in the amount of for jobsite costs and jobsite general and administrative costs associated with extended performance caused by the city interference with performance of the contract interstate claim.the parties desire,therefore,to agree upon a procedure through which they will coordinate the preparation,presentation and prosecution of the claim against the city of dallas.
msi may pursue the claim against the city in interstate name.interstate shall cooperate fully with msi including,but not limited to,passing on the claim to the city and executing such documents that may be required to further the claim and msi shall cooperate fully with interstate.msi shall have the responsibility for the preparation of any claim,the presentation and prosecution of any such claim,and the conduct of any litigation.
msi shall diligently pursue the claim.the right to abandon,settle,compromise or dismiss the claim shall be shared by msi and interstate.interstate and msi shall each not settle the claim without the others prior written approval.
all costs,fees and other expenses including expert and attorney fees incurred by msi in connection with the preparation,prosecution and litigation of the claim shall be paid by msi.msi shall have no responsibility for any attorney fees or expenses that interstate may elect to incur.
from any amount paid in settlement of the claim,interstate and msi shall be paid first for their respective markup including profit and overhead.if the percentage of markup actually paid as part of any settlement or judgment is specified,the markup payable shall be calculated according to the june,letter of understanding agreement.if the markup is not specified then the settlement amount will be presumed to include a total markup of and each party shall receive of the markup or the remainder of the settlement funds shall be prorated and paid between interstate and msi in the same percentage that each party portion of the claim exclusive of markup is to the total claim exclusive of markup submitted to the city examples omitted 
the district court allowed icc to bring these claims on behalf of msi following an jury trial,the jury found that the city breached its contract with icc.the jury also found that the city breached an implied warranty to provide accurate and suitable plans and specifications in light of subsoil conditions at the project.
on appeal,the city argued to the fifth circuit that the district court erred in concluding that icc as general contractor could seek and obtain damages on behalf of its subcontractor msi because there is a lack of privity of contract between the city and msi.there was no privity of contract between msi and the city however,icc contended that even though there was no privity between msi and the city,the district court was correct in permitting icc,under texas law,to present msi claim on a basis.
does texas law recognize claims,may a contractor assert a claim on behalf of its subcontractor against the owner when there is no privity of contract between the subcontractor and the.the basic arrangement 
a claim is a claim by a party who has suffered damages in this case,a subcontractor against a responsible party with whom it has no contract here,the city and presented through an intervening party the contractor who has a contractual relationship with both.carl calvert,pass through claims and liquidation agreements,construction lawyer,at bruner and on construction law.instead of one lawsuit between a subcontractor and general contractor and another between the general contractor and the owner,claims permit a contractor to pursue its subcontractor claims directly against the owner.bruner and on construction law.
under the typical arrangement,the contractor remains liable to the subcontractor,but only to the extent the contractor receives payment from the owner.id.a liquidation or agreement determines the manner and procedure by which the contractor presents the subcontractor claim to an owner.calvert,supra,at.a liquidation agreement may be included in the subcontract or may take the form of a separate agreement,much like the agreement icc and msi executed in this case.see id.at see also bovis lend lease lmb,gct venture.in a liquidation agreement the contractor acknowledges its liability to the subcontractor,thereby providing the general contractor with a basis for legal action against the owner the general contractor liability is liquidated to the extent of its recovery against the owner and the general contractor agrees to pass its recovery to the subcontractor.bovis lend lease lmb,at.thus,under a liquidation agreement,the subcontractor releases all claims it may have against the contractor in exchange for the contractor promise to pursue those claims against the owner and remit any recovery to the subcontractor.see henry kates,note facilitating subcontractors claims against the government through the prime contractor as the real party in interest,geo.
claims in federal courts 
in breach of contract actions against the federal government,contractors have long been permitted to present subcontractors claims on a basis against the government,even though the rule would otherwise bar subcontractors from recovering directly against the government.interstate contracting,at see also severin united states,whaley,dissenting,cert.denied.mitsui puerto rico water res.in united states blair,the supreme court articulated the policy rationale for allowing claims,stating that 
i t does not follow that the contractor is barred from suing for this amount.the contractor was the only person legally bound to perform his contract with the government and he had the undoubted right to recover from the government the contract price for the tile,terrazzo,marble and soapstone work whether that work was performed personally or through another.this necessarily implies the right to recover extra costs and services wrongfully demanded of the contractor under the contract,regardless of whether such costs were incurred or such services were performed personally or through a subcontractor.the contractor contract with the government is thus sufficient to sustain an action for extra costs wrongfully demanded under that contract.
citation omitted.the federal procedure has become the standard method by which such claims are resolved.fiberglas united states,mitsui.at ardsley constr.port of.
claims evolved because,as in texas,federal law provides that subcontractors under government contracts do not have standing to sue the government without first establishing privity of contract.see yates sons constr.caldera,black lake pipe line union constr,overruled on other grounds by sterner marathon oil,george hall.under the federal doctrine,however,as long as the general contractor remains liable to the subcontractor for the subcontractor damages,the general contractor can bring an action against the government for the subcontractor damages.yates,at citing severin.at mitchell constr.danzig,morrison knudsen fireman fund ins,cir blount.constr.united states,simmons united states,donovan constr.united states,warren.roads united states.federal courts construe this continued liability to the subcontractor as giving the contractor standing to pass the subcontractor claims through to the government.see,yates,at.
in severin,however,the united states court of claims held that a contractor suing on behalf of its subcontractor could not recover from the government because the subcontract contained a clause that completely exculpated the contractor from liability.see severin.at.the court reasoned that the contractor was barred from pursuing a claim on its subcontractor behalf because the exculpatory clause extinguished any claim the contractor could have asserted for damages resulting from the government breach.id.at.this rule has since become known as the severin doctrine.
the exculpatory clause in severin provided the contractor or subcontractor shall not in any event be held responsible for any loss,damate sic,detention,or delay caused by the owner or any other subcontractor upon the building severin.at emphasis added.the court concluded that this language constituted a complete release of the contractor liability to the subcontractor.id.however,the court noted that i f plaintiffs had proved that they,in the performance of their contract with the government became liable to their subcontractor for the damages which the latter suffered,that liability,though not yet satisfied by payment,might well constitute actual damages to plaintiffs,and sustain their suit.id.
federal courts have modified the severin doctrine to mitigate the perceived unfairness in its strict application.see,donovan constr.at holding that severin and blair could be reconciled only by holding that a prime contractor could recover damages on the subcontractor behalf even if the subcontract was silent on the prime contractor,as long as the contractor liability was not expressly negated and that contractor liability could be conditioned on recovery from the owner see also yates,at simmons,at acknowledging severin but holding that it did not bar a contractor from presenting the subcontractor claims pursuant to a consolidation agreement,implicit in which was the parties recognition of the contractor continued liability to the subcontractor.in accordance with the jurisprudence that emerged after severin,most arrangements still provide for the subcontractor to release the contractor from liability.however,that release is generally made contingent on the contractor bringing the subcontractor claims to the owner and remitting to the subcontractor any amounts recovered.such was the case in donovan,the first case to hold that contingent liability was sufficient for the contractor to pass through its subcontractor claim.see donovan constr.at.
more recently,federal courts have expressly limited the severin doctrine.in mitchell construction danzig,the federal circuit court of appeals noted that application of the severin doctrine has been narrowly construed.at quoting united states johnson controls.another court acknowledged that c ourts have strictly limited the severin doctrine,out of reluctance to leave subcontractors with valid claims out in the cold.morrison knudsen,at.that court stated that as a result,opinions often interpret releases and contracts generously to let contractors pursue their subcontractors claims.id.thus,federal courts allow the contractor and subcontractor to liquidate the contractor liability to the amount actually recovered from the owner.
in addition to narrowly reading exculpatory provisions in contracts,the court of claims shifted the burden of proof on this issue from the contractor to the government.see blount.constr,at holding that to come under the severin doctrine the defendant must show,through some contractual term or a release,that the is not liable to the subcontractor emphasis added.federal courts have consistently adhered to this position since that time.see yates,at mitchell,at george hyman constr.united states,fed.cl,aff,table cross constr.united states,wl southern constr.united states,mitsui.at.
claims in state courts 
following the lead of the federal courts,many states have expressly or implicitly recognized claims.of the nineteen states that have addressed this concept in published opinions,eighteen treat claims favorably and only connecticut explicitly rejects them 
recognizing claims in texas 
we have never addressed whether claims are permissible under texas law.in texas,a subcontractor generally may not recover from an owner without first establishing privity of contract,but instead may recover from the contractor,who in turn can look to the owner.black lake pipe line,at,city of corpus christi heldenfels,christi,aff on other grounds.however,the supreme court,while acknowledging the bar in blair,observed it does not follow that the contractor is barred from suing for subcontracted work.at.similarly,several texas cases have permitted such claims without explicitly adopting the federal approach,and more recently,one court has expressly acknowledged claims as compatible with texas law.see alamo cmty.coll.dist.browning constr,antonio,pet.filed.
in zachry ceco steel products,writ ref,for example,the court noted that,because the two subcontractors had no contractual relationship with the government,neither could present their claims for losses directly to the government.instead,the contractors had the right and duty to assert the same claims for the subcontractors that they would have asserted for themselves had they elected to do the work done by the subcontractors and sustained their losses.zachry,at.
similarly,in triton oil gas moran drilling,worth,writ ref,the court of appeals held that a contractor was entitled to recover damages arising out of collateral contracts,even if the contractor had not paid for the services.see also taylor mark,writ ref allowing a contractor to recover costs of materials without first requiring that the contractor prove that it had actually paid for the materials.the court reasoned that if the general contract contemplates collateral contracts,recovery can be had for damages or losses resulting from collateral contracts affected by the breach of the suit contract.triton oil gas,at quoting mcguire osage oil.comm app,holding approved.the court also explained that the subcontractors on the collateral contracts are not necessary parties to the litigation because the contractor alone had the right to enforce its contract with the owner.id.at.
finally,in north harris county junior college district fleetwood construction,dist,writ ref,the court of appeals rejected an owner argument that a subcontractor could not recover damages from the owner on the sole ground that the subcontractor lacked privity with the owner.because the contractor presented the subcontractor claims to the owner,the court held that t he argument and authorities regarding privity of contract are inapposite.fleetwood,at.
these cases advance the same reasoning expressed by the supreme court in blair.a contractor should be allowed to recover costs from the owner regardless of whether the contractor performed the work itself or through a subcontractor.see blair,at.otherwise,the owner could receive a windfall because the subcontractor lacked privity with the owner and the contractor lacked standing to sue the owner for damages suffered by the subcontractor.stated appropriately by one court 
t he holdings allowing claims for subcontracted work are soundly based in reason and equity.they recognize that a direct claim by a subcontractor against an owner is barred by concepts of privity as well as contractual provisions such as here,and that if the contractor himself is barred from asserting those claims,the owner would be in the extraordinary position of being responsible to no one regardless of the nature or extent of its liabilities under its contract.no proper justification exists for such a result.rather,the principle adopted by the cases is that the owner should be responsible to the contractor for costs or damages resulting from the performance or breach of the contract,whether the contractor performed the work himself or sublet it to others.
buckley,at.
in this case,icc contends that it included the language in its subcontract and then entered into the liquidation agreement in accordance with industry practice shaped by the broad national acceptance of claims.amici contend that claims and liquidating agreements have become standard industry practices and that failure to formally recognize such claims would come as a surprise to parties involved in the industry.after examining the authority from texas and other jurisdictions,we join the majority view and recognize claims in texas.
assignment of claims 
the city argues that claims resemble certain assignments of claims resulting in litigation between nominal adversaries that is purposely skewed to obtain a judgment against a common foe.we held in state farm fire and casualty gandy,that such assignments are invalid for two reasons.first,rather than put matters to rest,assignments of this sort spur additional and often more caustic litigation.at.second,assignments of this nature distort litigation by causing parties to take positions that appear contrary to their natural interests.id.we identified similar concerns when rejecting mary carter agreements in elbaor smith,noting that assignments bearing these characteristics are disfavored in texas.
what was disconcerting about assignments in those contexts is less evident in the context of claims.the claim certainly does not increase litigation and even tends to reduce it by rendering unnecessary a suit between the subcontractor and the contractor for the damages caused by the owner.furthermore,in a situation,any settlement by the owner is a full and final settlement because the subcontractor promises to release the contractor from liability to the extent the contractor presents the subcontractor claim and renders any recovery to the subcontractor.claims also avoid the problem presented when one defendant settles while the other remains partially liable,necessitating an additional settlement or further litigation.these features of claims facilitate efficient litigation,unlike the assignments we invalidated in gandy.
we are cognizant that claims distort litigation to a degree.for the owner to be liable to the subcontractor,the contractor must also be liable to the subcontractor.in a suit by the subcontractor against the contractor,the contractor would ordinarily be inclined to deny liability.in a suit on a claim,because the contractor asserts that the owner is liable to the subcontractor,the contractor position must be that it,too,is liable to the subcontractor.by taking a position contrary to its apparent interest,the contractor credibility may be enhanced.in short,claims put the contractor on the side of the subcontractor and against the owner when otherwise that would often not be in the contractor best interest.this distortion of positions is similar to the concern we raised in gandy.
nevertheless,for several reasons,we think this concern does not warrant prohibiting claims.for one thing,the contracting industry has become comfortable with claims as an efficient means of dispute resolution.as we have noted,such claims have long been allowed against the federal government and are permitted in every state that has considered the issue but one.moreover,the allowance of claims does not make the contractor a mere pawn for the subcontractor.if the contractor disputes the merits of its subcontractor claims,it is entitled to refuse to enter into a arrangement with the subcontractor,or refuse to pursue the subcontractor claims against the owner.in the latter case,the subcontractor could assert its claims directly against the contractor as the release only applies to claims for which the owner may be responsible and that the contractor actually asserts against the owner.
claims are also unlike mary carter assignments in which the assignee is at least partly responsible for the damages sought.see int l proteins,concluding that it is contrary to public policy to permit a joint tortfeasor the right to purchase a cause of action from a plaintiff to whose injury the tortfeasor contributed.with claims,the claims asserted by the contractor are not contingent on the value of claims the subcontractor may have against the contractor.instead,the claims are presented directly to the party ultimately responsible.in this way,claims avoid the concerns inherent in mary carter agreements because they do not create a false impression of adversity between the contractor and subcontractor.see elbaor,at.
furthermore,while a plaintiff in a mary carter agreement risks no increased exposure due to the settlement with the defendant,a contractor exposes itself to counterclaims by the owner and to by potential third parties and to penalties assessed by the court.see civ.a allison arkansas.gas.although the contractor may elect to delegate to the subcontractor the cost of prosecuting the subcontractor claim,the entity named in the suit is the contractor.as such,the contractor submits to the jurisdiction of the court and risks exposure to an adverse judgment.this risk may not be sufficient in itself to justify recognition of claims or to eliminate the concern that owners will be subject to more litigation by contractors who appear to have little to lose by passing through claims.but alignment with a majority of jurisdictions recognizing claims,combined with the reduction of unnecessary litigation,outweighs that concern.accordingly,we decline to require instigation of separate litigation merely to provide the contractor standing if the contractor agrees to pursue the subcontractor claims on a basis.see howard contracting,d at.
privity and standing 
the city of dallas also argues that privity and standing concerns bar contractors from asserting claims on behalf of their subcontractors.the city contends that because only the person whose primary legal right has been breached may seek redress for an injury,see nobles marcus,icc lacks standing as it has suffered no loss from the city purported breach of the contract.furthermore,the city asserts that because there is no privity between an owner and a subcontractor under texas law,see george hall,at,a subcontractor only legal remedy is to seek redress from the contractor who then looks to the owner.see black lake pipe line,at,city of laporte taylor,dist,no writ.
icc counters that a contractor has standing to pursue the claims of its subcontractor because it remains liable to the subcontractor for the amounts recovered.see yates,at.prop.code see also gulf constr.self,christi,writ ref holding that unless there is an express contractual provision to the contrary,a contractor is ultimately responsible for payment of its subcontractors.furthermore,icc argues that the decisions in fleetwood,triton oil gas,and zachry support its contention that a contractor has standing to assert the claims of its subcontractor to an owner.see fleetwood,at triton oil gas,at zachry,at.icc also contends that the subcontractor is not suing the owner for breach of contract because it acknowledges that the subcontractor is not in privity with the owner.that bar,icc argues,is the primary rationale for claims in the first place.
we believe icc has the better argument.rather than allowing a party to sue another with whom it has no privity,claims recognize the continued liability of a contractor to its subcontractor.see self,at.this liability gives the contractor,who is in privity of contract with an owner,standing to assert the claims of its subcontractor.see yates,at.
in articulating this rule,we explicitly confine our rationale to construction contracts involving owners,contractors,and subcontractors.in this context,it is not potential liability but continuing liability that gives the contractor standing to sue the owner.therefore,our recognition of claims does not run afoul of our tradition of requiring privity of contract and standing for a party to maintain a suit.see brown todd,republic bank bankers life ins,writ ref.
finally,we note that our recognition of claims does not,as the city contends,affect the procedures for perfecting statutory mechanic and materialman liens in private contracts or for asserting claims on payment bonds in public contracts.neither statutory scheme provides a remedy for subcontractors damaged by an owner or a governmental entity breach of contract with the contractor.see.prop.code mechanic and materialman liens.gov t code payment bonds.in both instances,the contractor bears the burden of payment,and subcontractors may recover only an amount up to the subcontract price,thus precluding recovery of additional costs.claims,on the other hand,allow subcontractors to recover from an owner when the owner breach has caused damages that exceed the subcontract price and place the ultimate responsibility for an owner breach on the owner.accordingly,claims provide protections not afforded by the lien and payment bond statutes,and our recognition of claims does not disturb the existing statutory procedures and requirements.
in sum,three policy justifications shape our decision that texas recognizes claims.first,recognition of this practice,common in the construction industry,aligns texas with federal procedure and with the majority of states that have considered this issue.second,claims protect subcontractors against an owner breach without undue prejudice to the owner.finally,claims promote judicial economy by eliminating unnecessarily duplicative litigation and encouraging full settlement of claims.
because we answer the first question in the affirmative,we proceed to the second question certified by the fifth circuit.
what are the requirements,if any,that need to be satisfied for a contractor to assert a claim on behalf of its subcontractor when there is no privity of contract between the subcontractor and the owner,and who holds the appropriate burden of proof 
in accordance with federal practice and the practice in most states recognizing claims,we hold that texas requires that the contractor remain liable to the subcontractor for damages sustained by the subcontractor.if the owner disputes that this requirement has been met,it bears the burden of proving,as an affirmative defense,that the arrangement negates the contractor responsibility for the costs incurred by the subcontractor.
claims are premised on a contractor liability to its subcontractor therefore,the contractor must have some liability upon which to base the claim.the federal courts generally hold that the contractor remains liable unless there is an unconditional release or contractual provision immunizing the prime contractor completely from any liability to the subcontractor.see,mitchell,at holding that the severin doctrine can only bar a contractor suit against the government if the government first asserts at trial,and then proves,that the contractor is not liable to the subcontractor for the costs in suit.the contractor then becomes an affirmative defense upon which the owner bears the burden of proof.see blount,at.accordingly,to defeat the claim on its face,an owner must prove that the con
