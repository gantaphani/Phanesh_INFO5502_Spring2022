the district court granted summary judgment to commercial,holding that commercial did not jointly employ plaintiffs because and commercial entered into a traditionally recognized,legitimate relationship and did not intend to avoid compliance with the flsa or maryland law.but the legitimacy of a business relationship between putative joint employers and the putative joint employers good faith are not dispositive of whether entities constitute joint employers for purposes of the flsa.rather,joint employment exists when two or more persons or entities share,agree to allocate responsibility for,or otherwise codetermine formally or informally,directly or indirectly the essential terms and conditions of a worker employment and the two entities combined influence over the essential terms and conditions of the worker employment render the worker an employee as opposed to an independent contractor.
applying this test,we conclude,based on the undisputed facts,that commercial jointly employed plaintiffs for purposes of the flsa and the analogous maryland law.accordingly,we reverse.
directly employed plaintiffs as drywall installers.since,contracted to provide labor for two companies commercial and a contractor known as p nearly all of work came through its contracts with commercial.notably,contracted to provide labor for p p only when commercial had no work available for to complete which occurred twice,at most.thus,as employees,plaintiffs worked almost exclusively for commercial during the course of their employment.
generally was responsible for hiring and firing plaintiffs,though one plaintiff testified that a commercial foreman threatened him with termination due to work the commercial foreman viewed as substandard.and on another occasion,when had difficulty enrolling in an insurance program mandated for a particular jobsite,commercial required several plaintiffs to complete applications for employment with commercial and to work directly for commercial on the project.typically,paid plaintiffs however,on at least a few occasions,plaintiffs received paychecks issued by commercial.
commercial also played a role in determining plaintiffs daily and weekly schedules.at each jobsite,the general contractor and others,including commercial,decided upon the start and end times for work on the jobsite.in addition to regular hours on the site,commercial foremen told certain plaintiffs to work additional hours or to report to work on sundays.commercial also was involved in determining where plaintiffs worked each day.commercial superintendent regularly communicated commercial staffing needs to the ramirez brothers,who assigned employees in accordance with commercial requests.
while working on commercial jobsites,plaintiffs wore hardhats and vests bearing the commercial logo.and commercial foremen gave supervisors sweatshirts branded with commercial logo for those supervisors to wear while working on commercial projects.in addition to these outward markers,plaintiffs were instructed to tell anyone who asked that they worked for commercial.
upon reporting to the assigned jobsite each day,commercial required plaintiffs to sign in on timesheets provided by commercial and bearing commercial logo.commercial retained these timesheets,storing them in a temporary office typically located on each jobsite before sending them to commercial main office in maryland for retention.using these timesheets,commercial foremen recorded the time plaintiffs reported to work,as well as the time plaintiffs finished working each day.by contrast,did not keep or maintain written records of plaintiffs hours.
after signing in for work on nearly every morning,commercial required plaintiffs to attend meetings.at these meetings,commercial foremen gave instructions regarding the projects plaintiffs needed to complete and the methods they needed to follow in doing so.commercial also required plaintiffs to attend a weekly safety meeting.because plaintiffs are native spanish speakers and speak limited english,supervisors generally translated the commercial foremen instructions to plaintiffs.
commercial foremen continually supervised plaintiffs as they completed their assigned tasks.for example,when did not have a supervisor at a jobsite,commercial foremen told plaintiffs what to do and how to do it.and regardless of whether had a supervisor at a jobsite,commercial foremen check ed plaintiffs work throughout each day to m ak e sure that the work wa s quality.commercial foremen also verified that employees work was acceptable before commercial issued payment to.if plaintiffs work was not up to commercial standards or specifications and had a supervisor on site,commercial communicated the deficiencies to plaintiffs via onsite supervisors.plaintiffs were then expected to remedy the identified shortcomings.
commercial owned and provided nearly all the tools and materials plaintiffs used to complete their tasks,even though commercial contract with provided that was obligated to provide all materials and equipment.in particular,commercial supplied plaintiffs with nail guns,chop saws,lasers,safety goggles,ropes,gloves,earplugs,and gangboxes metal storage boxes for overnight tool storage.commercial also provided the materials plaintiffs needed to complete their work,including metal studs used for framing and the drywall installed on commercial projects.by contrast,did not own or provide plaintiffs with any equipment or materials,and plaintiffs provided only small,handheld tools.
on july,plaintiffs filed a collective action under the flsa,the maryland wage and hour law,and the maryland wage payment and collection law against defendants in the united states district court for the district of maryland the complaint alleged that defendants willfully failed to pay plaintiffs wages,including overtime wages,in violation of the flsa and maryland law.plaintiffs asserted that they were jointly employed by commercial and,rendering commercial and jointly and severally liable for any violations of the flsa or maryland statutes 
commercial moved for summary judgment,arguing that it did not jointly employ plaintiffs.to determine whether commercial and jointly employed plaintiffs,the district court created and applied a novel multifactor test focusing on the legitimacy of the contracting relationship between commercial and and whether the putative joint employers intended to evade federal and state wage and hour laws.in particular,the court test examined the following five factors 
was the relationship between ji and commercial one that traditionally has been recognized in the law 
was the amount paid by commercial to ji pursuant to the contract between them sufficient to permit the direct employer to meet its legal obligations under the flsa while earning a reasonable profit 
did the relationship between ji and commercial appear to be a cozy one,one that is virtually exclusive and shaped by things other than objective market forces 
is the alleged violation of the flsa one of which commercial,during the ordinary course of performance of its own duties,should have been aware 
are there other indicia that the relationship between ji and commercial was designed to abuse the employees of the direct employer 
applying this test,the district court concluded that commercial did not jointly employ plaintiffs.consequently,plaintiffs could not aggregate the hours they worked for and commercial in determining compliance with the flsa and maryland law and could not hold commercial jointly and severally liable for the alleged wage and hour violations.
with commercial dismissed from the suit,plaintiffs claims against and the ramirez brothers proceeded to trial.after a bench trial,the district court entered judgment in favor of plaintiffs against and the ramirez brothers,in the amount of.the district court later awarded plaintiffs in attorneys fees and costs.and the ramirez brothers satisfied the judgment in full 
plaintiffs now appeal the district court conclusion that commercial did not jointly employ plaintiffs.on appeal,plaintiffs assert that the district court novel joint employment test did not conform to the flsa definitions of employ,employee,and employer failed to adhere to the department of labor longstanding regulations regarding joint employment and improperly limited joint employment liability to situations in which a court finds evidence of subterfuge or indicia of abuse.appellants opening br.at.for the reasons given below,we agree with plaintiffs assertions.

the supreme court has long recognized that two or more entities may constitute joint employers for purposes of the flsa.for example,in rutherford food which predated the department of labor regulations setting forth the circumstances in which joint employment generally exists the court observed that the plaintiff meat boners could be employed both by the subcontractor that directly employed them and by a slaughterhouse operator who supervised and controlled their daily work.at,see also zheng liberty apparel,cir.rutherford was a joint employment case,as it is apparent from the supreme court opinion that the boners were,first and foremost,employed by the independent contractor who had entered into a contract with the slaughterhouse.likewise,in falk brennan,the court found that maintenance workers who provided services to apartment complexes were employed both by the owners of the complexes and by the company that contracted to provide management services for the complexes because that company maintained substantial control over the conditions of the workers employment.at.
following the department of labor regulation and the supreme court decisions recognizing the joint employment doctrine,congress repeatedly has reaffirmed that the flsa definitions of employ,employee,and employer dictate that two or more entities can constitute joint employers for purposes of the flsa.for example,in amending the flsa in,congress recognized the flsa joint employment rule,explaining that there are some situations in which an employee who works for two separate employers or in two separate jobs for the same employer has all of the hours worked credited to one employer for purposes of determining overtime liability,at,at.congress also endorsed the flsa joint employment doctrine in enacting the migrant and seasonal agricultural workers protection act,et the migrant workers act,which uses the same definition of employ as the flsa.cong.rec.daily ed,adopting t he exact same principles to define the term employ in migrant workers act joint employment situations as are used under flsa emphasis added.
notwithstanding the joint employment doctrine venerable and entrenched position,courts have had difficulty developing a coherent test distinguishing separate employment from joint employment.as explained below,courts attempts to distinguish separate employment from joint employment have spawned numerous multifactor balancing tests,none of which has achieved consensus support.
the genesis of the confusion over the joint employment doctrine application appears to be the ninth circuit decision in bonnette california health and welfare agency,cir.emphasizing that courts must consider the circumstances of the whole activity and that no set of factors was etched in stone,the bonnette court concluded that four,nonexclusive factors provide a useful framework for determining whether an entity constitutes a joint employer whether the alleged employer had the power to hire and fire the employees,supervised and controlled employee work schedules or conditions of employment,determined the rate and method of payment,and maintained employment records.at internal quotation marks omitted.

emphasizing that congress intended for the flsa to stretch the meaning of employee to cover some parties who might not qualify as such under a strict application of traditional agency law principles,darden,at,several circuits have liberalized the bonnette test,see,zheng,at in re enterprise wage hour emp t practices,cir.as the second circuit explained,the test can not be reconciled with the suffer or permit language in the flsa,which necessarily reaches beyond traditional agency law.zheng,at.accordingly,although satisfaction of the bonnette factors can be sufficient to establish employer status a positive finding on those four factors is not necessary to establish an employment relationship.id.emphasis omitted.
rather than developing an entirely new joint employment test,courts have elected to supplement the four bonnette factors with additional factors intended to take into account the flsa more expansive definition of employee.for example,zheng identified six additional factors that speak to whether,as a matter of economic reality,a putative employer has functional control over workers even in the absence of formal control.id.at.the eleventh circuit applies an test with five factors that derive from regulations implementing the migrant workers act and speak to many of the considerations addressed by the bonnette factors designed to assess whether a worker is economically dependent on a putative joint employer layton dhl express usa,cir.and although the ninth circuit has not expressly replaced the bonnette test,it now assesses whether a joint employment relationship exists using thirteen nonexclusive factors,five from the text of the migrant workers act regulations and eight derived from case law.may,cir.l ike other balancing tests,this universe of nebulous factor tests has yield ed unpredictable and at times arbitrary results.lexmark int l,static control components,scalia.
we agree that bonnette reliance on agency principles does not square with congress intent that the flsa definition of employee encompass a broader swath of workers than would constitute employees at common law.see darden,at.accordingly,courts should not rely on the bonnette factors in determining whether a worker constitutes an employee or independent contractor for purposes of the flsa and analogous labor statutes but focusing on bonnette errant reliance on agency principles diverts attention from two more fundamental problems with the use of the bonnette factors and tests built upon those factors in the joint employment context that the factors improperly focus on the relationship between the employee and putative joint employer,rather than on the relationship between the putative joint employers,and incorrectly frame the joint employment inquiry as a question of an employee economic dependence on a putative joint employer.
as to the first problem,recall that the joint employment doctrine addresses whether a relationship exists between two entities such that they should be treated as a single employer for purposes of determining compliance with and liability under the flsa.to that end,the department of labor regulations state that joint employment exists when employment by one employer is not completely disassociated from employment by the other employer.a emphasis added.likewise,we have held that the joint employment inquiry must address the relationship between the employer who uses and benefits from the services of workers and the party that hires or assigns the workers to that employer.schultz,at emphasis added internal quotation mark omitted quoting ansoumana gristede operating,supp.
tests focusing on the relationship between a worker and a putative joint employer like the bonnette test do not address,much less solve,the problem of whether two entities are entirely independent or not completely disassociated with regard to the essential terms and conditions that govern a worker employment,a,and thus whether the worker employment with the two entities should be treated as one employment for purposes of determining compliance with the flsa,schultz,at.in particular,regardless of whether two entities qualify as employers under the bonnette factors,courts still must determine whether those two entities are not completely disassociated,a,with regard to the terms of a worker employment,such that all of the hours worked should be credited as if to one employer for purposes of determining overtime liability,at.likewise,even if two entities do not independently constitute employers under the bonnette test,their combined influence over the terms and conditions of a worker employment may give rise to liability under the flsa if the entities are not completely disassociated with regard to the worker employment.see schultz,at the district court therefore erred by weighing the degree of control exercised by one putative joint employer against that exercised by the other.the court should have instead weighed the agents control against the total control exercised by both joint employers.in other words,bonnette and its progeny do not squarely address the joint element of the joint employer doctrine.
the second problem with the bonnette factors and related tests their focus on whether as a matter of economic reality,the individual is dependent on a putative joint employer,layton,at also reflects a failure to distinguish the joint employment inquiry from the separate,contractor inquiry.courts focus on economic dependency derives from the supreme court decisions in rutherford food and goldberg whitaker house cooperative.see,at antenor,at bonnette,at.yet neither case supports the use of economic dependence to guide the entire joint employment analysis.
in rutherford food,the supreme court considered whether kaiser,a slaughterhouse operator,employed meat boners who were directly employed by an independent contractor that provided labor for kaiser meat deboning process.at.the meat boners did a specialty job on kaiser production line,working in one room within the slaughterhouse to remove the bones from cattle carcasses as they were conveyed into the room by kaiser employees on an overhead rail running throughout the slaughterhouse.id.at.in performing their tasks,the meat boners used kaiser premises and equipment and were supervised by one of kaiser managing official s.id.at.these factors,among others,reflected that the circumstances of the whole activity compelled the conclusion that the meat boners were employees of kaiser for purposes of the flsa.id.
although rutherford food recognized joint employment that both kaiser and the independent contractor employed the meat boners the case principally addressed whether the meat boners were employees or independent contractors of kaiser,not whether kaiser and its independent contractors were joint employers.see id.at we pass only upon the question whether the boners were employees of kaiser under the fair labor standards act.indeed,before the case reached the supreme court,the tenth circuit characterized t he strongly contested issue as whether the boners were and are employees of kaiser,within purview of the act,or were and are independent contractors.walling rutherford food,cir,aff.therefore,rutherford food embraced economic dependency as a vehicle for distinguishing employees from independent contractors not for determining whether two entities jointly employ a putative employee for purposes of the flsa.
goldberg likewise applied the economic dependence test to distinguish between employees and independent contractors and not as the basis for finding joint employment.there,the court considered whether members of a cooperative that made and sold knitted,crocheted,and embroidered goods of all kinds were also the cooperative employees.at.the court concluded that the members,who made goods for the cooperative,were neither nor independent,but rather were employees based on the economic reality test.id.at.goldberg did not address joint employment and relied heavily on united states silk,the foundational case addressing how to distinguish employees from independent contractors for purposes of the flsa.id.at.
although economic dependency is the prism through which courts should distinguish employees from independent contractors,as rutherford food and goldberg demonstrate,it does not capture key ways in which putative joint employers may be not completely disassociated with respect to establishing the terms and conditions of a worker employment the relevant question in determining whether entities constitute joint employers.a.for example,in determining whether entities are joint employers,courts have considered whether workers perform a specialty job on the production line,at work on a putative joint employer premises,or perform a job integral to a putative employer business,antenor,at and whether the putative joint employer prepares payroll,or maintains possession or control over the workers employment records,enterprise,at.we agree that these considerations are relevant to the joint employment analysis in that they speak to whether putative joint employers are not completely disassociated with respect to the terms and conditions of a worker employment,but we also recognize that these facts do not render a worker economically dependent on a putative joint employer.
courts conflation of economic dependency with whether two entities are not completely disassociated with respect to a worker employment arises from their improper focus on the relationship between a putative joint employer and a worker,rather than the relationship between putative joint employers.if a court addresses whether one entity is a worker employer under the flsa,then it makes sense to examine economic dependency.after all,that focus is derived from cases that seek to answer the same question framed in reverse whether an individual is an entity employee.but such a focus is inapposite to the joint employment inquiry,which requires courts to determine whether the putative joint employers are not wholly disassociated or,put differently,share or codetermine the essential terms and conditions of a worker employment.
in sum,courts have failed to develop a coherent test for determining whether entities constitute joint employers.the myriad existing tests most of which derive from bonnette improperly rely on agency principles focus on the relationship between a putative joint employer and a worker,rather than the relationship between putative joint employers and view joint employment as a question of economic dependency.accordingly,district courts should not follow bonnette and its progeny in determining whether two or more persons or entities constitute joint employers for purposes of the flsa.
in schultz,this court established a framework for analyzing flsa joint employment claims,under which courts must first determine whether two entities should be treated as joint employers and then analyze whether the worker constitutes an employee or independent contractor of the combined entity,if they are joint employers,or each entity,if they are separate employers at.regarding the first step,schultz identified the department of labor regulations as the starting point for determining whether two or more entities constitute joint employers for purposes of the flsa and focused on the nature of the relationship between putative joint employers.id.at see also cable telecomms.ass brand x internet,holding that if a statute is silent or ambiguous as to a particular issue,courts must defer to the agency interpretation so long as the construction is a reasonable policy choice for the agency to make internal quotation marks omitted.
but unlike many of our sister circuits,we have not identified specific factors courts should consider in determining whether a joint employment relationship exists,prompting our district courts to apply a variety of multifactor tests.see,dalton,supp.at applying the bonnette test jennings rapid response delivery,civil no,wl,at.june,applying a test derived from bonnette and zheng heath perdue farms,supp,applying a test derived from the migrant workers act regulations and case law 
in light of this confusion and our admonition that courts should no longer employ bonnette or tests derived from bonnette in the flsa joint employment context we now set forth our own test for determining whether two persons or entities constitute joint employers for purposes of the flsa.in doing so,we are guided by the supreme court direction that the flsa must not be interpreted or applied in a narrow,grudging manner.coal,at.rather,because the act is remedial and humanitarian in purpose,it should be broadly interpreted and applied to effectuate its goals.benshoff,at internal quotation marks and citation omitted.
as we made clear in schultz,any joint employment inquiry must begin with the department of labor regulations,which distinguish between separate employment when two persons or entities are entirely independent with respect to a worker employment and joint employment when the two persons or entities are not completely disassociated.a.to that end,the regulations identify three nonexclusive scenarios in which joint employment,as opposed to separate employment,generally exists 
where there is an arrangement between the employers to share the employee services,as,for example,to interchange employees or 
where one employer is acting directly or indirectly in the interest of the other employer or employers in relation to the employee or 
where the employers are not completely disassociated with respect to the employment of a particular employee and may be deemed to share control of the employee,directly or indirectly,by reason of the fact that one employer controls,is controlled by,or is under common control with the other employer.
id.b footnotes omitted.each of these scenarios focuses on the relationship between the putative joint employers the proper focus of the first step of the joint employment inquiry,which turns on the relative association or disassociation between entities with respect to establishing the essential terms and conditions of a worker employment.
although the regulations identify three distinct scenarios,all three speak to one fundamental question whether two or more persons or entities are not completely disassociated with respect to a worker such that the persons or entities share,agree to allocate responsibility for,or otherwise codetermine formally or informally,directly or indirectly the essential terms and conditions of the worker employment.enterprise,at w here two or more employers share or those matters governing essential terms and conditions of employment they constitute joint employers under the flsa.internal quotation marks omitted.
in answering this question courts should consider six factors 
whether,formally or as a matter of practice,the putative joint employers jointly determine,share,or allocate the power to direct,control,or supervise the worker,whether by direct or indirect means 
whether,formally or as a matter of practice,the putative joint employers jointly determine,share,or allocate the power to directly or indirectly hire or fire the worker or modify the terms or conditions of the worker employment 
the degree of permanency and duration of the relationship between the putative joint employers 
whether,through shared management or a direct or indirect ownership interest,one putative joint employer controls,is controlled by,or is under common control with the other putative joint employer 
whether the work is performed on a premises owned or controlled by one or more of the putative joint employers,independently or in connection with one another and 
whether,formally or as a matter of practice,the putative joint employers jointly determine,share,or allocate responsibility over functions ordinarily carried out by an employer,such as handling payroll providing workers compensation insurance paying payroll taxes or providing the facilities,equipment,tools,or materials necessary to complete the work.
we emphasize that these six factors do not constitute an exhaustive list of all potentially relevant considerations.to the extent that facts not captured by these factors speak to the fundamental threshold question that must be resolved in every joint employment case whether a purported joint employer shares or codetermines the essential terms and conditions of a worker employment courts must consider those facts as well.
we also emphasize that t he ultimate determination of joint employment must be based upon the circumstances of the whole activity.schultz,at internal quotation marks omitted a a determination of whether the employment by the employers is to be considered joint employment or separate and distinct employment for purposes of the act depends upon all the facts in the particular case.as judge easterbrook explained in reyes remington hybrid seed,cir,a score of to decides a baseball game,not whether two entities constitute joint employers under the relevant test,at.and,the department of labor regulation focus on whether two entities are entirely independent or not completely disassociated,a emphasis added,indicates that one factor alone can serve as the basis for finding that two or more persons or entities are not completely disassociated with respect to a worker employment if the facts supporting that factor demonstrate that the person or entity has a substantial role in determining the essential terms and conditions of a worker employment 
we adopt the test set forth above for several reasons.first,the test focuses on the relevant relationship the relationship between the putative joint employers as dictated by the department of labor regulation and the purpose of the joint employment doctrine.a.focusing on whether putative joint employers share or codetermine the terms and conditions of a worker employment also prevents courts from conflating the two separate inquiries within the joint employment analysis whether two or more entities are not completely disassociated with respect to a worker employment and in the context of the worker entire employment,whether the worker is an employee protected by the flsa or an independent contractor outside the statute scope.that courts must apply different factors in determining whether entities are joint employers and whether workers are employees or independent contractors,and must weigh those factors through different lenses whether the putative joint employers are not completely disassociated with regard to establishing the essential terms of a worker employment versus whether workers are economically dependent on a putative employer further serves to differentiate the two inquiries.
by focusing on the relationship between putative joint employers,our test also captures situations that tests focusing solely on the relationship between a worker and a putative joint employer can not resolve.for instance,a finding that two entities independently constitute a worker employers for purposes of the flsa does not resolve whether the entities amount to joint employers such that the worker hours for both employers must be aggregated to determine compliance with the statute.likewise,two entities that do not individually employ a worker within the meaning of the flsa may still have to comply with the flsa if their combined influence over the essential terms and conditions of the worker activities gives rise to an relationship.our test provides clarity in such situations,whereas tests focusing solely on the relationship between a worker and each putative joint employer,like bonnette,fail to address much less resolve the entities joint obligations.
finally,the test set forth above is appropriately different from and more inclusive than joint employment tests applied under other statutes that do not define employ,employer,and employee as broadly as the flsa.the supreme court has contrasted the striking breadth of the flsa definition of employee with other statutes that define the term more narrowly,stating that an entity may constitute an employer for purposes of the flsa even if it is not an employer under other statutes.darden,at.
we highlighted the implications of this difference in the context of joint employment in butler drive automotive industries of america,cir.there,we dealt with whether two entities were joint employers for the purposes of title vii of the civil rights act of.at.we adopted a hybrid test for determining when joint employment exists for title vii purposes,deeming the element of control the principal guidepost in the analysis.id.at.in adopting this test,we noted that flsa cases are not particularly transferrable to title vii cases because the flsa defines employee more broadly than title vii and a number of other federal labor statutes.id.at.by rejecting the control tests like butler and bonnette and instead focusing on whether two entities are not completely disassociated with regard to their codetermination of the key terms and conditions of a worker employment,the test set forth above remains true to congress intent to define employment more expansively in the flsa than in other statutes.
in reaffirming schultz analysis and setting forth factors to aid in determining whether two or more entities are not completely disassociated with respect to a worker employment,we also reject the novel test developed and applied by the district court,which focused on whether the relationship between putative joint employers was traditionally recognized in the law,represented a reasonable business decision,or reflected a bad faith effort to avoid compliance with wage and hour laws.
that the general relationship or any other relationship has long been recognized in the law and remains prevalent in the relevant industry has no bearing on whether entities codetermine the essential terms and conditions of a worker employment and,therefore,constitute joint employers for purposes of the flsa.as the second circuit has noted,the prevalence of an custom is subject to conflicting inferences.while,on the one hand,it may be unlikely that a prevalent action is a mere subterfuge to avoid complying with labor laws,on the other hand,the very prevalence of a custom may be attributable to widespread evasion of labor laws.barfield health and hosps,cir.quoting zheng,at.
more significantly,classifying contractors and subcontractors that share,allocate responsibility for,or codetermine the essential terms and conditions of a worker employment as joint employers and requiring them to comply with the flsa wage and hour requirements does not undermine the many reasons the law has traditionally recognized the general relationship.in particular,to the extent a subcontractor constitutes a bona fide independent contractor,the general contractor will limit its liability for the subcontractor negligence.rowley mayor city council of,the general rule is that the employer of an independent contractor is not liable for the negligence of the contractor or his employees.restatement second of torts.and by entering into a general relationship,the general contractor may not have to comply with tax,labor,and benefits laws that have narrower definitions of employ,employee,and employer than the flsa.see darden,at.accordingly,contrary to commercial protestations,applying the joint employment doctrine in accordance with the intent of congress and the department of labor does not undermine let alone deal a fatal blow to the traditional benefits of general relationships it simply ensures that the wages paid by private employers are sufficient to maintain the bare cost of living,at.
the fact that contracting out employment services represents a reasonable business decision likewise has no bearing on whether two entities constitute joint employers and therefore must jointly comply with the flsa wage and hour provisions.in numerous circumstances,courts have deemed an arrangement between two entities joint employment for purposes of the flsa,notwithstanding the entities reasonable business purpose for entering into the arrangement.for example,in barfield,the second circuit acknowledged that a hospital contracted with referral agencies for temporary nursing services as a result of a legitimate business concern stemming from the shortage of health care workers available for employment.at.nonetheless,the court held that the hospital jointly employed a nursing assistant who was directly employed and paid by three referral agencies with which the hospital contracted.id.at.likewise,in schultz,we concluded that a saudi diplomat and an independent security services contractor jointly employed plaintiff security agents for purposes of the flsa,notwithstanding that the contracting relationship made business sense because of licensing requirements for security businesses.at.
finally,that two persons or entities did not enter into a relationship with the intent to avoid compliance with the flsa is not dispositive as to whether the persons or entities codetermine the key terms and conditions of a worker employment or whether,ultimately,they are joint employers.to be sure,the joint employment doctrine serves to preserve flsa protection so as to prevent such abuses as manipulation of job scheduling or rotation of workers to circumvent overtime requirements,at.accordingly,facts demonstrating that two entities jointly engaged in a bad faith effort to evade compliance with the flsa such as by strategically allocating levers of control over a worker so that neither entity independently constitutes the worker employer will provide strong evidence that the entities are not completely disassociated with respect to that worker employment.
but as the third circuit has recognized in the context of the national labor relations act a labor statute that defines employment more narrowly than the flsa joint employment also can exist when one employer while contracting in good faith with an otherwise independent company,has retained for itself sufficient control of the terms and conditions of employment of the employees who are employed by the other employer.indus.of,cir.emphasis added.for this reason,we join other courts in rejecting joint employment tests,like the one developed and applied by the district court in this case,that turn on whether an arrangement between putative joint employers was purposely structured to avoid flsa obligations.barfield,at holding that an entity can constitute a joint employer even absent a showing of subterfuge or business bad faith.
we now apply the joint employment test set forth above to determine whether summary judgment was properly granted in favor of commercial position that it did not jointly employ plaintiffs.we review a district court award of summary judgment de novo,morrison cty.of fairfax,cir,viewing all facts in the light most favorable to the nonmovant,monahan cty.of chesterfield,cir.a court may award summary judgment only when the movant shows that there is no genuine dispute as to any material fact and the movant is entitled to judgment as a matter of law.fed.civ.a.
we also review de novo whether an entity is a joint employer for purposes of the flsa.moreau air france,cir.schultz,at w hether a worker is an employee or independent contractor under the flsa presents a legal question that we review de novo.in this case,we conclude that any factual disputes are immaterial and,therefore,resolve the joint employment question based on the undisputed facts in the record.
applying the joint employment test set forth above,we conclude that commercial and jointly employed plaintiffs based on the following undisputed facts 
plaintiffs performed nearly all of their work on commercial jobsites and for commercial benefit 
commercial provided the tools,materials,and equipment necessary for plaintiffs work,with plaintiffs providing only small,handheld tools 
on at least one occasion,commercial rented a house near the jobsite for employees to stay in during a project 
commercial actively supervised plaintiffs work on a daily basis by having foremen walk the jobsite and check plaintiffs progress 
commercial required plaintiffs to attend frequent meetings regarding their assigned tasks and safety protocols 
commercial required plaintiffs to sign in and out with commercial foremen upon reporting to and leaving the jobsite each day 
commercial foremen frequently directed plaintiffs to redo deficient work,communicating problems to supervisors who translated the information to plaintiffs 
commercial foremen told certain plaintiffs to work additional hours or additional days 
commercial communicated its staffing needs to,and based plaintiffs jobsite assignments on commercial needs 
when performed certain time and materials work for commercial and was paid on an hourly,rather than,basis,commercial told how many of its employees to send to the project and how many hours those employees were permitted to work 
commercial provided plaintiffs with stickers bearing the commercial logo to wear on their hardhats and vests bearing commercial logos to don while working on commercial jobsites 
supervisors instructed plaintiffs to tell anyone who asked that they worked for commercial 
commercial provided supervisors with sweatshirts to wear while working on commercial projects 
on at least one occasion,commercial required employees to apply for employment with commercial and directly hired those employees.
although a majority of factors are not necessary to support a finding that two or more entities are not completely disassociated with respect to a worker employment,see supra part,based on these facts,nearly all of the factors we identified above support such a finding 
regarding the first factor supervision commercial and jointly directed,supervised,and controlled plaintiffs.in particular,commercial continuously supervised plaintiffs,providing feedback and direction both formally,through frequent mandatory meetings,and informally,through instruction regarding the methods and quality of plaintiffs work and compliance with safety protocols.commercial also could and did require plaintiffs to redo work commercial found deficient.supervisors assisted in this supervision by translating commercial instructions and providing additional direction to plaintiffs.not only did commercial supervise plaintiffs work,it also required plaintiffs to hold themselves out as commercial employees by providing plaintiffs and supervisors with clothing and safety equipment to wear on commercial jobsites.
the second factor authority over terms and conditions of employment also supports a finding that commercial and were not completely disassociated with respect to plaintiffs employment.although generally was responsible for hiring and firing its employees,commercial,in consultation with others,dictated plaintiffs hours and,at times,required plaintiffs to work additional hours or on additional days.and when performed work for commercial paid on an hourly,as opposed to,basis,commercial instructed regarding how it should staff the project and when it could pay overtime.additionally,in at least one instance,commercial directly hired at least one plaintiff due to inability to enroll in an insurance program required for its employees to continue working on commercial jobsites.
regarding the third and fourth factors,although commercial did not own,commercial and had a longstanding business relationship.the overwhelming majority of contracts were with commercial,and plaintiffs worked almost exclusively on commercial jobsites.even after went out of business,commercial continued its business relationship with the ramirez brothers,who formed a new business,general contractors,that has contracted with commercial to provide drywall and framing services.
that plaintiffs worked on premises controlled by commercial speaks to the fifth factor whether plaintiffs worked in a location controlled by one or more of the putative joint employers.indeed,commercial required plaintiffs to sign in and out of the jobsite with commercial foremen and supervised plaintiffs actions while they were on the jobsite.
the final factor codetermination or allocation of responsibility over functions ordinarily carried out by employers also supports a finding that commercial and were not completely disassociated with respect to plaintiffs employment.in particular,commercial supplied plaintiffs with all the tools,materials,and equipment necessary to perform their work.moreover,on one occasion,commercial provided a house for employees to live in while working on a commercial jobsite.and while issued plaintiffs paychecks,commercial recorded plaintiffs hours on timesheets,maintained those timesheets,and required plaintiffs to sign in and out each day.
nevertheless,commercial maintains that it did not jointly employ plaintiffs for four reasons.first,it asserts that commercial and ji had nothing more or less than the relationship which is normal and standard in the construction industry.appellee response br.at.but,as explained above,that commercial and engaged in a traditional,normal,or standard business relationship has no bearing on whether they jointly employ a worker for purposes of the flsa.see supra part.
second,commercial emphasizes that its practice of having foremen supervise plaintiffs work and,through supervisors,demand corrections as needed amounted to quality control and therefore was not indicative of joint employment.appellee response br.at.we agree that an entity does not become a joint employer by engaging in the oversight necessary to ensure that a contractor services meet contractual standards of quality and timeliness.see moreau,at finding that indirect supervision or control to ensure compliance with various safety and security regulations was not indicative of joint employment when done to verify that the task was done properly zheng,at finding that although extensive supervision of a plaintiff work is indicative of an employment relationship,supervision with respect to contractual warranties of quality and time of delivery has no bearing on the joint employment inquiry.
but in this case,commercial supervision of plaintiffs went beyond ing to verify that the task was done properly.moreau,at.rather,commercial foremen engaged in daily oversight of plaintiffs work and provided regular feedback and instruction,through supervisors,to plaintiffs regarding the pace and quality of their work.in addition,commercial foremen conducted frequent meetings to instruct plaintiffs regarding the projects they needed to complete and the methods by which they should do so,as well as the safety protocols they should follow.taken together,these facts amount to extensive supervision indicative of an employment relationship,rather than an assessment of compliance with contractual quality and timeliness standards.zheng,at see also,at finding that the putative joint employer daily presence on the jobsite and ability to inspect all the work performed both while it was being done and after its completion weighed in favor of finding joint employment.
contrary to commercial protestations,we also give little weight to the fact that commercial foremen generally spoke only to supervisors and did not speak to plaintiffs directly.the flsa provides that indirect control is sufficient to render an entity an employer under the statute.d defining employer as any person acting directly or indirectly in the interest of an employer in relation to an employee emphasis added.the regulations implementing the flsa also expressly contemplate that direct or indirect supervision and control is probative of joint employment,stating that joint employment will generally exist when employers share control of the employee,directly or indirectly.b emphasis added.
to that end,courts have concluded that the suffer or permit to work standard was developed to assign responsibility to businesses that did not directly supervise putative employees.antenor,at emphasis added see also,at concluding that indirect control as well as direct control can demonstrate a joint employment relationship.accordingly,i t is that supervision is present whether orders are communicated directly to the laborer or indirectly through the contractor.aimable long scott farms,cir.see also hodgson,at the fact that the putative joint employer effect s the supervision by speaking to the crew leaders,who in turn sp eak to the workers,rather than speaking directly to the workers does not negate a degree of apparent control over the workers.here,commercial supervised plaintiffs by communicating instructions,on a daily basis,to plaintiffs through supervisors.commercial use of supervisors to convey instructions to plaintiffs,therefore,supports,rather than precludes,a finding that commercial jointly employed plaintiffs.
third,commercial emphasizes that its relationship with was that of a principal and an independent contractor,with receiving a fixed price or lump sum for supplying labor to commercial.appellee response br.at.although the flsa does not define employee so broadly that all or almost all employees of independent contractors become employees of every firm whose premises they enter,reyes,at,neither does the flsa automatically exempt entities that use independent contractors to provide labor from complying with the statute wage and hour provisions.significantly,independent contractor status does not necessarily imply the contractor is solely responsible for his employees under the flsa.another employer may be jointly responsible for the contractor employees.hodgson,at.here,commercial and codetermined the key terms and conditions of plaintiffs employment and therefore constituted joint employers,regardless of whether is properly characterized and treated as commercial independent contractor for other purposes.
finally,commercial maintains that a ruling in plaintiffs favor will render every general contractor a joint employer of its subcontractor employees and thereby impose unreasonable financial burdens on general contractors.we disagree.as an initial matter,we reiterate that courts must assess joint employment based upon the circumstances of the whole activity.schultz,at internal quotation marks omitted.accordingly,were we confronted with different facts establishing that a general contractor possessed and exercised less pervasive authority to determine the essential terms and conditions of employment of a subcontractor workers,our conclusion as to whether the entities were not completely disassociated may have been different.additionally,we note that,given the flsa particularly expansive definition of employee,a finding that a general contractor constitutes a joint employer for purposes of the flsa does not necessarily mean the general contractor is a joint employer for purposes of other federal and state laws.see supra part.
