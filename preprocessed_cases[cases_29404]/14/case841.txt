this court consolidated the two appeals.respondents are the dir,the acting director of the dir at the relevant time,chuck cake the director,and four labor organizations who obtained the public work determination from the director in this case the union respondents.we hold that the project at issue was not a public work and,therefore,reverse the judgment.
ii.statement of facts 
a.the redevelopment project 
the agency solicited proposals from interested parties to redevelop the cleaveland triangle area in pleasant hill,a site consisting of separate parcels of property.redeveloping this site,located within the schoolyard redevelopment project area,was part of the agency general plan to use its financial resources and administrative powers to stimulate private development and help improve the economic base of the project area and community.
on september,the agency entered into an exclusive right to negotiate agreement with the desilva group desilva to develop a plan for the cleaveland triangle project the project.negotiations culminated in a disposition and development agreement dda.before the dda was executed,a public hearing was held and the agency obtained approval from the pleasant hill city counsel to proceed with the project by entering into the dda.as part of the approval process,the agency filed a summary report,which outlined the plan for the project and the respective obligations of the agency and the developer.
in november,the agency and desilva executed the dda.in december,desilva assigned its rights and responsibilities under the dda to greystone.
the plan for this project was to aggregate the separate parcels into a common ownership,and then to build residential townhomes,parking and swimming facilities,and on and improvements.twelve of the townhomes would be made available for sale at an affordable housing cost to persons.these units were to be subject to affordability covenants restricting for several years both the prices for which they could be sold and and the income level of eligible buyers.
aggregation of the parcels 
at the time the dda was executed,desilva owned or was under contract to purchase of the parcels in the cleaveland triangle area the developer parcels.two parcels were owned by the agency the existing agency parcels,and the seven remaining parcels were owned by third parties the acquisition parcels.pursuant to the dda,the agency agreed to convey to the developer the two existing agency parcels and any acquisition parcels that it subsequently acquired.
the agency had used public funds to purchase one of the existing agency parcels,the clara court parcel,for.the second existing agency parcel,the district parcel,was purchased by the agency with funds advanced to it by desilva.
the dda required the agency to obtain appraisals of the acquisition parcels,to advise the developer of the appraised values of the parcels,and to attempt to purchase the parcels at the developer request.the agency also agreed to consider using its eminent domain power if it was unable to acquire the acquisition parcels by negotiation within a given time period.the developer was required to advance funds to pay and acquisition costs incurred by the agency to purchase these parcels.
the estimated cost of the project was million.the financing obligations for the project were set forth in an attachment to the dda entitled method of financing hereafter,the financing attachment.
the financing attachment provided that the developer was required to pay all costs for demolishing any buildings or other improvements on the site and clearing and preparing the site for development,and all hard and soft costs of construction of the developer improvements,including without limitation,the improvements.the developer was also required to pay the costs of complying with the conditions of approval of the tentative map for the project.
the summary report the agency had filed prior to executing the dda stated the agency had committed to pay a traffic impact mitigation fee,which was estimated to be approximately.neither the financing attachment nor any other provision of the dda made any reference to this traffic impact mitigation fee.
the financing attachment obligated the agency to reimburse the developer in the future for payments the developer made or would make in order to acquire the parcels needed for the project.specifically,the agency agreed to reimburse the developer for advances to the agency for and acquisition costs relating to the purchase of the acquisition parcels acquisition costs that the developer incurred in order to purchase the developer parcels and funds advanced to the agency before the dda was executed to purchase the district parcel,one of the two existing agency parcels.
reimbursement for these costs was to be paid by the agency out of future revenue generated by the project as a result of increased property taxes the dda provided that the maximum reimbursement the agency could make to the developer was,of which could be paid out of increases in unrestricted property tax revenue attributable to the project referred to in the financing attachment as annual net tax increments,and could be paid from increases in property tax revenue attributable to the project but restricted to use for affordable housing projects referred to in the financing attachment as annual housing revenue 
d.the public works determinations 
with exceptions not relevant here,the pwl requires that all workers employed on public works must be paid not less than the general prevailing rate of per diem wages for work of a similar character in the locality in which the public work is performed.the general prevailing rate of per diem wages is determined by the director of the dir.
when the dda was executed,public works was defined as c onstruction,alteration,demolition,or repair work done under contract and paid for in whole or in part out of public funds,except work done directly by any public utility company pursuant to order of the public utilities commission or other public authority.former,subd.a former section a.the parties agree that this case is governed by former section a 
by letter dated june,the union respondents requested a determination from the dir that the project was a public work.on january,the director issued public works coverage determination.the director determined that the project is a public work subject to the payment of prevailing wages.
the director found that the project was demolition and construction,done under contract and paid for in part with public funds from the agency.he identified three distinct payments of public funds.first,the director characterized the conveyance of the clara court parcel to the developer as a gift of public land which was the equivalent of the payment of public funds.second,the director found that the agency payment of the traffic impact mitigation fee,referenced in the agency summary report,was a payment for construction since the impact fees are a mandatory cost of constructing the project.finally,the director found that the agency payment of the annual net tax increments and housing funds constitutes payment of public funds for construction since they are being paid to reimburse the developer costs.the director reasoned that each of these three payments was for activities integrally connected to the construction of the project,thus making the project a public work.
greystone appealed the director decision on february.on july,the director affirmed his determination that the project was a public work.on september,greystone filed a petition for a peremptory writ of mandate and complaint for declaratory relief.the trial court denied the writ.although it affirmed the director determination that the project was a public work,the court based its decision solely upon the reimbursement the agency paid from annual housing revenue.
the trial court concluded that the agency payment of as an incentive to sell homes at below market rates established that the project was paid for in whole or in part out of public funds.former a.the court rejected appellants argument that this payment did not make the project a public work because a contribution toward acquisition of real property does not constitute payment for construction within the meaning of former section a.according to the trial court,t his payment was neither earmarked as a payment for land acquisition nor proven to in fact be used solely for land acquisition.since money is fungible,it is the view of this court that to be treated as solely land acquisition monies one or the other is necessary.
a judgment denying the petition for writ of mandate was filed july.
iii.discussion 
issue presented and standard of review 
appellants contend the trial court erred by affirming the director determination that the project was a public work within the meaning of former section a.because we agree,we do not reach appellants alternative arguments that the director violated the administrative adjudication bill of rights and the administrative procedure act and equitable considerations preclude enforcing the director determination.
the dir maintains that this court must affirm the director factual findings that public funds were used to pay for construction of the project because they are supported by substantial evidence.in fact,though,the director expressly based his determination on legal rather than factual grounds.in denying greystone request for a hearing before the dir,the director stated because here the material facts are undisputed and the issues raised are legal ones,there are no factual issues to be decided and no hearing is necessary.
in any event,the dir fails to identify the correct standard of review.in conducting our review,we must exercise our independent judgment in resolving whether the project at issue constituted a public work within the meaning of the pwl.city of long beach department of industrial relations cal th,d,city of long beach see also mcintosh aubry th,d coverage determinations,because they entail interpretations of section,can not be shielded from mandate review by labeling them discretionary interpretation or construction of a statute is a matter of law not the exercise of discretionary authority.
city of long beach 
former section a,which defines public work for purposes of this case,was recently interpreted by our supreme court in city of long beach,supra,cal th,d.the project at issue there was the private construction of a million animal control facility built by the society for the prevention of cruelty to animals spca and funded in part by a million grant from the city of long beach city.id.at,d.use of the grant money was expressly limited to project development and other preconstruction expenses.ibid.the director determined that the spca project was a public work under former section a and the court of appeal agreed.the city of long beach court reversed.
in reaching its decision,the city of long beach court resolved a dispute regarding the meaning of the term construction in former section a.city of long beach,supra,cal th at,d.the city argued construction meant only the actual physical act of building the structure.ibid.it maintained that this narrow definition was expanded by a amendment to section a which expressly defined construction to include work performed during the design and preconstruction phases of construction including,but not limited to,inspection and land surveying work.see fn,ante.the city characterized this amendment as a prospective change in the law,not a simple restatement of existing law which did not apply retroactively to agreements that were executed prior to its effective date.city of long beach,supra,cal th at,d.on the other hand,the dir maintained that the term construction encompassed the planning,design,and phases of a project,which would include architectural design,project management,and surveying.according to the dir,the amendment to section a merely clarified existing law.ibid.
the city of long beach court agreed with the city.city of long beach,supra,cal th at,d.it found that the term construction in former section a did not encompass work performed during a project design and preconstruction phases,the amendment to section a expanded the definition of public works,and the amendment did not apply retroactively to contracts executed prior to its effective date.id.at,d.therefore,the court held that the spca project,which was built solely with private funds,did not become a public work under former section a because the city had contributed funds to defray such preconstruction costs or expenses as legal fees,insurance premiums,architectural design costs,and project management and surveying fees.id.at,d.
in the present case,both the director and the trial court issued their decisions before city of long beach was decided.the director made the legal determination that payment for construction under former section a meant a payment for any activity essential to the completion of a construction project.thus,he found this project was a public work because agency contributions funded activities integrally connected to the construction of the project this interpretation and application of the governing statute is erroneous under city of long beach.the city of long beach court was persuaded that the term construction in former section a meant only the actual physical act of building the structure,and it expressly rejected the dir contrary claim that this term encompassed phases of a project.city of long beach,supra,cal th at,d.
apparently the trial court in the present case was persuaded by the director construction of former section a.the court found that the agency payment of as an incentive to sell homes at below market rates established that the project was paid for in whole or in part out of public funds.emphasis supplied.to the extent it equated project costs with construction costs,the trial court erred.in light of city of long beach,the dispositive question in the present case is whether actual construction of the new development at the cleaveland triangle site in pleasant hill was paid for in whole or in part out of public funds.see city of long beach,supra,cal th at,d.
respondents characterize city of long beach as a narrow ruling which is inapposite because it is factually distinguishable.city of long beach is narrow in the sense that it interprets former section a,a statute which governs a limited number of cases.however,since it is undisputed that this case is governed by former section a,city of long beach is directly on point and it streamlines our analysis in this case.accordingly,we summarily reject the numerous arguments that respondents make which simply ignore the city of long beach court interpretation of former section a 
c.the project in this case 
as detailed in our factual summary,the agency made three distinct contributions to the project the conveyance of the clara court parcel the parcel conveyance payment of the traffic mitigation fee the fee payment and reimbursement for property acquisition costs paid out of future tax revenues the agency reimbursement.
the parties spend considerable time debating two irrelevant factual issues whether the parcel conveyance was a gift of public land and whether there is sufficient evidence in the record that the fee payment was actually made by the agency.we need not resolve these issues because,in any event,neither payment constitutes a payment for actual construction which would make this project a public work under city of long beach.the real property involved in the parcel conveyance became part of the land upon which the project was built it was not used to pay the costs of construction.nor was the traffic mitigation fee a cost of actual construction.according to the dir such a fee alleviate
