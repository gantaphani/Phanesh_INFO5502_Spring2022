plaintiff clear lake riviera community association association regulates new construction within a common interest development.defendants robert and catherine cramer the cramers purchased a lot within the development and drew up plans to build a house.in approving their plans,the association committee with responsibility for plan review applied an association guideline that limited the height of homes within the development.because the cramers home was located on a sloping lot,compliance with the height guideline depended not only on the height of the structure itself but also its location on the lot.
during construction,it was called to the attention of defendant robert cramer cramer that the location he selected for the home would result in a violation of the height guideline,but he disregarded the warnings.when the resulting home exceeded the height guideline by nine feet,the association filed suit to abate the violation.finding the cramers knowingly violated the height guideline,the trial court ordered them to bring their home into compliance.they contend the height regulation was unenforceable because the association failed to prove it had been properly adopted and the trial court abused its discretion in awarding injunctive relief rather than damages.we affirm.
background 
the association is a nonprofit corporation organized under the common interest development act,et to manage clear lake riviera riviera,a common interest development located in lake county.in,the association recorded an amended declaration of covenants,conditions,and restrictions declaration governing riviera.among other measures,the declaration established an architectural control and planning committee committee,consisting of three members appointed by the board of directors of the association board.the committee was charged with reviewing the plans for any improvements contemplated within riviera to ensure they complied with the requirements of the declaration and were in harmony with the general surroundings of such lot or with the adjacent buildings or structures.in addition,the committee was empowered to enact height restrictions for buildings within riviera,as well as other restrictions on the size and appearance of riviera construction.the declaration stated that,once plans had been approved by the committee,a ctual construction of any improvements must be in strict conformity with said plans.
the committee maintained a set of guidelines that was given to persons who planned to build in riviera,along with a copy of the association bylaws and a checklist for application processing.the guidelines described the process of plan approval and contained various substantive regulations governing new construction.among the guidelines was one limiting the height of structures to a maximum of feet above street level or the control point of the lot.for a sloping lot,the control point was the elevation at the center of the lot.although there was no evidence when and how this guideline was enacted,it had been applied by the committee since at least.
in march,the cramers submitted to the committee plans for a home they hoped to construct in riviera.rather than retain a general contractor,cramer intended to act as his own builder.the cramers plans were approved by the committee in april.beneath the approval stamp on each page of the plans,the committee had printed,structure height not to exceed feet from control point of lot.cramer was aware of the notation and knew the association guidelines imposed the height restriction.in a plot plan submitted with his application and approved by the committee,cramer had placed an asterisk in the middle of the lot map and written control point and next to the asterisk.
the evidence was in dispute at trial regarding the exact information and warnings given to cramer about his compliance with the height restriction.a member of the committee,curtis winchester,testified he had discussed lot setbacks and application of the association height restriction with cramer even before his plans were submitted to the committee.winchester explained to cramer that he and the committee would have to agree on the location of the lot control point before the application could be approved and a height variance was unlikely because there were many homes within riviera on similar upslope lots that complied with the height restriction.winchester told cramer it would be necessary to remove a substantial amount of soil from the lot to meet the height restriction,given the particular house design the cramers had chosen,and cramer agreed to do the necessary grading of the property.
cramer acknowledged he was aware of the height guideline,but he testified he was confused about the concept of control point and its measurement and had no knowledge or experience in determining the elevation of buildings.he never personally did the measurements necessary to determine how high his house was.cramer said he relied on his grading contractor to determine compliance with the height requirement and,in any event,could not have placed the home foundation any lower because the grading contractor ran into rock that prevented further excavation 
in june or early july,after cramer had completed grading and installed the wooden forms for his foundation,the committee met with him and two persons working with him to discuss application of the height restriction.the meeting occurred as a result of the complaint of a neighboring homeowner who was concerned from the location of the cramers foundation forms that the resulting house would be too tall.
winchester testified the committee told cramer at the meeting that if he chose to build at the location of his foundation forms,the planned house would have to be altered considerably to meet height requirements,and they recommended further grading to lower the foundation.at the close of the meeting,winchester testified,cramer was noncommittal,but he did not indicate any reservations about complying with the height guideline.
cramer and one of his contractors disputed this account of the meeting.according to these witnesses,the committee dismissed the neighbor complaint and told cramer there was no problem with his construction.as a result of the committee apparent approval,cramer testified,he decided soon after to pour the foundation concrete.cramer denied ever being warned by a committee member prior to the pouring of his foundation that the house would be too high.
in,the committee sent the cramers a notice stating that their house appeared to depart from the approved plans and noting the completed building would violate the height restriction in the guidelines.the form requested the cramers to notify the committee if they could not comply,but they did not do so.the committee sent a similar form in september,after the foundation was poured but before the walls were erected.
it was undisputed that when the cramers house was finished,it differed significantly from the house depicted in the approved plans,with one wall being considerably higher and more massive than shown on the plans.the house exceeded the height restriction by nine feet and impinged severely on the views of at least two neighboring homes.in november,after the home was complete,the cramers unsuccessfully requested a variance from the committee that would have ratified their violation of the height restriction.
in june,the association filed an action against the cramers seeking a declaration they were in violation of the guidelines and the approved construction plans,an injunction requiring compliance,and monetary damages.following a bench trial,the court found for the association in a statement of decision.the court rejected the cramers various arguments that the height restriction was invalid or unenforceable,found the cramers home to be nine feet higher than permitted under the guidelines,and concluded cramer knowingly built the home in violation of the height guideline.finding the cramers home had caused irreparable injury to neighboring homeowners,the court ordered them to bring it into compliance with the guidelines.
ii.discussion 
common interest developments,such as riviera,have become a widely accepted form of real property ownership.nahrstedt lakeside village condominium cal th.ordinarily,such ownership also entails mandatory membership in an owners association,which,through an elected board of directors,is empowered to enforce any use restrictions contained in the project declaration or master deed and to enact new rules governing the use and occupancy of property within the project.id.at.use restrictions are an inherent part of any common interest development and are crucial to the stable,planned environment of any shared ownership arrangement.id.at.use restrictions contained in a recorded declaration are afforded a presumption of validity and are enforced unless found unreasonable under a deferential standard.id.at.while use restrictions outside the declaration are not afforded the same presumption of validity,they are nonetheless enforced unless they fail a straight reasonableness test.rancho santa fe th.
a.the validity of the height guideline 
the cramers do not challenge the trial court conclusion their home violated the association construction guidelines,nor do they contend the height guideline is unreasonable.rather,they contend the evidence was insufficient to support the conclusion that there was a duly adopted and enforceable height restriction.
adoption of the height guideline 
the cramers primary validity argument is that t here was no showing whatsoever by plaintiff that the guidelines were ever adopted by a duly constituted committee.
the trial court held that the height guideline was valid and enforceable,a finding that necessarily includes the conclusion the guideline was properly enacted under the association rules.we must uphold the trial court findings of fact if they are supported by substantial evidence.in re charlisse cal th.
the limited testimony at trial addressing the guidelines demonstrated they were available in printed form at the time the cramers sought to build,were distributed to all who planned to build in riviera,were followed by the committee throughout the time in question in evaluating applications,and were believed by committee members to constitute enforceable regulations governing construction at riviera there was no evidence when and how the height guideline was enacted,but winchester testified it had been applied by the committee since at least.
while circumstantial,the foregoing provides substantial evidence supporting a finding the height guideline was validly adopted.see people lenix cal th,unlike direct evidence,circumstantial evidence does not directly prove the fact in question.instead,circumstantial evidence may support a logical conclusion that the disputed fact is true.the association amended declaration was adopted in.three years later,the committee was enforcing the height guideline.it is a permissible inference from this evidence that the guideline had been properly adopted,since the application of the guideline likely would have encountered resistance had it not been properly adopted.further support for proper adoption is found in the height guideline long history of enforcement since that time and the ease with which the association or the committee could have repealed the guideline if it had become disfavored by the members or if there were concerns about the propriety of its adoption.
it is true,as the cramers contend,there was no direct evidence of the guideline adoption.a witness provided by the association in response to a trial subpoena testified he could not locate any documents reflecting the result of any vote of the members of the committee on any rule or regulation involving height.that the association was unable to locate a document reflecting the adoption of the guidelines,however,does not necessarily support a finding they were not properly adopted.as one committee member testified,the committee operated relatively informally.it did not always keep minutes,and the minutes it kept were not rigorous.further,the height regulation had been enacted more than years before the trial.in the absence of testimony about the association document retention policy,it would not be surprising if documents reflecting adoption of the height guideline had not been retained over that time.indeed,no written records were produced dating from the era of the guideline adoption.under these circumstances,the absence of records regarding the adoption of the guideline does not outweigh the substantial circumstantial evidence supporting its proper adoption.
accordingly,the cramers argument that there was insufficient evidence of proper adoption of the height guideline reduces to the claim the association was required to prove proper adoption by direct evidence,by a written record reflecting the formal vote of the committee to adopt the regulation,rather than by circumstantial evidence.the cramers,however,present no persuasive argument to support such a conclusion.
it is a truism of the law that facts can be proven by circumstantial as well as direct evidence.ortega kmart cal th.the cramers provide no argument that would differentiate the issue of proper adoption from any other fact in this regard.indeed,none of the decisions reviewing an action to enforce a common interest development regulation holds the association is required to provide direct evidence that a regulation was properly adopted to prevail,pacific hills homeowners prun th,rancho santa fe th,cohen kite hill community d.on the contrary,those decisions never address the procedural history of the regulations,and there is no indication in any of them the association provided,or was required to provide,direct evidence the regulation had been properly adopted.in villa de las palmas homeowners terifaj cal th,in which the association originally attempted to enforce such a regulation,the supreme court expressly noted there was no evidence regarding the date of its adoption.id.at.although the regulation was ultimately not enforced,the court did not indicate the regulation would have been found unenforceable merely for the lack of direct evidence about its genesis.
the closest arguable authority for such an evidentiary requirement is ironwood owners.ix solomon d,which states,when a homeowners association seeks to enforce the provisions of its ccrs to compel an act by one of its member owners,it is incumbent upon it to show that it has followed its own standards and procedures prior to pursuing such a remedy,that those procedures were fair and reasonable and that its substantive decision was made in good faith,and is reasonable,not arbitrary or capricious.id.at.in holding an association must show its standards and procedures were followed,however,ironwood was not referring to proof that proper procedures were used for adoption of the guideline.rather,the standards and procedures referred to by ironwood were the internal procedures for enforcement of the restrictions,rather than their adoption.see pacific hills homeowners prun,supra,th at.
the cramers cite for the proposition that regulations adopted by an association are not afforded a presumption of reasonableness,but this portion of is concerned with the substantive reasonableness of regulations,not their procedural validity,supra,th at.in any event,there was no need for a presumption of reasonableness here.as discussed above,the trial court was entitled to infer proper adoption from the circumstantial evidence of long enforcement provided by the association.further,there was no suggestion in that the association was required to provide direct evidence its existing regulations had been properly adopted,and there is no indication in the decision such evidence was provided.id.at.
accordingly,we find no legal support for the cramers claim that a common interest association is required to provide direct,rather than circumstantial evidence that its use restrictions were properly adopted in an action to enforce the restrictions.
in arguing the guideline was invalid,the cramers also cite a resolution passed by the board in that rescinded each and every former policy procedure,rule regulation,and resolution put into effect prior to january.because this doc
