a licensed contractor was cited for six violations of state contractor law and ordered to pay civil penalties and compensation to the injured homeowner.he challenged the citation,which was upheld by the registrar of contractors after an administrative hearing at which the violations were found true by a preponderance of the evidence.the contractor argues the standard of proof should have been clear and convincing evidence.we conclude the agency applied the correct standard of proof.we also reject the contractor contention that he was improperly convicted of criminal misdemeanors through an administrative proceeding,and his argument that the administrative hearing was procedurally flawed because no accusatory pleading was filed.
background 
the following facts are taken from the administrative law judge findings,which are not disputed for purposes of this appeal.on june,timothy owen verbally agreed to replace windows,install a sliding glass door,and replace the front door in a kensington home for.he performed the work in july and august,even though his contractor license was not issued until september.the homeowner asked other contractors to review the quality of owen work,and it was found deficient.when the homeowner confronted owen on the matter,he became angry,demanded more money,and ultimately abandoned the project.the homeowner hired another contractor to correct and complete the work at a cost of.
the registrar of contractors registrar issued a citation to owen alleging six violations of the business and professions code engaging in the business of contractor without a license willfully and materially departing from trade standards of good workmanship failing to correct or complete a project for the stated contract price,causing the owner to secure the services of another contractor failing to include required provisions in the contract willfully or fraudulently acting in a manner that substantially injured another and falsely claiming a workers compensation insurance exemption,subd.b.the citation imposed civil penalties totaling and an order of correction requiring owen to pay the homeowner.
owen contested the citation and a hearing was held before an administrative law judge alj of the contractors state license board.before the hearing commenced,owen argued that the standard of proof at the hearing should be clear and convincing evidence,but the alj ruled the applicable standard of proof was preponderance of the evidence.following four days of testimony,the alj found each of the alleged violations to be true,and increased the civil penalties to after finding owen conduct was deceitful,grave and egregious.the registrar adopted the alj proposed decision in september and his decision became final in october.
in november,owen filed a petition for administrative mandamus asking the court to set aside the decision on the ground that the alj applied the wrong standard of proof.code civ.after briefing,the trial court ruled that the preponderance of the evidence was the correct standard of proof and denied the petition.
discussion 
owen argues the alj applied the wrong standard of proof,that the alj improperly convicted him of misdemeanors without criminal jurisdiction,and that the hearing was procedurally flawed because it was not initiated with a formal accusatory pleading.because only legal issues are raised on appeal,our standard of review is de novo.steinsmith medical board th,d steinsmith.
standard of proof at the alj hearing 
owen argues the standard of proof required in all professional or vocational license disciplinary proceedings is clear and convincing proof to a reasonable certainty.we conclude the preponderance standard was appropriate in the citation proceeding because the only potential sanctions were orders of correction and civil penalties.
owen relies on a line of cases holding that the clear and convincing evidence standard of proof applies in proceedings to restrict,suspend or revoke professional or vocational licenses.in the lead case of ettinger board of medical quality assurance,the court held that the proper standard of proof in an administrative hearing to revoke or suspend a doctor license should be clear and convincing proof to a reasonable certainty and not a mere preponderance of the evidence.ettinger board of medical quality assurance d.ettinger.ettinger in turn relied on cases holding that this heightened standard of proof applies in proceedings to disbar an attorney or to suspend or revoke a real estate license.id.at,citing furman state bar cal d,furman small smith d.small realty projects,smith d.realty projects see also kapelus state bar cal d,fn,kapelus san benito foods veneman th,d heightened standard of proof not required in proceeding to revoke nonprofessional food processing license mann department of motor vehicles th,d same with respect to vehicle salesperson license.although owen does not cite any case that holds the clear and convincing evidence standard of proof applies in a licensed contractor disciplinary proceeding,the registrar does not dispute that the higher standard would apply in a proceeding seeking suspension,or revocation of a contractor license.see viking pools,maloney cal d,noting that alj applied clear and convincing evidence standard in licensed contractor disciplinary hearing without addressing whether the higher standard was required.
the question before us is whether the clear and convincing evidence standard also applies in a citation proceeding where the only proposed sanctions are a civil penalty or an order of correction,and which does not involve restriction,suspension,or revocation of a contractor license.in the licensed contractor context,the registrar generally has the power to cite,temporarily suspend,or permanently revoke any license or registration if the licensee is guilty of or commits any one or more of the acts or omissions constituting causes for disciplinary action.see also.a subset of statutes,however,provides for citation proceedings with more limited remedies.if,upon investigation,the registrar has probable cause to believe that a licensee has committed any acts or omissions which are grounds for denial,revocation,or suspension of license,he or she may,in lieu of proceeding pursuant to this article,issue a citation to the licensee each citation may contain an order of correction fixing a reasonable time for correction of the violation or an order for payment of a specified sum to an injured party in lieu of correction,and may contain an assessment of a civil penalty,italics added.if the licensee appeals a citation,the registrar must afford an opportunity for a hearing and thereafter issue a decision,based on findings of fact,affirming,modifying,or vacating the citation or penalty,or directing other appropriate relief.suspension or revocation of a license can not be ordered unless certain procedural prerequisites,such as the filing of an accusation,are satisfied.see.those procedures were not invoked here.
neither party has cited,and we have not found,any case law that directly addresses the appropriate standard of proof in a citation proceeding such as that described in section et.therefore,we look to the principles underlying the ettinger line of cases for guidance on the issue.
in hughes board of architectural examiners,the supreme court linked the ettinger cases to procedural due process principles hughes board of architectural examiners cal th,d.w e often have recognized that an individual,having obtained the license required to engage in a particular profession or vocation,has a fundamental vested right to continue in that activity.citations.a licensee,having obtained such a fundamental vested right,is entitled to certain procedural protections greater than those accorded an applicant.for example,this court repeatedly has held,with exceptions not pertinent here,that the independent judgment standard of review must be applied in the trial court to an administrative decision that substantially affects such a fundamental vested right.citations.id.at,d.similarly,it has been held that procedural due process of law requires a regulatory board or agency to prov
