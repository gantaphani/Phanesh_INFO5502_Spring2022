appellants hallmark developers,and charles garrison collectively,hallmark appeal from the summary judgment in favor of appellee fulton county,georgia the county on their intentional discrimination claim based on the fair housing act,et fha and the judgment entered following a bench trial on the merits on their discriminatory impact claim based on the fha.
the district court concluded that hallmark had failed to adduce evidence that the county had intentionally discriminated on the basis of race when it refused to a parcel of property in order for hallmark to build,inter alia,homes affordable to households with low and moderate incomes.the district court also concluded that hallmark failed to demonstrate that the decision had a significant disparate impact on minorities.hallmark argues that the district court failed to consider relevant evidence of discriminatory intent was clearly in error in its finding regarding disparate impact and considered expert testimony that should have been excluded under rule of the federal rules of evidence.
for many years,chris doughtie,president of hallmark,received literature and invitations to attend business functions in south fulton county,georgia.this literature identified south fulton county as a development target and advised developers of the incentives to encourage development in the corridor.
accordingly,hallmark and appellant charles garrison acquired property in south fulton county the property with the express intention of developing it for a mixture of uses,including commercial,office,and residential.specifically,they hoped to construct a large development consisting of apartments,townhomes homes,and office space.the townhomes and homes would be built under the control of hallmark.the apartments would be built by a contractor subject to conditions imposed by hallmark.hallmark intended that a large percentage of the homes would be affordable,as defined by the department of housing and urban development hud the property would have to be from agricultural to mix mixed use in order for this development to take place.
in early,doughtie arranged for a visit to chestnut lake,a,subdivision that hallmark had developed in dekalb county,georgia.among others,he invited fulton county commissioner william edwards,fulton county assistant director of comprehensive planning beth mcmillan,and fulton county economic development director joseph johnson.the purpose of the visit was to acquaint these county officials with the sort of development hallmark intended to make on the property.
chestnut lake contains lots.the homes initially were priced in the range of to,but after changes were made,the price range was from approximately to.the homes were built by mayfield homes,which is owned in part by doughtie and his son.doughtie told the county officials that mayfield homes would build the homes on the property as well,and that the homes on the property would be similar in appearance and layout to those at chestnut lake.
during this visit,none of the county officials expressed any concern regarding the quality of the chestnut lake development commissioner edwards,however,cautioned doughtie to involve south fulton community associations in the process to get the community happy.among the community groups commissioner edwards listed were the south fulton parkway alliance,the cliffondale community association,and green south fulton the community groups.
on october,hallmark filed an application with the fulton county department of environment and community development seeking to the property.kathryn zickert appeared before the board of commissioners the board on behalf of hallmark at a public hearing on february.the board granted a deferral to allow hallmark to engage in discussions with the community groups regarding the proposed development.
on april,zickert appeared before the board on behalf of hallmark a second time.after the public hearing,commissioner edwards who is commissioner of the district where the property is located moved to deny hallmark application based on the quality of what he seen and things he heard.chairman mike kenn supported commissioner edwards motion.he stated that the development was probably one of the,laid out subdivisions he ever seen.another commissioner made a substitute motion for an additional deferral,and the board granted the deferral so that hallmark could continue to discuss unresolved issues with the community groups.
on june,zickert appeared before the board on behalf of hallmark a third and final time.commissioner edwards moved to deny the application due to the lack of improvement in terms of the quality of the site plan and the site plan design.hallmark application was denied.
while hallmark application for was pending,doughtie,his colleagues,and his attorneys met with the community groups as suggested by commissioner edwards.during the meetings,community group members expressed opposition to the proposed development on the property.three community leaders,abby jordan,dave robinson,and larry hyde stated that they opposed the proposed development because it was likely to attract blacks and families with children to the area.another community activist,bruce moody,stated that he did not want poor black people moving into,lower priced homes in south fulton county.
on january,at a meeting with a community group,hallmark counsel heard commissioner edwards say to jordan,i know a lot of your objections to projects like hallmark proposed development,is a black issue.the community groups also objected to the quality of the proposed homes,made demands which drove up the prices of homes,and did not want apartments in anything but luxury form.hallmark agreed to many of the changes in the quality of the development that the community groups suggested.
hallmark did not produce evidence that any racist remarks were made at the hearings in front of the board.although hallmark contends that subtle remarks were made by no fewer than three activists to the board at the second hearing on april,hallmark does not state exactly what the remarks were the county points out that one member of the community stated 
what i saying is that we have no choices that are over,with reference to the price of the homes.and what i trying to get at is if we just keep building houses that are all under,we will never raise the bar in south fulton.we will never bring in the kind of development that i thought this commission envisioned.
the same community member later referred to the apartment challenge and the transient part of that.commissioner emma darnell responded 
that a bad argument to bring to me.let the approach have something to do with some objective measurement of the quality of life.talk to me about environment.talk to me about traffic.let not bring our personal aesthetic prejudices and biases to the table this county commission is not going to close its doors to ordinary working people who also want to live and have nice houses.
commissioner nancy boxill stated i do want to participate in a zoning process that starts to say what kind of person gets to live where.commissioner edwards stated 
let me just add,too,because i want to thank both my colleagues for bringing out a very good point and a sensitive point because you understand my motion to deny the application has nothing to do with price but we do talk about price and a lot of times i think we should change that to quality and other things.and that was the basis of my denial.
another community member said something about keeping south fulton parkway pristine.commissioner boxill stated that the community members were describing a redlining practice.
the county planning staff,community zoning board,the atlanta regional commission,and the georgia regional transportation authority reviewed and repeatedly recommended approval for hallmark zoning application.nevertheless,commissioner edwards voted to deny the.he was apparently influenced by the opposition of the community groups in this decision.he stated in his deposition that ninety percent of the zonings that happen in south fulton county are done real simple between the community and the developer.zoning applications opposed by such community groups are usually not approved.actual voting records confirm that in of instances,commissioner edwards vote reflected the community position.typically,other commissioners show district courtesy to each other.if a proposed project is located within one commissioner district,the other commissioners defer to that commissioner wishes.
following the denial of its application,hallmark filed a complaint under the fha,contending that the county discriminated on the basis of race in denying its application.hallmark alleged that in giving effect to the racist views of the community groups,the county acted with intent to discriminate.it also alleged that the denial of the worked a disparate impact on,who were more likely to be the purchasers of the homes and renters of the apartments and townhomes on the property.the district court granted summary judgment in favor of the county with regard to the intentional discrimination claim.it concluded that there was no evidence that the county was aware of the racist views of the community members.it denied the motion for summary judgment with regard to the disparate impact claim.
at trial,hallmark produced an expert witness,bradford,who testified that the decision had a disparate impact on minorities.specifically,he testified that the elimination of either for sale or rental housing in the lower cost ranges of the proposal for the hallmark development would disproportionately and adversely affect minority households as compared to white households.he calculated disparity ratios based on an assumption that persons who owned homes or rented apartments in certain value ranges in particular geographical areas were representative of those who would have purchased or rented homes on the property.using data from the united states census,bradford examined the race of each homeowner or renter,the individual estimate of the value of his or her home or the amount of rent,and the address of the residence.he examined this data in five geographical areas,of increasing size,that surround the property the area within a radius of the property the area within a radius of the property the area within a radius of the property the radius from central atlanta and the counties surrounding atlanta.he opined that the radius from central atlanta and the area would be the most reliable indicator of the race of the likely owners or renters on the property.
based on the disparity ratios he calculated,bradford concluded that there would be a statistically significant disparate racial impact arising from the denial of the due to the elimination of homes priced below and rental housing costing less than per month.
the county produced an expert who testified that there is an oversupply of housing within the price ranges bradford testified were relevant to the disparate impact on minorities.camilla johnson moore,director of the fulton county office of housing testified that at the time hallmark application was denied,there was adequate housing for low and moderate income residents.she testified there was an oversaturation.the district court credited this testimony.it concluded because other housing was available within the price ranges that would allegedly produce the disparate impact,there was no appreciable impact on minorities caused by the lack of the particular development hallmark wished to construct.
the district court also concluded that the impact to which bradford testified was not significant.in terms of pure percentages as opposed to disparity ratios,black home purchasers and renters occupied only a slightly larger percentage of the market than caucasians in the relevant price ranges.
finally,the district court concluded that bradford testimony was inherently speculative.his calculations related to an estimated,hypothetical group of individuals additionally,the district court found that there was no guarantee that any of the homes or apartments,if built,would be priced as hallmark intended.in the chestnut lake development,the homes sold for a higher price than originally intended.the apartments were not to be built by hallmark,but by a contractor.because bradford opinion regarding disparate impact was based on a specific price range,any potential changes in the prices at which the homes actually sold or the apartments actually rented would affect the validity of bradford opinion.
having concluded that bradford testimony failed to establish a prima facie case of disparate impact,the district court entered judgment in favor of the county.hallmark has timely appealed.
hallmark argues that the district court erred in entering summary judgment on its claim of intentional discrimination.the district court entry of summary judgment is reviewed de novo.summary judgment is appropriate only if there is no genuine issue of material fact and the moving party is entitled to judgment as a matter of law.lippert cmty.bank,cir.

to prove that a zoning decision was based on intentional discrimination,a plaintiff must establish that race played some role in the decision.sofarelli pinellas county,cir.
because explicit statements of racially discriminatory motivation are decreasing,circumstantial evidence must often be used to establish the requisite intent.among the factors that are instructive in determining whether racially discriminatory intent is present are discriminatory or segregative effect,historical background,the sequence of events leading up to the challenged actions,and whether there were any departures from normal or substantive criteria.

hallmark produced evidence that the county acted for the sole purpose of effectuating the desires of the community groups and that commissioner edwards felt pressured by the groups.he encouraged hallmark to meet with the groups,and he met with the groups.commissioner edwards testified that he typically votes in a manner consistent with the desires of the community groups.hallmark also demonstrated that some members of the community groups were motivated by racial considerations.hallmark evidence showed that during its own meetings with the community groups,racist remarks were made.
however,hallmark failed to establish that members of the body were aware of the motivations of the private citizens.yonkers,at.although hallmark contends that commissioner edwards told a community leader,i know a lot of your objection to projects like hallmark proposed development,is a black issue,this is not sufficient to raise a triable issue of fact.this statement does not demonstrate that the other members of
