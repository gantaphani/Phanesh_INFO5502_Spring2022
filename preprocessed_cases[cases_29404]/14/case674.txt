factual and procedural background 
the proposed project and proceedings before the city 
darla jones owns an undeveloped parcel of land on mount holyoke avenue in the pacific palisades area of los angeles.darla jones and her late husband,stanley jones,formed mhh for the purpose of developing the property schelbert owns a home across the street from the property.
mhh filed an application with the city for approval of a preliminary parcel map and a coastal development permit for a proposed subdivision on the property in september.after review of grading reports and a public hearing,the city deputy advisory agency conditionally approved the parcel map and coastal development permit.a group of neighboring property owners appealed that approval to city board of zoning appeals,which disapproved the parcel map and coastal development permit.mhh appeal to the los angeles city council was denied.mhh and the joneses filed a superior court action challenging the city disapproval.on december,the court issued a peremptory writ of mandate commanding the government respondents to set aside their decision and to reconsider the matter.
the city council referred the matter to its planning and land use management committee in january.after schelbert and others raised concerns regarding the impact of the proposed plan on views,mhh agreed to reduce the number of lots from four to three and to accept conditions of approval providing greater setbacks and view corridors between future homes.mhh submitted a revised subdivision plan to the city,but the city building department staff raised new concerns regarding soils and geology reports that previously had been approved.for the next four years additional reports were prepared,reviewed and finally approved by the building department on july.on march,the city planning and land use management committee recommended approval of the parcel map and coastal development permit for the subdivision.the city approved the revised proposal on april.
the appeal to the commission and substantial issue determination 
on june,schelbert appealed the city approval to the commission,which had jurisdiction because the property is located within the coastal zone.in a notification of appeal dated june,the commission advised the city appeal had been filed and stated the matter had been tentatively set for a hearing during the commission meeting on july to july.the notice directed the city to provide the commission with copies of all relevant documents and materials used in considering the proposed development within five working days and stated a commission staff report and notice of the hearing will be forwarded to you prior to the hearing.the notice stated on the bottom cc to,among others,the joneses and counsel for mhh.in a public hearing notice dated june,the commission advised the hearing on the appeal had been scheduled for july.the notice identified the applicant as holyoke homes.et,attn stanley and darla jones.
at its july,meeting the commission opened and continued the public hearing on schelbert appeal because the city,for reasons unexplained in the record,had failed to provide any documents or materials to the commission.neither counsel for mhh nor any of its representatives attended the hearing.according to a declaration prepared by counsel for mhh,they had not been provided with a hearing notice or staff report prior to the meeting and were unaware a hearing on the appeal would take place at that meeting.
although the city had been,was obligated pursuant to commission regulations,tit,to provide the commission with all relevant documents the city council had considered in approving mhh proposed plan within five working days of receipt of the june,notification,it was mhh that arranged to have copies of the city council file made by a bonded and licensed copy service and transmitted to the commission on december.the file consisted of more than pages of documents,maps,reports,photographs and other materials.
on january,commission staff informed mhh the city council file did not appear to contain all the substantive material on which the city council had based its decision,including certain technical data.mhh agreed to arrange with the city planning department to have the entire coastal permit file and parcel map file copied and sent to the commission.on march,the files were transmitted to the commission,and in the transmittal letter mhh stated it was in the process of obtaining signatures on a stipulation among the city,mhh and schelbert that the coastal commission has now been provided with all relevant documents and materials used by the city in its consideration of the subject coastal permit application.on april,mhh provided the commission with the fully executed stipulation.
on april,the commission issued a letter stating a hearing was tentatively scheduled in the matter during the commission may to may,meeting.on may,mhh submitted to the commission an letter with supporting documentation arguing the appeal did not present a substantial issue warranting a hearing as provided by public resources code section,subdivision b,commission shall hear an appeal unless it determines no statutorily defined substantial issue exists on may,the commission determined the appeal raised substantial issues regarding visual impacts,geologic hazards and potential land form alteration and advised the matter would be reviewed de novo at a later date.
the commission denial of the parcel map and coastal development permit 
from august through april mhh provided additional information to the commission in response to several requests by the commission and its staff.approximately months elapsed between one of the requests and mhh response,which included foundation plans and a letter clarifying a seismic analysis.by public hearing notice dated may,the commission advised the hearing on mhh proposed development would be on june.in a letter dated june,a consultant for mhh argued the commission should approve the subdivision without imposing the commission staff recommended special conditions.the consultant also argued,for the first time,the commission had failed almost three years earlier to timely hold the hearing at which it was determined the appeal presented a substantial issue the commission neither set nor held the hearing required by a within the required days and obtained no waiver of said time frame from our client or its representative.our client therefore reserves its legal rights relating to the timely hearing provided by the coastal act.
at the june,hearing the commission denied mhh proposed subdivision,contrary to staff recommendation the project be approved with conditions imposed to address the geologic hazards and visual impacts of the project.although mhh counsel and consultant testified at the hearing,they did not argue the commission had failed to timely determine schelbert appeal presented a substantial issue.
in a letter dated july,mhh requested the commission reconsider its disapproval on the ground,among others,the commission had lost jurisdiction of the matter by failing to decide whether the appeal presented a substantial issue by august,days from the date schelbert filed her appeal.mhh alternatively contended,even if the period were measured from the date the commission received all relevant documents,contrary to the express language of section,subdivision a,the commission still had failed to make the substantial issue determination by january,days from the date mhh provided the city council file to the commission.in its letter mhh noted the court of appeal had recently ruled in encinitas country day school,california coastal commission th,d encinitas the commission practice of opening and continuing a hearing within the did not comply with section.on september,however,mhh request ed that the matter be continued for an indefinite period of time in order to facilitate discussion and consideration of alternatives.
the petition for writ of mandate and complaint 
mhh and the joneses filed a verified petition for writ of mandate and complaint for declaratory relief and inverse condemnation against the commission,naming schelbert as real party in interest,on july.the petition and complaint requested a writ of administrative mandamus on the ground,among others,the commission lacked jurisdiction to disapprove the project because it had failed to hear schelbert appeal in a timely manner.
in may mhh,the joneses and the commission entered into a tentative settlement,which provided the decision disapproving mhh proposed subdivision would be vacated and the commission would hold a new hearing on an alternative site plan with a larger view corridor.if the commission approved the alternative site plan,mhh and the jones agreed to dismiss their action with prejudice.the settlement agreement was presented to the superior court as a stipulation and proposed order vacating the commission june,decision and remanding to the commission for a new public hearing,which the superior court signed.
at a status conference held soon after the stipulation was signed by the court,schelbert explained she had not been a party to the settlement negotiations or the stipulation and objected to setting aside the commission decision.the court acknowledged it had not noticed schelbert had not agreed to or signed the stipulation and withdrew its approval.the court then deemed the stipulation a joint motion by mhh,the joneses and the commission to approve the settlement and remand to the commission and gave the parties an opportunity to submit additional briefing.after further proceedings,the court ordered the matter remanded to the commission for a new public hearing,but entered judgment dismissing mhh and the joneses petition over their objections.on appeal,this court reversed the superior court decision,holding the court abused its discretion by dismissing mhh and the joneses lawsuit over their objection holyoke homes california coastal commission,wl nonpub.opn.
once mhh and the joneses petition was reinstated,the superior court ordered the parties to file briefs and thereafter heard oral argument.on november,the court issued a peremptory writ of mandate ordering the commission to set aside its disapproval of mhh parcel map and coastal development permit and to dismiss schelbert appeal on the ground the commission had lost jurisdiction because it failed to determine the appeal presented a substantial issue within the period mandated by statute here,petitioners sic filed the appeal on june,and the commission did what it had habitually done previous to opened the public hearing within the limit,and then continued it.the commission did not make its substantial issue determination until almost one year later,on may,and almost months after mhh had provided six large folders of city approved documents to it.pursuant to the rule articulated by the court in encinitas,the commission lost jurisdiction of the matter,and pursuant to public resources code section,petitioners original coastal development permit application,granted by the city,became final.the court rejected the commission and schelbert argument mhh had waived the rule by waiting until june,to raise the issue and complying with the commission repeated requests for additional documents.
contentions 
the commission schelbert contend,among other arguments,the rule in section was not triggered until the commission received all relevant documents used by the city in making its decision to approve the coastal development permit and the commission acted within days of receipt of the stipulation transmitted on april,assuring the commission it had received all such relevant documents the superior court finding mhh had not waived the time limit was not supported by substantial evidence mhh failed to exhaust its administrative remedies and mhh should be estopped from asserting the commission lacked jurisdiction.
discussion 
the time limit and encinitas 
in encinitas,supra,th at pages,d the city of encinitas had approved encinitas country day school,proposal to build a elementary school.multiple appeals of the approval were received by the commission on december.on december,commission staff issued a staff report stating a hearing was required to be set within days of the date of appeal but recommending the commission open and continue the matter at its january meeting because it had not yet received all relevant documents from the city.the commission followed staff recommendation and continued the matter to its february meeting.id.at,d.at its february,meeting,held days after the appeals were filed,the commission,again in accordance with staff recommendation,found the appeals presented a substantial issue and denied approval of the project.id.at,d.
encinitas country day school filed a first amended petition for writ of mandate and complaint in june.the superior court granted the writ of mandate and ordered the commission denial be set aside and city approval of the coastal development permit be final on the ground the commission had failed to rule within the jurisdictional period.encinitas,supra,th at,d.
the fourth district court of appeal affirmed the superior court decision,explaining the commission had erroneously interpreted its decision in coronado yacht club california coastal com.th,d coronado yacht club to permit the commission to satisfy the rule by merely opening and continuing the hearing within days of the appeals being filed not only did the coronado yacht club case not so hold,the case is also clearly distinguishable.in coronado yacht club the issue was whether the commission complied with the rule when the commission during the period decided whether the appeal raised a substantial issue and therefore should be heard see,subd.b but continued the hearing on the merits of the appeal to a date beyond the period.we found reasonable the commission interpretation of the statute requirement that a hearing be set to mean to be held within days of the filing of the appeal,rather than merely being scheduled.citation.m indful that the statutory scheme provides for but one public hearing on an appeal,we held that the commission administrative construction is reasonable,that it need only to open the hearing and if three commissioners desire a debate on the question of substantial issue,it need only resolve the matter of its jurisdiction and then continue the matter in a timely fashion that will guarantee its timely action on the appeal consistent with the implied legislative intent to avoid bureaucratic delay.encinitas,supra,th at,d.
encinitas did not change the law.the court merely held the commission must comply with the law as enunciated in coronado yacht club.encinitas,supra,th at,d i n coronado yacht club we specifically observed that a procedure like the one used here would be inconsistent with the legislature intent moreover,neither encinitas nor coronado addressed the issue presented in this appeal whether,notwithstanding the clear language in section that a hearing on an appeal shall be set no later than days after the date on which the application or appeal is filed with the commission,the triggering date is extended if the commission has not received all relevant documents from the local agency within five working days of requesting them.italics added.although the commission had asserted this argument in encinitas,the court did not reach it because it held the commission had received all relevant documents within the applicable time period.encinitas,at,d.we also need not decide this issue because we hold mhh is estopped from contesting the commission jurisdiction.our extended discussion of encinitas is relevant to that conclusion.
mhh is estopped to contest the commission jurisdiction
