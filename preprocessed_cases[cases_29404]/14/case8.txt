in this case,a group of employers associations and employers employers seek relief from a broad category of enforcement actions that may be brought under the massachusetts earned sick time law estl.laws ch.specifically,the employers contend that the estl is preempted by section of the relations act,a,with respect to those employers in the state who are parties to collective bargaining agreements cbas with unions.on that basis,the employers seek a judgment prohibiting the massachusetts attorney general from g ranting private rights of action to employees who are members of collective bargaining units and e nforcing civil sanctions pursuant to the estl against employers who are signatory sic to collective bargaining agreements.
the district court dismissed the suit for failure to state a claim insofar as it constituted a facial,challenge to the estl,and for want of jurisdiction on ripeness grounds insofar as it represented an challenge to particularized,future actions to enforce the measure.due to the inquiry that we must undertake in order to determine section preemptive effect,however,we conclude that the employers unusual request for sweeping relief is not ripe for adjudication no matter how it is best characterized along the spectrum.for that reason,we dismiss the suit for want of jurisdiction.
we start by describing the contours of both the massachusetts estl and federal preemption under section.we then will be better able to describe the basis for this suit and the district court reasons for dismissing it.
in,voters in massachusetts overwhelmingly approved the estl through the initiative process.the estl broke new ground in massachusetts by providing that employers of a certain size must compensate their employees for the sick time that they use for specified purposes.laws ch,a d.
to ensure compliance with the estl,the law provides that the attorney general shall enforce the law and may obtain injunctive or declaratory relief for this purpose.id.at l.that same subsection of the estl further provides that v iolation of the estl shall be subject to various provisions of massachusetts law that,among other things,permit the imposition of civil penalties.see also id.at.
in addition to providing for enforcement by the attorney general,the estl also authorizes an aggrieved employee to bring actions under the estl,provided that such an employee first files the complaint with the attorney general to notify her of the impending suit.id.at l.after filing the complaint with the attorney general,the aggrieved employee must wait ninety days to bring the suit unless the attorney general permits the employee to file the suit before the period has run.id.
finally,the estl authorizes the attorney general to promulgate regulations to carry out the purpose and provisions of the law.id.at n.the attorney general exercised that authority on july,by promulgating regulations that defined certain terms in the estl,some of which the employers point to in pressing their challenge.specifically,the estl provides that covered employers must compensate their employees for such paid sick time at the same hourly rate as the employee would have been paid had the employee not taken leave.laws ch,a.the regulations promulgated by the attorney general define the same hourly rate to mean the employee regular hourly rate for employees paid a uniform hourly rate.for employees who receive different pay rates for hourly work from the same employer,the regulations permit an employer to use a blended rate,determined by taking the weighted average of all regular rates of pay over the previous pay period.id.
section of the national labor relations act long the estl.it was enacted in,and it provides suits for violation of contracts between an employer and a labor organization representing employees may be brought in any district court of the united states having jurisdiction of the parties,without respect to the amount in controversy or without regard to the citizenship of the parties.a.
notwithstanding its phrasing,section is more than jurisdictional it authorizes federal courts to fashion a body of federal law for the enforcement of cbas.textile workers union lincoln mills of.moreover,soon after lincoln mills,the supreme court in local,teamsters lucas flour,explained that,in light of the congressional command in section to fashion a body of federal law for the enforcement of cbas,state courts were not free to apply individualized local rules when called upon to enforce such agreements.rather,in enacting,congress intended doctrines of federal labor law uniformly to prevail over inconsistent state rules.id.at.
the result is that section preempts suits alleging cba violations.lueck.there is no shortage of complexities concerning precisely what consequences flow from section preemption,but we need not delve into all of them here.for present purposes,it suffices to say that,by virtue of section preemptive effect,a claim for breach of a cba often must be dismissed so that the claim may be arbitrated in accord with an agreement to arbitrate such a breach that the governing cba contains.see,id.at see also lucas flour,at holding that the cba in that case expressly imposed upon both parties the duty of submitting the dispute in question to final and binding arbitration.as the court has explained,t he need to preserve the effectiveness of arbitration was one of the central reasons that underlay the court preemption holding in lucas flour.lueck,at.
the court has also made clear,however,that t he requirements of as understood in lucas flour can not vary with the name appended to a particular cause of action.id.at.thus,in lueck,a claim styled as a tort claim for breach of a obligation under a contract was held preempted under section and thus dismissed because the right the plaintiff asserted was fundamentally rooted in the cba,which had provided that a dispute over the employer compliance with the predicate right under the cba was subject to arbitration.id.at noting that a rule that permitted an individual to sidestep available grievance procedures would eviscerate a central tenet of federal labor contract law the primacy of the arbitrator in cba interpretation.in this way,too,section preemption ensures that interpretation of cbas remains firmly in the arbitral realm.lingle norge div.of magic chef.
there are limits,though,to section preemptive reach.the court has explained that it would be inconsistent with congressional intent under section to preempt state rules that establish rights and obligations,independent of a labor contract.lueck,at.that is because section says nothing about the substantive rights a state may provide to workers when adjudication of those rights does not depend upon the interpretation of such agreements.lingle,at.accordingly,the bare fact that a cba will be consulted in the course of litigation pursuant to a cause of action that confers a right independently of the cba is not sufficient,in consequence of section preemption,to require the dismissal of the cause of action.livadas bradshaw,see also lueck,at n ot every dispute tangentially involving a provision of a cba is preempted by.for example,when liability is governed by independent state law,the mere need to look to the cba for damages computation is no reason to hold the claim defeated by.livadas,at internal citation omitted 
it is against this legal background that the employers filed this suit in the district court for the district of massachusetts in.the employers did so before any action to enforce the estl had been filed against any employer who is a party to a cba by either the attorney general or by any aggrieved employee.but the employers contend in the currently operative complaint,which is styled as amended petition for declaratory relief ii,that section preemption nonetheless entitles them to sweeping relief from the estl eventual enforcement.
specifically,in that complaint,the employers seek a judgment declaring that the estl is preempted with respect to employers who are signatory sic to collective bargaining agreements.second,the employers seek a judgment prohibiting the attorney general from granting private rights of action to employees who are members of collective bargaining units and enforcing civil sanctions pursuant to the estl against employers who are signatory sic to collective bargaining agreements.
in support of the contention that section preemption entitles the employers to the relief they seek,the complaint alleges the following facts.first,the complaint asserts that the employers and the members of the employers associations that bring this action are parties to cbas.next,the complaint alleges that a ny and all state law claims brought under the estl would require a determination of the hourly rate of a worker covered by a cba,which would necessitate an analysis and interpretation of the terms of the cbas made between the parties in a labor contract.and,finally,quoting subsection j of the estl.laws ch,j,the complaint asserts that the estl further necessitates an analysis and interpretation of the terms of the cbas made between the parties in a labor contract to determine whether the estl diminishes or impairs the obligations of an employer to comply with any contract,cba,or any employment benefit program or plan that provides to employees greater earned sick time rights than the estl.
the attorney general responded to the employers suit in the district court by moving to dismiss under both federal rules of civil procedure b and b.the district court ruled as follows.
construing the complaint as a facial preemption challenge against the estl,the district court first concluded that the employers would not be able to show that all claims to benefits under the estl for all unionized workers in the state would depend on cba interpretation.labor relations div.healey,civil action,wl,at.july,emphasis omitted.the district court reasoned that many conceivable estl claims brought against employers who are parties to a cba would not so depend on cba interpretation claims,for instance,involving workers earning a uniform hourly wage,or claims not involving a wage dispute at all,such as retaliation.id.thus,the district court held,the employers challenge failed the familiar test laid out in united states salerno,which requires plaintiffs bringing a facial challenge to a statute to show that there are no set of circumstances under which that statute would be valid.id.as a result,the district court dismissed what it characterized as the employers facial challenge under rule b.
the district court then considered the employers challenge to the estl as an challenge to only those enforcement actions whether brought by the attorney general or by employees that would involve cba interpretation.id.at.the district court held,however,that,so understood,the complaint was not ripe for adjudication because,at the time the complaint was filed,the purported application of the estl to the employers ha d been at best hypothetical.id.at.the district court emphasized that no employee had,to that point,brought a claim for paid sick time under the estl.id.neither,the district court observed,ha d the attorney general.id.on this basis,the district court concluded that the employers challenge did not present a justiciable case or controversy under the article iii,and therefore the district court dismissed the case under rule b for lack of subject matter jurisdiction.id.
the employers now appeal.
although the attorney general does not dispute that the suit,if understood to be a facial challenge to the estl,is ripe for adjudication,we are obliged to determine ripeness for ourselves.see city of fall river ferc,cir.noting that the question of ripeness may be considered on a court own motion internal quotation marks and citation omitted.and,after doing so,we hold,as the united states contends as amicus,that this case,even if characterized as a facial challenge,is not ripe and thus must be dismissed for lack of jurisdiction 
the basic rationale of the ripeness inquiry is to prevent the courts,through avoidance of premature adjudication,from entangling themselves in abstract disagreements in violation of article iii case or controversy requirement.roman catholic bishop of springfield city of springfield,cir.quoting abbott labs.gardner.as the supreme court has put it,the question in each case is whether the facts alleged,under all the circumstances,show that there is a substantial controversy,between parties having adverse legal interests,of sufficient immediacy and reality to warrant the issuance of a declaratory judgment.medimmune,genentech,quoting.cas.pac.coal oil.
in line with these principles,a claim is ripe only if the party bringing suit can show both that the issues raised are fit for judicial decision at the time the suit is filed and that the party bringing suit will suffer hardship if court consideration is withheld.me.med,cir.quoting abbott,at.in considering the fitness prong of the ripeness inquiry,we have emphasized that a claim is not ripe for adjudication if it rests upon contingent future events that may not occur as anticipated,or indeed may not occur at all.city of fall river,at quoting texas united states.in a similar vein,we have explained that t he conditional nature of the claims strongly counsels against a finding of hardship,at.
the burden to prove ripeness is on the party seeking jurisdiction.see nulankeyutmonen nkihtaqmikon impson,cir.the pleading standard for satisfying the factual predicates for proving jurisdiction is the same as applies under rule b that is,the plaintiffs must state a claim to relief that is plausible on its face.see power,cir.silha act,cir.collecting cases from other circuits.in evaluating such claims,we must separate out factual assertions from legal conclusions.as the court instructed in ashcroft iqbal,the tenet that a court must accept as true all of the allegations contained in a complaint is inapplicable to legal conclusions.threadbare recitals of the elements of a cause of action,supported by mere conclusory statements,do not suffice.our review for ripeness is de novo.riva massachusetts,cir.a trial court determination on a paper record that the case before it lacks ripeness presents a question of law subject to plenary review.
we start by considering whether the employers request for relief against the attorney general is fit for judicial resolution.in contending that it is,the employers acknowledge that they seek relief from estl actions that have not yet been brought.but,they contend,section preemption would block any such suit therefore,the employers contend that there is no reason to wait to provide them the relief they seek because,even at this early stage,the case is sufficiently developed to be adjudicated.we do not agree 
unlike a typical claim of field preemption,a claim of preemption under section that is lodged against a suit to enforce a cause of action,such as one granted by a measure like the estl,does not involve purely legal questions,where the matter can be resolved solely on the basis of the state and federal statutes at issue,shannon,cir.rather,section preemption can defeat a claim brought under the estl and thus support the employers request for relief in this case only if the specific claim that is brought is determined to depend upon the provisions of the cba.livadas,at.but,as this case comes to us,it is not sufficiently developed to be fit for such a preemption inquiry.
the seventh circuit analysis of ripeness in the quite similar challenge presented in shannon is instructive.at.there,the court considered an employer challenge to a state agency official possible enforcement of a state overtime law under the railway labor act,which has a preemption provision that operates in the same manner as does preemption under section.see shannon,at see also hawaiian airlines,norris.even in the somewhat more developed state of that case,however,the seventh circuit held that the claim was not fit for adjudication because the state agency investigation had not progressed to a point where it could be determined what dispute,if any,the parties would have over the cbas terms,shannon,at,as there are many scenarios where cbas may be implicated as part of a state or federal cause of action,but of the claim w
