the international union of operating engineers,local,filed three unfair labor practice charges against brandt construction company,alleging that the company changed,limited,and made more onerous its hiring practices and procedures with the purpose of making it more difficult for applicants with sentiments to apply or obtain employment refused to hire or consider hiring individuals with sentiments and maintained a policy of giving preference in hiring to referral applicants over or unknown applicants with the purpose or intended effect of making it more difficult for applicants with sentiments to be considered for employment.the general counsel of the national labor relations board issued complaints on the charges,and a consolidated hearing was held before an administrative law judge.the alj concluded that,although brandt had engaged in some unfair labor practices,the company had not refused to hire or consider hiring applicants on account of their union affiliation.a panel of the national labor relations board affirmed the alj decision,and the union filed a petition for review of the board order,which we deny.
brandt construction company brandt,a highway contractor located in milan,illinois,is engaged in the business of road construction bridge building concrete paving asphalt,sewer and water utility work and demolition work the company conducts its business within a radius of the quad city,illinois area and has been in existence for over forty years.since at least,brandt has followed a set hiring policy.under this policy,brandt gives preferential treatment to employment applications filed by current and former employees,as well as individuals referred by current supervisors or employees,over unknown or applicants.brandt also gives preferential treatment to applicants referred by equal employment opportunity service providers pursuant to a conciliation agreement that it entered into with the department of labor on march,dol agreement the company attempts to fill any open positions with these preferred applicants before it will even consider an application filed by an unknown or job applicant.brandt established,and has maintained,this preferential hiring policy as a means by which to better assess the caliber of prospective employees.
brandt preferential hiring policy allows referral candidates to apply with the company at any time without an appointment,but only permits unknown or applicants to submit employment applications when the company is hiring and even then only on mondays.the company instituted the mondays only rule also in for efficiency reasons and to dissuade individuals receiving unemployment compensation from coming into the office and submitting employment applications solely for the purpose of proving that they were attempting to obtain employment,in order to receive unemployment compensation.
on january,brandt placed a sign on its front office door indicating that it only accepted employment applications on mondays,replacing a similarly worded sign that had been used by the company since the.when brandt posted the mondays only sign it meant that the company was currently hiring.if the company was not distributing employment applications,the mondays only sign would be replaced by another sign advising we are not accepting applications.
in february,brandt amended its hiring policy to require all job applicants not hired within fourteen days of submitting an application to reapply if they were still interested in working for the company.brandt instituted the rule to ensure that terry brandt could immediately locate the applicant laborers,who,in the construction industry,are often needed on short notice.
in late february or early march,brandt memorialized its hiring policy in writing and posted it on the company employee bulletin boards.the policy stressed that the company only accepts employment applications on monday,and that applications would only be considered current for a period of two weeks after fourteen days the employment application expires and any individual interested in employment must complete a new application,if they are being accepted we do not accept employment applications when we are not hiring.the policy further provided that brandt rigorously follow s a procedure of preferring,in descending order,the following types of job applicants a current employees of the company b past employees with proven safety,attendance and work records c applicants recommended by supervisors d applicants recommended by current employees and e unknown,applicants.brandt posted the policy to promote the efficiency of its office staff,and to stay in compliance with the dol agreement.as in the past,brandt limitations on accepting,on mondays when the company is applied to unknown or applicants.
at all times relevant to this litigation,brandt accepted applications from current and former employees,individuals referred by current supervisors and employees,and equal employment opportunity service providers the company also received applications from unknown or applicants in,but none in.upon receiving an employment application,terry brandt,the company officer in charge of hiring,would place it in a file according to the trade classification for which he would hire that,operator,laborer,truck driver or flagger.when brandt needed to fill a position for the company,he would pull out the folder for that particular job classification and examine the applications then on file.in january and february,brandt received approximately twelve employment applications seven and five referrals but hired none of them.in march,the company received approximately applications,hiring two of the twelve referred candidates and none of the sixteen candidates.
on april,thursday,the international union of operating engineers,local,local or union at a regularly scheduled meeting,announced that brandt had recently been awarded a large job on interstate,and would,therefore,probably need to hire additional workers for the project.accordingly,local decided to send a number of its members to brandt office the next day to request and submit employment applications.before doing so,however,the union scheduled an early morning meeting to instruct participating members on how to fill out brandt employment application.the union instructed participating members to wear union hats or other insignia to brandt office,and to be polite throughout the application process.the union members were also instructed to indicate on their applications that local had referred them for the express purpose of organizing the company,and to note that they were applying for operator,laborer,truck driver,or flagger positions with open salary requirements.
on april,friday,a total of eleven applicants,all donning union insignia,went to brandt business office seeking to fill out job applications.the first group of five applicants arrived at brandt office at approximately.the individuals in this group claim that they did not see any signs posted on the front door or inside the office informing job applicants that the company only accepted employment applications on mondays.once they were inside the office,all five received,completed,and filed job applications with the company.an hour later,two more applicants arrived at brandt business office.both applicants observed the company mondays only sign prior to entering the office.after entering the office,the applicants requested and received job applications.the receptionist would not,however,allow them to submit their applications for consideration,advising them that the company only accepted applications on mondays.a third group of four applicants arrived at brandt office around.they also observed the mondays only sign before entering the office.upon entering the reception area,the applicants were met by a brandt employee who told them that they could not fill out employment applications because the company only distributed applications on mondays.
on april,monday,approximately fifteen applicants,all sporting union insignia,went to brandt business office to fill out job applications.this group of applicants included the union members who had been given applications by brandt the preceding friday april but were prohibited from turning them in,as well as the other applicants who,that same day,were not given applications at all.each of the individuals in this group observed the mondays only sign prior to entering brandt business office,and,once inside,were permitted to obtain,fill out,and submit employment applications.
on april,monday,a group of approximately sixteen applicants arrived at the brandt office wearing union insignia and seeking to fill out employment applications.before entering the office,however,the prospective applicants saw,in addition to the mondays only sign,a sign indicating that prospective applicants would be required to present photo identification in order to receive job applications.upon entering the office,the group was told by the company receptionist that such identification was mandatory.four of the sixteen applicants did not have photo identification,and therefore were not given applications to fill out.one of the applicants returned later that day with proper identification,and then received,completed,and filed an application with the company.
all of the aforementioned applicants indicated on their applications that local had referred them specifically for the purpose of organizing the company,and several of them also listed union business agents as personal references.after reviewing the employment history of these applicants,terry brandt categorized most of them as prospective candidates for an operator position.
in april,brandt also received,in addition to the applications filed by the applicants,applications from approximately referred applicants including five minority referrals,as well as twenty applicants from other candidates.of those applications,the company hired eight of the referred candidates,including three of the five minority referrals.a ninth hire,angela smith,was a applicant who listed union local as having referred her for employment.unlike other applicants,however,smith attended and completed a flagger training class held by the company and sponsored by the springfield urban league.
on may,brandt took down the mondays only sign and replaced it with a new sign advising prospective job applicants that the company is currently not distributing nor accepting employment applications,which meant that the company was not currently hiring.as previously noted,however,this limitation only applied to or unknown applicants,not to current employees,former employees,or applicants referred by eeo service providers.
on may,the applicants who had applied for employment with brandt the preceding month,as well as other applicants with no union affiliation,received letters from the company thanking them for their recent interest in employment,notifying them that their applications would remain on file for fourteen days,and advising them that if they wanted to be considered for employment after that time period they would need to file new applications.
on may,several of the applicants who had previously applied with brandt in april returned to the company business office seeking to fill out new employment applications.prior to entering the office,the applicants observed the sign indicating that the company was not currently distributing or accepting applications.nevertheless,the applicants went inside the office and requested new employment applications.the company declined to provide them,referring the applicants to the sign on the front of its office door.during the visit to brandt office,one of the union applicants observed a hispanic individual filling out an application.
on may,saturday,brandt held a mandatory meeting with its employees.at the meeting,irwin brown,a labor relations consultant,spoke to the assembled employees about labor relations,the pros and cons of unions,and showed a video about union organized employees.sometime thereafter,terry brandt informed the employees that the company was no longer handing applications out over the counter because it knew that local was trying to salt,organize its workforce.
during may,brandt received nine applications from referrals,of which it hired eight.in june,the company received nine applications from referrals,hiring eight of them.finally,one referred candidate started work in october of that year.from april,through december,brandt hired employees,of whom were referrals,from a pool of sixty seven referral applicants angela smith,a applicant,was the only applicant who obtained employment with the company that year.moreover,all of the individuals hired by brandt in were offered employment within days of the date their applications were filed with the company 
on october,local filed unfair labor charge number against brandt,which,as amended,alleged that,since april,the company changed,limited,and made more onerous its hiring practices and procedures with the purpose of making it more difficult for applicants with sentiments to apply or obtain employment,thereby violating section a of the national labor relations act nlra or act,a.the charge also alleged that brandt violated section a of the act,a,by refusing to hire or consider hiring union members for employment.on january,the regional director issued and served a complaint and notice of hearing against brandt based on the allegations contained in the charge brought by local hereinafter case.
in late april or early may,local learned that brandt was hiring for the construction season.on may,a number of active and retired business agents of local,as well as those of another local union,assembled for the purpose of organizing brandt labor force.the next day,a group comprised of approximately eighteen union members,all wearing union insignia,traveled to brandt office to obtain,complete,and submit applications for employment.upon arriving at the front door of brandt business office,the group observed a sign indicating that the company was not distributing or accepting employment applications.five members of the group,nevertheless,entered the office,with a video camera in tow,while the remaining members waited outside.once they were inside the office,the spokesman of the group informed the receptionist that it was the union understanding that brandt was hiring and that some of their members were interested in applying for jobs.at this point,terry brandt entered the room and advised the group to leave the premises or he would be forced to call the police.irwin brown,a consultant to the company,also appeared and informed the group that brandt was not hiring or giving interviews,and that if the union members had been told otherwise they were misinformed.brown also pointed to the sign on the front door of brandt office,advising the group that the company only accepted applications on mondays when it was hiring.all of the applicants left the premises when it became clear that they would not be given applications.
that same day,marty clark was permitted to file an employment application with the company.clark was referred to brandt by his stepfather,a business acquaintance of terry brandt.terry brandt reviewed clark application that afternoon,and,upon realizing that clark was not referred in accordance with the company hiring policy,sent out a letter rejecting the application.shortly thereafter,brandt rehired a former employee as a laborer and hired a referred applicant as a carpenter.both applied and started work on may.two other referral applicants began work in june,one on june and the other on june.
in june,chuck stevens,at the behest of local,telephoned his old foreman at brandt,joe copeland,to inquire as to whether he could possibly be rehired by the company according to stevens,copeland stated that local guys have caused trouble and there is a sign on the door that we are not taking applications,and i ca get you in the front door but probably could get you in the back door.copeland then told stevens that he would check with charles brandt,the company president,and get back with him shortly.later that month,copeland told stevens that he could be hired,and stevens reported to work shortly thereafter.
in,brandt received applications for laborer and operator positions,hiring individuals from that pool of,twenty laborers,two operators,two drivers,one finisher,and one carpenter.ten of the hires occurred in may and june.all of the hired individuals applications in came from former employees,individuals referred to the company by current supervisors or employees,or equal opportunity employment service providers.brandt did not accept any applications from unknown or applicants that year,and only hired four employees during the fourteen day time period for which the applicants attempted to file applications.
on june,local filed a second unfair labor charge number against brandt,which,as amended,alleged that since may,the company had refused to consider hiring union members.on september,the regional director issued a complaint and notice of hearing against brandt based on the charge brought by local case,and consolidated the case with case.
on november,a hearing was held before an administrative law judge on case and.on december,the hearing ended when the alj approved a settlement with brandt over the objections of both the general counsel of the national labor relations board general counsel and local.thereafter,both the general counsel and local filed a special appeal,pursuant to section of the rules and regulations of the nlrb,see provides for interlocutory appeals to the board,which are discretionary,challenging the settlement.on or about february,the national labor relations board board granted the special appeal,remanding the case back to the alj for further consideration.
on march,local filed its third unfair labor charge number against brandt,which,as amended,alleged that brandt has in effect and continues to maintain and apply a hiring practice of giving a preference in hiring to referred applicants regardless of their skill level over or unknown applicants and that such policy is designed to discriminate,interfere and prevent applicants from being considered for employment and is designed to deter the effects of union organizing in violation of the act.on may,the regional director issued a complaint and notice of hearing against brandt based on this charge case.
on june,case was consolidated for hearing with case and.after a hearing,the alj issued his decision on january.in that decision,the alj found that brandt violated a by changing and making more onerous its hiring practices and procedures with respect to applicants due to the differential treatment of the three groups of applicants by brandt on april,and amending its hiring policy to require applicants to present photo identification before receiving an employment application the alj dismissed the and charges,however,concluding that although the general counsel had met his burden of proving that brandt acted with animus,under the test outlined by the board in wright line,wl,enf,cir the company had not unlawfully refused to hire or consider hiring the applicants,noting 
after careful consideration,i conclude that brandt did not refuse to hire consider hiring the and applicants because of their sentiments.rather,i find that brandt faithfully adhered to its longstanding hiring policy that has been in effect since at least,and was posted on employee bulletin boards prior to the submission of the applications in april.
in support of the dismissals,the alj also made the following findings of fact that the march conciliation agreement,entered into by brandt and the department of labor to remedy of women and minority employees in brandt workforce,mandated hiring individuals referred by eeo service providers the company consider ed the application of applicant angela smith and hired her as a flagger in may that all of the positions filled by brandt in and were for laborer,truck driver,or flagger positions paying between and per hour,whereas t he majority of the applicants were higher paid skilled operators and the documents in evidence that an abundant pool of lower paying referral applicants existed for the laborer positions i n regard to the applicants who were not permitted to submit applications on may,brandt possessed an available pool of referral applicants to fill the laborer positions that the company hired in all of the applicants who submitted applications in were higher paid skilled operators,and brandt hired only two operators in that unknown or candidates that did not possess sentiments were treated similarly to applicants with sentiments and did not receive applications in may under the company nondiscriminatory hiring policy and that the individuals with sentiments attempted to file applications on may,a day that the union observed a sign on the door that brandt was not currently distributing or accepting applications or hiring employees.
finally,the alj dismissed the allegation that since september,brandt had in effect and maintained policies that gave preference in hiring to referral applicants with the purpose or intended effect of making it more difficult for applicants with sentiments to be considered for employment.both local and brandt filed exceptions to the alj decision,and the general counsel filed none.
on october,the board affirmed the alj conclusion that brandt did not unlawfully refuse to hire or refuse to consider for hire certain union affiliated applicants.in doing so,the board noted that the alj issued his opinion before the board published its decision in fes a division of thermo power and plumbers and pipefitters local of the united association,wl may,review denied and petition enforced by,fes a division of thermo power,cir,a case that clarified the framework for analyzing and allegations see discussion infra.nevertheless,the board found that the judge analysis in this case is consistent with the framework outlined in fes.
the board agreed with the alj that the general counsel had met its initial burden under the fes test,explaining i n regard to animus,the judge found that brandt violated section a of the act by changing its hiring practices to restrict the receipt of employment applications from applicants this unfair labor practice finding demonstrates the company animus.the board also agreed,however,with the alj conclusion that brandt had met its burden of demonstrating that it would not have hired the applicants even in the absence of their union activity or affiliation,noting the record shows that brandt established hiring policy was to give hiring preference to applicants who were current employees presumably on layoff or some other form of absence from their employment past employees with proven safety,attendance,and work records and applicants recommended by current supervisors and employees,and that t here is no contention that any of the applicants in question were in any of the identified categories.in reaching this conclusion,the board noted that brandt hired employees during the relevant time period and that o f those,were referred for employment by incumbent supervisors or employees,or by equal employment opportunity service providers pursuant to a conciliation agreement entered into between brandt and the department of labor in march and the other applicant hired during this time period was employee angela smith 
for these reasons,the board affirmed the alj dismissal of the and charges,as well as the dismissal of the allegation that brandt maintained its preferential hiring policy with the purpose or intended effect of making it more difficult for applicants to be considered for employment.
the board order,with which brandt has complied,directed the company to cease and desist from the unfair labor practices found from interfering with,restraining,or coercing employees in the exercise of their rights protected by section of the nlra,and required the company to post an appropriate remedial notice.local filed a petition to review the board decision.
we have jurisdiction to review applications for enforcement and petitions for review of board decisions pursuant to sections e and f of the national labor relations act nlra or act,e and f.in conducting our review,we are required to determine whether the board decision is supported by substantial evidence and whether its legal conclusions have a reasonable basis in law,cir.substantial evidence in this context means more than a mere scintilla.it means such relevant evidence as a reasonable mind might accept as adequate to support a conclusion.roadmaster,cir citation omitted.this standard applies to the board application of the facts to the law,winnebago television,cir,and w e apply a similarly deferential standard in determining whether the board legal conclusions have a reasonable basis in law.dunbar armored,cir.moreover,we defer particularly to the board findings regarding credibility,which can not be disturbed absent extraordinary circumstances,at.thus,while our review of the board decision is meaningful,it is decidedly deferential the board reasonable inferences may not be displaced on review even though we might justifiably have reached a different conclusion dunbar armored,at citation omitted.this deferential standard of review is appropriate in light of congress intent to confer upon the board broad authority to develop and oversee national labor policy,at.against this backdrop,we consider local petition for review.
a.the charge.
local first argument on appeal is that the board erred in concluding that brandt did not refuse to hire applicants.an employer violates a and of the nlra,a and,if it refuses to hire an individual because of his union sentiments,membership,or activities.bloedorn francisco foods,cir accordingly,an employer violates the act if it refuses to hire applicants because they are union salts hartman.heating air conditioning,cir.
to establish a discriminatory violation,the general counsel must prove,by a preponderance of the evidence,that the employer was hiring,or had concrete plans to hire,at the time of the alleged unlawful conduct that the job applicants had experience or training relevant to the announced or generally known requirements of the positions for hire,or,in the alternative,that the employer has not adhered uniformly to such requirements,or that the requirements were themselves pretextual or were applied as a pretext for discrimination and animus contributed to the decision not to hire the applicants.fes a division of thermo power and plumbers and pipefitters local of the united association,wl may,review denied and petition enforced by,fes a division of thermo power,cir see also vulcan basement waterproofing of,cir holding that in order t o prove a violation of section a or,the nlrb general counsel must prove that antiunion animus was a substantial or motivating factor in the employer decision to make adverse employment decisions citation omitted.once this is established,the employer can avoid liability by demonstrating that it would not have hired the applicants even in the absence of their union activity or affiliation.fes,wl,at see also vulcan,at holding that if the general counsel proves animus by a preponderance of the evidence,the employer can then avoid a finding of an unfair labor practice if it can show that it would have taken the action regardless of the employee union activities.if the employer makes this showing,the board will not find a violation of the act.fes,wl,at see also van vlerah,cir 
in this case,the board agreed with the alj that although the general counsel had proven that brandt displayed animus by making it more difficult for applicants to submit employment applications with the company,brandt demonstrated that,notwithstanding this animus,it would not have hired the applicants under its nondiscriminatory,preferential hiring policy.specifically,the board found that all but one of brandt hires in and were referred applicants,with the one exception being applicant angela smith,and that the company did not hire any unknown or applicants during that time period,the manner by which all of the applicants had sought employment.local does not dispute either of these facts,but maintains that the board,nevertheless,erred in concluding that brandt met its burden of showing that it would not have hired the applicants even in the absence of their union activity or affiliation because the hiring policy maintained by brandt is inherently discriminatory,destructive of the applicants section rights brandt did not rely on its preferential hiring policy as a defense at the alj hearing and brandt applied its hiring policy in a discriminatory manner.
we begin with local argument that brandt preferential hiring policy is inherently discriminatory and destructive of the applicants section rights under the nlra.according to the union,the board should not have permitted brandt to use its hiring policy as a wright line defense because policies which effectively eliminate an entire class of applicants from consideration have been found to be discriminatory and destructive of employee rights,and because brandt preferential hiring policy has no legitimate business purpose.
the alj dismissed the allegation that brandt preferential hiring policy was a mere pretense for making it more difficult for applicants to be considered for employment or to discourage membership in labor organizations,concluding that the policy of giving preferential treatment to referred applicants over or unknown applicants was not inherently discriminatory.the board affirmed the dismissal of this allegation an allegation separate and apart from the charge,but in doing so questioned the alj use of the phrase inherently discriminatory,noting there is no contention by the general counsel that brandt hiring policy was inherently destructive of rights.
the general counsel,of course,has the discretion to decide whether or not to issue a complaint.united food commercial workers union,local,d,and therefore possesses the lesser included authority to exercise exclusive control over the issues contained in any complaint that he issues.see d of the nlra,d noting that the general counsel shall have final authority,on behalf of the board,in respect of the investigation of charges and issuance of complaints and in respect of the prosecution of such complaints before the board williams,cir.moreover,the general counsel decision not to issue a complaint,or to include a particular issue in a complaint,is final and unreviewable,united food commercial workers union,at.we,therefore,agree with the board that the question of whether brandt hiring policy is inherently discriminatory or destructive is not an issue in this case 
this brings us to local second argument that none of brandt witnesses testified before the alj that the applicants were rejected as a result of the company faithful adherence to its preferential hiring policy.in a nutshell,the union contends that only reasons offered by terry brandt during the alj hearing for the company refusal to hire the applicants were that there were no positions available at the time they applied and their applications expired after fourteen days.this argument,however,is based on a selective reading of brandt testimony before the alj.
at the alj hearing,brandt provided extensive testimony that the company favored referred candidates and limited applicants,and that employment applications filed with the company would only be eligible for consideration for a period of fourteen days.moreover,when brandt testified that no positions were available for applicants,he did not assert,as local suggests,that no hiring took place during the time period in question.on the contrary,brandt testimony merely reflects that no positions were available for any applicants because the company was able to meet its hiring needs from a considerable pool of referred candidates.indeed,in earlier testimony,brandt readily acknowledged that the company conducted limited hiring during the periods that the applications were valid.he further explained that any hiring taking place at that time was for laborers and not operators,the position for which he categorized most,if not all,of the applicants.furthermore,as noted supra,all of the company hires during that time period were referred candidates.accordingly,brandt testimony does not undermine the board conclusion that brandt declined to hire applicants pursuant to its long standing,nondiscriminatory,preferential hiring policy.
local final argument is that brandt applied its hiring policy in a discriminatory manner,and,therefore,the company may not use that policy as the basis of its defense to the charge.to put it more precisely,the union contends that because brandt applied one aspect of its hiring policy in a discriminatory manner,the procedures governing the receipt and distribution of employment applications,we should presume that the company applied the remainder of its policy in a discriminatory manner.we disagree.such a presumption would conflate the two steps of the wright line test,as clarified in fes,rendering the second,whether the employer would have taken the same action even in the absence of union activity or.
the first step of wright line,as noted supra,requires the general counsel to produce enough evidence to create an inference that the employer decision not to hire applicants was motivated by animus.jet star,cir.here,the board found that the general counsel met this initial burden by producing evidence that brandt changed its hiring practices to restrict the receipt of employment applications from applicants.at this point,brandt,in order to avoid a finding of liability,was required to show that the applicants would not have been hired even if the company had not attempted to restrict or hinder the ability of those applicants to obtain and submit employment applications to the company.jet star,at holding that in evaluating the employer wright line burden we look to whether the employer was able to rebut the general counsel evidence or to show that the job action would have been taken even in the absence of the employee protected activities.the board concluded that brandt made this showing because the evidence demonstrated that the company applied its preferential hiring policy in a nondiscriminatory manner,and that the applications,submitted by union members as applicants,would have been rejected under this longstanding policy notwithstanding any animus.
the board can not,as local suggests,infer that brandt decision not to hire applicants was fueled by animus in the absence of evidence calling into question the truthfulness of the nondiscriminatory reason proffered by the company.that is because the general counsel bears the ultimate burden of persuasion under the wright line test,establishing a causal link between the animus and the adverse action taken by the employer.wright line,at fivecap,cir.the ultimate inquiry under the wright analysis is not whether the employer ever exhibited animus,but whether the employer would have refused to hire the applicants even in the absence of their union activity or affiliation.fes,wl,at see also vulcan basement,at.and although a finding of animus in one regard may make it more difficult for an employer to meet its burden of proving that its true reason for not hiring applicants was nondiscriminatory,this is ultimately a credibility determination to be made by the alj in the first instance and by the board thereafter a determination we are required to afford great deference,at.
therefore,in order to prevail on its petition,local must point to evidence that significantly undermines the board finding that,notwithstanding any sentiments,brandt would have rejected the applications under its nondiscriminatory,preferential hiring policy id.holding that we defer particularly to the board findings regarding credibility,which can not be disturbed absent extraordinary circumstances,and will refuse to interfere with the board choice between two permissible views of the evidence,even though we may have decided the matter differently had the case been before us de novo.the union attempts to make such a showing on appeal,and we shall therefore now turn to its arguments in this regard.
we begin by addressing local assertion that terry brandt comment to employees that the company was no longer accepting applications over the counter because of the union salting campaign sent the clear message to the employees that they should not refer applicants but rather only nonunion applicants.assuming this is a permissible inference to draw from brandt statement,the inference is of no use to the applicants who,by the time this statement was made may,had already filed applications april and attempted to obtain new applications may,as applicants.terry brandt statement,therefore,can hardly be said to have reduced the applicants chances of being referred by the company supervisors or employees,when none of them ever made an attempt to obtain such referrals.
as for the applicants,there is also nothing in the record suggesting that any of these applicants ever attempted to obtain referrals from a brandt supervisor or employee,or through one of the equal employment opportunity service providers used by the company.instead,the record shows that all of these applicants attempted to obtain employment applications from brandt as on may.in the absence of any effort on the part of these applicants to obtain referrals,we will not speculate as to whether the referral option was foreclosed to them because of a statement made by terry brandt over a year before they sought employment with the company.
local next argument is that brandt deviated from its hiring policy by preferring applicants referred by equal employment opportunity service providers over unknown or applicants.the crux of the union contention is that brandt written hiring policy does not specifically list referrals from equal employment opportunity service providers as a preferred category,and,therefore,the company failed to adhere faithfully to its preferential hiring policy when it gave applicants referred by eeo service providers priority over unknown or applicants.
in making this argument,however,the union does not point to any evidence that brandt deviation from its preferential hiring,giving priority to minority fueled by animus.instead,the union once again suggests that we should infer that the company decision to give preferential treatment here,to minority referrals was motivated by animus even in the absence of corroborating evidence.without such evidence,this is something we are rarely,if ever,inclined to do.see vulcan basement,at starcon,cir louis weiss mem,at.
and here,there is nothing in the record even remotely suggesting that brandt decision to give minority referrals preferential treatment was motivated,in any respect,by animus.indeed,the record shows that the company gave preferential treatment to applicants referred by eeo service providers pursuant to a conciliation agreement that the company entered into with the department of labor on march.under this agreement,brandt agreed to increase the number of women and minorities on each job in order to be in compliance with certain equal employment opportunity guidelines.
moreover,brandt decision to give preferential treatment to applicants referred from eeo service providers is entirely consistent with the company longstanding policy of hiring individuals referred from sources that it deems trustworthy over unknown or applicants a policy formulated long before local salting campaigns an employer who follows established hiring practices can rebut the general counsel showing of motivation if the hiring practices in question do not preclude the consideration of union applicants,nlrb,wl,september,holding that employer who followed hiring policy that gave preference to current and former employees,as well as referrals by employer management,did not discriminate on the basis of union activities because the policy does not on its face preclude or limit the possibilities for consideration of applicants with union preferences or backgrounds custom topsoil,nlrb,holding that employer did not discriminate on the basis of union activities when it differentiated between stranger applicants and familiar applicants,but did not differentiate between union and applicants 
in this case,brandt preferential hiring policy did not prevent the applicants from being considered for employment with the company.what doomed their applications was the decision to apply as,an applicant pool of last resort for the company.thus,while brandt may have tech
