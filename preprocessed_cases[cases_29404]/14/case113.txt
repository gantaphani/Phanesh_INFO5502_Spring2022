appellants,members of the eichenlaub family and their business,have been embroiled in a contentious zoning dispute with appellees,the township of indiana,pennsylvania,and several of its officials.the controversy arises from the eichenlaubs desire to develop certain pieces of property,and from the township insistence that the development comply with a number of regulations.the disagreement has engendered claims that township officials violated the eichenlaubs substantive due process and equal protection rights by denying or delaying authorization to develop the properties that officials violated david eichenlaub first amendment petition and free speech rights by curtailing his speech during a public meeting and removing him from the meeting that officials retaliated against david eichenlaub for exercising his first amendment rights and that officials are also liable under pennsylvania state law for damages.
the district court granted summary judgment on the substantive due process,equal protection,and first amendment charges but denied the eichenlaubs mandamus claim as moot.we affirm the district court judgment with respect to the substantive due process and free speech and petition claims.however,we will reverse as to the first amendment retaliation,equal protection,and writ of mandamus claims.
david,daniel,and barbara eichenlaub own two parcels of property in indiana township seven lots in the fairview gardens plan and a separate tract of land located along saxonburg boulevard.in the,the eichenlaubs commenced plans to develop their fairview gardens property,which was part of a lot subdivision of single family residences approved by the allegheny county planning commission and the board of supervisors of the township in the plan.in april of,the eichenlaubs submitted an application to the township for approval of a revised plan related to the seven lots the revised plan.after several rejections and subsequent revisions,the township approved the eichenlaubs amended subdivision plan on june,conditioned upon an execution of a satisfactory developer agreement.however,several weeks later,the eichenlaubs withdrew their revised plan,claiming that they had been subject to unnecessary and onerous obligations by the township.appellant br.
following the withdrawal of their revised plan application,the eichenlaubs continued their development efforts for their fairview gardens lots.on august,daniel and barbara eichenlaub executed deeds granting two of the fairview gardens lots to family members,david and carl eichenlaub.one week later,david eichenlaub submitted a building permit application for a single family residence on lot of the plan.the township rejected that application,as well as a subsequent application filed on august,claiming that the family was trying to develop the seven residential lots in a serial fashion so as to claim colorable exemption from the requirements of the township subdivision and land development ordinance.
the eichenlaubs maintained that they were not required to obtain the township approval of their subdivision plans under the land development regulations.they claimed that because the fairview gardens subdivision development was part of the lot plan approved in,subsequent revisions to the development codes did not apply to them.the township argued otherwise and maintained that the eichenlaubs were obliged to comply with development regulations enacted following the original subdivision approval granted in 
the eichenlaubs also sparred with township officials over the development of their saxonburg boulevard property.in,the eichenlaubs filed a permit application to grade the property to plant nursery stock for their landscaping business.the following year,the eichenlaubs fulfilled a township request to file a site plan for the project.in june of,the board approved the eichenlaubs plan.however,the township had not executed the developer agreement because,as the magistrate judge found,the eichenlaubs have refused to pay the engineering fees for the project.app.
in september of,the eichenlaubs filed two separate civil actions in federal court.in the first case,docket,the township,the township board of supervisors,the township board code enforcement officer,the township manager,and the township engineer were named defendants.david eichenlaub alleged that the township violated his first amendment rights to petition government for redress of grievances when he was limited in his right to speak at a public meeting on september,and was removed from the same meeting count i and was subject to various alleged retaliatory actions taken by the defendants count ii.david eichenlaub and his business,ike construction,also asserted defamation claims regarding defendants involvement in a newspaper article recounting that david eichenlaub had violated an indiana township ordinance count ii.
in the second case,docket,david,daniel,and barbara eichenlaub raised conspiracy claims under asserting violation of their fourteenth amendment rights to substantive due process count i arising out of delays and disputes in securing authorization to develop the fairview gardens and saxonburg boulevard properties and denial of equal protection under the fourteenth amendment by being denied the opportunity to proceed with their projects count ii and arbitrary action,selective enforcement and retaliation regarding both the fairview gardens and saxonburg boulevard properties count iii.the eichenlaubs also alleged that the defendants failure to act on their development applications in the time and manner required under the pennsylvania municipalities planning code mpc entitled them to a writ of mandamus compelling approval of those projects count iv.
the two complaints were consolidated at.the defendants moved for summary judgment on all counts,and the eichenlaubs moved for partial summary judgment on the counts initially listed in.
on august,the magistrate judge issued his report and recommendation.the report recommended that the district court grant summary judgment for defendants on david eichenlaub first amendment free speech and petition claim as well his state defamation claim the eichenlaubs equal protection,conspiracy,and official capacity claims alleged against the individual defendants deny defendants motions for summary judgment on the david eichenlaub first amendment retaliation claims deny motions by the eichenlaubs and defendants for summary judgment on the eichenlaubs substantive due process claim and grant the eichenlaubs request for a writ of mandamus based on a defendants failure to notify the eichenlaubs of its april decision to deny approval of the subdivision plan for fairview gardens and b defendant failure to act on the eichenlaubs grading permit and site plan applications for the saxonburg boulevard property.
while the case was pending in district court,the parties entered into two partial settlement agreements,dated february,and february,under which the township agreed to grant building permits at fairview gardens and approve the subdivision plan and grading permits for the sax on burg property.
on may,the district court entered an order granting defendants motion for summary judgment on all counts.the court also dismissed the eichenlaubs mandamus requests as moot in light of the partial settlement agreements.
the eichenlaubs appeal from that order as it relates to the claims for substantive due process,equal protection,free speech,and retaliation as well as the denials of mandamus.this court has jurisdiction pursuant to.our review over a district court grant of summary judgment is plenary.see fed.home loan mortgage scottsdale ins,cir.we assess the record using the same summary judgment standard that guides district courts.see farrell planters lifesavers,cir.to prevail on a motion for summary judgment,the moving party must demonstrate that there is no genuine issue as to any material fact and that the moving party is entitled to a judgment as a matter of law.c.
david eichenlaub first amendment claims present two distinct issues.he complains that the township restricted his ability to speak at various township board of supervisors meetings and that he was removed from one such meeting on september.in effect,david eichenlaub alleges a direct restraint on speech in a particular public forum,as well as a restraint on his ability to petition under the petition clause of the first amendment.second,david eichenlaub urges that township officials took adverse action against his family in retaliation for his statements.we examine each claim in turn.
the government power to prevent or limit speech on public property is carefully circumscribed by the first amendment.not all public property is open to unfettered public speech,for the first amendment does not guarantee access to property simply because it is owned or controlled by the government.united states postal serv.council of greenburgh civic ass ns,d.government facilities that are not committed to public communicative activity may regulate speech by the general public so long as that regulation is reasonable and not based on opposition to a particular viewpoint.id.at.that is because the government may legally preserve the property under its control for the use to which it is dedicated.lamb chapel ctr.moriches union free sch,d.
on the other hand,public areas that are open to general assembly and debate as a matter of tradition or by specific government designation are characterized as a public forum,within which speech can be limited only narrowly.educ.television comm forbes,d,quoting perry educ.ass perry local educators ass n,d see also whiteland woods,township of west whiteland,cir.streets and parks are examples of traditional public forums.see,hague cio.public forums are also established when the government opens property for general expressive activity,perry educ.ass n,at,as in the case of theaters,southeastern promotions,conrad,d.absent a compelling interest,speech in a public forum may not be regulated based upon content.furthermore,in a public forum any restrictions as to time,place,and manner of speech must be unrelated to content must be narrowly tailored to serve a significant governmental interest and must allow alternative ways of communicating the same information.whiteland woods,at quoting ward rock against racism,d.
there is a third type of public setting that the courts have forum created by the government that is limited to certain groups or to discussion of certain topics.see rosenberger rector visitors of the of,d lamb chapel,at.an example of this kind of limited public forum is a university facility open for meetings of student groups,but not for the general public.see,widmar vincent,d.the supreme court has not precisely instructed where the limited public forum is located on the first amendment spectrum between the strict test for public forum regulation and the more relaxed test for nonpublic regulation.see whiteland woods,at.earlier decisions,such as widmar itself,at,and perry educ.ass n,at,suggest that restraints on limited public forums must be subject to strict scrutiny,and can survive only if they are supported by a compelling interest.recently,however,the court has apparently moved to the position that regulation of a limited forum may survive under a test that is less strict than that applied in the case of a general open forum.good news club milford cent,d.under this refined test for reviewing limited forum restrictions,restraints are permitted,so long as they are designed to confine the forum to the limited and legitimate purposes for which it was created.rosenberger,at.see also brody spang,cir.two limitations remain.any restrictions on speech must be viewpoint neutral and must be reasonable in light of the purpose served by the forum.good news club,at.quoting cornelius naacp legal def.ed.fund,d.
put another way,we may say that under contemporary public forum jurisprudence,a designated as opposed to traditional forum is reviewed under a sliding standard that allows for regulation so long as the content is tied to the limitations that frame the scope of the designation,and so long as the regulation is neutral as to viewpoint within the subject matter of that content.
in this case,the primary restrictions placed on david eichenlaub speech occurred during his appearance at the citizen forum portion of the township board of supervisors meeting on september,during which he was eventually removed.whether the citizen forum was a general public forum or a limited public forum is a close question.certainly,the citizen forum is not limited to a particular class of speakers,as was the case in cornelius charities,rosenberger student groups,or forbes political candidates.indeed,the record discloses that the citizen its name open to all citizens who wish to address the township government.at the same time,a review of the transcript of the forum confirms that even the public discussion session of the township meeting was designed to be limited to matters pertaining to town government.the meeting was not the equivalent of a municipal theater,as in southeastern promotions,or a public park or street.one would certainly not expect the forum of a township meeting to include such expressive activities as performance art,lectures on medieval history,or arguments about private disputes involving town citizens.plainly,public bodies may confine their meetings to specified subject matter city of madison joint sch.dist.employment relations comm n,d see white city of norwalk,cir.thus,matters presented at a citizen forum may be limited to issues germane to town government.
with this framework,we agree with the district court that summary judgment against david eichenlaub on his restraint of speech and petition claims was appropriate.the record of the september,meeting discloses that he was repetitive and truculent,and that he repeatedly interrupted the chairman of the meeting.restricting such behavior is the sort of time,place,and manner regulation that passes muster under the most stringent scrutiny for a public forum.indeed,for the presiding officer of a public meeting to allow a speaker to try to hijack the proceedings,or to filibuster them,would impinge on the first amendment rights of other participants.we have no difficulty sustaining the decision to remove david eichenlaub on that basis.
to be sure,the chairman of the meeting sought to restrict the discussion to topics of public interest and requested that david eichenlaub not discuss matters of private concern.to the extent those restrictions were not strictly,the chairman actions served the function of confining the discussion to the purpose of the meeting.as we have observed,speech at a citizen forum may be limited according to its germaneness to the purpose of the meeting at any rate,the overwhelming,and wholly sufficient,motive to eject david eichenlaub from the meeting was the perfectly sustainable and desire to prevent his badgering,constant interruptions,and disregard for the rules of decorum.
we will affirm summary judgment for the defendants on this claim.
the eichenlaubs retaliation claims stand on different footing,however.the magistrate judge determined that there were material issues of fact as to whether the defendants took steps to retaliate against the eichenlaubs for david eichenlaub various statements and complaints,including his speech at the september,meeting.the district court entered summary judgment against the eichenlaubs,however,on the ground that,even if there was retaliation,the speech in question related to private matters,rather than matters of public concern,and,therefore,was unprotected by the first amendment 
the district court opinion misconceives the scope of protection for speech under the first amendment.
the issue of government retaliation for unwelcome communication arises in various contexts.sometimes,public employees claim adverse employment action resulted because of their speech.prisoners not infrequently allege that punishment was spurred by their complaints.and,as is the case here,citizens may charge that the government hurt them in retaliation for some criticism against the authorities.see bd.of county comm rs umbehr,d.
in general,constitutional retaliation claims are analyzed under a test.plaintiff must prove that he engaged in activity that the government responded with retaliation and that the protected activity caused the retaliation.anderson davila,cir public employee retaliation rauser horn,cir.the threshold requirement is that the plaintiff identify the protected activity that allegedly spurred the retaliation.in this case,david eichenlaub argues that his exercise of his freedom of speech and ability to petition the government under the first amendment are the protected activities in question.
the district court relied in part on our opinion in anderson to hold that plaintiff must show that speech is a matter of public concern in order to receive first amendment protection.app.quoting anderson,at.this reading of our case law,however,is overbroad.our decision in anderson and all the other decisions relied upon in the district court or by the only that a public concern requirement applies when a claim of first amendment retaliation is brought by a public employee against his or her government employer.anderson,at.the speech on public concerns requirement embodied in these decisions has not been applied,however,when complain that government has retaliated against them as citizens for their speech.to expand this public concern limitation into the broader context of all citizen speech would wrench it from its original rationale and curtail a significant body of free expression that has traditionally been fully protected under the first amendment.
we begin with the proposition that,except for certain narrow categories deemed unworthy of full first amendment as obscenity,fighting words and speech is protected by the first amendment.paul,d.that protection includes private expression not related to matters of public concern.see capitol square review advisory bd.pinette,d connick myers,d united mine workers of am.dist.state bar ass n,d.
the public concern test was formulated by the supreme court in addressing speech restrictions placed by governmental entities on their own public employees.regulation of public employee speech presented two features not present in other forms of speech control.first,acting as an employer,the government has some authority to impose conditions upon those who seek jobs,including conditions that limit the exercise of otherwise available constitutional rights.see,broadrick oklahoma,d.second,w hen someone who is paid a salary so that she will contribute to an agency effective operation begins to do or say things that detract from the agency effective operation,the government employer must have some power to restrain her.waters churchill,d plurality opinion.
the supreme court approached public employee speech,therefore,as a balance between the rights those employees enjoy as citizens and the obligations they bear as loyal employees.in connick myers,d,the court held that while government employers,like their private counterparts,have authority to manage their the authority to restrict various kinds of first amendment imposes limits on that authority when the employees are speaking about matters of public concern.to strike the balance,the court carved out speech on matters of public concern as a species of expression that would remain protected even for government employees.the court reasoned that speech on public issues occupies the highest rung of the hierarchy of first amendment values,and is entitled to special protection.id.at.quoting carey brown,d 
nothing about the reasoning of connick suggests that this concern distinction has any role to play regarding speech outside the public employment setting.
to the contrary.in singling out speech on matters of public concern for the highest protection in the government workplace,the supreme court took pains to avoid any implication that speech on private matters is not entitled to constitutional protection 
we do not suggest,however,that myers speech,even if not touching upon a matter of public concern,is totally beyond the protection of the first amendment.the first amendment does not protect speech and assembly only to the extent it can be characterized as political 
id.at.quoting united mine workers of am.dist,at.thus,the court distinguished between types of speech only in order to accommodate the strong countervailing need for governments to discipline their own personnel.
this court has also observed,albeit in dictum,that s peech unrelated to a matter of public concern is not,like obscenity,entirely outside the protection of the first amendment.while the government as employer may discharge a public employee for such speech,the government as sovereign may not sanction the same individual when she engages in such speech as a citizen,outside the employment context.azzaro county of allegheny,cir.
to be sure,numerous cases,including those cited by the district court and by the parties,have reiterated the matters distinction in the context of retaliation claims brought by public employees.healthy city sch.dist.bd.of educ.doyle,d anderson,at cir kokkinis ivkovich and vill,of bridgeview,cir russoli salisbury township,alvarez city of new york,d.what is pivotal,though,is that these cases do not involve retaliation by government bodies against citizens who are not employed by the government and who,incidentally,can not be viewed as having limited their speech as a condition of voluntary employment indeed,many other cases point to the principle that outside the employment context the first amendment forbids retaliation for speech even about private matters.for example,we have held that first amendment claims may be based on allegations that a prisoner complaint against a guard caused retaliation.mitchell horn,cir.realistically,these kinds of complaints are often highly particularized objections to alleged individual mistreatment.we do not,however,impose a public concern threshold.
in short,while speech on topics of public concern may stand on the highest rung on the ladder of the first amendment,private speech unless obscene or fighting words or the like is still protected on the first amendment ladder.see capitol square review,at.the rationale for a concern distinction that applies to public employees simply does not apply to citizens outside the employment context.by the same token,the decisions of the supreme court and of our court have not established a public concern threshold to the protection of citizen private speech.we decline to fashion one now.c onstitutional review of government employment decisions must rest on different principles that review of speech restraints imposed by the government as sovereign.waters,at.
accordingly,david eichenlaub speech,even if concerned with private grievances,is entitled to first amendment protection 
because the district court did not consider the magistrate report that found material issues of fact with regard to the other elements of the retaliation claim,we will vacate the judgment on the first amendment retaliation claim and remand for further proceedings.
the district court properly held,and the eichenlaubs do not dispute,that whether a zoning official actions or inactions violate due process is determined by utilizing a shocks the conscience test.united artists theatre circuit,township of warrington,cir.that test,of course,is not precise,see county of sacramento lewis,d,and it also varies depending on the factual context,united artists,at.what is clear is that this test is designed to avoid converting federal courts into super zoning tribunals.what shocks the conscience is only the most egregious official conduct.id.quoting lewis,at.
cases cited by the eichenlaubs in support of their argument illustrate the kinds of gross misconduct that have shocked the judicial conscience.in conroe creosoting montgomery county,cir,the court of appeals determined that whether a plaintiff substantive due process had been violated by local officials was a triable allegation.but that was not a zoning dispute.rather,plaintiffs charged that the officials fraudulently converted a tax levy for a deficiency into an unauthorized seizure and forced sale and destruction of an ongoing business.the principal defendant conceded that the sale was unauthorized.the facts
