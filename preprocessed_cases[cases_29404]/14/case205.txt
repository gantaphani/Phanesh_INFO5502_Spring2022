friends of tims ford ftf appeals from the district court dismissal of its case on summary judgment for want of standing.ftf is an unincorporated association of individuals,families,and homeowners associations,who own property adjoining the tims ford reservoir reservoir or in adjacent communities,and are concerned about the environmental impact of land development near the reservoir and the environmental impact of increased boating on,and community use of,reservoir water.ftf seeks declaratory and injunctive relief against the tennessee valley authority tva and james fyke,in his official capacity as commissioner of the tennessee department of environment conservation tdec,for alleged violations of the national environmental policy act of nepa,et,by tva and tdec in their implementation of the tims ford reservoir land management and disposition plan lmdp,based on the final environmental impact statement feis prepared by tva and tdec,and for violations of the tva act of tva act,k a and,in the development of two parcels of land,fanning bend,and a parcel conveyed to the city of winchester,parcel.ftf has also brought state law claims against tdec.id.because we find that ftf has failed to demonstrate standing to bring this case,we affirm the district court decision to dismiss this action without prejudice.
background 
tva completed the reservoir in for purposes of flood control,hydroelectric generation,recreation,and economic development.over the years,transfers and sales of land for various commercial,industrial,residential and recreational uses resulted in government ownership of acres of land at the reservoir,of which acres were owned by tva and acres were owned by tdec.in,tva and tdec agreed by contract to create an lmdp to determine specific uses of the reservoir.the at issue in this case is in fulfillment of that agreement.
ftf specifically challenges the decision by tva and tdec to choose as its preferred alternative for development of the reservoir,as outlined in the,alternative,balanced land development with conservation partnership,which ftf asserts was not revealed nor discussed in the draft eis deis prepared and circulated for public comment.alternative was developed by modifying b,which was presented in the deis,to reflect further analysis and public comment on the deis.in relevant part,it created a new allocation zone,zone,and opened up nine additional shoreline miles for consideration of requests for community docks.the tva board adopted the lmdp,as described in alternative,on august,and the tennessee state building commission adopted the plan on september.tva issued its record of decision on the lmdp on october,and it was published in the federal register on november.
ftf also challenges the implementation of the in the disposition of state property.after soliciting development proposals based on a series of conservation development goals outlined in the concept plan book,fanning bend conservation development,tims ford tennessee concept plan book,tdec disposed of a particular tract of land,fanning bend,for private residential development.in the quitclaim deed transferring fanning bend to the private developer,tdec imposed certain restrictive covenants,such as prohibiting the construction of individual or private facilities on this parcel,enforceable by the state of tennessee,as grantor,upon the private developer,its successors and assigns.in the instant action,ftf challenges the decision by tva and tdec to transfer land to a private developer and then to issue permits allowing the private developer to build nine community boat dock facilities.ftf also challenges tva decision to grant permits for marinas and community boat docks on parcel in violation of the zoning requirements in the and the tva act.
in sum,among numerous specific allegations,ftf alleges tva and tdec violated nepa,the tva act,and its own rules in transferring land for permanent residential development to the benefit of private developers implementing a procedurally deficient failing to create a mandatory supplemental eis in light of the fanning bend development project and granting permits for the construction of a marina,boat dock,pier and boat slips on land specifically prohibited from such use.ftf also alleges that tva failed to supplement the after receiving significant new data from a recreational boating capacity study prepared and completed by tva in.
in support of ftf assertion that it has standing to pursue these claims,two ftf members,robert taylor taylor and steve hammond hammond,filed affidavits alleging they are directly affected by the failure of tdec to enforce the restrictive covenants in the deed to the developer of fanning bend and in the placement of two large community boat docks in willis lake cove.taylor and hammond allege that these boat docks add significant boat traffic resulting in impaired boating safety,significantly more bank erosion,and degraded water quality.taylor alleges that normal activity on these boat docks adds water pollution and significantly more noise,and that the docks themselves obstruct the view of the wooded shoreline.
in its request for relief,ftf seeks a preliminary injunction prohibiting tva and tdec from proceeding with any additional development warranting community boat dock approvals permits or transfers of land for residential or commercial development on the reservoir pending the litigation of this action a declaratory judgment stating that tva and tdec implementation of the violates nepa,the tva act,and tva own regulations and guidelines a declaratory judgment finding unlawful tdec covenant with the grantee of the quitclaim deed for the fanning bend development in violation of the tva act an order requiring tdec to enforce the restrictive covenants in the quitclaim deed a temporary injunction prohibiting tva and tdec from proceeding with any additional development of lake front property on the reservoir until they have prepared and circulated for public and intragency comment an adequate supplemental draft and final eis identifying and discussing in detail the environmental impacts from the proposed development of marinas,community boat docks,boat slips,increased boat traffic on the reservoir,and permanent residences which allegedly were not anticipated in the and costs and fees incurred in this action.
procedural history 
ftf initiated this lawsuit by filing a complaint on october,against tva and tdec,which the district court granted leave to amend on november.on march,the city of winchester,tennessee donald minor parcel dock association,llc rec development,llc rocky top lakeshore development,twin creeks development,llc and winchester marina,llc the intervenors filed a motion to intervene,a memorandum in support of the motion to intervene,and an attached intervening,alleging that ftf lawsuit has resulted in the stoppage and delay of approved projects at the reservoir and the permitting processes for the docks and other developments of interest to the intervenors.the intervenors further alleged in their countercomplaint that ftf actions were not brought in good faith and are carried out solely and intentionally for the purpose of interfering with the contractual rights of the.the intervenors sought compensatory damages from ftf in addition to attorneys fees and costs.the motion to intervene was granted on july.ftf filed objections on july.
on may,tdec filed a motion to dismiss ftf case for lack of standing.after receiving an extension of time,ftf filed a response to tdec motion on june.on june,tdec replied.
on january,the district court entered an order to show cause,requiring ftf to demonstrate why the instant action should not be dismissed for lack of standing.the parties ftf and all of the defendants were ordered to submit briefs and supporting evidence on the issue of ftf associational standing.the district court held in abeyance all pending motions and objections while the parties briefed the issue of ftf associational standing.in compliance,ftf filed a response to the order on february,attaching the sworn affidavits of taylor and hammond.defendants fyke,tva,and the intervenors filed responses on february,to which ftf replied on february.
on march,the district court issued an order and judgment dismissing,without prejudice,ftf federal causes of action for lack of standing and declining to exercise supplemental jurisdiction over ftf and the intervenors state law claims.the district court expressly held that ftf failed to assert concrete and particularized allegations of a threat of future injury resulting from the development of future community boat docks,and that ftf,and its members,established instead an injury in fact stemming from two docks.the district court,therefore,found that ftf failed to satisfy the redressability prong of the standing inquiry,as the injury in fact alleged could not be redressed by the declaratory and injunctive relief sought.
ftf timely appealed.
before reaching the merits of this case,we must address several threshold issues raised by the parties.
as a first matter,tva contends it invited public comment on the adoption of the feis for thirty days after publication of the availability of the and that ftf failure to comment on or object to the selection of alternative precludes a challenge to it.contrary to tva contention,failure to object or comment on a selection during administrative proceedings does not automatically preclude one from challenging the selection.neither nepa itself,et,nor the ceq regulations for the implementation of nepa,parts,expressly limit judicial review of final agency action to those who preserved their appellate rights through public comment.see detailing public involvement limiting the duty to comment to federal agencies with jurisdiction by law or special expertise with respect to any environmental impact involved and agencies which are authorized to develop and enforce environmental standards.additionally,as the supreme court found in dep t of transp.pub.citizen,d,the agency bears the primary responsibility to ensure that it complies with nepa and an eis flaws might be so obvious that there is no need for a commentator to point them out specifically in order to preserve its ability to challenge a proposed action.tva has not shown why,nor are we persuaded that,the development of the reservoir in the face of a deficient was not so obvious that ftf needed to comment to preserve its right to appeal.
next,tva asserts that ftf nepa claims are barred by the applicable statute of limitations whether a claim is barred by the relevant statute of limitations is a question of law that we review de novo.sierra club slater,cir.
nepa does not authorize a private right of action,but judicial review is granted through the administrative procedure act apa.sierra club,at citing see also.a complaint under the apa for review of an agency action is a civil action within the meaning of a,and is governed by a statute of limitations.sierra club,at see also southwest williamson county cmty.ass slater,cir.the limitations period begins to run from the time of final agency action.southwest,at citing.in determining what constitutes final agency action,t he core question is whether the agency has completed its decisionmaking process,and whether the result of that process is one that will directly affect the parties.id.quoting franklin massachusetts,d.a final eis,for example,or the record of decision rod issued thereon constitute s final agency action.see also sierra club,at.additionally,a pproval of a land use plan is a major federal action requiring an eis and that action is completed when the plan is approved.norton utah wilderness alliance,d citations and internal quotation marks omitted.read together,the rod on the lmdp,based on the accompanying feis,is the final relevant agency action in the instant case.or.natural desert ass forest,cir stating that issuance of an aoi annual operating instruction is the consummation of a process that sets the parameters for the upcoming grazing season and imposes legal consequences on the permit holder emphasis added.here,the rod on the lmdp was issued on october.when ftf filed its complaint on october,it did so just before the expiration of the applicable statute of limitations.therefore,the claims relating to the adequacy,preparation and implementation of the lmdp,and the accompanying feis,under nepa are not.
finally,ftf contends that the district court decision to dismiss this case on summary judgment was procedurally improper.we review a district court decision to convert a motion to dismiss under rule b into a motion for summary judgment under rule for abuse of discretion.ball union carbide,cir see also shelby county health care council of indus.workers health welfare trust fund,cir.before a district court can make this conversion,it must give the parties a reasonable opportunity to present all material made pertinent to the issue,which requires sufficient notice and an opportunity for further discovery.ball,at quoting.b see shelby,at noting that w hether a district court must provide actual notice that it intends to convert a motion to dismiss into a motion for summary judgment depends on the facts and circumstances of each case.once the conversion has been made,the substance of the district court decision is reviewed de novo under the normal standards for summary judgment.shelby,at.
the district court issued an order to show cause on january,ordering the parties to show through briefs and supporting evidence why the instant action should not be dismissed for lack of standing,particularly associational standing,as plaintiff purports to prosecute the instant action as an unincorporated association the district court procedural action was consistent with the power it has to require further particularized allegations of fact before dismissing a case for lack of jurisdiction.in warth seldin,the supreme court detailed the procedure by which appellate courts are to rule on such motions to dismiss 
both the trial and reviewing courts must accept as true all material allegations of the complaint,and must construe the complaint in favor of the complaining party at the same time,it is within the trial court power to allow or to require the plaintiff to supply,by amendment to the complaint or by affidavits,further particularized allegations of fact if,after this opportunity,the plaintiff standing does not adequately appear from all materials of record,the complaint must be dismissed.
warth seldin,d.in this case,the parties were ordered to submit briefs and supporting evidence on the issue of associational standing.after granting the parties an opportunity for further discovery days from the date on which the order to show cause was filed until the initial brief was due,and accepting as true all of ftf factual allegations,the district court found that ftf failed to demonstrate standing.thus,the district court faithfully complied with the process outlined in warth.
ftf argument that it suffered prejudice because discovery was still fully underway when the district court dismissed its case is undermined by its failure to demonstrate,or even allege,that it sought an extension of time to complete discovery prior to filing its initial brief.it did move the district court for leave to amend its pleadings or file additional affidavits,but only i n the event the district court found that the plaintiff allegations were insufficient in some degree to support associational or representational standing a blatant request for a second bite of the apple.moreover,ftf,in fact,filed affidavits along with its brief.
ftf additionally argues that it was given insufficient notice that it risked dismissal as to both defendants in that the order to show cause did not address any defendant other than tdec,nor was there any other dispositive motion before the court other than the state.ftf argument is unpersuasive.the district court expressly stated in its order to show cause that the plaintiff complaint,which was filed against both defendants,does not established sic that at least one of its members has individual standing to bring the instant action.roa at.in that same order,the district court directed the defendants,in plural,to submit responsive briefs.the defendants did so,and tva specifically addressed ftf standing to raise the federal causes of action at issue.in reply,ftf addressed tva arguments,even as it called them procedurally improper and not properly before the district court.ftf can not reasonably claim surprise and prejudice due to lack of notice that its federal claims risked dismissal,given that it addressed the substance of these claims.salehpour of,cir holding that notice is required w here one party is likely to be surprised by the proceedings.therefore,the district court dismissal of ftf complaint was procedurally proper.
we turn to the merits of the standing issue.
standard of review 
whether a party has standing to assert nepa claims and tva claims is an issue of law subject to de novo review.michigan united states,cir.
the central issue before us is whether ftf has standing to sue tva and tdec for their alleged violations of nepa and the tva act.to demonstrate constitutional standing,a plaintiff must satisfy the following three elements an allegation of an injury in fact,which is a concrete harm suffered by the plaintiff that is actual or imminent,rather than conjectural or hypothetical a demonstration of causation,which is a fairly traceable connection between the plaintiff injury and the conduct of the defendant and a demonstration of redressability,which is a likelihood that the requested relief will redress the alleged injury.steel citizens for a better env t,d see also wuliger mfrs.life ins,cir.additionally,a plaintiff seeking judicial review of agency action under the apa must not only meet constitutional requirements of standing,but must also demonstrate prudential standing,which exists if the interest that the plaintiff seeks to protect is arguably within the zone of interests to be protected or regulated by the statute in question.courtney smith,cir citations omitted.prudential standing is also met if the plaintiff alleges it suffered a legal wrong.ctr.for biological diversity lueckel,cir.the legal injury or interest sought to be protected must relate to agency action,which is defined to include failure to act.id.
as an unincorporated association,ftf also must demonstrate associational standing,which is met when the organization members would otherwise have standing to sue in their own right the interests it seeks to protect are germane to the organization purpose and neither the claim asserted nor the relief requested requires the participation of individual members in the lawsuit.hunt.state apple adver.comm n,d see also fednav,chester,cir.the plaintiff bears the burden of showing standing as to each type of relief sought.summers earth island,d.here,ftf request for injunctive and declaratory relief requires a showing of a likelihood of substantial and immediate irreparable injury,a requirement that can not be met where there is no showing of any real or immediate threat that the plaintiff will be wronged again and the inadequacy of remedies at law.city of los angeles lyons,d see also claybrooks.dep t of,wl,at.lexis,cir.where a plaintiff has been asked to support its standing to bring a case by affidavit or other evidence,said plaintiff must set forth specific facts,which will be taken as true for purposes of the motion.lujan defenders of wildlife,d warth,at.
in the instant case,ftf alleges its members have suffered two types of injuries procedural injuries arising from the failure of tva and tdec to follow nepa procedures and ongoing injuries to their aesthetic and recreational interests arising from environmental harm to the reservoir caused by agency action in violation of nepa and the tva act.
before turning to the merits of ftf procedural injury claim,we must address one final threshold issue raised by tva.tva asserts that ftf raises for the first time on appeal that ftf pleaded a procedural injury sufficient to sustain its standing to sue for alleged nepa violations,and that ftf failure to make this argument in response to the district court order to show cause precludes ftf from raising and pursuing such a theory in this court.see merit.prot,cir see also maldonado acme,cir.tva argument is compelling because ftf did not expressly label any of its allegations of injury in fact procedural before the district court,nor did it argue entitlement to the relaxed causation and redressability requirements connected to a procedural injury,as it now asserts on appeal.nonetheless,ftf did more than raise these alleged procedural injuries in a perfunctory manner when it argued on appeal the same violations of nepa and the tva act that it raised in its complaint and amended complaint as well as in its response to the district court order to show cause.we therefore conclude ftf sufficiently pleaded the procedural injury for purposes of our review.
tva and tdec alleged failure to follow nepa procedures 
nepa is a procedural statute,designed to ensure that federal agencies consider the environmental impact of their actions.michigan,at.to satisfy this goal,nepa provides that when a federal agency undertakes major federal action significantly affecting the quality of the human environment,it must prepare an eis concerning that action.id.citing c.procedural rights are considered special insofar as a person who has been accorded a procedural right to protect his concrete interests can assert that right without meeting all the normal standards for redressability and immediacy.lujan,at.
procedural injury in fact 
to show a cognizable injury in fact in a procedural injury case,a plaintiff must allege that the agency violated certain procedural rules,that these rules protect a plaintiff concrete interests and that it is reasonably probable that the challenged action will threaten these concrete interests.ouachita watch league jacobs,cir see also town of winthrop faa,cir citizens for better forestry usda,cir heartwood,forest,cir comm.to save the rio hondo lucero,cir.additionally,i t is well settled that,in a nepa suit,a cognizable procedural injury exists when a plaintiff alleges that a proper eis has not been prepared when the plaintiff also alleges a concrete as an aesthetic or recreational is threatened by the proposed actions.ouachita,at citations and internal quotation marks omitted see lujan,at.stating that concrete injury is required in suits against the government,including those alleging a procedural injury see also city of las vegas faa,cir city of clarkson valley mineta,cir.nepa is rather than.see robertson methow valley citizens council,d.if the adverse environmental effects of the proposed action are adequately identified and evaluated,the agency is not constrained by nepa from deciding that other values outweigh the environmental costs.id.at.
whether ftf has adequately alleged a procedural injury in fact turns on whether the fell below the standard required to comply with nepa procedural requirements and is linked to a concrete harm asserted by one of ftf members that is connected to a proposed action.here,ftf alleges the agencies created a new land use classification in the feis,zone,that was not presented in the deis and that the zone classification would open an additional nine miles of shoreline for the installation of boat docks the agencies failed to consider or even discuss in the the environmental impacts,including detrimental impacts to water quality,to the reservoir from increased development of permanent residential homes on private land as a result of the zone designation and that the feis concluded that the new zone designation would benefit water quality without analysis and without evidence of any tangible,quantifiable benefits.ftf also alleges that a recreational boating study conducted in provided significant new information relevant to environmental concerns and warrants the preparation of a supplemental eis.
ftf has failed to adequately plead a procedural injury,because it has failed to connect the procedural harm alleged in its creation of a new land use classification in the feis without an environmental assessment,resulting in than action in violation of specific harm threatening particular ftf members.see robertson,at.
in support of its assertion that its members suffered concrete har
