we have for review architects,ced construction partners,so d dca,in which the fifth district court of appeal certified conflict with reuter recycling of florida,city of dania beach,so d dca.the conflict issue is whether under the florida arbitration code a statute of limitations defense is subject to arbitration when the arbitration agreement provides that claims,disputes or other matters arising out of or relating to the contract are to be decided by arbitration,but also provides that a demand for arbitration can not be made when institution of legal or equitable proceedings based on the underlying claim would be barred by the applicable statute of limitations.we have jurisdiction.see art.v,b.const.
because the florida arbitration code allows parties to agree to arbitrate any controversy,the question of whether a dispute is subject to arbitration is a matter of contract interpretation.we hold that a broad agreement to arbitrate includes determining defenses to an otherwise arbitrable claim,including the statute of limitations 
facts and procedural history 
on august,architects,contracted with vero club partners vero club,to design a housing project.on january,entered into a nearly identical contract with clearwater phase i partners phase i,to design a housing project.ced construction partners ced was the general contractor on both projects.
after discovering latent construction and design defects on their properties,vero club and phase i demanded that ced fix the problems.ced did so and vero club and phase i assigned ced their rights to make a claim for damages against for the defects.ced then filed a demand with the american arbitration association for arbitration against and several subcontractors for damages arising from negligent design and construction of both projects.objected to the arbitration on several grounds,including that some of the claims were barred by the statute of limitations and,therefore,were not subject to arbitration under the contracts.
relevant to the statute of limitations issue,the arbitration clauses in both contracts provide 
claims,disputes or other matters in question between the parties to this agreement arising out of or relating to this agreement or breach thereof shall be subject to and decided by arbitration in accordance with the construction industry arbitration rules of the american arbitration association currently in effect unless the parties mutually agree otherwise.
demand for arbitration shall be filed in writing with the other party to this agreement and with the american arbitration association.a demand for arbitration shall be made within a reasonable time after the claim,dispute or other matter in question has arisen.in no event shall the demand for arbitration be made after the date when institution of legal or equitable proceedings based on such claim,dispute or other matter in question would be barred by the applicable statutes of limitations.
after the arbitrators ruled adversely to on several issues,including the statute of limitations,filed a complaint for declaratory relief against vero club,phase i,and ced.asserted that only vero club and phase i,and not ced,were authorized to bring the arbitration claims because the contracts were not assignable.also raised the statute of limitations defense and asserted that the trial court was required to decide this issue.the trial court entered an order compelling the completion of arbitration and staying the circuit court case.regarding statute of limitations defense,the trial court found that this issue was a matter for the arbitrators to decide.
appealed the order to the fifth district.in a brief decision,the fifth district affirmed the trial court in all respects.see,so d at.the district court wrote only to reiterate that an issue concerning whether a demand for arbitration is timely is a question of fact to be decided by arbitration,and not the trial court.this concept encompasses the position that arbitration is unnecessary because of the expiration of the statute of limitations.id.citations omitted.however,the fifth district certified conflict with reuter recycling,in which the fourth district reviewed an arbitration agreement that contained similar language regarding timeliness and reversed the trial court order refusing to enjoin the arbitration 
both parties agree that the florida arbitration code fac,rather than the federal arbitration act faa,applies in this case.because both parties are florida corporations involved in florida construction projects,interstate commerce is not involved and,thus,the provisions of the fac control.musnick king motor,cir t he faa applies to all arbitration agreements involving interstate commerce citing circuit city stores,adams,d wachovia securities,llc vogel,so d,dca where interstate commerce is involved,federal law governs the analysis of the arbitration proceeding.
the fac provides that t wo or more parties may include in a written contract a provision for the settlement by arbitration of any controversy thereafter arising between them relating to such contract or the failure or refusal to perform the whole or any part thereof.stat.emphasis supplied.if a dispute arises regarding a party refusal to comply with an agreement to arbitrate,the court is required to compel arbitration if it is satisfied that no substantial issue exists as to the making of the agreement or provision.stat.
in ruling on a motion to compel arbitration of a dispute,the court must consider three issues whether a valid written agreement to arbitrate exists whether an arbitrable issue exists and whether the right to arbitration was waived.seifert home,so d.the issue here,whether statute of limitations defense to an otherwise arbitrable claim is also subject to arbitration,falls under the second of these considerations 
arbitration clauses are creatures of contract.as a result,courts look to the intent of the parties as manifested in the contract to determine whether an arbitration clause compels arbitration of a particular dispute.seifert,so d at.thus,whether statute of limitations defense is subject to arbitration is a matter of contract interpretation that is reviewed de novo.see engle homes,jones,so d,dca hirshenson spaccio,so d,dca.
in,city of sanibel,so d dca,the second district court of appeal held that under the fac,an arbitration clause almost identical to the clause in contracts required the parties to arbitrate a statute of limitations defense.id.at in reaching this decision,the district court recognized that doubts concerning the scope of arbitration agreements should be resolved in favor of arbitration and noted that the plain language of the parties broad arbitration provision required arbitration on all issues related to the contract.id.at.the second district acknowledged that the fourth district had reached a contrary conclusion in anstis ornstein associates,architects planners,palm beach county,so d dca,but agreed with then judge anstead dissent 
the arbitration clause in question is a broad and comprehensive one covering all disputes between the parties.another clause provided that the claim for arbitration must be filed within a reasonable time,not to exceed the applicable legal limitation period.i see no reason why the arbitrators can not properly resolve any dispute between the parties as to compliance with this provision.
so d at quoting anstis ornstein,so d at anstead,dissenting.
is consistent with decisions by the first and third district courts of appeal,which have also held that in general,issues of timeliness are to be decided by the arbitrator.see alderman city of jacksonville,fire and rescue,so d,dca q uestions of timeliness are to be decided by an arbitrator,not a trial court.pembroke indus.park jazayri,so d,dca t he issue of whether the demand for arbitration was timely is a question of fact for the arbitrator to decide,not the trial court.
is also consistent with recent united states supreme court decisions addressing this issue under the faa.see howsam dean witter reynolds,d howsam clarified the scope of the supreme court prior determination that a question of arbitrability is an issue for judicial
