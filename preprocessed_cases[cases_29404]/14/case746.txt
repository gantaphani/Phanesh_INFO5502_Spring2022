plaintiff affholder,affholder,a subcontractor,appeals from a judgment entered in favor of defendant mitchell engineering,mitchell or mitchell engineering,a prime contractor,on its complaint for a violation of the subletting and subcontracting fair practices act pub.contract code,et the act or subcontracting act affholder contends that the trial court erred in granting mitchell summary judgment because there is a triable issue as to whether mitchell improperly refused to award affholder a subcontract on a public works project after the sacramento county sanitation district the district,the awarding authority,issued a change order affecting the work to be performed on the project.we conclude that summary judgment was properly granted because the change order deleted the work for which affholder had submitted a bid,and the district determined that the change order relieved mitchell of its statutory obligation to enter a subcontract with affholder.
factual and procedural history 
in october,mitchell submitted a bid to the district to be the prime contractor for the bradshaw interceptor section road improvements project the project.the project consisted of the construction of sewer interceptor pipes and roadway improvements in sacramento county,and included the construction of two segmented precast concrete tunnels which were to be excavated by an earth pressure balanced tunnel boring machine ept tbm.affholder,a tunnel contractor,submitted a proposal to mitchell for the performance of the tunnel work,described as bid items and affholder proposal states,the tunnel s will be constructed per specifications,or better,with bolted and gasketed segmental primary lining behind an epb tbm.affholder proposal to mitchell included for bid item number,the jackson highway tunnel,and for bid item number,the morrison creek tunnel.mitchell listed affholder in its bid to the district as the subcontractor for the micro tunnel portion of the work.on november,the district awarded mitchell the contract for the project.
before entering into a subcontract with affholder,mitchell submitted to the district,pursuant to sacramento county construction incentive change proposal cicp program,a proposal to change the method of tunneling a cicp is a formally written proposal for a contract change order.the program provides an opportunity for the contractor to use his expertise to improve the contract performance to create an overall reduction in the total contract price.if the proposal is approved by the awarding authority,the contractor shares in the cost savings.
when affholder learned that mitchell had submitted a cicp relating to the tunnel work,it demanded that mitchell award affholder a subcontract and include it in the cicp negotiations with the district.in april,affholder attorney sent mitchell a letter warning that any attempt by mitchell engineering to shop other bids for the tunnel work on the project will constitute a violation of the subcontracting act.affholder stated that it was willing to negotiate a change order reflecting the changes set forth in mitchell engineering cicp and stated that it would pursue legal action if mitchell did not provide affholder with a subcontract for the tunnel work on the project mitchell explained,the work affholder bid for and for which it was listed is being deleted by the district.affholder is not entitled to a subcontract for change order work,or for work it did not bid,and for which it is not listed.there is no improper substitution.
in may,mitchell confirmed with the district an agreement to use an alternate tunneling method for the project.on june,mitchell sent affholder and other approved tunnel contractors a request for proposals to perform the newly specified work affholder did not submit such a proposal,instead continuing to insist that it was entitled to be awarded a subcontract to perform the originally specified work and then to negotiate a change order with mitchell.
on june,the district issued change order,which provides,in accordance with county standard specification,this cicp changes the specified bid tunneling work.specification sections,and are deleted in their entirety and are replaced with new specification sections,and.bid item rcp jackson highway crossing tunnel in the amount of is hereby deleted.bid item rcp morrison creek crossing tunnel in the amount of is hereby deleted.a new item titled open face shield tunneling is hereby added in the amount of.
on august,affholder filed a superior court complaint alleging that mitchell refused to award it a subcontract for the tunnel work in violation of the act.after receiving affholder complaint,mitchell sent a letter to the district respectfully request ing the district confirm that in this situation,affholder is not a listed subcontractor on the above referenced contract,because the scope of work specified in affholder bid was deleted by change order,and that mitchell is not required to request a substitution for the performance of change order,by reason of public contract code section c.in december,the district confirmed that o nce change order was adopted by the district,mitchell engineering was released from its contractually listed tunnel subcontractor.in the same letter,the district also stated that it has no objection to your chosen subcontractor kiewit to perform the tunnel work kiewit was chosen from the list of tunnel contractors developed by the district for this work.
mitchell moved for summary judgment and the court ultimately granted the motion.the court concluded that mitchell did not violate the act because the district change order deleted the work affholder bid to perform and added new work which affholder did not bid and was not listed to perform.the court also found a s a separate and independent basis for granting summary judgment,that to the extent that a triable issue of fact could be found as to whether all of affholder work was deleted,and to the extent that a triable issue of fact could be found as to whether kiewit pacific performed work to which affholder was entitled to perform,mitchell still did not violate section because mitchell asked the district to confirm that affholder was not a listed subcontractor and the district stated that once change order was adopted by the district,mitchell engineering was released from its contractually listed tunnel subcontractor.affholder filed a timely notice of appeal.
discussion 
standard of review 
the standard of review applicable to summary judgment entered by the trial court is de novo.our review of a summary judgment is limited to determining upon a de novo examination whether there was no genuine issue of material fact and the moving party was entitled to judgment as a matter of law.scroggs coast community college dist.d.the purpose of a summary judgment proceeding is to permit a party to show that material factual claims arising from the pleadings need not be tried because they are not in dispute.citation.the function of the pleadings in a motion for summary judgment is to delimit the scope of the issues the function of the affidavits or declarations is to disclose whether there is any triable issue of fact within the issues delimited by the pleadings.citations.the complaint measures the materiality of the facts tendered in a defendant challenge to the plaintiff cause of action.fpi development,nakashima d.
statutory overview 
the subcontracting act regulates contracts for public works.under the act,a general contractor submitting a bid on a public contract must list each subcontractor that will perform more than of percent of the total bid.citation.the listing does not create an express or implied contract between the contractor and subcontractor.citations.once the general contractor bid is accepted,however,the general contractor has a statutory duty to use the listed subcontractor,unless one of nine statutory enumerated circumstances exist.brady golden th,d,italics omitted,subd.a.under subdivision c of section,a prime contractor may not o ther than in the performance of change orders causing changes or deviations from the original contract,sublet or subcontract any portion of the work in excess of of percent of the prime contractor total bid as to which his or her original bid did not designate a subcontractor.see also if a prime contractor fails to specify a subcontractor for work to be performed under the contract in excess of of percent of the prime contractor total bid,the prime contractor shall perform that portion himself or herself.
if the named subcontractor is unlawfully removed or substituted for a reason not authorized by the statute,the removal permits the subcontractor to maintain a cause of action against the prime contractor.citation.as explained by our supreme court,the act confers the right on the listed subcontractor to perform the subcontract unless statutory grounds for a valid substitution exist t hat right may be enforced by an action for damages against the prime contractor to recover the benefit of the bargain the listed subcontractor would have realized had he not wrongfully been deprived of the subcontract.citation.the legislature enacted this statutory scheme to address perceived problems with subcontractor financial solvency and the quality of subcontractor work on public projects.in particular,the legislature wanted to ensure the awarding authority would have the opportunity to investigate and approve the initial subcontractors and any proposed substitutions citation and prevent bid shopping and bid peddling after the prime contract has been awarded.citation.bid shopping is the use of the low bid already received by the general contractor to pressure other subcontractors into submitting even lower bids.bid peddling is an attempt by a subcontractor to undercut known bids already submitted to the general contractor in order to procure the job.citation.these practices often result in financial difficulties for subcontractors and poor workmanship brady golden,supra,th at,d,italics omitted.
mitchell contends that section,subdivision c recognizes that the prime contractor is not bound to utilize a listed subcontractor for the performance of change order work.it argues that it is not possible to list subcontractors who will perform change order work at the time the prime contractor submits its bid to the owner because change order work does not exist at that time,for which reason subdivision c makes an exception for change order work.according to affholder,section,subdivision a required mitchell to award it a subcontract for the tunnel work and section subdivision c has no application.subdivision c,it argues,applies only if the prime contractor did not designate a subcontractor italics omitted and mitchell did designate affholder to perform the tunnel work.according to affholder,a llowing a prime contractor such as mitchell to utilize section,subdivision c,in instances where the prime contractor had listed a subcontractor would vitiate the listing law and create an exception that swallows the rule set forth in section,subdivision a.
section,subdivision c does not provide an exception for all change order work,but only for the performance of change orders causing changes or deletions from the original contract.while most change orders will to some extent cause a change or deletion in the originally specified work the qualification in subdivision c implies a qualitative and quantitative evaluation of the significance of the change.if the change order does not involve a change of significance,a prime contractor who did not list a subcontractor for the performance of the particular work may not subcontract out the work,in violation of section.and,if the prime contractor did list a subcontractor to perform that work,it may not make a substitution in violation of section,subdivision a.however,if the change order does call for the performance of new work that can reasonably be construed as outside the scope of the originally specified work,subdivision c permits the prime contractor to subcontract out that work even though no subcontractor was initially specified.subdivision c does not state explicitly that if the change order calls for work outside the scope of the original contract documents the prime contractor may itself perform the new work,but additional language to that effect is unnecessary since the prime contractor is always authorized to perform work for which no subcontractor has been listed.similarly,subdivision c does not authorize a substitution of subcontractors under subdivision a for a significant change order because,necessarily,no subcontractor previously was or could have been listed to perform the new work,and no substitution is involved.
in the present case,the district left no doubt that change order was intended to call for the performance of new and different work not within the scope of the original specifications.the change order explicitly deleted the original specifications and replaced them with a new set of specifications the change order also explicitly deleted the two bid items on which affholder had bid and replaced them with a new item,at a reduction in cost of some million.in opposing summary judgment,affholder contended that change order did not delete bid items and,but the change order is in the record and unambiguously does delete those bid items.affholder position comes down to the argument that the differences between the original and the newly specified work are not sufficiently substantial to have justified deletion of the bid items.instead,the argument implies,the change order should simply have modified the specifications to which bid items and applied,making clear that the changes were within the scope of the work on which the contract was originally bid.
the declarations submitted in support of and in opposition to the summary judgment motion present conflicting views as to the significance of the changes in the method of tunneling.this conflict in the evidence does not preclude summary judgment,however,because there is no question how these changes were treated in the change order the decision to delete the original bid items in their entirety and to replace them with a new bid item was within the discretion of the district as the awarding authority.see interior systems,del webb d.see also authorizing awarding agency to consent to substitution of subcontractors under specified conditions,a prime contractor violating any of the provisions of this chapter violates his or her contract and the awarding authority may exercise the option,in its own discretion,of canceling his or her contract or assessing the prime contractor a penalty in an amount of not more than percent of the amount of the subcontract involved.if the district abused its discretion in issuing change order,affholder should have taken legal action to compel the district to revise the change order.interior systems,del webb,supra,at.if awarding authority approves substitution of a listed subcontractor on a statutorily recognized ground,a cause of action for damages for breach of statutory duty simply can not be permitted unless the decision of the awarding authority is set aside by mandamus.absent judicial invalidation,mitchell was entitled to rely upon the action taken by the district.in doing so,it did not act unlawfully and it is not subject to liability for violating the subcontracting act.ibid.
this conclusion is not inconsistent with the decision in southern cal.acoustics holder,cal d,in which a prime contractor was held liable for substituting subcontractors even though the substitution was approved,wrongly,by the awarding authority.there,the substitution was made on a ground that was clearly unauthorized by section and not within the discretion of the awarding authority.id.at.in the present case,the district had the authority to define and to modify the scope of the contract bid items.there is no evidence that the district acted collusively or in bad faith.hence,unless and until the district change order was set aside,mitchell was entitled to act upon its terms.
there is yet another way to view the situation,which also confirms the propriety of the summary judgment.if,as affholder contends,the modified tunnel work should be regarded as within the scope of the original bid item so that perf
