introduction 
a subcontractor employee,while working at a multiemployer construction site,was slightly injured by a preexisting,nonobvious hazard that had not been created in the course of the subcontractor work.the employee told his foreman about the incident,but the foreman did not report it to the general contractor.shortly thereafter,two employees of the general contractor were severely injured by the same hazard.
can the injured employees of the general contractor sue the subcontractor for negligence,based on the subcontractor failure to warn the general contractor about the hazard we hold that neither the common law nor the applicable construction contract created a duty on the part of the subcontractor to take affirmative steps to protect those working for other employers from hazards not created by the subcontractor.
however,we conclude that the subcontractor did have a statutory duty of care,created by applicable workplace safety statutes and regulations requiring the subcontractor to report hazards to which its employees were exposed.under california supreme court case law,one who breaches such a duty is liable in tort.accordingly,we reverse the trial court grant of summary judgment to the subcontractor.
ii.factual and procedural background 
in january,appellants miguel suarez and luis avila were working for a construction company called all bay contractors,all bay.all bay was the general contractor on a tenant improvement project on which appellants were working the project.all bay hired respondent pacific northstar mechanical,pnm as a subcontractor to install only the heating,ventilation,and air conditioning hvac components of the project.
before appellants began working on the project,an unguarded electrical circuit,to which an ungrounded light fixture the ungrounded fixture was wired,was installed on the premises on which appellants were working.neither all bay nor any of the subcontractors on the project,including pnm,had been hired to do any work with the ungrounded fixture,and pnm did not install it.
on january,during the course of appellants work on the project,suarez climbed to the top of a ladder inside the building that was being remodeled,so as to make some marks on the ceiling,and grabbed an to steady himself while on the ladder.meanwhile,avila was standing on the floor holding the ladder.unbeknownst to suarez,the light fixture that was hanging from the he grabbed was the ungrounded fixture.when suarez grabbed the,he immediately received an electric shock,fell off the ladder,and landed on avila,resulting in injuries to both men.
on november,appellants filed a complaint in san mateo county superior court against the owner of the property on which the project was located.the complaint alleged two causes of action one for premises liability,and one for general negligence.
on march,appellants filed an amendment to their complaint substituting pnm for a fictitious defendant.on may,appellants filed an amended complaint alleging that the ungrounded fixture that caused their injuries was installed by the previous owners of the property,who had failed to disclose the latent hazard to the defendant that owned the property at the time of the project.the amended complaint also alleged that before appellants were injured,a pnm employee encountered the ungrounded fixture and failed to report the problem to other contractors or to the property owner.
on august,pnm filed a motion for summary judgment,or,in the alternative,for summary adjudication of issues.in support of its motion,pnm relied on the following facts pnm did not own,lease,occupy or control the property where the accident occurred pnm work on the hvac installation did not create any dangerous conditions at the project pnm was not hired to inspect or work on the ungrounded fixture and pnm did not work on or use the ungrounded fixture.
in their opposition to the motion,appellants did not dispute these facts.however,appellants introduced evidence that approximately three weeks before they were injured,pnm employees were working in the room where the ungrounded fixture was located,and that pnm learned of the dangerous condition at this time,and did not warn anyone about it or correct the problem.specifically,appellants produced evidence that a pnm employee named rafael campos,campos suffered an electric shock from the ungrounded fixture while pnm workers were in the location,receiving only minor injuries.appellants also produced evidence that a pnm foreman who happened also to be campos father,juan rafael campos campos knew about campos injury before appellants were injured 
in their opposition to the summary judgment motion,appellants introduced evidence supporting the contention that before appellants were injured,no one at pnm informed all bay,or anyone else in authority at the project,about any injury to campos,or about the existence of the ungrounded fixture.in its reply papers,pnm contended that these facts were irrelevant,but did not dispute them.
appellants also relied on deposition testimony from campos,campos,and pnm owner to the effect that they each had an obligation to report the existence of safety hazards at the jobsite to all bay.pnm owner testified that one purpose of pnm policy of requiring such reports was to protect all of the workers at the jobsite,not just those employed by pnm.
the motion for summary judgment was heard on november.on december,the trial court entered a formal order granting pnm motion for summary judgment,and ruling on the parties respective evidentiary objections.on february,the court entered judgment in favor of pnm.this timely appeal ensued.
iii.discussion 
appellants acknowledge that their premises liability cause of action does not lie against pnm,and that the trial court properly granted summary judgment in pnm favor on that cause of action.thus,the sole issue on appeal is whether summary judgment was properly granted as to appellants cause of action against pnm for negligence.

negligence and duty of care 
actionable negligence is traditionally regarded as involving the following a legal duty to use due care a breach of that duty and the breach as the proximate or legal cause of the resulting injury.witkin,summary of cal.law ed.torts.the threshold element of a cause of action for negligence is the existence of a duty to use due care toward an interest of another that enjoys legal protection against unintentional invasion.citations.whether this essential prerequisite to a negligence cause of action has been satisfied in a particular case is a question of law to be resolved by the court.citations.citation.paz state of california cal th,d,see also gilmer ellington th,d.
as appellants recognize,it is undisputed that pnm had nothing to do with the installation of the ungrounded fixture that resulted in their injury.however,for purposes of this summary judgment appeal,we must accept appellants factual assertion that before appellants were injured,pnm acquired actual knowledge of the hazard posed by the ungrounded fixture,due to the injury it caused to campos.appellants cause of action against pnm is premised on the contention that despite this knowledge,pnm neither informed all bay about the hazard,nor took any other action to protect others from the danger 
under standard common law tort principles,a person who has not created a peril is not liable in tort merely for failure to take affirmative action to assist or protect another unless there is some relationship between them which gives rise to a duty to act.citations.williams state of california cal d.liability for nonfeasance is limited to situations in which there is a special relationship that creates a duty to act.citations.the basic idea is often referred to as the no duty to aid rule,which remains a fundamental and rule of tort law as a rule,one has no duty to come to the aid of another.a person who has not created a peril is not liable in tort merely for failure to take affirmative action to assist or protect another unless there is some relationship between them which gives rise to a duty to act.citation.seo all makes overhead doors th,d seo.
thus,the first issue presented by this appeal is whether pnm,as a subcontractor on a multiemployer construction site,had a common law duty to appellants,who were not its own employees,to take action to protect them from a nonobvious hazard in the workplace that pnm knew about,but did not create.at common law,certain special relationships were recognized as creating an affirmative duty to take action to assist or protect another,such that a failure to act could give rise to a tort cause of action.examples of these traditional special relationships include that between common carriers and their passengers that between innkeepers and their guests and that between school district and its students.seo,supra,th at,d.
the common law did not,however,recognize such a special relationship between an employer,such as pnm,and the employees of another employer who are present at the same worksite.appellants do not argue otherwise.instead,they invite this court to extend the general common law concept of duty arising from a special relationship to the present situation.we decline to do so.because the traditional weighing process using the seven factors set forth in rowland christian cal d,has already been done by courts over the centuries in formulating the no duty to aid rule in the context of liability for nonfeasance,it is not necessary to engage in the weighing process in a particular case.citation.seo,supra,th at,d.
the common law does recognize,however,that a special relationship of the type that gives rise to a duty to take affirmative action to protect another may be created by contract,or by a statute or government regulation.seo,supra,th at,d see also elsner uveges cal th,fn,d,statutes may be borrowed in the negligence context to establish a duty of care.in the present case,appellants argue that both by virtue of the contract between pnm and all bay,and under certain statutes and regulations governing workplace safety,once pnm discovered a latent hazard at the project worksite,pnm had a duty to appellants to disseminate a warning about the hazard.we next turn to these alternative theories of duty.
contract as source of duty 
the contract between all bay and pnm included a paragraph entitled precautions precautions provision that addressed pnm duties with regard to safety on the project.the precautions provision read in its entirety as follows pnm shall promptly take all precautions which are necessary and adequate against any conditions created during the progress of the work which conditions involve a risk of bodily harm to others or a risk of damage to property,including the property of the premises owner and all bay.pnm shall continuously inspect the work and all facilities utilized by pnm in performing the work to discover and determine any such conditions.pnm shall take all precautions to protect the work of all bay or other subcontractors from damage arising from the performance of,or failure to perform the work.original capitalization omitted.
the existence and language of the contract are undisputed,and neither party has proffered disputed extrinsic evidence relating to its meaning.accordingly,the proper interpretation of the contract is a question of law for the court,and our standard of review on this issue is de novo.roden amerisourcebergen th,d witkin,summary of cal.law,supra,contracts.
it is not disputed that the conditions which injured appellants,the ungrounded fixture were not created during the progress of the work,nor were they facilities utilized by pnm in performing the work.as we read the contract,that means that these conditions did not fall within the ambit of the phrase such conditions in the contractual provision requiring pnm to continuously inspect the work to discover and determine any such conditions.accordingly,we agree with pnm that the language of the precautions clause can not be read as creating a tort duty on pnm part to protect the employees of all bay from a hazard at the project worksite that was not created by any act or omission of pnm during the course of its own work on the hvac system.
statutes and regulations as source of duty 
as already noted,the existence of a tort duty may be premised on a statute or regulation requiring the defendant to act in a particular manner.elsner uveges,supra,cal th at,d.in,the legislature amended labor code section to provide that the statutes governing workplace safety et cal osha,as well as occupational safety and health standards adopted under cal osha,are admissible under evidence code sections and in the same manner as any other statute,ordinance,or regulation.see stats,ch.
in,after thorough consideration of the legislative history of the amendment,the california supreme court concluded that under the current version of the statute,plaintiffs may use cal osha provisions to show a duty or standard of care to the same extent as any other regulation or statute,whether the defendant is their employer or a third party.elsner uveges,supra,cal th at,d.thus,in its current form,section codifies the common law doctrine of negligence per se,pursuant to which statutes and regulations may be used to establish duties and standards of care in negligence actions.id.at,d,fn.omitted.
appellants argue that pnm had a duty of care to them under section,which is also part of cal osha.that section provides a every employer shall furnish employment and a place of employment that is safe and healthful for the employees therein.b on multiemployer worksites,both construction and nonconstruction,citations may be issued only to the following categories of employers when the division has evidence that an employee was exposed to a hazard in violation of any requirement enforceable by the division the employer whose employees were exposed to the hazard the exposing employer.the employer who actually created the hazard the creating employer.the employer who was responsible,by contract or through actual practice,for safety and health conditions on the worksite,which is the employer who had the authority for ensuring that the hazardous condition is corrected the controlling employer.the employer who had the responsibility for actually correcting the hazard the correcting employer.the employers listed in paragraphs to,inclusive,of this subdivision may be cited regardless of whether their own employees were exposed to the hazard.
assuming that campos was injured by contact with the ungrounded fixture,pnm would qualify as an exposing employer under section,subdivision b,as one whose employees were exposed to the hazard.pnm argues that this language plain ly applies only to an employer own employees,and not to other persons who are exposed after a pnm employee has been exposed.we do not agree that the language of the statute makes it clear that an exposing employer in c
