uniwill appeals the dismissal of its lawsuit for inverse condemnation after the successful demurrer of defendant city of los angeles the city and the subsequent judgment on the pleadings entered in favor of southern california edison company edison.the trial court ruled that uniwill complaint was a challenge to the conditions of a tract map tract map which,pursuant to government code section,was required to be filed within days of imposition of the challenged conditions.the court also ruled that the complaint failed to state a cause of action for inverse condemnation against edison.we determine that the court erred in both findings,and so reverse the judgment.
uniwill is the owner of a parcel of real property near downtown los angeles.wishing to develop a shopping center on the property,uniwill applied to the city advisory agency for a tentative tract map tentative tract map in august.the advisory agency issued tentative tract map on december,approving construction of uniwill project subject to certain conditions.based on that approval,uniwill obtained the necessary building permits,arranged construction financing,and commenced construction of the project,valued at between and million.
pursuant to the provisions of government code section uniwill had days after issuance of the tentative tract map to challenge any condition contained therein by filing a petition for writ of mandate.uniwill was satisfied with the conditions of the tract map,and so did not file a writ petition.
when the construction was well underway grading and underground excavations were complete,rough plumbing and utilities had been installed,and foundations for major structures had been erected,which work together represented approximately to percent of the work to be done on the project,and after uniwill had expended some million,the city and edison informed uniwill that the city would not certify to the advisory agency that uniwill had complied with the conditions of the tentative tract map unless and until uniwill conveyed to edison an easement for a communications cable valued at to,completed certain trenching work costing approximately,and paid a fee.because uniwill was then incurring interest costs alone of per day and had executed leases which required it to complete construction and deliver occupancy to the lessees on a certain timetable,uniwill determined that it was economically unfeasible to stop the project and commence litigation to vindicate its rights.consequently,uniwill complied with the city unlawful exaction under protest and,after completing the project,filed suit in inverse condemnation.
the city demurred to the complaint.however,rather than admit the allegations of the complaint for purposes of the demurrer,the city contradicted the allegations of the complaint.it requested that the trial court take judicial notice of the tentative tract map,which it contended contained the edison easement.specifically,the city cited condition c of tentative tract map as the condition which uniwill was required to challenge by petition for writ of mandate.that condition reads that satisfactory arrangements be made with both the water system and the power system of the department of water and power with respect to water mains,fire hydrants,service connections and public utility easements.the city also pointed to the notes to tentative tract map,which provide satisfactory arrangements shall be made with the los angeles department of water and power,power system,to pay for removal,relocation,replacement or adjustment of power facilities due to this development.the subdivider must make arrangements for the underground installation of all new utility lines in conformance with section n of the los angeles municipal code.
the city further argued that,even if the condition did not appear in the tentative tract map,the statute of limitations contained in government code section expired whether it began to run upon issuance of the tentative tract map december,the date the city notified uniwill of the requirement may,the date uniwill granted the easement to edison october,or the date of issuance of the final tract map february.plaintiff claims that these dates are irrelevant because this is an inverse condemnation action with a statute of limitations.travis county of santa cruz cal th,d,statute of limitations for action arising out of the title to real property applies to inverse condemnation action based on a physical taking code civ,see also code civ,limitation for action for the recovery of real property.
in its order on demurrer to the original complaint,the trial court rejected the city argument that the condition appeared in the tentative tract map there is nothing alleged in the complaint that work occurred was part of a process.this conclusion is by the record.the utility easement language of the tentative tract map speaks only of easements to the department of water and power not to edison for relocation of existing easements not for granting new easements with respect to water and power facilities not for communications cables due to this development not for the benefit of property other than that under development.thus,the trial court properly concluded that the city was not entitled to judgment based on its primary argument that the edison easement was contained in the tentative tract map.
the trial court nevertheless rejected plaintiff claim that the complaint was timely filed and ruled in the city favor,finding that the statute of limitations commenced on may.pursuant to government code,any challenge to any condition imposed on a parcel map must be raised within days of the date that the condition is imposed.the complaint herein was filed on august.it is unclear from the pleadings whether the claims were properly brought within days prior to august.leave to amend is therefore warranted.
uniwill filed a first amended complaint,again alleging that the condition of which it complained was not a condition of the tentative tract map and,for that very reason,could not be a condition for issuance of the final tract map final tract map.since it was not imposed as part of the permitting process,but was simply coerced in an informal but highly effective manner after uniwill had obtained all of the permits necessary to complete its project,it was not the decision of an advisory agency which could only be challenged in a mandamus proceeding pursuant to government code section.rather,it was a physical taking of property subject to a five year limitations period.
the city again demurred.the trial court ruled that,pursuant to government code section,uniwill was required to commence an action or proceeding within days after may,when it learned of the city demand that uniwill grant the edison easement,and that its failure to do so barred the action.thus,notwithstanding the fact that the court agreed with uniwill that the edison easement was not a condition of the tentative tract map,the court apparently concluded that the easement was at least a de facto condition of the final tract map,and therefore had to be challenged,if at all,within days of imposition of the condition.
uniwill timely appeals the court ruling.

first,there is no dispute regarding the general rule applicable to permit conditions which a landowner claims constitute a taking of property.that rule states that when a governmental agency conditions its approval of a project on the grant of an easement,payment of a fee,or any other exaction which would otherwise constitute a taking requiring compensation,the property owner must challenge the condition by petition for writ of mandate before or simultaneously with filing a lawsuit for inverse condemnation.or,put another way,a landowner who accepts and complies with the conditions of a building permit can not later sue the issuing public entity for inverse condemnation for the cost of compliance.citations.instead,the property owner is generally limited to having the condition invalidated by a proceeding for writ of mandate.salton bay marina,imperial irrigation dist.d.
