iii.discussion 
motion to transfer 
ehs first appeals the district court denial of its motion to transfer action confirmation lawsuit to the district court for the western district of tennessee.for the convenience of parties and witnesses,in the interest of justice,a district court may transfer any civil action to any other district or division where it might have been brought.a.the determination of convenience turns on a number of public and private interest factors none of which can be said to be of dispositive weight.syndicate at lloyd london early am,cir.
ehs contends that the western district of tennessee is a more convenient venue than the northern district of mississippi because the application of tennessee law is integral to this case.this argument is without merit.first,ehs fails to establish that the mississippi district court was either unable or unwilling to apply tennessee law.second,the mississippi district court appears to have been the most convenient venue for the parties and potential witnesses.action principal place of business is in mississippi,the agreement was executed in mississippi,and the contested arbitration was held in mississippi.we therefore find that the district court did not abuse its discretion by denying ehs motion to transfer.
vacatur standard 
ehs next appeals the district court application of the faa vacatur standard.it contends that the arbitration award should be reviewed under the broader vacatur standard outlined in the tennessee uniform arbitration act tuaa 
arbitration under the faa is a matter of consent,not coercion,and parties are generally free to structure their arbitration agreements as they see fit.volt info,bd.of trustees of leland sanford junior,d.just as parties may limit by contract the issues which they will arbitrate,so too may they specify by contract the rules under which that arbitration will be conducted.id.accordingly,this court has consistently held that parties may modify the faa standard of arbitration review.harris parker coll.of chiropractic,cir see also hughes training cook,cir an arbitration agreement may therefore expand judicial review of an arbitration award beyond the scope of the federal arbitration act.
faa rules apply absent clear and unambiguous contractual language to the contrary.mastrobuono shearson lehman hutton,d hughes training,at.in general,this court permits arbitration under rules if a contract expressly references state arbitration law,or if its arbitration clause specifies with certain exactitude how the faa rules are to be modified.for example,in gateway technologies,mci telecommunications,cir,we held that a clause stating that t he arbitration decision shall be final and binding on both parties,except that errors of law shall be subject to appeal evinced the parties clear intent to depart from the faa vacatur standard emphasis added.in harris,at,we found that a contract providing that t he award of the arbitrator shall be binding on the parties hereto,although each party shall retain his right to appeal any questions of law demonstrated a similar intent to modify the faa standard emphasis added.in ford nylcare health plans of the gulf coast,cir,we held that a contract which specifically referenced the texas general arbitration act unambiguously expressed the parties intent to supercede the faa rules with texas arbitration law.
in this case,the agreement fails to expressly reference the tuaa and its arbitration clause does not in any way modify or replace the faa rules ehs nonetheless contends that the parties intent to replace the faa vacatur standard can be gleaned from the agreement general provision,which provides that tennessee law governs contractual execution and performance we disagree.
in mastrobuono shearson lehman hutton,d,the supreme court held that a contract provision did not evince the parties clear intent to opt out of the faa default rules.mastrobuono involved a dispute between a securities broker and two of its customers.id.at.the parties agreed to resolve any disputes by arbitration,but stipulated that the entire agreement would be governed by new york law in holding that new york law did not govern the arbitration,the court reasoned that the provision should be read,at most,to include only new york substantive rights and obligations,and not the state allocation of power between alternative tribunals.id.at.
in the wake of mastrobuono,this court has held that a provision is insufficient,by itself,to demonstrate the parties clear intent to depart from the faa default rules.see ford,at holding that a contract provision did not determine the scope of an arbitration clause our sister circuits have reached the same result.in a case directly on point,the third circuit held that an arbitration clause and a generic clause do not demonstrate a clear intent to displace the faa vacatur standards and replace them with ones borrowed from state law.roadway package,kayser,cir.the court opined that we need to establish a default rule,and the one we adopt is that a generic clause,standing alone,is insufficient to support a finding that contracting parties intended to opt out of the faa default standards.id.similarly,the ninth circuit recently held that a general clause within an arbitration provision does not trump the presumption that the faa supplies the rules for arbitration.sovak chugai pharm,cir see also uhc mgmt,computer sciences,cir same ferro garrison,cir same porter hayden century indem,cir same union fire ins.belco petroleum,cir same painewebber elahi,cir same.
thus,we hold that the agreement provision does not express the parties clear intent to depart from the faa vacatur standard.because the agreement does not expressly reference the tuaa,and its arbitration clause does not modify or replace the faa rul
