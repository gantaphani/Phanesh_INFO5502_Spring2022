this diversity case arises out of a common situation in commercial dealings the failure of negotiations and the resulting bad blood between the parties.here,after a ultimately negotiation between a general contractor and a potential subcontractor,the general contractor brought suit against the subcontractor for breach of contract,claiming that at some point during the negotiations a binding contract had been formed.after for summary judgment on the question of contract formation,the district court ruled in favor of the general contractor.because we hold that no contract was formed,we reverse.
background 
tlt construction tlt,a massachusetts company,was the general contractor on renovation and expansion projects for reading memorial high school in reading,massachusetts the reading project,and wachusett regional high school in holden,massachusetts the wachusett project.in april,as tlt was preparing its bid for the reading project,ri,seating solutions seating,a new york company specializing in selling and installing spectator seating for athletic facilities,submitted a bid to tlt to install bleachers for the reading project as a subcontractor.in its proposal,seating stated,we have worked very closely with this architect and have helped them design this bleacher from the very first steps.on the record before us,it does not appear that seating bid was a filed,nor does tlt makes such a claim.see.laws ch.
on may,tlt,having been awarded both the reading and the wachusett projects,requested that seating submit a new quote that would include both projects.on may,seating quoted a price of nearly for both.tlt responded that the price was too high,and seating replied on may with a revised quote of.seating said that the price was contingent on a letter of intent being received may and an aia contract being executed by friday.tlt responded that day,seeking clarification of a few terms,including whether or not bonding was included in the quote,since a bond was required and had been included in the quotes from seating competitors.seating responded later that day that bonding was not included in the quote,and that it did not feel bonding was necessary,since it would be paid in progress payments.tlt replied,we have a deal if we can split the bond and if tlt could have retainage of seating had originally proposed no retainage.tlt also said that it would not be able to draft a contract in seating time frame,but that it could provide a letter of intent.seating agreed to accept a letter of intent,and granted tlt two weeks to draft and execute a final contract,but said that it could not hold the price any longer than that.on the record before us,it appears that no letter of intent was ever sent.
rather,four days later,on may,tlt sent seating a draft contract along with manuals and specifications,and asked that the contract be signed and returned within five days,along with payment and performance bonds and certificates of insurance.the contract package included standard bond forms.
the record becomes more opaque at this point.it appears that a revised draft contract may have been sent on june,but that draft does not appear in the record a handwritten notation on the cover letter to the may draft contract shows that the same cover letter may have been resent on june,with the only change being that a previous line asking for return of the payment and performance bonds had been excised.the record contains no response from seating with respect to either contract until tlt contacted seating on june to request return of the signed contract.
on june,seating wrote to tlt to say that it had several issues with the draft contract.first,seating said that it had understood that no bonding would be required,and that there would be a retainage in lieu of bonding.second,seating wanted to clarify the timing for submission of shop drawings.third,seating said that its quote was made using prevailing wages,not union labor,and if tlt were to require union labor as the may draft contract did,then there would be a price increase.fourth,seating noted that the quote was exclusive of taxes,permits,and fees.this letter was apparently returned to seating with notations by tlt,but that response is not in the record.
on june,seating wrote to tlt,responding to tlt notations to seating june letter,saying that after only a few comments it could get this thing executed.first,seating said that its insurance company would not make a certain change to the language on the certificates that tlt had presumably requested.second,it said that an umbrella policy was.third,it requested a time frame for return of engineered shop drawings.on june,tlt accepted the first two changes,but did not reply to the third.tlt also requested that seating mark up the original contract with these changes and return it to tlt.
on july,seating returned a version of the may draft contract.the changes covered five areas.first,seating struck all language related to payment and performance bonds and struck out the bonding forms that had been attached.second,seating struck the language requiring union labor.third,seating struck the language requiring that insurance coverage be in the same limits as required by the owner contract of the general contractor,and inserted language that seating standard insurance limits to apply to this contract.fourth,seating struck the language making it responsible for permits and fees though it kept the language making it responsible for taxes.fifth,seating added language saying that it would provide shop drawings within six weeks of receiving the executed contract.with these changes,seating signed the draft contract and returned it to tlt.tlt neither signed nor returned this version of the contract.
the next writing in the record,perhaps after some verbal communication between the parties,is a july letter from seating to tlt.the letter provided a of additional cost if union labor was to be required.then the letter continued 
regarding the bonding,it was agreed that retainage would be held in lew sic of bonding.we will bond this and pass the cost along to you as an to the contract.when bonding is required we reserve the right,depending on our current bonding capacity at that time,to have our factory supply the required bonds.
the letter closed,if all is acceptable please forward new contracts for us to execute.
on july,tlt sent a new draft contract to seating the draft no longer required union labor,but it was otherwise unchanged with respect to seating july edits.
on july,tlt wrote to seating to request the return of the signed contracts.on august,seating wrote to say that its price would have to increase by to account for an that it had not realized was in the plans.
on august,seating provided a certification of insurance from outdoor aluminum,an affiliated company that ran seating factory,asking if it was acceptable.in addition,the letter said,per our conversation,bonding will not be an issue.they outdoor aluminum bond many projects for us and unless there is something out of the ordinary all will be done.
on august,tlt wrote back to challenge the price increase,saying that seating had the specifications showing the when it made the bid.at that point,relations deteriorated.over the next few months,the parties continued to try to reach agreement,but with decreasing levels of cooperation.tlt ultimately had the work performed by another company,at a cost of.
in december,tlt brought suit in massachusetts state court for breach of contract and violation of the massachusetts consumer protection law.laws ch.seating removed the case to the united state district court for the district of massachusetts on february.the parties agreed to have the case tried by a magistrate judge.the parties then for summary judgment on the issue of contract formation.the district court held that a contract existed and that seating had breached the court awarded damages of seating now appeals.
