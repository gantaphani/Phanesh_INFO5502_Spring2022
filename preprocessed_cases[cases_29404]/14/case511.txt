dick pjd and the secretary of veterans affairs secretary each appeal different aspects of the september,decision of the department of veterans affairs board of contract appeals board awarding in damages to pjd for contract delays that were the fault of the government.dick,vabca,et,cch,wl,va bca lexis vabca.for reasons of judicial convenience the two separately filed appeals were consolidated into a single proceeding before this court,with the secretary appeal treated as the for purposes of briefing and argument.pjd appeals the board denial of its claims for unabsorbed home office overhead damages.the secretary appeals the board conclusion that six separate contract changes the combined directives should be treated as occurring on the same date in calculating the extent of the resulting delay to contract completion.although we affirm the board conclusion that pjd was not on standby,we reverse the board denial of pjd claim for unabsorbed home office overhead because the board erred in its interpretation of the parties stipulation.because the board also erred in analyzing six separate changes to the contract occurring over ten months as a single change effective on the date of the first change,we vacate the board determination of the number of days of delay due to those changes.we therefore vacate the board damages calculations and remand for recalculation in accordance with this opinion.
these appeals are related to a contract between the department of veterans affairs dva and pjd to construct the clinical addition to the dva medical center in ann arbor,michigan.under the contract,pjd was due to complete the work by january.during the contract the government issued over orders changing the contract and causing various delays to different aspects of the project.these modifications increased the contract price by over five percent and caused the dva to grant days of additional contract performance time.in accepting the additional days to complete the contract,pjd reserved its right to seek additional impact and suspension costs.pjd completed the contract on september,days after the original contract completion date and days after the revised date.
pjd presented to the government contracting officer co claims for additional relief as a result of the delays to the contract.all of the claims were denied by the co or were deemed denied by the co failure to timely issue a decision.pjd timely appealed the co denials to the board,filing five delay appeals,an appeal for its contract balance,and an appeal for certain labor inefficiencies incurred by its electrical subcontractor.in essence,pjd claimed it was entitled to a time extension for all days of delayed performance and sought field and home office overhead damages for most of these delays.
the board reached several conclusions that are relevant to this appeal the board granted pjd a time extension for days and initially concluded that only sixty days were due under the contract suspension of work sow clause,but upon pjd motion for reconsideration,revised that number upward to days.the board granted pjd field overhead for the days damages are due under the sow clause,but determined that pjd was not entitled to damages for unabsorbed home office overhead eichleay damages because the stipulation between the parties only addressed quantum and therefore did not remove the contractor burden to prove entitlement to eichleay damages,and pjd had not shown it was on stand of several prerequisites for entitlement to eichleay damages.a large portion of the extension days granted by the board resulted from pjd claim for delays due to the combined directives.the combined directives were six separate contract change orders issued by the dva over a period,all relating to installation of certain equipment in the clinical addition.importantly for this appeal,the board analyzed the effect of each of the changes as of the date of the earliest change,which gave pjd a larger delay than it would have received were the effects of the change orders analyzed separately on the dates the dva issued them.
the secretary and pjd each appeal different aspects of the board decision.the secretary appeals the board conclusion granting days of extension for the combined directives delay.the dispute on this question is whether the language of the contract requires the board to analyze the effect of each change separately.pjd appeals the board denial of its claims for recovery of home office overhead.the primary issues here are whether the parties stipulation entitled pjd to recovery of home office overhead and,if not,whether pjd had shown the dva placed it on standby.both appeals were timely filed and we have jurisdiction pursuant to a.
although we review the board interpretation of a contract de novo,the board interpretation is accorded careful consideration due to the board considerable experience in construing government contracts.wickham contracting fischer,citation omitted.the relevant provision of the contract reads the contracting officer determination as to the total number of days of contract extension will be based upon the current schedule for the time period in question and all other relevant information.specification a emphases added.the secretary agrees with the board conclusion that the time period in question is the date an action or activity occurred on which a time extension is based.the secretary argues only that the board erred in its subsequent determination that the time period in question for all six of the changes included in the combined directives was november date the dva issued the first of those change orders.we agree.
we conclude that the language of the contract required the board to analyze the changes of the combined directives separately utilizing the most recent monthly update of the schedule.the express language of the contract establishes that the current schedule will be the basis for determining the extent of the delay.by using will the contract indicates that this is the sole method of calculating the delay.the board circumvented this language by crediting litigation arguments that the six unrelated changes issued over ten months had a unitary effect,making the time period in question the date the dva issued the first change order.this was error because the language of the contract requires the use of the current computer schedule as the basis for making such a determination.in other words,regardless of what the testimony showed,under the contract,the only way of determining the effect of the changes was to analyze each of them using the current computer schedule.thus,if the changes did have a unitary effect,it had to be demonstrated by the computer model,not the testimony pjd presented.
we therefore reverse the board determination that the combined directives should all be analyzed utilizing the october schedule update most current as of november remand for a damages analysis in accordance with this opinion on remand the board should determine whether pjd delay claims that it found were not controlling because of the combined directive delay the underground conduit and the radiology and cardiology claims become controlling as a result of any reduction in the combined directive delay and analyze them accordingly.
a board interpretation of the tests for proving entitlement to eichleay damages presents a question of law that we review de novo.west all state boiler.a board decisions with respect to the underlying facts related to those legal tests shall be upheld unless we conclude they are not supported by substantial evidence.see also b.the eichleay formula is used to calculate the amount of unabsorbed home office overhead a contractor can recover when the government suspends or delays work on a contract for an indefinite period.melka marine,united states,citing eichleay,asbca,cch ascba.to show entitlement to these eichleay damages,the contractor must first prove there was a delay to contract performance as originally planned that was not concurrent with a delay caused by the contractor or some other reason.sauer danzig.the contractor must also show that the original time for performance of the contract was thereby extended,or that he finished the contract on time or early but nonetheless incurred additional,unabsorbed overhead expenses because he had planned to finish even sooner.interstate gov t contractors,west,once the contractor has proven the above elements,it must then prove that it was required to remain on standby during that delay.id.if the contractor proves these three elements it has made a prima facie case of entitlement and a burden of production shifts to the government to show that it was not impractical for the contractor to take on replacement work and thereby mitigate its damages.melka,at if the government meets its burden of production,however,the contractor bears the burden of persuasion that it was impractical for it to obtain sufficient replacement work.id.
the board concluded that pjd was not entitled to eichleay damages because it failed to prove that it was placed on standby.more specifically,the board found that pjd was not placed on standby because pjd was able to progress other parts of the work during the time periods it alleges it was suspended.
pjd challenges the board conclusion on both legal and factual grounds.first,pjd argues the board committed legal error because,it asserts,a contractor is automatically on standby any time there is a delay of an uncertain duration extending the performance of the contract,at the end of which the contractor can be required to immediately resume work.thus,pjd argues,the board determinations that its direct billings remained substantial during the several suspension periods and that it accelerated the work on the contract are irrelevant.second,pjd argues that substantial evidence does not support the board findings that its direct billings show ed no appreciable diminution during the alleged suspension periods and that it accelerated performance of the contract.we address each argument in turn.
in evaluating pjd legal argument,we find it useful to clarify our case law delineating the standby requirement.a review of the pertinent case law shows that the standby inquiry is multifaceted.in making that inquiry,the court should first determine whether the co has issued a written order that suspends all the work on the contract for an uncertain duration and requires the contractor to remain ready to resume work immediately or on short notice.see interstate,at.in such a case,the contractor need not offer further proof of standby.in the cases where the co does not issue such a written order,the contractor must then prove standby by indirect evidence.see id.to do so,the contractor must show three things.
first,the contractor must show that the delay was not only substantial but was of an indefinite duration.see id.at.for example,where the government suspends all work on the contract,but tells the contractor work will begin again on a date certain,the contractor can not be on standby.see melka,at.
second,the contractor must show that during that delay it was required to be ready to resume work on the contract,at full speed as well as immediately.see id.our case law has not elaborated on this requirement,but it is clear that once the suspension period is over,the contractor must be required to be ready to resume full work immediately,id.at all state boiler,at.thus,where the government gives the contractor a reasonable amount of time to remobilize its work force once the suspension is lifted,the contractor can not be on standby.west,holding the contractor could not be on standby where the government gave the contractor three months to remobilize its work force on site.presumably,the same result would follow if the government required immediate resumption of the work,but only with a reduced work force and allowed the contractor to gradually increase its work force over some reasonable amount of time.see,melka,at.in addition,satisfaction of this element of standby clearly requires something more than an uncertain delay as this is a separate requirement of the case law the implication is that the contractor must be required to keep at least some of its workers and necessary equipment at the site,even if idle,ready to resume work on the contract,doing nothing or working on something elsewhere that allows them to get back to the contract site on short notice.see,sergent mech.united states.
third,the contractor must show effective suspension of much,if not all,of the work on the contract.melka,at.our early decisions do contain some statements that arguably support the notion that suspension of the work and idleness are not prerequisites to a determination that the contractor is on standby,altmayer johnson,there is no requirement that a contract be suspended before a contractor is entitled to recover under eichleay.interstate,at although idleness of workers is evidence that a contractor is on standby,performance has been suspended,it is neither conclusive nor required.at no time,however,has this court held that a contractor has been placed on standby merely because a delay of uncertain duration occurred,at the end of which the contractor must be ready to resume work.altmayer,oft cited for that proposition,held no such thing.altmayer merely held that a contractor performance of minor tasks during a suspension does not prevent it from recovering eichleay damages.altmayer,at.nor does interstate statement that idleness is not a prerequisite to standby support the idea that a contractor can be deemed on standby where there is no delay or suspension of the work.at.a closer reading of interstate indicates that its reference to idleness simply means the workers need not be physically standing by idly.id.at referencing a quote in a previous opinion and stating these two phrases stand by idly and suspend its work clearly refer to standing by in the sense that no work is being performed on the contract,not that there must be workers physically standing by idly see also id.at if the test were whether the contractor work force assigned to the contract in issue was standing by,the contractor would be penalized for,and thus deterred from,mitigating its damages for direct costs by reassigning its employees to other jobs or laying them off during the period of delay.indeed,every case where this court has held a contractor to be placed on standby has involved a complete suspension or delay of all the work or at most continued performance of only insubstantial work on the contract.see,mitchell constr.danzig,holding subcontractor was entitled to eichleay damages where it performed some work on the contract,but where most work could not proceed until the faults causing the suspension were cured all state boiler,at,holding contractor was entitled to eichleay damages where the government suspended all work on the contract satellite dalton,holding contractor was on standby where all the work on the contract was stopped,but denying recovery of eichleay damages for other reasons altmayer,at,at holding contractor was entitled to eichleay damages where work on the contract was completely suspended see also interstate,at noting that the record could support a conclusion that a contractor was on standby where all work on the contract was suspended.
in addition to being implicit in our early cases,our later decisions explicitly state that such a suspension or delay of the work on the contract is a prerequisite to a finding that the government placed the contractor on standby.melka,at see also interstate,at discussing standby as requiring suspension of work on the contract.in melka,we held that a contractor was not on standby where it was working on the contract and the government had not suspended all contract work.at.there,the government stopped work on one type of work,but,by resequencing the work under the contract,the contractor was able to perform substantial work on another type of work with comparable direct cost billings.id.at.subsequent decisions by the court of federal claims and the contract boards also followed this view of the law,pete vicari,contractor,united states,fed.cl,carousel,asbca,cch,wl,asbca lexis,at asbca,concluding contractor was not on standby where it continued to perform subst
