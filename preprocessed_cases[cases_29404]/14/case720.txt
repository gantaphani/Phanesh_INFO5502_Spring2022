a project to build a public elementary school in pleasanton suffered substantial delays.after the school was built,the general contractor,west bay builders,west bay,refused to release to the electrical subcontractor,s s cummins corporation cummins,its share of retention proceeds that the school district paid to west bay following the school completion.west bay justified its refusal to pay cummins its share of retention proceeds on the ground that cummins had contributed to delays that caused west bay to incur damages.cummins sued for breach of contract,seeking contract damages as well as statutory charges for west bay failure to make prompt payment of the retention proceeds.following a jury trial,the trial court entered judgment in favor of cummins for.
both west bay and cummins appeal from the judgment.west bay contends the judgment is not supported by substantial evidence,and asserts that the proper application of indemnity and damages caused by delay provisions in the subcontract would completely offset cummins damages,compelling a reversal of the judgment.cummins challenges the trial court calculation of statutory prompt payment charges,claiming the court erred when it concluded the percent per month charge set forth in public contract code section is applied on an annual basis rather than compounded on a monthly basis.cummins also contends the court erred by ruling that the percent per month statutory charge ceases accruing upon entry of judgment.in the published portion of the opinion,we hold that statutory prompt payment charges imposed under subdivision f of public contract code section cease to accrue upon entry of judgment and are not compounded on a monthly basis.
we affirm the judgment.
factual and procedural background 
the prime contract and the cummins subcontract 
west bay was the successful low bidder on a public works project in pleasanton known as the phoebe apperson hearst elementary school hereafter the project or school.on october,west bay entered into a prime contract with the pleasanton unified school district district to construct the school.the prime contract anticipated a contract price,before modifications or change orders,of slightly over million.
west bay hired cummins as the electrical subcontractor on the project.the contract price,as expressed in the west subcontract agreement cummins subcontract,dated october,was.the contract price rose to after accounting for approved change orders and additional work and materials requested by west bay during the course of the project.
construction delays 
the district issued the notice to proceed on november.under the original project schedule,west bay was to complete its work on august,or calendar days after work began.during the course of the project,the district awarded west bay days in time extensions,pushing the estimated date for project completion out to october.the project was not completed until september,or days past the original completion date for the project.subtracting the days of time extensions awarded by the district,the project was delayed a total of days until its completion.
from the beginning,the work fell behind the original schedule.the project was immediately beset by weather delays and problems associated with the district design for the project.there were substantial delays in commencing and completing the foundation and framing,for which west bay was responsible.
at trial,west bay presented a critical path method to assess and assign blame for delays in the project.the united states court of claims offered this definition of critical path analysis in haney united states,essentially,the critical path method is an efficient way of organizing and scheduling a complex project which consists of numerous interrelated separate small projects.each subproject is identified and classified as to the duration and precedence of the work,one could not carpet an area until the flooring is down and the flooring can not be completed until the underlying electrical and telephone conduits are installed.the data is then analyzed,usually by computer,to determine the most efficient schedule for the entire project.many subprojects may be performed at any time within a given period without any effect on the completion of the entire project.however,some items of work are given no leeway and must be performed on schedule otherwise,the entire project will be delayed.these latter items of work are on the critical path.a delay,or acceleration,of work along the critical path will affect the entire project.
out of the total of days of delay on the project,west bay expert estimated that of those days were attributable to cummins as delays to the critical path.the expert estimated that days of delay to the critical path were attributable to west bay and others,but not to cummins.the remainder of the delay was attributable to rain or project extensions granted by the district.
west bay expert divided the days of critical path delay attributable to cummins into three distinct windows or categories of delay.first,west bay focused on a notice of issued by the district inspector on december,for duct and conduit work performed by cummins.cummins corrected the duct and conduit work by december.west bay expert witness concluded that responding to the notice of delayed critical path work days,of which were attributable solely to cummins.cummins disagreed that the work to correct the duct and conduit work affected the critical path,pointing out that the early start date for the underground electrical work was originally december,one day after cummins completed the corrections to its work.
the second category of delay purportedly attributable to cummins stemmed from a lack of manpower during late.on august,west bay sent cummins a fax asking cummins to provide additional manpower and advising that other trades were being delayed.west bay expert opined that cummins delay in manning up contributed days of delay to the project critical path cummins disagreed with this assessment,arguing that the days of delay attributable to cummins were not actual days but were instead the result of west bay decision to resequence the schedule.it was not until after the project was resequenced that the alleged delays materialized.
the third category of delay blamed on cummins stemmed from one of cummins subcontractors,ceintronics,which was engaged to install low voltage items such as the smoke alarms and speakers.after signing on to perform the low voltage work,ceintronics had experienced a significant increase in the cost of its labor.ceintronics refused to man the job until the wage issue was resolved and cummins agreed to pay the extra cost.on january,west bay issued a notice to cummins to commence the low voltage electrical work or west bay would hire another company to complete the work.although ceintronics ultimately completed the job,west bay expert attributed days of delay to cummins for the period from late to early.cummins disputed this assessment,claiming that installation of the fire alarm and other low voltage items was delayed because of excessive dust caused by the grinding of the concrete floors.the low voltage items could not be installed in such a dusty environment,according to cummins site foreman.
the district settles with west bay and releases retention proceeds 
west bay submitted monthly payment requests to the district in order to receive progress payments during the course of construction.each progress payment request reflected amounts of work completed by west bay as well as the subcontractors.pursuant to the prime contract,the district was entitled to withhold percent of each progress payment.the withheld percent is referred to as retention or retention proceeds.retention proceeds were to be held by the district in an escrow account until the project was completed.in turn,west bay had the right to withhold percent from each subcontractor progress payments.
after the project was completed,west bay and the district disputed the amount owed under the prime contract as well as the proper disposition of the retention proceeds withheld by the district during the course of the project.the district identified roughly in disputed work items that remained to be installed or repaired.the district also claimed the project was completed days beyond the adjusted contract completion date,entitling the district to in liquidated damages under the prime contract,or for each day the project was delayed.the district facilities director described the liquidated damages assessment as a negotiable situation.west bay filed a claim for additional compensation,seeking roughly more from the district for delay costs incurred as a result of the district changes and for extra work that west bay performed.
in october,west bay settled its dispute with the district.pursuant to the settlement,the district agreed to release the remaining retention proceeds,thus paying west bay the full amount of the original contract price.in addition,the district agreed to pay an additional to west bay,composed in part of a final payment to settle the full amount of the adjusted contract price.the sum of out of the represented the settlement of claims over and above the adjusted contract price.the settlement was predicated on an assessment of liquidated damages in the amount of.the settlement amounts were unaffected by this assessment because they had already been reduced to reflect the offset for liquidated damages.therefore,in the end,west bay received the full,adjusted contract price plus over to settle its claims.
the district released of the retention proceeds to west bay on october.the other of the retention proceeds were released to west bay on november,following the october settlement between west bay and the district.
west bay refuses to release retention proceeds to cummins 
west bay withheld as retention from cummins progress payments.public contract code section,subdivision d generally provides that a subcontractor must be paid its share of retention proceeds within seven days from the time the original contractor receives all or any portion of the retention proceeds from a public agency.the original contractor may withhold from a subcontractor its portion of the retention proceeds,but only if a bona fide dispute exists between the subcontractor and the original contractor.pub.contract code,subd.e.a contractor may not withhold more than percent of the estimated value of the disputed amount.ibid.
although the district released of the retention to west bay in october,and the balance in november,west bay did not pay cummins its share of the released retention.west bay claimed to believe that cummins had delayed the critical path of the project by approximately days.west bay claimed it incurred liquidated damages imposed by the district as well as general condition costs associated with the delay.general condition costs represent the costs of remaining on the site,including expenses for phones,temporary power,toilets,rent for jobsite trailers,and salaries.west bay estimated that it incurred per day in general condition costs for each day of delay.notwithstanding its claim that it incurred damages as a consequence of cummins delay,west bay never provided any written accounting,itemized statement,or justification to cummins as to why west bay was refusing to release cummins share of the retention proceeds other than to tell cummins it had delayed the project.
cummins files stop notice 
on march,cummins filed a stop notice for.a stop notice is a remedy to reach unexpended construction funds that remain in the owner hands.see.upon receiving the stop notice,the district withheld percent of the amount specified in the notice from further progress payments to west bay.
civil code section authorizes the issuance of a stop notice release bond.after the bond is posted,the claimant remedies are limited to the bond and the public entity may no longer withhold money due the general contractor on account of the stop notice,winick county sanitation dist.d.
on april,west bay obtained a stop notice release bond from travelers casualty surety company of america,travelers.west bay paid an annual premium of to obtain and maintain the stop notice release bond.
cummins sues west bay and travelers 
on february,cummins sued west bay for breach of contract and quantum meruit in the alameda county superior court.cummins alleged west bay had breached the subcontract by failing to properly manage and supervise the project work.cummins also alleged that west bay had failed to pay on time and sought contract damages as well as statutory prompt payment charges.alternatively,cummins sought damages under a quantum meruit theory for the unpaid value of goods and services it had provided.
cummins also sued travelers to recover against the stop notice release bond.cummins sought statutory prompt payment charges in addition to the unpaid contractual amounts.
cummins secures a judgment for 
the matter proceeded to a jury trial.the trial court granted west bay and travelers motion in limine to exclude all evidence regarding cummins claim arising from its stop notice because the court found the stop notice was not timely filed and was,therefore,void following the presentation of cummins case,the court dismissed travelers on cummins motion.after the close of evidence,the court on its own motion dismissed the cause of action for quantum meruit,leaving only the breach of contract cause of action against west bay.
the jury returned a special verdict in favor of cummins.the jury made the following findings cummins did all or substantially all of the significant things that the cummins subcontract required it to do,including completing the cummins subcontract in accordance with the contract documents and satisfactorily performing the work on the cummins subcontract west bay failed to do something required by the cummins subcontract and that cummins was harmed by that failure in the amount of west bay was not entitled to any offset against the damage award west bay failed to remit payment of retention proceeds to cummins within seven days after it received retention proceeds from the district on october,and november,west bay withholding of the retention proceeds on both occasions was not based on a bona fide dispute and,cummins share of the retention proceeds received by west bay on october,and november,was on each occasion.
cummins sought costs,attorney fees,and statutory prompt payment charges pursuant to the verdict,the cummins subcontract fee clause,and public contract code section,respectively.west bay moved to tax costs and opposed the attorney fees and statutory charges motion.west bay also moved for a new trial,asserting the damages were excessive,there was insufficient evidence to support the verdict,and the verdict was against the law.among other things,west bay asserted it was undisputed that it had incurred liquidated damages and general condition costs as a consequence of project delay.west bay claimed it was entitled to a complete offset under the indemnity and damages for delay provisions of the cummins subcontract.the court denied west bay motion for new trial.
the trial court entered judgment on the verdict,ordering west bay to pay to cummins unpaid retention of and additional damages in the amount of,in accordance with the jury verdict,plus in attorney fees,in costs,in statutory prompt payment charges,and in prejudgment interest,for a total judgment of.
discussion 
iii.the trial court properly calculated the statutory prompt payment charges imposed under public contract code section.
in its,cummins challenges two aspects of the trial court calculation of statutory prompt payment charges imposed under subdivision f of public contract code section hereafter section f first,cummins contends the court erred by concluding the percent per month charge is not applied on a compounded basis.second,it claims the court erroneously found the percent per month charge stops accruing upon entry of judgment such that the retention proceeds withheld plus any statutory charges accumulated through judgment bear interest at the percent per annum postjudgment rate.because these arguments raise issues of statutory construction,we apply a de novo standard of review.people morris th,d.
