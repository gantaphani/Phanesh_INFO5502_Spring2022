we consider here whether section of new york labor law,which establishes an absolute liability regime for certain types of injuries,covers an injury sustained while lowering a heavy object by means of a makeshift pulley down a small stairway separating two levels of a hallway,and certification to the new york court of appeals is appropriate 
background 
in february,plaintiff victor runner was injured while moving a large reel of wire about four feet in diameter between the two levels of a hallway in the basement of the new york stock exchange building in lower manhattan.the reel of wire had to descend approximately four steps from the higher level of the hallway to the lower level.according to defendants,
t o move the reel to the next level of the hallway,at their supervisor direction plaintiff and his coworkers secured one end of a rope to the reel,wrapped the rope a few times around a inch thick steel pipe placed in a manner so as to horizontally span a door jamb,and then the plaintiff,who was situated closest to the pipe,and several coworkers behind him took up the slack on the rope.when the reel started to roll towards or down the first step it pulled plaintiff forward and his hands became caught between the rope and the pipe,causing amputation of several fingers.
appellant br.in other words,plaintiff and his served as human brakes on a pulley to prevent the reel of wire from tumbling uncontrollably down the stairs.plaintiff account of events is substantially similar to defendants.
plaintiff brought a number of state law claims against defendants new york stock exchange,and amec construction management,to recover for his injury,but this appeal concerns only one of them the scaffold law,codified at section of new york labor law a trial was held in the united states district court for the southern district of new york thomas griesa,judge and on february,a jury returned a verdict in favor of defendants the same day,in an oral ruling from the bench,the district court granted plaintiff motion to set aside a jury liability verdict pursuant to rule b of the federal rules of civil procedure.in the district court view,section applied to injuries involving a risk,which,in the district court view,existed as a matter of law in the instant case.trial tr.in addition,the district court determined that,o n the basis of the evidence beyond any question,the device actually used in the operation did not give proper protection and was a substantial factor in causing the accident.trial tr.accordingly,the district court ordered a new trial for damages.
rather than proceed with a retrial,the parties agreed to a settlement with a right to appeal.under the settlement agreement,plaintiff received,which he may retain if our court reverses the district court liability determination.if we affirm,plaintiff will receive an additional million from defendants.if we remand for a new trial,plaintiff will receive an additional without the need for a new trial.on january,the district court entered judgment for plaintiff in the amount of pursuant to the settlement agreement.on appeal,defendants seek review of the district court ruling on rule b,and a november,order denying in part defendants motion for summary judgment as relates to section.

standard of review 
we review a district court ruling on a rule motion for summary judgment and a rule motion for judgment as a matter of law de novo,construing all facts in favor of the nonmoving party.see,paneccasio unisource worldwide,cir summary judgment cobb pozzi,cir judgment as a matter of law.summary judgment is only warranted upon a showing that there is no genuine issue as to any material fact and that the movant is entitled to judgment as a matter of law.c.the standard for judgment as a matter of law is the same as for summary judgment under.cobb,at internal quotation marks omitted see also.a b authorizing judgment as a matter of law where a claim or defense can be maintained or defeated only with a favorable finding of law on that issue.
new york scaffold law 
on its face,new york scaffold law applies broadly to any use of pulleys or ropes used in the repair of any building.labor law.were we to rely simply on the statute plain meaning,we would agree with the district court that new york scaffold law applies to the instant case,in which plaintiff was injured while moving a large,heavy object by means of a makeshift pulley as part of a construction project at the new york stock exchange.however,we must apply the statute as it has been interpreted and applied by new york highest court.as we have previously explained,
our role as a federal court sitting in diversity is not to adopt innovative theories that may distort established state law.instead we must carefully predict how the state highest court would resolve the uncertainties that we have identified.in making this prediction,we give the fullest weight to pronouncements of the state highest court while giving proper regard to relevant rulings of the state lower courts.

the opinions of the new york court of appeals are relevant in two important respects not immediately apparent from the face of the statute.first,new york scaffold law imposes absolute liability upon landowners and general contractors.see rocovich consol.edison,w e have interpreted the section as imposing absolute liability for a breach which has proximately caused injury.see also blake neighborhood hous.servs.of city,stating that the phrase strict or absolute liability in the labor law context is different from the use of the term elsewhere and explaining that section requires proof of causation.second,new york limits liability under section to accidents related to the inherent effects of gravity.as explained by the new york court of appeals,circumstances in which the statute applies 
entail a significant risk inherent in the particular task because of the relative elevation at which the task must be performed or at which materials or loads must be positioned or secured.the contemplated hazards are those related to the effects of gravity where protective devices are called for either because of a difference between the elevation level of the required work and a lower level or a difference between the elevation level where the worker is positioned and the higher level of the materials or load being hoisted or secured.it is because of the special hazards in having to work in these circumstances,we believe,that the legislature has seen fit to give the worker the exceptional protection that section provides.
rocovich,at.
defendants argue that the district court interpretation of section was too broad.according to defendants,section only applies to injuries that are the direct result of hazards,in the sense of the particular risks that attend working only at an elevated level,not at ground level.ross.quoting the new york court of appeals decision in ross,defendants emphasize that the statute 
was designed to prevent those types of accidents in which the scaffold,hoist,stay,ladder or other protective device proved inadequate to shield the injured worker from harm directly flowing from the application of the force of gravity to an object or person.the right of recovery afforded by the statute does not extend to other types of harm,even if the harm in question was caused by an inadequate,malfunctioning or defectively designed scaffold,stay or hoist.
id.at,emphasis altered.defendants argue that the new york court of appeals has recognized only two categories of direct,injuries covered by section falling objects and falling workers.appellant br.citing narducci manhasset bay,noting,in turn,that labor law applies to both falling worker and falling object cases because the instant case involved neither a falling object that directly struck plaintiff nor a falling worker,defendants claim that section does not apply.defendants offer a litany of illustrative cases highlighting various limitations on section,see,toefer long island,finding no liability where worker fell from a flatbed truck smerka niagara mohawk power,de
