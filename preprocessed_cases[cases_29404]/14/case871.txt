plaintiff diede construction,diede was awarded a million contract to renovate the city hall in the city of livermore the city.after the bids were opened but before diede executed a contract with the city,defendant monterey mechanical company monterey,a subcontractor diede had listed in its bid pursuant to public contract code section,informed diede that its proposal contained a mistake,that it would not honor the proposal,and that diede should seek to be relieved of its bid to the city pursuant to sections and.diede nonetheless proceeded to execute a contract with the city and,when monterey refused to perform,contracted with other subcontractors to perform montereys portions of the project.thereafter,diede filed a complaint seeking to recover from monterey,on a theory of promissory estoppel,the difference between montereys original bid and the amounts diede was required to pay the replacement subcontractors.after a bench trial,the court denied diedes claim because diede did not attempt to be relieved from its bid to the city after learning of montereys mistake.we conclude relief is available under sections and only for errors in the general contractors bid and that diede was not required to request relief from its bid to the city as a condition of holding monterey to its bid for the subcontract.nonetheless,diedes right to recover on the basis of promissory estoppel is dependant on its proving that it reasonably relied on montereys mistaken bid in calculating the amount of its bid to the city,as to which the trial court made no finding.accordingly,we shall reverse the judgment and remand for a determination of this controlling issue.
factual and procedural background 
diede is a general contractor that performs large public works projects.monterey is a contractor specializing in mechanical,plumbing,and heating,ventilation,and air conditioning hvac work.on august,diede submitted a bid to perform all work on a project to remodel the city hall for.montereys bid to diede to perform the hvac and certain other work on the project was.diede listed monterey as its hvac subcontractor and allocated percent of the total contract price to its work diede learned later that day that it was the low bidder on the job.
the next business day,three days later,monterey faxed a letter to diede stating that it had discovered an inadvertent clerical error in its proposal and it was therefore withdrawing its bid.the letter explained that montereys proposal failed to include the cost of for its controls subcontractor.diede faxed a reply stating that it had based its bid on montereys quote and expected monterey to honor its bid.the next morning,montereys attorney sent diede a letter enclosing two declarations showing how the mistake was made,and advising diede that if it acted by the next day,it could use the declarations to withdraw its bid under the relief provisions of the public contract code.diede disagreed that such relief was available for montereys mistake,and it did not wish to forfeit its bid bond,lose the substantial sums expended in bidding on the project,or sacrifice the profit and the enhanced professional reputation that it felt it would realize from completing the project.accordingly,diede executed the contract with the city for the original bid amount.
after monterey refused to perform the subcontract work,diede executed contracts with the next lowest bidders for the portions of the work monterey was to perform at an increased cost of,and filed this action to recover these additional costs from monterey.the trial court found that montereys proposal contained a material clerical mistake that satisfied the requirements for relief under the public contract code.accordingly,it held that diede had not established the elements of promissory estoppel because diedes continued reliance on montereys bid after receiving notice of the mistake was unreasonable,and that the damages sought could have been readily prevented if diede had sought to be relieved of its bid to the c ity.diede filed a timely notice of appeal.
discussion 
elements of promissory estoppel 
a general contractor may recover damages incurred as a result of its reasonable reliance on a subcontractors mistaken bid under the theory of promissory estoppel.a promise which the promisor should reasonably expect to induce action or forebearance of a definite and substantial character on the part of the promisee and which does induce such action or forebearance is binding if injustice can be avoided only by enforcement of the promise.citation.this principle is applicable to a proposed subcontractor promisor who makes a bid and with it an implied subsidiary promise to keep the bid open for a reasonable time after the awarding of the general contract to a general contractor promisee who in turn bids on a construction contract with a third person in reliance upon the subcontractors bid and subsidiary promise and is the successful bidder.allen engineering d,citing drennan star paving cal d,drennan.as between the subcontractor who made the bid and the general contractor who reasonably relied on it,the loss resulting from the mistake should fall on the party who caused it.drennan,supra,cal d at.
thus,in order to prevail on its promissory estoppel claim,diede was required to prove that it had reasonably relied on montereys bid to its detriment,and that injustice could be avoided only by enforcing montereys promise to perform at the quoted price.
statutory provisions for the relief of bidders 
in the state legislature established a comprehensive procedure in connection with public contracts to enable a contractor to claim relief from a bid mistake by following certain procedural steps.a a electric,city of king d.a a electric.the derivation of these provisions traces back to more limited legislation first enacted in see stats,ch,and briefly described in a a electric,supra,at pages.these provisions were initially found in government code sections through,but in,without significant change,became chapter of division,part of the public contract code,entitled relief of bidders.et emma inglewood unified school dist.th,d.they provide the exclusive means by which a contractor may be relieved from a mistake in a bid submitted to a public entity.a a electric,supra,d at.
for purposes of the statute,a bid is defined as any proposal submitted to a public entity in competitive bidding for any type of improvement,subd.b.section,subdivision a,provides,a bidder shall not be relieved of the bid unless by consent of the awarding authority nor shall any change be made in the bid because of mistake,but the bidder may bring an action against the public entity for the recovery of the amount of the bid bond forfeited,without interest or costs section sets forth the grounds for relief under section the bidder shall establish that a a mistake was made.b he or she gave the public entity written notice within five days after the opening of the bids of the mistake,specifying in the notice in detail how the mistake occurred.c the mistake made the bid materially different than he or she intended it to be.d the mistake was made in filling out the bid and not due to error in judgment or to carelessness in inspecting the site of the work,or in reading the plans or specifications.
under these provisions,relief is available to a general contractor whose bid is based on a clerical mistake brought promptly to the attention of the public agency.nonetheless,contrary to montereys contention and the premise of the trial courts ruling,these provisions do not apply to mistaken bids submitted by a subcontractor to the general contractor.as noted,the statute applies explicitly to proposals submitted to a public entity in competitive bidding,subd.b.the contractors bid to the city was such a proposal,but the bids made by subcontractors and materialmen to diede were not.other aspects of the statute confirm that it is not intended to apply to mistakes in the bid of subcontractors.section,subdivision c provides that to obtain relief,the bidder must show that the mistake made the bid materially different than he or she intended it to be.if the bid from the ge
