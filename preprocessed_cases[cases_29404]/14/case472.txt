connecticut llc,a limited liability corporation wholly owned by clark tilden llc and cei,clark,brought suit against the district of columbia district claiming that the district issuance of a stop work order swo that halted clark construction of a apartment building violated its procedural due process and equal protection rights.the district court dismissed the suit,holding that clark lacked a constitutionally protected property interest in the building permits the district had issued and that its equal protection claim was unripe.llc district of columbia,d,mem.we affirm the district court but on different grounds,concluding that,although clark had a property interest in the permits,the process afforded clark was adequate on clark equal protection claim,we affirm the grant of summary judgment to the district because the claim fails as a matter of law on two of its elements.
the district of columbia construction codes,mun.regs.tit,et construction codes,authorize the issuance of preliminary permits to a builder to begin limited activities on a building site while approval of construction plans for the complete project pends before the district building and land regulation administration blra.id.pursuant to these provisions,clark sought and obtained five separate permits to begin the sheeting,shoring,excavation,foundation construction and underpinning of existing structures in preparation for its construction of the nine story apartment building at connecticut avenue,northwest.in order to obtain the five preliminary permits,clark submitted inter alia an environmental impact screening form eisf,describing the nature of the site and the proposed project,to district particular,to the district department of health,environmental administration doh which determines whether a comprehensive,detailed environmental impact statement eis is required by the environmental protection act dcepa,code et,before a building project can proceed.mun.regs.tit.based on clark eisf,doh determined that an eis was not required with its five preliminary permits in hand although full project approval was still pending,on july,clark began work at the connecticut avenue site.the next day,opponents of the project calling themselves friends of tilden park filed suit in superior court seeking to enjoin construction.they alleged that the eisf clark had submitted contained material errors and omissions.the court found that there were discrepancies in clark initial eisf and issued a temporary restraining order tro.the tro lasted only two days and immediately upon its dissolution on august,blra issued a swo halting work on the project until compliance with all applicable district of columbia law and regulations can be confirmed.notice of stop work order,ja.
on august,clark appealed the swo to the blra administrator,arguing,among other things,that it was invalid under district law and should be rescinded because the errors on the eisf were immaterial.two days later,the administrator responded,denying clark appeal and upholding the swo because he questioned whether the preliminary permits were based on inaccurate site information contained in clark eisf.clark submitted a revised eisf on august,disclosing for the first time that mature trees were located on the property,a stream ran near the property and an adjacent building was listed on the national register of historic places.clark then appealed the blra administrator decision to the director of the department of consumer and regulatory affairs dcra,blra supervising agency.although the director did not act on clark appeal,on september,dcra did order clark to submit more detailed environmental information regarding several potential impacts of its proposed on traffic,vegetation and trees,storm water,soil erosion and groundwater control so that it could reconsider whether an eis was required clark submitted the requested information and,on october,renewed its request that the director review the swo.again the director failed to respond.on october,clark filed the instant suit,initially seeking injunctive relief only.meanwhile dcra requested doh and other district agencies to review clark revised eisf.doh officials reviewed clark revised eisf and the supplemental materials clark had submitted and visited the connecticut avenue site.doh was concerned with surface water problems and recommended to dcra that it require clark to prepare a mitigation plan.clark met with doh and developed a plan that resolved the issue on november,blra rescinded the swo and,four days later,issued a building permit for clark entire project.clark then amended its complaint to seek compensatory and punitive damages for the interruption of its project.
the district moved for summary judgment and the district court dismissed both of clark claims.it dismissed clark due process claim because,it concluded,clark lacked a property interest in the five preliminary permits suspended by the district swo,d at.the court read our statement in tri county industries,district of columbia,rejecting the notion that an agency deprives an applicant of property whenever it backtracks on a prior favorable finding on one of the approvals preliminary to issuance of a building permit independently of withdrawal of the permit itself,to mean that the district approval of the five preliminary permits issued to clark did not confer any property rights on clark,d at quoting tri county,at internal quotations omitted.according to the district court,clark only property interest lay in the real building permit,the one ultimately granted on november,d at.permits for preliminary work,the court said,were merely steps toward the issuance of a building permit and therefore,under tri county,not property.id.at.
as other courts have done,the district court applied the property interest test set forth in board of regents roth,d,to regulation,concluding that clark lacked a legitimate claim of entitlement,d at quoting roth,at,and therefore had no property interest in the preliminary permits because significant discretion is conferred upon the local agency under district law,d at quoting gardner city of baltimore,cir.the court characterized the permits at issue as partial permits under the construction codes,in particular,mun.regs.tit,which provides 
the code official is authorized to issue a partial permit for the construction of foundations or any other part of a building or structure before the entire plans and specifications for the whole building or structure have been submitted,provided adequate information and detailed statements have been filed complying with all pertinent requirements of the construction codes.

the district court also dismissed clark equal protection claim,explaining that clark assertion that its rights were violated because the district applied the requirements of the dcepa to this project alone boiled down to a complaint that the district had required clark to prepare an eis,d at.but because the district had not in fact required clark to submit an eis,it concluded,clark claim was premature.id.clark then filed this appeal.
