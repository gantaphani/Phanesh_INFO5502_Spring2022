in gale industries,trytek,so d dca,the fifth district court of appeal ruled on statutory attorneys fees in construction lien actions and certified a question of great public importance.we therefore have jurisdiction.see art.v,b.const.we rephrase the certified question as follows 
where a lienor obtains a judgment against a property owner in an action to enforce a construction lien brought pursuant to section,florida statutes,are trial courts required to apply the significant issues test articulated in prosperi code,so d,in determining which party,if any,is the prevailing party for the purpose of awarding attorneys fees 
we answer the rephrased certified question in the affirmative and hold that trial courts are required to apply the significant issues test of prosperi to evaluate entitlement to prevailing party attorneys fees under section,even when the lienor obtains a judgment on the lien we conclude that this court has consistently approached the award of attorneys fees in lien actions as being tempered by equitable principles.prosperi,so d at.in that regard,when applying prosperi to the facts of a case,there is no mandatory requirement that the trial court determine that one party is the prevailing party.we therefore quash the fifth district decision that held that the trial court is required to award the lienor prevailing party attorneys fees if the lienor recovers a judgment in any amount on the lien claim that exceeds any setoff or damages claimed by the homeowner on his or her counterclaim.
facts and procedural history 
in this case,the petitioners,frank trytek and his wife,cathy trytek,hereinafter referred to as either trytek or homeowner,were building a new residence.as part of the project,they contracted with gale industries,an insulation contractor,to install insulation throughout the structure hereinafter referred to as either gale,contractor,or lienor.it is undisputed that w hile installing the insulation,gale employees inadvertently caused some staples to be driven through some previously installed electrical wires.the parties agreed that electric company,a corporation owned by frank trytek that was involved in electrical contracting,would make the necessary repairs.gale,so d at.according to the invoice in the record,trytek cost incurred for the electrical repair work was,including a building inspection fee.trytek delivered a check to gale for,which trytek determined was the amount due on the contract work after setting off the inspection fee and repair work done by his company.gale refused to accept trytek check and recorded a construction lien in the amount of,which did not include any offset for the damages it caused.
this case eventually proceeded to trial.as set forth in the fifth district opinion 
early in the proceedings the parties stipulated that the gale industries claim of lien complied procedurally with the construction lien law,chapter,florida statutes,and that all notice requirements had been met.in addition,the parties agreed that the lien accurately stated the value of the labor,services and materials provided by gale,subject only to the trytek counterclaim.an agreed order was rendered that established that gale lien was procedurally sufficient that no evidence would be necessary at trial on that issue and that gale industries was entitled to recover the amount stated in the lien,less any damages proved by and trytek and that the only issue to be resolved at trial was the value of the damages alleged in the counterclaim.
following a nonjury trial,the trial court entered an order determining that the tryteks were entitled to repair costs of.after setting off that figure against the agreed lien amount of,the net result was a judgment for in favor of gale industries.
thereafter,each party concluded that it was the prevailing party and filed to tax attorneys fees and costs pursuant to section,florida statutes.after a hearing on the motions the trial court,while expressing some concern over this court position on the definition of prevailing party in the construction lien context,determined that it was required to apply the significant issues test set forth in prosperi,so d,in order to award fees and costs properly.the court then found that the tryteks were the prevailing party because the only real issue in the case was how much money should be set off against the gale industries lien,and the tryteks primarily prevailed on their counterclaim.
in determining that trytek was the prevailing party,the trial court reasoned 
there was never an issue about gale performing the insulation work at the tryteks residence nor was there ever an issue about whether gale was entitled to payment for its work.early in the case,there was an agreed order on plaintiff motion for partial summary judgment which recognized the validity and amount of gales sic lien.the real issue in the case was how much money should be setoff from the lien amount as compensation to the tryteks for repairing the damage done by gale during its installation of the insulation.the tryteks prevailed on their counterclaim to the extent of almost extinguishing the gale lien.it was this aspect of the case that required expert testimony,document production,document analysis and trial time.the tryteks recovered on their counterclaim.gale only offered a discount of from to.therefore,this court finds that the tryteks prevailed on the significant issue of this case and are the prevailing parties entitled to recover attorneys fees and costs pursuant to,

the parties stipulated to the amount of attorneys fees and costs and thus the trial court entered an order awarding attorneys fees of and costs of in favor of the homeowner,trytek on appeal,the fifth district recognized that this court decisions in moritz hoyt enterprises,so d,and prosperi,so d,modified the prevailing party rule by applying the significant issues test.however,it concluded that the significant issues test of prosperi applies only where the contractor is unsuccessful in its lien foreclosure action.the fifth district concluded that under section,a contractor who obtains any monetary judgment pursuant to a construction lien claim would ordinarily be the prevailing party,and in this case,the contractor did receive a judgment of.the fifth district therefore reversed and remanded for assessment of an attorneys fees award in favor of gale.the fifth district also recognized that this court application of the significant issues test in prosperi may have changed the legal landscape for determining the prevailing party in a construction lien case and accordingly certified a question of great public importance regarding whether the significant issues test of prosperi is applicable even when the contractor obtains a judgment on its lien,no matter what the amount.gale,so d at.
the contractor claims that because it obtained a judgment on its lien,the contractor is entitled to receive all of its attorneys fees connected with the litigation.the homeowner contends that by prevailing on the only issue tried before the trial counterclaim based on the contractor damage to the electrical trial court determination of prevailing party should be affirmed.both parties assert that one or the other must be the prevailing party.
the main issue in this case is what factors enter into a determination of prevailing party pursuant to section.the specific issue raised by this case is whether the trial court is vested with discretion,or is even required to consider,which party prevailed on the significant issues or whether the trial court is bound by an inflexible rule that a prevailing party must be determined and that the contractor must be considered the prevailing party if it obtains a judgment on its lien in any amount in excess of an asserted or counterclaim.
it is that attorneys fees can derive only from either a statutory basis or an agreement between the parties.state farm fire cas.palma,so d.in this case,entitlement to attorneys fees is based on statute.we thus start with the language of the lien statute that concerns the award of attorneys fees in an action to enforce a lien.section was first enacted by the legislature in.ch,laws of.section states 
in any action brought to enforce a lien or to enforce a claim against a bond under this part,the prevailing party is entitled to recover a reasonable fee for the services of her or his attorney for trial and appeal or for arbitration,in an amount to be determined by the court,which fee must be taxed as part of the prevailing party costs,as allowed in equitable actions.
emphases added.although the legislature expressly defined several terms within the construction lien law in a section entitled definitions,it did not define the term prevailing party,see.stat,nor does a definition appear in section.
with regard to any principles of statutory construction that might be applicable,although we have generally held that attorneys fees statutes should be strictly construed because there was no common law right to attorneys fees in this case,that principle does not assist the court in construing the term.further,in,the legislature enacted section,which states that the construction lien law shall not be subject to a rule of liberal construction in favor of any person to whom it applies.therefore,jurisprudence that has relied on the principle that the lien laws favor the contractor or laborer has no direct application when determining which party is entitled to prevailing party attorneys fees 
because our rephrased certified question asks whether the significant issues test of prosperi applies where a lienor has obtained a judgment on his or her lien claim,we turn to this court precedent regarding lien actions and also jurisprudence regarding prevailing party attorneys fees.first,with regard to the purpose of the construction lien statute,we have stated 
w e note that mechanic lien law serves at least two purposes.first,mechanic liens protect suppliers who furnish labor or materials to the property by assuring them of full payment.prosperi,so d,citing emery international glass,so d,dca.mechanic lien law also protects owners by requiring subcontractors to provide notice of possible liens,thereby allowing owners to prevent double payment to both a contractor and subcontractor,material supplier,or laborer,for provision of the same services or materials when the contractor and subcontractor are not in privity.aetna cas.and sur.buck,so d at.
stunkel gazebo landscaping design,so d.the dual purpose of the lien law in protecting both the laborer and owner seems to evidence a legislative intent to emphasize fairness and equity in actions brought pursuant to the lien law.
the notion that equitable principles should apply in determining prevailing party attorneys fees has been utilized in this court opinions deciding attorneys fees in the context of section.for example,in associates,grove,so d,the court examined a case in which a litigant had offered an amount to settle that was equal to the amount recovered.this court found that in order to be a prevailing party entitled to the award of attorney fees pursuant to section,a litigant must have recovered an amount exceeding that which was earlier offered in settlement of the claim.id.at.this court explained that it based its decision on the purported policy underlying section 
the award of attorney fees and costs to the prevailing party in a mechanic lien action serves to encourage settlement of disputes before resorting to litigation.forcing the loser to bear the costs and fees of producing the opponent victory engenders a more realistic appraisal of the merits of the claim and discourages dilatory or obstructive tactics.if the statute were to apply as the third district construes it,however,the burden of fair dealing and negotiation would lie only upon the defendant.to award attorneys fees and costs when any judgment is won,without reference to earlier,good faith offers to settle the claim,allows the plaintiff a free throw of the dice in an attempt to squeeze the last penny out of the claim.
id.at emphasis added.our decision in associates explicitly stands for the proposition that the underlying policy of section is to encourage settlement of disputes before resorting to litigation.however,the case also implicitly espouses equitable principles by preventing a plaintiff who has recovered a judgment from unjustly being awarded attorneys fees after rejecting a good faith offer from the defendant that exceeded the amount of the judgment.
subsequently,this court decided prosperi,which is also based on basic principles of fairness and an interest in discouraging needless litigation.the rule of prosperi is that in determining prevailing party under section,the trial court should look to which party prevailed on the significant issues,as recognized in our case of moritz that had been decided the previous year.prosperi,so d at together,prosperi and its predecessor moritz require that the trial court determination of a prevailing party rest on whether the party succeed ed on any significant issue in litigation which achieves some of the benefit the parties sought in bringing suit.moritz,so d at quoting hensley,at.
in prosperi,the contractor brought an action to foreclose a lien claim,among other claims the trial court denied relief on the lien claim and awarded damages on the homeowner breach of contract counterclaim.however,the trial court also found that the homeowner setoff from the counterclaim was less than the amount owed to the contractor under the contract.therefore,the contractor received a judgment on its contract claim but did not prevail on the lien claim.the trial court denied both parties claims for fees,and on appeal the district court affirmed,certifying the following question does the test of moritz hoyt for determining who is the prevailing party for the purposes of awarding attorney fees apply to fees awarded under section,florida statutes so d at 
in concluding that the significant issues test adopted in moritz was applicable to claims under section,this court discussed what appellate courts had termed the net judgment rule,which in essence precluded an owner from recovering attorneys fees under section where a claimant fails to foreclose a mechanic lien but obtains a judgment on other claims that exceeds any claim of the owner.prosperi,so d at.while giving deference to the long line of appellate precedent,this court ultimately held that,in light of moritz,the fact that a claimant recovers a net judgment is significant but does not necessarily control the determination of the prevailing party,and the trial court must have flexibility to consider the equities and determine which party prevailed on the significant issues.so d at.significantly,as applied to the case,the court observed 
as we see it,the net judgment rule itself was originated as a device to do equity.for example,under most circumstances it would be unfair to require a contractor who recovers the bulk of its claim to pay attorney fees for failure to meet the technical requirements of the mechanic lien law.in some of the later cases,however,the net judgment rule appears to have been applied mechanically without regard to the equities.we believe that moritz now requires a more flexible application.the fact that the claimant obtains a net judgment is a significant factor but it need not always control the determination of who should be considered the prevailing party.we hold that in considering whether to apply the net judgment rule,the trial judge must have the discretion to consider the equities and determine which party has in fact prevailed on the significant issues.
in the instant case,the findings of the trial judge make it clear that he believed that the owner was the innocent party but felt constrained not to award him attorney fees under a strict application of the net judgment rule.under the net judgment rule as tempered by equitable principles according to the rationale of our opinion,it is equally clear that the trial judge would have found the owner to be the prevailing party.therefore,we quash the decision below and remand with directions that attorney fees be awarded to the owner.we quash the order awarding the contractor appellate attorney fees and direct that
