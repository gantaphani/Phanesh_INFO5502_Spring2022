daniel alberstone and lisa ogawa appeal from the denial of their petition for writ of mandate,which sought to compel the california coastal commission the commission to hear de novo their neighbor application to develop the vacant lot next to appellants home in malibu.we affirm.
appellants own a home located at the end of escondido beach road in malibu.on november,real party in interest jeff stibel applied to the city of malibu the city to build a square foot beachfront home on the vacant lot next to appellants property,plus a square foot garage,an alternative septic system,and a bulkhead on the sandy beach.during the application process,a question arose as to whether stibel land consisted of one or two parcels.a previous owner applied to the los angeles county assessor to consolidate the parcel numbers,but a permit was never issued by the commission.
appellants met with the city staff throughout and submitted correspondence outlining their objections to the development.in a letter dated january,appellants objected to the development on the grounds it violated malibu certified local coastal program lcp because it would require the construction of protective devices that would contribute to shoreline erosion or alter natural land forms it would require shoreline protection or bluff stabilization structures during the full year economic life of the development and it was well below the minimum lot width requirements.
on february,the malibu planning commission approved the development upon a recommendation by the city staff.appellants appealed the planning commission decision to the malibu city council.the appeal was denied on may.appellants further appealed to the commission,which found the appeal failed to raise a substantial issue and declined to hear the matter.
appellants then petitioned the trial court for a writ of administrative mandamus to compel the commission to hear their appeal and consider stibel application de novo.the trial court found the commission refusal to hear appellants appeal was not contrary to law or an abuse of discretion,and was supported by substantial evidence in the administrative record.this appeal followed.both the commission and stibel have submitted briefs in response.
discussion 
standard of review 
public resources code section gives appellants the right to judicial review of a decision by filing a petition for writ of mandate pursuant to code of civil procedure section.la costa beach homeowners california coastal com.th,d.the inquiry in such a case extend s to the questions of whether the commission has proceeded without,or in excess of jurisdiction whether there was a fair trial and whether there was any prejudicial abuse of discretion.abuse of discretion is established if the commission has not proceeded in the manner required by law,the order or decision is not supported by the findings,or the findings are not supported by the evidence.code civ,subd.b eden hospital dist.belsh√© th,d pub.
given this directive,the trial court presumes that the agency decision is supported by substantial evidence,and the party challenging that decision bears the burden of demonstrating the contrary.desmond county of contra costa th,d.in reviewing the agency decision,the court examines the whole record and considers all relevant evidence,including that evidence which detracts from its decision.bolsa chica land trust superior court th,d.although this task involves some weighing to fairly estimate the worth of the evidence,that limited weighing does not constitute independent review where the court substitutes its own findings and inferences for that of the commission.rather,it is for the commission to weigh the preponderance of conflicting evidence,as the court may reverse its decision only if,based on the evidence before it,a reasonable person could not have reached the conclusion reached by it.kirkorowicz california coastal com.th,d sierra club california coastal com.th,d.
on appeal from the denial of a petition for writ of mandate,our role is identical to that of the trial court with respect to the administrative record.that is,both the trial and appellate courts must determine whether the record is free from legal error.thus,the trial court conclusions and disposition of the issues are not conclusive on the court of appeal.sierra club california coastal com.th,d.
in spite of this,appellants first focus on what they perceive to be errors made by the trial court in denying their petition for writ of mandate.in particular,appellants argue the trial court factual conclusions were not supported by substantial evidence.given the authorities cited above,it is clear that our role is not to review the trial court decision or reasoning and we need not address appellants contentions of error by the trial court.we now turn to the remaining issues raised by this appeal.
ii.no substantial issue raised by appellants 
as previously noted,appellants appealed the approval of the development to the commission.the commission found the appeal failed to raise a substantial issue and declined to hear the matter.appellants contend substantial issues were presented by their appeal to the commission and that it erred by failing to hear them.we disagree.
public resources code section,subdivision b requires the commission to hear an appeal from a decision of a local government unless it finds no substantial issue was raised.appellants contend two substantial issues were presented by their appeal to the commission.first,they argue the development violates section.r of the malibu local implementation program lip which prohibits the development of land divisions unless it can be shown the new lot can be developed without a shoreline protective structure.appellants argue the development violates section.r of the lip because it merges two lots and includes a bulkhead in the plans.second,appellants argue the merged lot fails to conform to the lot size requirements of the lcp.
it must first be noted that the question here is not whether appellants appeal raises any issue but whether it raises a substantial one.a substantial issue is defined as one that presents a significant question as to conformity with the certified local coastal program.of,tit.we review the commission determination of whether a substantial issue has been raised for abuse of discretion we grant broad deference to the commission interpretation of the lcp since it is well established that great weight must be given to the administrative construction of those charged with the enforcement and interpretation of a statute.code civ,subd.b see people ex rel.cal.regional wat.quality control bd.barry d.wat.quality control bd.rea enterprises california coastal zone d.rea enterprises.we will not depart from the commission interpretation unless it is clearly erroneous.rea enterprises,supra,d at.
further,appellants reliance on wat.quality control,supra,d at page.for the proposition that section,subdivision b,by using the word appeal rather than petition,mandates de novo review by the commission whether the issue is substantial or not ignores the express directive in section,subdivision b that t he commission shall hear an appeal unless it determines that no substantial issue exists as to conformity with local coastal programs.while section describes the circumstances under which an aggrieved person has the right to appeal,section clearly specifies when the commission must hear that appeal.finally,appellants provide no legal citation for their argument that the term substantial is clearly meant to address the legislature concern that the commission not be bogged down with appeals that are either frivolous or otherwise without possible merit.
with these principles in mind,we agree with the commission that neither of appellants points present a substantial issue that required the commission to review stibel application de novo.
