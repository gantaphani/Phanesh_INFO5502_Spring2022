this appeal presents two separate,but related,insurance coverage questions in the construction context whether,under maryland law,a standard commercial general liability policy form published by the insurance services office,incorporated iso provides liability coverage to a general contractor to correct defective workmanship performed by a subcontractor and whether,under maryland law,the same policy form provides liability coverage for the costs to remedy unexpected and unintended property damage to the contractor otherwise nondefective caused by the subcontractor defective workmanship.we answer the first question in the negative and the second question in the affirmative.accordingly,we affirm in part and vacate in part the judgment below in favor of the insurance company defendants and remand for further proceedings.
the following relevant facts are undisputed.in,james and kathleen french the frenches contracted with jeffco development corporation jeffco for the construction of a home in fairfax county,virginia.pursuant to the construction contract,and via a subcontractor,the exterior of the home was clad with a synthetic stucco system known as exterior insulating finishing system eifs.following the completion of construction,building officials issued a certificate of occupancy for the frenches home in december.nearly five years later,in late,the frenches discovered extensive moisture and water damage to the otherwise nondefective structure and walls of their home resulting from the defective cladding of the exterior of their home with eifs.the frenches have since spent in excess of to correct the defects in the eifs exterior of their home and to remedy the resulting damage to the otherwise nondefective structure and walls of their home.
on november,the frenches filed suit the underlying suit against jeffco in virginia state court alleging multiple claims,including breach of contract,and seeking damages to cover the costs to correct the construction defects with respect to the eifs exterior of their home and to remedy the resulting damage to the otherwise nondefective structure and walls of their home.
for certain time periods some overlapping during the entire time period relevant to the underlying suit,jeffco had commercial general liability coverage through four different commercial general liability insurance carriers assurance company of america assurance,united states fire insurance company,ohio casualty insurance company ohio casualty,and aetna casualty and surety company travelers casualty and surety company travelers.all parties agree that for purposes of resolving the issues presented in the present appeal,the commercial general liability policies issued to jeffco by appellees assurance and fire consisted of the version of the standard commercial general liability policy form drafted by the iso and widely used in the insurance industry.see hartford fire ins.california,d iso develops standard policy forms and files or lodges them with each state insurance regulators most cgl insurance written in the united states is written on these forms.from henceforth,we will refer to these policies as the iso cgl policies.of relevance in the present appeal,the iso cgl policies provided 
coverage bodily injury and property damage liability 
insuring agreement 
a.we will pay those sums that the insured becomes legally obligated to pay as damages because of property damage to which this insurance applies.we will have the right and duty to defend the insured against any suit seeking those damages.however,we will have no duty to defend the insured against any suit seeking damages for property damage to which this insurance does not apply.we may,at our discretion,investigate any occurrence and settle any claim or suit that may result 
b.this insurance applies to property damage only if 
the property damage is caused by an occurrence 
the iso cgl policies applied to completed operations,as defined in said policies under operations hazard.this term is defined,in relevant part,as follows 
operations hazard 
includes all bodily injury and property damage occurring away from premises you own or rent and arising out of your product or your work except 
products that are still in your physical possession or 
work that has not yet been completed or abandoned.however,your work will be deemed completed at the earliest of the following times 
a when all of the work called for in your contract has been completed.
b when all of the work to be done at the job site has been completed if your contract calls for work at more than one job site.
c when that part of the work done at a job site has been put to its intended use by any person or organization other than another contractor or subcontractor working on the same project.
work that may need service,maintenance,correction,repair or replacement,but which is otherwise complete,will be treated as completed.
the iso cgl policies contained several exclusions that limit the insurance carriers duty to provide coverage to jeffco.the following two of those exclusions are relevant to the issues on appeal 
exclusions 
this insurance does not apply to 
expected or intended injury 
p roperty damage expected or intended from the standpoint of the insured.
damage to your work 
property damage to your work arising out of it or any part of it and included in the operations hazard.
this exclusion does not apply if the damaged work or the work out of which the damage arises was performed on your behalf by a subcontractor.
the iso cgl policies define the term o ccurrence as an accident,including continuous or repeated exposure to substantially the same general harmful conditions.while the iso cgl policies do not define the term accident,controlling maryland case law provides that an act of negligence constitutes an accident under a liability insurance policy when the resulting damage takes place without the insured actual foresight or expectation.sheets brethren mut.ins,adopting subjective test from standpoint of the insured regarding whether act of negligence constitutes an accident under liability insurance policy see also cole state farm mut.ins.the test is a subjective one,because,according to maryland highest court,i f we were to adopt an objective standard and hold that the term accident as used in liability insurance policies excludes coverage for damage that should have been foreseen or expected by the insured,such insurance policies would be rendered all but meaningless.sheets,at.also of relevance here,the iso cgl policies define p roperty damage as physical injury to tangible property,including all resulting loss of use of that property.
jeffco notified assurance,fire,ohio casualty,and travelers of the underlying suit and requested to be defended.assurance and fire undertook to defend jeffco pursuant to a reservation of rights letter.ohio casualty also undertook to defend jeffco,but travelers refused to provide any defense.assurance,fire,and ohio casualty jointly retained the law firm of sinnott,nuckols,and logan to represent jeffco in the underlying suit.
on july,the date of trial in the underlying suit,the only count remaining alleged breach of contract.however,that same day,jeffco and the frenches reached a settlement agreement the settlement agreement.although ohio casualty consented to the settlement agreement,assurance and fire did not.
pursuant to the settlement agreement jeffco agreed to confess judgment to the frenches for jeffco and ohio casualty would only be responsible to collectively pay the frenches of the confessed judgment the judgment would be marked paid and satisfied upon the frenches receipt of the,and jeffco would assign the frenches all rights,claims,and interest it has or may have against assurance and fire in connection with the allegations in the underlying suit.jeffco and ohio casualty fulfilled their obligations under the settlement agreement and,by order entered september,the state court marked the judgment fully paid and satisfied in accordance with the settlement agreement.
on april,the frenches,as assignees of jeffco rights,claims,and interest against assurance and fire in connection with commercial general liability coverage for the allegations in the underlying suit,filed the present civil action in virginia state court against assurance and fire from henceforth,collectively,insurance defendants.the complaint alleged counts for declaratory judgment breach of contractual duty to indemnify breach of contractual duty to defend breach of the implied covenant of good faith and fair dealing and unjust enrichment.insurance defendants permissibly removed the case to federal court based upon diversity jurisdiction.all parties agreed below and continue to agree on appeal that maryland substantive law controls the coverage disputes presented in the present action.
on january,the frenches filed a motion for partial summary judgment,and the insurance defendants filed a motion for summary judgment.the frenches subsequently voluntarily dismissed their counts alleging breach of express duty to defend and unjust enrichment.this left the counts for declaratory judgment,breach of contractual duty to indemnify,and breach of the implied covenant of good faith and fair dealing.the frenches sought summary judgment on the basis that there was no genuine issue of material fact that the property damage to their home was caused by an occurrence during the insurance defendants respective policy periods and that they were entitled to judgment as a matter of law for in direct damages.frenches opening br.at.
the district court granted summary judgment in favor of the insurance defendants and denied the frenches motion for partial summary judgment.relying on the maryland court of special appeals decision in lerner assurance of,the district court concluded that no coverage existed under the iso cgl policies pursuant to the express exclusion of coverage for property damage expected or intended from the standpoint of the insured.
on appeal,the frenches seek reversal of the district court grant of summary judgment in favor of the insurance defendants with respect to their claims for declaratory judgment and breach of contract with respect to the express duty to indemnify the frenches base both claims upon their assertion that the iso cgl policies provide jeffco liability coverage for the cost to correct their home defective eifs exterior and to remedy the resulting moisture damage to the home otherwise nondefective structure and walls.the insurance defendants urge affirmance based upon the reasoning of the district court.alternatively,the insurance defendants suggest affirmance on three separate and independent grounds they asserted below,but which the district court did not address see infra at.
we review de novo the district court grant of summary judgment.williams staples,cir.summary judgment is appropriate when there is no genuine issue of material fact and the moving party is entitled to judgment as a matter of law.c edell assocs.law offices of peter angelos,cir.thus,the overarching issue that we must decide de novo is whether there is no genuine issue of material fact and the insurance defendants are entitled to judgment as a matter of law.to answer this question,we apply,as the parties agree,maryland substantive law regarding the interpretation of an insurance policy,which law provides in general as follows 
a n insurance policy is interpreted in the same manner as any other contract.maryland courts do not follow the rule that an insurance policy must be strictly construed against the insurer.the principal rule in the interpretation of contracts is to effect the intentions of the parties.when a contract wording is clear,the court will presume that the parties intended what they expressed,even if the expression differs from the parties intentions at the time they created the contract.if reasonably possible,effect must be given to every clause and phrase of a contract,so as not to omit an important part of the agreement.
nationwide ins.rhodes,internal quotation marks and citations omitted.
we will first address the reasoning of the district court.the district court relied heavily upon the maryland court of special appeals opinion in lerner assurance of,in ruling in favor of the insurance defendants.the insurance defendants also argue that lerner is dispositive in their favor.accordingly,a thorough discussion of lerner is in order.however,before we undertake such a discussion,we deem it helpful to provide some background information regarding relevant provisions of the iso cgl policies.
prior to,the iso had not significantly revised its standard commercial general liability form since.ernest martin,daniel mabery,erika blomquist jeffrey lowenstein,insurance coverage for the new breed of trademark infringement claims,smu,iso frequently makes minor revisions to its cgl form,but rarely undertakes a major,substantive overhaul the standard iso form in existence before the revision was promulgated in.
in the version of the iso cgl policy form,the work performed exclusion precluded coverage for property damage to work performed by or on behalf of the named insured arising out of the work or any portion thereof,or out of materials,parts or equipment furnished in connection therewith.kvaerner metals division of kvaerner,commercial union ins,some internal quotation marks omitted internal citations omitted quoting collett ins.of the west,th,d see also eric mills holmes,holmes appleman on insurance,at matthew bender.the on behalf of language was interpreted to mean that no coverage existed for damage to a subcontractor work,or for damage to the insured own work for damage resulting from a subcontractor work.kvaerner metals,at maryland casualty reeder,d.steven plitt,daniel maldonado joshua rogers,couch on insurance holmes appleman on insurance,at.
many contractors were unhappy with this state of affairs,since more and more projects were being completed with the help of subcontractors.american family mut.ins.american girl.see also couch on insurance due to the increasing use of subcontractors on construction projects,many general contractors were not satisfied with the lack of coverage provided under the iso cgl commercial general liability policies where the general contractor was not directly responsible for the defective work.in response to this unhappiness,beginning in,an insured under the iso cgl policy form could pay a higher premium to obtain a broad form property damage endorsement the bfpd endorsement which effectively eliminated the on behalf of language and excluded coverage only for property damage to work performed by the named insured.kvaerner metals,at reeder,d at.couch on insurance holmes appleman on insurance,at.thus,liability coverage was extended to the insured completed work when the damage arose out of work performed by a subcontractor.kvaerner metals,at reeder,d at.couch on insurance holmes appleman on insurance,at.
in,as part of a major revision,the subcontractor exception aspect of the bfpd endorsement was added directly to the body of the iso cgl policy in the form of an express exception to the your work exclusion.limbach.llc zurich am.ins,cir american family mut.ins,at.thus,under the iso cgl policies,the your work exclusion,exclusion l,specifically states that it does not apply if the damaged work or the work out of which the damage arises was performed on the insured contractor behalf by a subcontractor.emphasis added.
one other distinction between the iso cgl policy and the iso cgl policies is the definition of o ccurrence.rather than containing a separate exclusion from coverage for property damages expected or intended from the standpoint of the insured,as does the version of the iso cgl policy,exclusion a,the version includes the same language within its definition of occurrence.occurrence is defined by the iso cgl policy as an accident,including continuous or repeated exposure to conditions,which results in bodily injury or property damage neither expected or intended from the standpoint of the insured.lerner,at.
with this background in mind,we now turn to a thorough discussion of lerner.in lerner,the maryland court of special appeals addressed the issue,in the construction context,of what damages are expected from the standpoint of the insured under the terms of a iso cgl policy and a iso cgl policy.in lerner,the plaintiffs were a developer and the firm that provided the developer with construction management services in regard to the construction of an office building in rockville,maryland.id.at.a third party acted as the general contractor and all construction work on the building was performed by subcontractors.id.
the plaintiffs sold the building to the united states.id.at.the contract of sale provided that acceptance of the work performed under the contract was deemed to be final except as to latent defects.id.following the actual sale of the building,the general services administration gsa discovered latent defects in the building marble and stone exterior facade.id.at.there was no damage to other parts of the building resulting from such defects.
the plaintiffs undertook to repair the defective facade and then sued their commercial general liability insurers for indemnity.id.at.the defendant general liability carriers defended on the ground that the policies did not provide coverage for the plaintiffs economic losses arising out of breach of contract and,in addition,that any alleged damages were specifically excluded under the provisions of the policy.id.at.
the trial court granted summary judgment in favor of the defendant insurance carriers on the ground that the damages alleged by the plaintiffs arose out of a breach of contract and therefore,were not covered.id.the plaintiffs appealed.id.
on appeal,maryland court of special appeals affirmed,holding that the plaintiffs liability to correct the building defective facade did not result from the happening of an accident but resulted simply from its failure to satisfy its obligation under their contract,and therefore,did not constitute an occurrence under any of the cgl policies at issue.id.at.the court reasoned that i f the damages suffered relate to the satisfaction of the contractual bargain,it follows that they are not unforeseen.in other words,and in the context of this case,it should not be unexpected and unforeseen that,if the building delivered does not meet the contract requirements of the sale,the purchaser will be entitled to correction of the defect.id.at.the lerner court went on to opine in dicta,however,that if the defect causes unrelated and unexpected property damage to something other than the defective object itself,the resulting damages,subject to the terms of the applicable policy,may be covered.for example,if a collapse of the veneer had injured a user of the facility or damaged property other than the veneer itself,these may well be covered.id.
in the case before us,the district court held that coverage to correct the defective eifs exterior of the frenches home and to remedy the resulting damage to the nondefective structure and walls of such home was excluded pursuant to the express exclusion in the iso cgl policies for property damage that was expected from the standpoint of the insured relying on lerner assurance of,the district court held that the property damage to the residence was expected from the standpoint of jeffco,and therefore,no coverage existed for the frenches breach of contract claim.
in our view,the district court is partly right and partly wrong.under the iso cgl policies,the insurance defendants agreed to defend and,if necessary,indemnify jeffco for property damage caused by an occurrence,unless such property damage was otherwise excluded by the terms of the policies.an o ccurrence is defined by the iso cgl policies as an accident,including continuous or repeated exposure to substantially the same general harmful conditions.property damage is defined as physical injury to tangible property,including all resulting loss of use of that property.thus,our initial inquiry is whether the property damage to the frenches home falls within the initial grant of coverage in the iso cgl policies.
for analytical purposes,we deem it necessary to divide the property damage to the frenches home into two categories.the first category is the defective eifs exterior.the second category is the damage to the nondefective structure and walls of the frenches home directly resulting from moisture intrusion through the defective eifs exterior.
with respect to the first category,lerner unequivocally answers the question.we hold that just as the defective application of the building stone facade in lerner did not constitute an accident,and,therefore,not an occurrence under the materially similar cgl policies at issue in lerner,so does the defective application of the eifs exterior to the frenches home not constitute an accident,and therefore,not an occurrence under the iso cgl policies lerner,at.as the lerner court reasoned t he obligation to repair the facade itself is not unexpected or unforeseen under the terms of the sales contract.therefore,the repair or replacement damages represent economic loss and consequently would not trigger a duty to indemnify under a cgl policy.id.at.
however,despite the position of the district court and the insurance defendants,lerner does not answer the question with respect to the second category of damage claimed by the,damage to the nondefective structure and walls of the frenches home caused by moisture intrusion through the defectively installed eifs exterior.unlike the undisputed factual situation in the case before us,factually,lerner did not involve property damage to otherwise nondefective parts of the building.this is a significant distinction,and one which brings into play the subcontractor exception to the your work exclusion in the iso cgl policies.
thus,the question only referenced by lerner in dicta,and not answered by any other controlling maryland authority,is whether,under maryland law,the iso cgl policies provide a general contractor liability coverage for the cost to remedy property damage to the contractor otherwise nondefective caused by a subcontractor defective workmanship the supreme court of wisconsin thoughtful opinion in american family mutual insurance company american girl,and dicta in lerner conclusively persuade us that the answer to this question is yes.
in american family,the supreme court of wisconsin considered a materially analogous set of facts.the court found coverage under the version of the iso cgl policy to indemnify a general contractor for the costs to remedy property damage to a warehouse,the sinking of the building foundation and buckling and cracking of the building structure necessitating the building being declared unsafe and torn down caused by faulty advice by a soil engineering subcontractor.id.with respect to the initial grant of coverage,the court held that the property damage to the warehouse was the result of an accident,the settling of the soil,and therefore,an occurrence within the meaning of the iso cgl policy form.id.at.
moreover,in american family,the liability carrier,like the insurance defendants here,asserted,inter alia,that the expected or intended exclusion,exclusion a,applied to defeat coverage in full.id.at.specifically,the liability carrier argued that given poor soil conditions at the site and the insured general contractor recognition that special measures were required to prepare the soil to carry the weight of the warehouse,the insured general contractor expected that some settlement would occur,and thus,the exclusion applied.id.the court held the exclusion was not triggered because the liability carrier was not arguing that property damage was expected or intended by the general contractor,but only that some degree of settlement must have been expected under the circumstances.id.
additionally,the insurance carrier in american family also argued that coverage to remedy the property damage caused by the faulty advice by one of the insured general contractor subcontractors was defeated by the your work exclusion,exclusion l.after recounting the history of the iso inclusion of the subcontractor exception to the your work exclusion in the iso cgl policy form,the supreme court of wisconsin reiterated that the revision restored otherwise excluded coverage for damage caused to construction p
