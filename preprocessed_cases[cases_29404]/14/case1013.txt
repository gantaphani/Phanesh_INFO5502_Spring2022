plaintiff,md electrical contractors,filed suit against defendants fred and carol abrams,under a theory of quantum meruit to recover for services that it rendered as a subcontractor on defendants home improvement project.defendants moved to dismiss the case pursuant to section of the code of civil procedure code ilcs a west,alleging plaintiff failure to comply with the home repair and remodeling act act ilcs et west barred plaintiff recovery.the circuit court of du page county dismissed the case.plaintiff appealed and the appellate court reversed and remanded,holding that the home repair and remodeling act does not apply to subcontractors.d.
this court allowed defendants petition for leave to appeal pursuant to supreme court rule.defendants assert on appeal that the home repair and remodeling act applies to subcontractors and plaintiff is,therefore,precluded from recovery because it did not comply with the terms of the act regardless of the applicability of the act to subcontractors,plaintiff is prohibited from recovery under quantum meruit because there was no direct relationship between plaintiff and defendants.for the reasons stated below,we affirm the judgment of the appellate court.
background 
on november,plaintiff,an illinois corporation,filed its first amended complaint,which is the subject of this case.plaintiff alleged that from june,through october,it was a subcontractor that provided labor,electrical equipment,and materials which we collectively refer to as services toward the remodeling of defendants residence in naperville,illinois.plaintiff alleges that it provided services to defendants on a nongratuitous basis defendants accepted,received,and enjoyed the benefits of these services and these services had a value of.plaintiff has not been compensated for its services.the complaint did not identify a theory of liability,but merely pled the facts above as well as the fact that no contract existed between defendants and plaintiff to govern the method of payment for plaintiff services.
defendants filed a motion to dismiss pursuant to section of the code,alleging that the services performed by plaintiff fell within the home repair and remodeling act and that the plaintiff had failed to comply with the act.thus,defendants asserted,plaintiff could not recover because the court could not imply a contract where the act would prohibit one.defendants relied upon the following provisions of the home repair and remodeling act section policy,section definitions of home repair and remodeling and person,section requirements of written contracts and the contents thereof,section the consumer rights brochure,and section unlawful acts.ilcs,west.
plaintiff countered that the act does not apply to subcontractors.the basis for this assertion was the act focus on communications with the homeowner.plaintiff asserted that because subcontractors generally do not have significant interaction with the homeowner,the act could not be meant to apply to them.in support of its argument,plaintiff attached a copy of an affidavit of michael,md electrical president.the affidavit averred that plaintiff was hired by and had a contract with apex builders,a general contractor apex is not a party to this litigation,and that prior to commencing work on june,plaintiff conducted a of the jobsite.during the,defendants approved the plans,authorized the work to begin,and requested additional services that were not part of the original plan plaintiff performed these services,and defendants have retained the full benefit of these services without having paid for them.
the circuit court,after considering the above arguments and ascertaining that plaintiff theory of liability was quantum meruit,granted defendants motion to dismiss.in the process of dismissing the complaint,the trial court asked plaintiff q uantum meruit is a contract that implied,and how can the court imply a contract when the law prohibits one at plaintiff request,the trial court clarified that its finding was that to grant the relief that plaintiff is saying would be under quantum meruit would be in derogation of statute and a clear legislative pronouncement contrary.the court concluded by saying that plaintiff could either amend the complaint or the court could issue a finding under supreme court rule so that plaintiff could take an interlocutory appeal.plaintiff requested the rule finding and appealed.
plaintiff presented two issues to the appellate court first,plaintiff argued that the home repair and remodeling act does not apply to subcontractors second,even if the act does apply to subcontractors,plaintiff was not precluded from recovering in quantum meruit.the appellate court agreed with plaintiff first contention,finding that the act does not apply to subcontractors.as such,the court reversed and remanded the cause without reaching the issue of whether recovery is available in quantum meruit even if the act applies.d at.
in their petition for leave to appeal to this court,defendants raised,as the sole issue,the application of the act to subcontractors.however,in their brief to this court,defendants raise a second issue,namely,whether subcontractors are able to recover in quantum meruit or any direct action outside the mechanics lien act ilcs et west.
as to the first issue,plaintiff maintains that the language is ambiguous.in response to the second issue,plaintiff contends that this question is forfeited because the issue was not raised in the defendants statement of points relied upon in the petition for leave to appeal,as required by supreme court rule.
this is a case of first impression and requires this court to examine the meaning of the home repair and remodeling act with respect to subcontractors.as this case is one of statutory interpretation,the standard of review is de novo.harshman dephillips.
it should be noted at the outset that the use of general contractors and subcontractors is a common business practice in the home repair and remodeling industry.this relationship usually entails a homeowner contracting with a general contractor to oversee a specific project,such as an addition to a home.the general contractor acts as a project manager and may in turn contract with other individuals or tradesmen to perform certain duties,for instance the plumbing or masonry.the general contractor,in its managerial capacity,ensures that each task is performed in the proper manner and order.the homeowner pays the general contractor based on the terms of their agreement.the general contractor in turn pays the subcontractors based on the agreements that they formed.thus,the hallmark of a subcontractor is that he works for the general contractor and not for the homeowner or business owner.this practice alleviates much of the burden on the homeowner of coordinating a construction project.it ensures that the homeowner does not have to know enough about construction to ensure that the plumber roughs in the plumbing before the drywall contractor hangs the sheet rock that obscures the wall cavity where the pipes were to be run.it also allows the homeowner to deal with only one person or company and not to have to contract with or supervise every aspect of the project.this common understanding of the general relationship is critical to the understanding of the home repair and remodeling act.
the process of statutory interpretation is firmly established.the goal is to ascertain and give effect to the intent of the legislature.the simplest and surest means of effectuating this goal is to read the statutory language itself and give the words their plain and ordinary meaning.illinois graphics nickum.however,it is not sufficient to read a portion of the statute in isolation.we must,instead,read the statute in its entirety,keeping in mind the subject it addresses and the legislature apparent objective in enacting it.gill miller.where the language of the statute is clear and unambiguous,we must apply it as written,without resort to other tools of statutory construction.raintree homes,village of long grove.generally,the language of a statute is considered ambiguous when it is capable of being understood by reasonably persons in two or more different senses.in re.
in the present case,we are asked to decide whether and to what extent the home repair and remodeling act applies to subcontractors.we begin with the language of the act itself.the act requires that a person engaged in the business of home repair or remodeling shall furnish to the customer for signature a written contract.ilcs west.this contract must meet certain disclosure requirements including cost and business name ilcs west,and the person must give the homeowner notice of any arbitration clauses or jury waivers.ilcs west.further,the act requires that any person engaging in the business of home repair and remodeling shall provide to its customers a copy of the home repair know your consumer rights pamphlet prior to the execution of any home repair and remodeling contract,the text of this brochure appears in the statute itself.ilcs west.the act specifies that it is unlawful for any person engaged in the business of home repairs and remodeling to remodel or make repairs before obtaining a signed contract or work order for over.ilcs west.
the next stage of analysis looks to the definitions provided within the act.person is defined in section of the act as any individual,partnership,corporation,business,trust,or other legal entity.ilcs west.home repair and remodeling is defined as the fixing,replacing,altering,converting,modernizing,improving,or making of an addition to any real property primarily designed or used as a residence other than maintenance,service,or repairs under.home repair and remodeling includes electrical wiring.ilcs west.
for the purposes of the case at bar,plaintiff does not dispute that it was engaged in home repair and remodeling work at defendants place of residence.further,the parties do not dispute that the work plaintiff performed,had it been done by a general contractor or in direct relationship to the homeowner,would fall squarely within the home repair and remodeling act.finally,plaintiff does not claim that it attempted to comply with the act.instead,the question is whether,by nature of plaintiff being a subcontractor,the act applies in a way that prohibits plaintiff from recovering from the homeowners because it did not comply with the act.
defendants argue that the act is unambiguous in its use of the term any person,which,they contend,clearly includes subcontractors.plaintiff contends that the home repair and remodeling act was designed to regulate the communications between contractors and the.thus,because subcontractors typically do not have significant direct communications with homeowners,the home repair and remodeling act can not apply to them.
the text of the act lends support to plaintiff position.section states that the general assembly recognizes that improved communications and accurate representations between persons engaged in the business of making home repairs or remodeling and their consumers will increase consumer confidence,reduce the likelihood of disputes,and promote fair and honest practices in that business in this state.ilcs west.
the text of the consumer rights brochure that must accompany a contract also militates against a reading that includes subcontractors.under the contracts section of the brochure,item states,remember,homeowners should know who provides supplies and labor for any work performed on your home.suppliers and subcontractors have a right to file a lien against your property if the general contractor fails to pay them.to protect your property,request lien waivers from the general contractor.ilcs west.the sections of the act that precede the consumer rights brochure prescribe that the person engaged in the business must include in its contract with the homeowner its business name and address.if the person uses a post office box,then that person must give the address of their personal residence as well.ilcs west.it is doubtful that the legislature would include language in the consumers rights brochure that warns homeowners to know who provides supplies and labor if the legislature intended that everyone,subcontractors included,individually comply with the act.
however,defendants argue that the statute is unambiguous and applies to plaintiff.they note that plaintiff complaint states that it is an illinois corporation with its principal place of business in illinois.corporations are specifically listed in the definition of person.ilcs west.thus,they argue plaintiff falls within the statute meaning of person.likewise,the work performed by plaintiff clearly falls within the meaning of home repair or remodeling as provided in the statute.furthermore,plaintiff alleges that the value of its services was,well in excess of the minimum contract required by the act.the act makes no mention of,or distinction between,contractor and subcontractor.instead it repeatedly refers to any person.thus,according to defendants,the plain language means that plaintiff is a person engaged in the business of home repair and remodeling and is,therefore,bound to comply with the act.thus,defendants argue that the statute unambiguously applies to all subcontractors,including plaintiff.plaintiff argues that the statute is ambiguous and is meant to exclude subcontractors.we are not persuaded by either approach.
instead of adopting either the defendants or plaintiff argument,this court recognizes that s tatutes should be read as a whole with all relevant parts considered.in re marriage of kates.when the home repair and remodeling act is considered in its entirety,it is clear that the statute unambiguously applies only to those who directly contract with a homeowner.
the entire focus of the act is on regulating the direct contact and contracting between the person and the homeowner or consumer.section of the act sets forth the policy statement of the general assembly in enacting the act.it states in relevant part,t he business of home repair and remodeling is a matter affecting the public interest.a ccurate representations between persons engaged in the business of making home repairs or remodeling and their consumers will increase consumer confidence.emphases added.ilcs west.subcontractors,by virtue of their working for a general contractor,do not make representations to a homeowner.thus,consumer confidence can not be enhanced through the regulation of subcontractors as their business practice is not one that engages the.
the conclusion that the act applies only to those who contract directly is further supported by section of the act.section specifies the contents of the contract that the person is to provide to the homeowner.section states,prior to initiating home repair or remodeling work a person engaged in the business of home repair and remodeling shall furnish to the customer for signature a written contract that states the total cost.emphases added.ilcs west.subcontractors do not directly contract with a so this section can not apply to them.further,section says that the contract must contain the total cost.total cost is in reference to the total cost of the project,not the cost of each individual subpart of the project.
in addition,section prescribes notice be given to a consumer if the contract presented requires a consumer to submit all disputes to arbitration,or waive the right to a jury trial.it states 
a person engaged in the business that prepares or presents a written offer for home repair and remodeling to a consumer,shall advise the consumer,before the contract or agreement is accepted and executed,of the presence of any contractual provision that requires the consumer to i submit all contract or agreement disputes to binding arbitration and ii waive his or her right to a trial by jury.ilcs a west.
further,aside from the point that a subcontractor does not prepare or present a written offer for home repair and remodeling to a consumer,there is the negotiations clause that appears in subsection b.section b notes that if a consumer rejects either or both of the above clauses,that this shall be treated as a counter offer.ilcs b west.clearly,this section applies to those who contract directly with the homeowner.it can not be read to include subcontractors.subcontractors do not negotiate with a homeowner,they do not present written contracts to a homeowner,and they are certainly not in a position to accept counter offers.a subcontractor relationship is with the general contractor.the subcontractor presence or absence on a jobsite is accordingly based on the contract and relationship formed with the general contractor and not with the homeowner.
finally,section of the act also supports the exclusion of subcontractors from the act.section states that a person engaged in the business must provide to its customers a copy of the home repair know your consumer rights pamphlet prior to the execution of any home repair and remodeling contract.emphasis added.ilcs west.the customer of a subcontractor is the general contractor,not the homeowner.it would make no sense to provide a consumer rights brochure to the general contractor.the general contractor is not a consumer.
defendants maintain that a proper reading of the act merely requires a subcontractor to comply with the act if it wants to preserve the right of direct action against the homeowner.preserving a right of action,however,is not the sole focus of the act.the act also regulates liability for failure to comply with its terms.the enforcement provisions use the same any person language as the rest of the act.thus,the act implicates not just civil recovery,but civil liability as well.
section of the act authorizes the attorney general or the state attorney to bring an action against any person to restrain and prevent any pattern or practice violation of this act.emphasis added.ilcs a west.because section contains no exception to the any person language,noncompliance with the act not only prevents the ability to recover,but also exposes the entity to civil liability.thus,the act can not reasonably be construed,as defendants contend,to apply to a subcontractor only when the subcontractor wishes to bring a direct action against the homeowner.the act must apply to subcontractors in its entirety,or not at all.
our conclusion that the act does not include subcontractors is also consistent with related statutes.a subcontractor recovery against a homeowner is usually governed by the mechanics lien act ilcs et west.in fact,the consumer rights brochure provided for in the home repair and remodeling act implicitly references the application of the mechanics lien act.the brochure states,suppliers and subcontractors have a right to file a lien against your property if the general contractor fails to pay them.to protect your property,request lien waivers from the general contractor.ilcs c west.
the mechanics lien act is designed to provide,among other things,a remedy for wronged subcontractors.if the home repair and remodeling act applies to subcontractors,portions of the mechanics lien act are rendered superfluous.for instance,section of the mechanics lien act prescribes a notice that each subcontractor must provide to a homeowner in order to preserve its lien claim 
each subcontractor who has furnished,or is furnishing,labor,services,material,fixtures,apparatus or machinery,forms or form work in order to preserve his lien,shall notify the occupant either personally or by certified mail,return receipt requested,addressed to the occupant or his agent at the residence within days from his first furnishing labor,services,material,fixtures,apparatus or machinery,forms or form work,of his agreement to do so.
the notice shall contain the name and address of the subcontractor or material man,the date he started to work or to deliver materials,the type of work done and to be done or the type of labor,services,material,fixtures,apparatus or machinery,forms or form work delivered and to be delivered.ilcs b ii west.
if the home repair and remodeling act required each subcontractor,before work began,to furnish to the customer for signature a written contract or work order that states the total cost,including parts and materials listed with reasonable particularity and any charge for an estimate ilcs west,it would render the notice provided in section b of the mechanics lien act unnecessary and redundant.
the mechanics lien act also requires a subcontractor to give a specific warning to a homeowner when it provides the notice of rendering services.this warning reads 
the subcontractor providing this notice has performed work for or delivered material to your home improvement contractor.these services or materials are being used in the improvements to your residence and entitle the subcontractor to file a lien against your residence if the services or materials are not paid for by your home improvement contractor.a lien waiver will be provided to your contractor when the subcontractor is paid,and you are urged to request this waiver from your contractor when paying for your home improvements.ilcs west.
by comparison,the brochure required under the home repair and remodeling act requires the statement,homeowners should know who provides supplies and labor for any work performed on your home.suppliers and subcontractors have a right to file a lien against your property if the general contractor fails to pay them.to protect your property,request lien waivers from the general contractor.ilcs c west.
if each subcontractor is required to contract with the homeowner directly,there would be no need for these provisions in the mechanics lien act.all the information required in both the mechanics lien act notice and warning would already have been given as required under sections and of the home repair and remodeling act.
forcing subcontractors to comply with the act would increase the burden on the very homeowners the act is meant to protect.such a homeowner would have to read and examine each contract,ensure that the totals in the subcontracts do not exceed the amount allocated to that portion of the project under both the contract with the general contractor and the contract that the general contractor has with the subcontractor.the homeowner would have to ensure the same project deadlines are present.the homeowner may even have to ensure that the deadlines in one contract are sufficiently early to allow other subcontractors to complete their tasks before the total project deadline.the simplicity of providing the homeowner with one written contract enumerating all the costs would be obfuscated under such a reading.even under the best of circumstances,all a requirement of subcontractor compliance would yield is repetition of the same information already conveyed by the general contractor.
the statute is focused on regulating the communications and business practices of those people who directly solicit and contract with the homeowner.
the statute plain language limits its application to only those who contract directly with the homeowner.to allow any other interpretation not only would be contrary to our principles of statutory interpretation,but would also do severe damage to industry practice and other statutes.the home repair and remodeling act is unambiguous and only applies to those who form direct contracts with the homeowner.
defendants petition for leave to appeal raised only the issue of the application of the home repair and remodeling act to subcontractors.however,in defendants brief to this court,they raise the question of plaintiff ability to recover under quantum meruit where there was no direct contractual relationship between the defendants and plaintiff.in reality,this question is far broader than the application of quantum meruit to the present action.indeed,the argument is that a subcontractor has no direct right of recovery outside of the mechanics lien act.this question was not properly presented in the defendants petition for leave to appeal pla.accordingly,plaintiff argues that the issue is forfeited.for the reasons that follow,we agree.
defendants argue that this question is not forfeited because it was i directly and properly raised before the appellate court,ii directly raised in the initial brief filed in this cause,and iii plaintiff has had ample opportunity to respond to the argument.this statement is incorrect on all three counts.
the defendants contention that the issue was properly raised before the appellate court is a red herring.as this court stated in marshall burger king,i t is well settled that where the appellate court reverses the judgment of the circuit court,and the appellee in that court brings the case before this court as an appellant,that party may raise any issues properly presented by the record to sustain the judgment of the circuit court.marshall burger king,noting that the sole issue before the trial court was whether defendant owed a duty of care to decedent thus,when defendant raised the issue of proximate cause before this court,this court found the issue was not properly presented by the record and thus ineligible for review.in the present case,defendants prevailed in the circuit court.they were the appellees in the appellate court,where plaintiff prevailed,and are the appellants in the present action.therefore,the relevant inquiry is not,as defendants contend,whether the issue was directly and properly raised before the appellate court,but rather whether the issue is properly raised by the trial court record and can now be utilized to support the finding of the trial court.
at the outset,we note that the issue before this court is a different issue than was addressed by the circuit court.defendants,in their motion to dismiss plaintiff first amended complaint,argued that the trial court could not allow plaintiff action to go forward because to do so would be in derogation of a statute which prohibited the enforcement of this agreement.to support this argument,defendants cited tlc the laser center,midwest eye institute ii,d,and leoris dicks,d.in tlc,the appellate court held that a arrangement could not be enforced because it ran afoul of the medical practice act.tlc,d at.in leoris,the appellate court refused to allow attorneys to split fees where public policy prohibited the practice.in doing so,the appellate court noted that,w here enforcement of an illegal contract is sought,the courts will aid neither party but will leave them where they have placed themselves since the parties are pari delicto and can recover nothing under the contract.leoris,d at.
in the present case,the trial court,in granting the motion to dismiss asked plaintiff counsel,h ow can the court imply a contract where the law prohibits one thus,the question before the trial court was not the availability of the quantum meruit theory of recovery itself,but whether the court enforcement of an implied contract would be lawful where the home repair and remodeling act if it applied to subcontractors would prohibit the contract from existing in the first place.
before this court,the issue presented by defendants is decidedly different.defendants present the issue by stating that a subcontractor has no claim against a homeowner in quantum meruit under illinois law.thus,the issue changes from one that was intertwined with the application of the home repair and remodeling act to a question that is an independent basis for dismissal of the case.it is also worth noting that the first time the cases of redd woodford county swine breeders,d,vanderlaan berry construction,d,and suddarth rosen,d,appear as cited authority is in defendants brief to this court.defendants make no mention of these cases in their motion to dismiss.the appearance of these cases in defendants brief to this court invites the court to adopt a per se prohibition on a subcontractor recovering against a homeowner outside of the mechanics lien act,where there was no privity of contract.this is a different issue altogether than was presented to the trial court.thus,the quantum meruit issue presented to this court is not properly presented by the record in this case and is therefore forfeited.
further,supreme court rule c requires that petitions for leave to appeal contain a statement of the points relied upon for reversal of the judgment of the appellate court.c.if a party fails to raise an issue in its petition for leave to appeal,it may be deemed a forfeiture of that issue.central illinois light home insurance.
contrary to defendants assertions,the issue was not directly raised in the pla.the first time the quantum meruit issue is even mentioned in the pla is in footnote on page of the pla,where the defendants note that the appellate court declined to address the related issue of whether a subcontractor can recover from a homeowner with whom there is no direct contractual relationship.the issue is alluded to a second time in the last paragraph of the conclusion,where the defendants state that the plaintiff has no right to proceed directly against the defendants under any theory except a properly perfected mechanic lien.these passing references do not constitute a statement sufficient to meet the requirements of rule.
finally,there is no legal support to claim that a court should reach an issue simply because plaintiff has had an ample opportunity to respond.beyond the defendants implication that plaintiff had ample opportunity to respond,plaintiff only response to this argument was to assert that the issue was forfeited.this case is illustrative of why the court must have forfeiture rules.by raising the question at this juncture,this court is effectively deprived of the benefit of having the issue squarely addressed by the parties.therefore,this issue is forfeited for the purpose of the present appeal before this court.
conclusion 
for the reasons stated,the home repair and remodeling act does not apply to subcontractors.we affirm the judgment of the appellate court,which remanded this cause to the trial court for further consideration.
the court decision today rests on the assumption that the home repair and remodeling act is an affirmative defense to the cause of action asserted in this case.the court opinion,however,never addresses if this assumption is correct.the court analysis is therefore incomplete.additionally,the court decision rests upon its discussion of the relationship of a subcontractor to a general contractor.this is problematic for a number of reasons,not the least of which is the fact that the court understanding of that relationship comes from facts not found in the record.in fact,operation of the home repair and remodeling act in this case has nothing to do with notions regarding the relationship between general and subcontractors at act does not even use the terms,a fact all but ignored by the court.instead,the act concerns only the nature of work done and whether the work has been done pursuant to the act requirements concerning accuracy of communications about that work to the consumer.facts about these things are entirely underdeveloped in this record,a fault of plaintiff complaint to be sure,but a fault that the court condones.in utterly failing to allege any specifics about the contract in this case and the work undertaken,the complaint hardly offers a proper foundation for this court first opportunity to address the home repair and remodeling act.
the court is not bothered by any of this,or the niceties of proper procedure for that matter.the result is an opinion of nature and a confusing one at that.readers of the court opinion may try,as i have,to determine exactly what the court ruling is.as far as i can perceive,it is this the home repair and remodeling act applies only to entities that contract directly with consumers and,to the extent that plaintiff claims that it was not such an entity,the act does not apply to it.this perhaps would be an acceptable ruling,if there were any basis in the record for it.the record,however is far too underdeveloped to allow for that conclusion,and i therefore respectfully dissent.
procedural background controlling principles 
the first indication that the court opinion is appears early on in its background section.in a footnote,the court explains that because neither party has claimed that plaintiff was anything other than a subcontractor,it need not address the fact that the record reflects that plaintiff may have ceased to act as a subcontractor.at.at,at.the court asserts that this discrepancy has no bearing on its analysis because such a dispute is a factual question and beyond the scope of this opinion.at.at,at.
i am not entirely sure what the court means by beyond the scope of this opinion.this case is before us on the dismissal of plaintiff complaint pursuant to section of the code of civil procedure ilcs west.generally,the existence of such a disputed question of fact is enough,in and of itself,to preclude dismissal under section,as was explained in kedzie currency exchange,hodge.based on statements made in the parties affidavits,i disagree that neither party has claimed that plaintiff was anything other than a subcontractor.the parties are in dispute about plaintiff status.in my opinion,the existence of a disputed factual question is not beyond the scope of an opinion that supposedly addresses whether the circuit court correctly dismissed the cause of action under section.
it could be said that all of the problems in today opinion stem from the court inability to properly frame the central issue before it.as i have noted,the question raised in this appeal is whether the circuit court properly dismissed plaintiff complaint.the court,however,sees the issue differently,stating that,in this appeal,it is asked to decide whether and to what extent the act applies to subcontractors.at.at,at.the court failure to accurately recognize the issue leads it to assert that the standard of review in this case is de novo because the case is one of statutory interpretation.at.at,at.this,of course,is wrong.although the circuit court decision to dismiss raised an ancillary question concerning the interpretation of a statute a legal question to which rulings made by the circuit court are given no deference on appeal,the standard of review in all appeals,including this one,is governed by the circuit court ultimate disposition,nothing else.in this case,that disposition was the dismissal of plaintiff complaint pursuant to section.an appeal from such a ruling is the same in nature as an appeal following the grant of summary judgment and is likewise a matter given to de novo review.kedzie,at.the reviewing court must consider whether the existence of a genuine issue of material fact should have precluded the dismissal or,absent such an issue of fact,whether dismissal is proper as a matter of law.kedzie,at.see also michael,illinois practice.
defendant motion to dismiss was presumably brought pursuant to subsection a of section.i say presumably because the motion does not specify the subsection under which it was brought,a fact that does not appear to bother the court much subsection a is appropriate where the basis asserted for dismissal relies on affirmative matter avoiding the legal effect of or defeating the claim.ilcs a west.the important point is that a section a motion admits the legal sufficiency of the plaintiff cause of action much in the same way that a section motion to dismiss admits a complaint facts.kedzie,at.however,such motions do not admit conclusions of law or conclusions of fact unsupported by allegations of specific facts upon which such conclusions rest.meyer murray,d.
what,then,did plaintiff allege in its complaint the complaint alleged in conclusory fashion that,over the course of a period in,plaintiff furnished services,which consisted of providing electrical materials,equipment,labor and services at defendants residence.the complaint,all of a page and a half,alleged that no contract existed between plaintiff and defendants to govern the method by which plaintiff would be compensated for its services.plaintiff sought the reasonable value of its services.the complaint otherwise failed to specifically allege what subcontractor services were actually performed or even the scope of its subcontract in relation to the rest of the general contract.
all of the other facts in this case come by way of affidavits submitted for consideration upon the motion to dismiss.the affidavits defendants attached to their motion stated that they did not enter into any written contract with plaintiff and did not receive any pamphlet required by the home repair and remodeling act.the affidavit of michael,which was attached to plaintiff response,stated that plaintiff contracted with apex builders,the general contractor,for electrical material and services to be installed performed at defendant residence.affidavit stated that apex had a contractual relationship with defendants.the affidavit stated further that,during an initial,defendants approved the preliminary plans and authorized said work to begin.plaintiff performed services including but not limited to installation of conduit,brackets,electrical boxes,recessed lighting and bathroom fans.
that affidavit also stated,however,that other work,outside of apex contract,was performed by plaintiff.affidavit stated that during the same initial,defendants requested that plaintiff provide additional material and services not included in the original plan including but not limited to lighting television and data wiring and full electrical services to an additional family room and an additional bathroom.emphasis added.
importantly,affidavit says nothing about the central concern for this case whether the recovery sought by plaintiff represented costs for work not included in the original plan as opposed to costs for work that plaintiff performed under apex contract with the defendants.
finally,defendants supported their reply with affidavits which stated that neither apex nor plaintiff provided them with a written agreement or change order for additional work claimed by plaintiff,namely lighting,television and data wiring,and full electrical services to an additional family room and an additional bathroom.defendants also stated that they were never provided with an updated estimate of the cost for any such additional work.
what are the consequences of these alleged facts a section motion is designed to test,like a motion for summary judgment,if a material or genuine disputed question of fact is raised.if so,the circuit court may decide the motion 
upon the affidavits and evidence offered by the parties,or may deny the motion without prejudice to the right to raise the subject matter of the motion by answer and shall so deny it if the action is one in which a party is entitled to a trial by jury and a jury demand has been filed by the opposite party in apt time.ilcs c west.
see also castro chicago,rock island pacific.therefore,section,unlike a motion for summary judgment,allows the trial judge the discretion to litigate disputed questions of fact if a jury demand has not been made.in exercising this discretion,the judge may hear and determine the merits of the dispute based on the pleadings,affidavits,counteraffidavits,and other evidence presented,but may not weigh conflicting affidavits.in re estate of silverman,d.when presented with conflicting affidavits,the judge must hold an evidentiary hearing at which the unresolved issue or issues of fact must be determined on the basis of a preponderance of the evidence.michael,illinois practice,at,citing chapman huttenlocher,d,calloway kinkelaar,freeman,specially concurring noting the shifting burdens in section practice.
application of the law 
whether the circuit court correctly dismissed plaintiff complaint turns upon whether the act has any application to this case in light of the facts actually alleged,and not on generalizations about the relationship between subcontractors and contractors.as an initial matter,i note that both this court and the appellate court have accepted the underlying premise of defendants section the act serves as an affirmative defense to plaintiff cause of action.as a result,neither court has engaged in any analysis on the question of whether the legislature intended,by virtue of the act passage,to abolish the common law remedy of quantum meruit or even to provide individual consumers like defendants with a private right of action to enforce violations of the act.certainly,the plain language of the act is silent as to both of these related issues.the act stated purpose is to increase consumer confidence,reduce the likelihood of disputes,and promote fair practices between consumers and those enga
