during a recess after the first day of a bench trial,ignatin for the first time challenged the validity of a recorded amendment that purportedly extended the duration date set forth in the original cc rs,and asked the trial court to find that the cc rs expired on january,the original expiration date.the trial court made that finding,entered judgment in favor of ignatin on schuman complaint,and dismissed ignatin and edmunds as moot.schuman,edmunds,and ignatin all appeal schuman and edmunds challenge,among other things,the trial court finding that the cc rs expired,arguing that the applicable statute of limitations bars ignatin assertion that the amendment of the cc rs was invalid,and ignatin challenges the dismissal of ignatin as moot.we conclude that ignatin assertion of the invalidity of the amendment is.accordingly,we reverse the judgment and remand the matter for retrial,at which ignatin may present other asserted defenses against schuman and edmunds claims and seek the relief sought in ignatin.
in,link builders,owners of real property described as lots through of tract in the city of los angeles,recorded a declaration of establishment of conditions and restrictions the cc rs that subjected all of the lots in the general plan development to various conditions and restrictions.among other things,the cc rs provided that no structure on any lot may be constructed in such a manner as to obstruct the scenic view of any other lot owner.the cc rs also provided that the conditions and restrictions would run with the land,and would remain in force until january.
on december,the brentwood hills homeowners association recorded a document entitled amendment to extend duration of declaration of establishment of conditions and restrictions for tract the amendment.the amendment,which was signed in by the owners of of the lots,stated that the owners desired to amend the cc rs to provide that the restrictions and conditions would remain in effect until january,and would be continued automatically for year periods unless a majority of owners recorded a written agreement changing,modifying,or extinguishing the cc rs.schuman signed the amendment as owner of lot cordelia road,a different lot than the lot schuman owned at the time this lawsuit was initiated edmunds signed as owner of parcel a cordelia road.ignatin predecessor as owner of lot cordelia road,which was owned by alfred yue at the time the amendment was signed also signed the amendment.ignatin purchased lot in or around october.
sometime before september,schuman,edwards,and other owners of homes in tract learned that ignatin planned to construct a new,much larger,home on lot.schuman and the other neighbors believed the new home would violate the cc rs,including the view protection provisions.some of the neighbors expressed to ignatin their concerns about the proposed construction,and made suggestions about how to abate some of those concerns.when ignatin did not respond to those suggestions,schuman,edmunds,and several other neighbors sent a letter to ignatin on september,demanding that ignatin suspend all development of the property until the neighbors concerns were addressed.ignatin responded to the letter a week later,disputing that the proposed construction would violate the cc rs ignatin did not challenge the validity of the cc rs or the amendment.
on october,schuman filed a complaint against ignatin seeking a declaration that ignatin proposed construction would violate the cc rs,and an injunction prohibiting ignatin from constructing any structure or cultivating any landscaping that would interfere with schuman scenic view in violation of the cc rs.that same day,schuman recorded a joinder in the amendment,as owner of lot.
ignatin filed an general denial,with several affirmative defenses,none of which challenged the validity of the cc rs or the a for declaratory relief against schuman,edmunds,and the other property owners who signed the september,letter to ignatin.the alleged that all the lots in tract are subject to recorded cc r,but that ignatin proposed construction would not violate the cc rs and the amendment.the also alleged that schuman,edmunds,and the other owners may not enforce the cc rs and the amendment,because they have acquiesced in violations of the cc rs and the amendment,because they have waived their right to enforce the cc rs and the amendment,and because changed circumstances in tract render the cc rs and the amendment obsolete and enforcement of the cc rs and amendment against ignatin inequitable and arbitrary.ignatin requested a declaration that the proposed construction does not violate the cc rs or the amendment,or alternatively,that the cc rs and the amendment may not be enforced to prevent ignatin construction of a residence on ignatin property in accordance with the plans.
edmunds responded with a against ignatin,seeking a declaration that the proposed construction would violate the cc rs,city codes and laws,and ceqa,and would constitute a nuisance edmunds also sought an injunction prohibiting ignatin from constructing any structure that would interfere with edmunds rights.
a court trial on the matter began on june.in his opening statement,ignatin attorney asserted the evidence would show that schuman allowed construction of another house that blocks schuman view,that ignatin proposed house would not unreasonably block any significant views,and that schuman,edmunds,and other neighbors can not enforce the cc rs against ignatin because they violated the cc rs themselves.there was no reference made to the possible invalidity of the cc rs or the amendment.
following opening statements,schuman presented two expert architect who testified about how the proposed house would block schuman view,and a real estate appraiser who testified about the value of schuman property and the change in value if the proposed house were built.schuman then called george marnon,an owner of one of the lots in tract.marnon testified that he bought his property after the cc rs had been extended by the amendment,and that the existence of cc rs protecting the view was an important consideration when he and his wife decided to buy the property he noted that he and his wife were aware that tract was the only tract in the neighborhood that chose to extend the duration of the cc rs.he also testified that he and his wife had to file a lawsuit against another neighbor to enforce the cc rs about five years earlier,when the neighbor built a fence that obstructed his view.he and his wife estimated that the value of the view was,so they were willing to spend that much in legal fees to preserve that view.he testified that even though ignatin proposed house would not interfere with his view,he was concerned that,if ignatin were to prevail,other property owners would be allowed to build structures that would block his view.
marnon was the last witness on the first day of trial.schuman attorney estimated that he would call four more witnesses on the next day of trial,and ignatin attorney said that he would call one or two more witnesses before the parties and the court participated in a viewing at the location.on the next day of trial,june,the parties met with the court in chambers,after which the matter was continued until september,to allow the parties to engage in further settlement discussions mediation.
on august,ignatin filed a supplemental trial brief.the stated purpose of this brief was to address three major issues not previously brought to the trial court attention.ignatin argued he was entitled to judgment as a matter of law in this action because the cc rs expired on january,the amendment was ineffective to extend the cc rs because it was not signed by all of the lot owners and schuman could not enforce the cc rs against ignatin because the previous owner of schuman lot did not sign the amendment.at a status conference held on september,the trial court ordered further briefing and set a hearing to address the issues ignatin raised.schuman filed a response that addressed the merits of ignatin arguments,but also asserted that the arguments were untimely,outside the pleadings,and could not be tried without amendment of ignatin pleadings.
following argument,the trial court ruled that ignatin did not waive the challenge to the cc rs by not raising it sooner,and that the amendment did not extend the cc rs because it was not signed by all of the lot owners.the court ruling,set forth in a minute order,concluded this court is legally compelled to find that the ccrs expired on january,that the restrictions of the ccrs are not covenants running with the land and that the defendants are entitled to judgment as a matter of law.the court is well aware of the impact of this ruling on the plaintiffs and each of the property owners and strongly encourages the parties to take this to the court of appeal for guidance.
ignatin submitted a proposed judgment that provided that schuman would take nothing on the complaint,that edmunds would take nothing on his,and that ignatin would be granted declaratory relief,decreeing that the cc rs expired by their terms and are of no force and effect the amendment did not extend the cc rs or create equitable servitudes or covenants running with ignatin property,and is void and neither the cc rs nor the amendment impose any restraint on ignatin proposed construction.the trial court did not sign the proposed judgment,instead writing the court ruling on the minute order will stand as the judgment.in the meantime,edmunds filed an objection to the proposed judgment,arguing that it was inappropriate to issue a final ruling on his because the ruling did not address or resolve all issues alleged in the.
three months later,ignatin filed a motion for entry of judgment.ignatin noted that there was no signed judgment because neither the minute order nor the handwriting on the submitted proposed judgment was signed by the court.ignatin also pointed out that,although the minute order disposed of all claims based on the cc rs and the amendment,it did not mention all of the.the motion attached two different proposed judgments,and asked that the court sign one of them,or any other judgment that finally adjudicated the rights of all parties.in response to the motion,edmunds noted that the court had not yet ruled on his earlier objection to the proposed judgment.
at the hearing on ignatin motion,the court provided the parties with a proposed judgment nunc pro tunc it had drafted.that proposed judgment stated that schuman shall take nothing by way of the complaint,that ignatin shall recover costs from schuman,and that ignatin and edmunds shall take nothing by way of their.counsel for ignatin argued that the provision stating that ignatin shall take nothing on his was incorrect he asserted that ignatin prevailed on his because the court found that the cc rs had expired.counsel for schuman also pointed out that edmunds had filed an objection to the original proposed judgment on the ground that the minute order did not address all of the issues in his,including his allegation that ignatin proposed construction would violate ceqa the trial court overruled edmunds objection and signed the judgment nunc pro tunc,with minor changes.
ignatin moved to vacate the judgment and enter a new judgment.ignatin argued that the judgment nunc pro tunc was erroneous because the court ruling in favor of ignatin requires a judgment in ignatin favor on their.emphasis omitted.ignatin also filed a motion to tax costs,after counsel for schuman who also represented all of the neighbors who were sued in ignatin filed a memorandum of costs seeking reimbursement of the filing fees for all of the answers.in the motion to tax costs,ignatin asserted that the court ruling that the cc rs had expired and the amendment did not extend them was precisely the relief sought in ignatin.under applicable precedent,this constituted relief to ignatin and against the cross defendants.
at the hearing on both motions,the trial court found that ignatin request for declaratory relief in the was rendered moot by the finding that the cc rs had expired and were not extended by the amendment,noting that the relief ignatin sought in the was that the planned construction did not violate the cc rs or the amendment or,alternatively,that the cc rs and the amendment could not be enforced by to prevent the planned construction.the court also found that the on ignatin were not entitled to recover costs because ignatin obtained greater relief by prevailing on the complaint.
schuman and edmunds timely filed a notice of appeal from the judgment nunc pro tunc to the extent it denied relief on schuman complaint and edmunds.ignatin also timely filed a notice of appeal from the portion of the judgment nunc pro tunc denying relief on ignatin and from the order denying ignatin motion for a new and different judgment.
discussion 
most of the arguments in the parties briefs on appeal address the requirements for modifying cc rs,or whether the cc rs and the amendment constitute equitable servitudes or covenants running with the land as between the owners who signed the amendment,or whether all of the owners in tract needed to be joined in the lawsuit.we need not address those issues,however,because we agree with schuman and edmunds argument that ignatin challenge to the validity of the amendment is barred by the applicable statute of limitations,and therefore the judgment in favor of ignatin,which was based solely on the trial court finding that the amendment was invalid,must be reversed.
challenges to recorded amendments to cc rs must be brought within four years 
ignatin argued,and the trial court found,that the amendment was invalid and therefore did not extend the duration of the cc rs because it was not signed by every lot owner in tract.schuman and edmunds disagree that all lot owners were required to sign the amendment but they contend,relying upon a recent decision of the fourth district court of appeal,division one filed after judgment was entered in this case,that in any event,the statute of limitations bars any challenge to the validity of the amendment made more than four years after the amendment was recorded.
