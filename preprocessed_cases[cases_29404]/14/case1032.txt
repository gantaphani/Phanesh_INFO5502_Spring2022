the united states court of appeals for the eleventh circuit has certified the following question of florida law that is determinative of a cause pending in that court and for which there appears to be no controlling precedent 
does a standard form commercial general liability policy with product s completed operations hazard coverage,such as the policies described here,issued to a general contractor,cover the general contractor liability to a third party for the costs of repair or replacement of defective work by its subcontractor 
pozzi window ins,cir.we have jurisdiction.see art.v,b.const.
when the eleventh circuit certified the question,it did not have the benefit of our decision in united states fire insurance,so d,in which we held that a subcontractor defective work can constitute an occurrence under a standard form commercial general liability policy.in this case,the defective work relates to the repair or replacement of custom windows in a home.however,in its opinion,the eleventh circuit used the terms defective installation and defective windows interchangeably,even though the terms are not interchangeable for purposes of determining whether there is insurance coverage based on our decision in.in fact,as we will explain more fully below,there is a critical distinction for purposes of insurance coverage depending on whether the defective work refers only to the defective installation of the custom windows or whether the windows themselves were also defective.therefore,the answer to the certified question is dependent on this ultimate determination,which we are not in a position to make.
facts and procedural history 
coral construction of south florida,and coral president james irby builder constructed a multimillion dollar house in coconut grove,florida.the house included windows that were individually purchased by perez homeowner from international windows doors,retailer,manufactured by pozzi window company pozzi and installed by a subcontractor,brian scott builders,subcontractor.after moving into the house,the owner complained of water leakage around the windows.the homeowner filed suit against pozzi,the retailer,the builder,and the subcontractor.
according to the homeowner complaint,the builder urged him to purchase the windows from the retailer,which in turn hired the subcontractor to perform the installation.the homeowner asserted that the windows were shipped directly to his residence,that he paid the retailer directly for the windows,and that the windows were defectively and deficiently designed and manufactured,and were installed improperly into his home.pozzi filed a against the subcontractor alleging that the damages to the home were caused by the defective installation and not a result of any defect in the windows themselves.
pozzi entered into a settlement with the homeowner,agreeing to remedy the defective installation of the windows.thereafter,pozzi also settled with the builder,and as the builder assignee,filed a lawsuit against the builder insurer,insurance company.
in its complaint,pozzi alleged that breached its insurance contract by denying coverage,acted in bad faith,and that pozzi,as assignee of the builder,was entitled to fees and costs incurred by the builder in prosecuting this action.pozzi claimed that the homeowner purchased the windows and that the subcontractor,under the supervision of the builder,negligently installed the windows pozzi also contended that the negligently installed windows leaked,
causing substantial water damage to the surrounding plaster and wood of the walls,floors,and ceiling of the perez residence,as well as damage to the windows themselves.the damage caused by negligent installation and resulting water intrusion rendered the pozzi windows unfit for use in the residence,requiring their replacement.
in its answer,admitted that the homeowner purchased the windows from the retailer and that the subcontractor alone installed the windows however,specifically denied pozzi allegations as to the defectiveness of the installation and that the installation caused damage to the windows themselves,which required their replacement.also filed a counterclaim seeking a determination that it had no duty to defend the builder and that there was no coverage for the claims asserted because defective work performed by the subcontractor was excluded under the policies.
pursuant to the policies,had paid the homeowner for personal property damage caused by the leaking windows,but refused to provide coverage for the cost of repair or replacement of the windows.the insurance policies that had issued the builder were two identical commercial general liability cgl policies.the policies provided coverage for the sums that the insured becomes legally obligated to pay as damages because of bodily injury or property damage caused by an occurrence within the coverage territory during the policy period.as defined in the policies,an occurrence is an accident,including continuous or repeated exposure to substantially the same general harmful conditions,and property damage includes p hysical injury to tangible property,including all resulting loss of use of that property.the policies also contain operations hazard coverage that 
i ncludes all bodily injury and property damage occurring away from premises you own or rent and arising out of your product or your work except 
work that has not yet been completed or abandoned.
the coverage provisions are limited by numerous exclusions.of particular relevance are those exclusions,with their exceptions,that exclude coverage for damage to the insured property and work 
property damage to 
that particular part of real property on which you or any contractors or subcontractors working directly or indirectly on your behalf are performing operations,if the property damage arises out of those operations or 
that particular part of any property that must be restored,repaired or replaced because your work was incorrectly performed on it.
paragraph of this exclusion does not apply to property damage included in the operations hazard.
property damage to your work arising out of it or any part of it and including in the operations hazard.
this exclusion does not apply if the damaged work or the work out of which the damage arises was performed on your behalf by a subcontractor.

the parties filed for summary judgment argued that the homeowner originally sued the builder in the underlying lawsuit for defective construction and poor workmanship for work done in the installation of the windows.similarly,in its memorandum in support of its for partial summary judgment,pozzi contended that coverage existed because of the defective installation performed by the subcontractor,rather than asserting that the windows themselves were damaged or defective.
the federal district court granted pozzi for summary judgment and found that the policies provided coverage for the subcontractor defective work.see pozzi window,at on appeal,the eleventh circuit concluded that under this court decision in state farm fire casualty ctc development,so d,d efective construction is an occurrence under florida law.pozzi window,at.however,the eleventh circuit recognized that this court earlier decision in lamarche shelby mutual insurance,so d,used broad language and reasoning that indicated that cgl policies generally do not cover the costs of repair and replacement of defective work.see pozzi window,at.the eleventh circuit also noted that as a result of the second district decision in,united states fire ins,so d dca,there was a split in florida case law on this issue.see pozzi window,at.accordingly,the court certified to this court the unsettled question of florida law.see id.at.
the question certified by the eleventh circuit asks whether a standard form cgl policy with operations hazard coverage,issued to a general contractor,provides coverage for the repair or replacement of a subcontractor defective work.this is an issue of insurance policy construction,which is a question of law subject to de novo review.see fayad clarendon ins,so d.in addressing this issue,we first review our decision in,which
