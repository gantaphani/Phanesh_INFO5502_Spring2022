chapter of the property code permits a construction subcontractor to claim a lien on funds retained by the owner if the subcontractor sends the notices required by this chapter in the time and manner required and files an affidavit claiming a lien not later than the day after the work is completed.in this case,the owner terminated the general contractor and hired other contractors to complete the project.the question before us is when,in fulfilling the affidavit requirement of the statute,work is completed.the subcontractor here filed its affidavit days after the original contract was terminated but well before subsequent contractors finished the project.the court of appeals held that work is completed when the requirements of the initial contract are finished,either by the first contractor or by subsequent contractors.because we conclude that work must be defined in relation to a particular contract,and that the work under that contract was completed when the contract was terminated,we hold that the affidavit was not timely filed.consequently,we reverse the court of appeals judgment and render judgment that the subcontractor take nothing.
in,herman page hired mark sepolio as general contractor on a remodeling and expansion project for a building that page owned in houston.sepolio in turn hired several subcontractors,including structural wood components,structural wood,to provide labor and materials.structural wood completed its portion of the job in.as work progressed on the construction,page made periodic payments to sepolio totaling.before the project was finished,however,page and sepolio quarreled over the work,and sepolio requested additional funds to finish the project.page refused,and on april,he terminated sepolio contract.page then hired six new contractors to finish the construction.without hiring additional subcontractors,the new contractors completed the project on july,for a total payment of.
meanwhile,because sepolio failed to pay in full for its labor and materials,structural wood filed an affidavit claiming a lien on the property on may,days after page terminated the contract with sepolio.structural wood subsequently filed suit to foreclose on its lien.after a bench trial,the trial court concluded that the work was completed on july,when the replacement contractors finished the project.the trial court held sepolio and page jointly and severally liable to structural wood for in actual damages plus pre and interest and costs.the court further ordered foreclosure of the lien on page property and held page individually liable for in attorney fees.page appealed and the court of appeals reformed the judgment to eliminate the foreclosure order,holding that no evidence supported the trial court finding that page had failed to retain ten percent of the contract price as required by section of the property code.at.however,based on section,the court of appeals upheld the personal judgment against page,concluding that structural wood would still be entitled to a lien on retained funds as long as the lien affidavit was timely filed.id.at.like the trial court,the court of appeals interpreted the statutory definition of completion as the date when the additional contractors finished the project in july.id.
the texas property code requires owners to retain either percent of the contract price of the work to the owner or percent of the value of the work using the contract price or,if there is no contract price,using the reasonable value of the completed work for days after the work is completed.these retained funds secure the payment of artisans and mechanics who perform labor or service,including subcontractors such as structural wood.id.a subcontractor or other claimant who wants to make a claim on that retainage must properly give notice and file an affidavit claiming a lien not later than the day after the work is completed.id.the period during which a claimant can and must file a lien affidavit under section is therefore the same period that an owner can and must hold retainage under section days after the completion of work.it is consequently in the best interest of all construction participants to know when the period owner so that it can release the remaining funds,the original contractor so that it can budget for its final payment,and the claimant so that it can file the lien affidavit before that date.
to determine when the period ends,we look to the statutory definitions of work and completion of an original contract.the property code provides that c ompletion of an original contract means the actual completion of the work,including any extras or change orders reasonably required or contemplated under the original contract.the code defines work as any part of construction of repair performed under an original contract.the parties statutory interpretations focus on different words within these definitions.
page focuses on the phrase under an original contract and contends that work under an individual contract should be deemed completed when the contract is terminated or abandoned.he argues that just as a contract retainage amount will change when the contract price is later modified,so too should the retainage period change when the work is modified.page argues that the work contemplated under a contract is necessarily completed when a contract is terminated,as no additional work is contemplated under that contract.
structural wood focuses on the word contemplated and counters that because the statute requires actual completion of the work reasonably required or contemplated under the original contract,a court should determine completion based on when all the work initially contemplated under the original contract is finished.in this case,the original contract contemplated the remodeling and expansion of the building,so the lien affidavit could be filed at any time within thirty days of the project completion.in accepting this interpretation,the court of appeals noted that the statute did not specify that the work only be done by the contractor who started it,as opposed to a substitute contractor.at.structural wood argues that the alternative interpretation urged by page works a hardship on subcontractors,who must file their lien affidavits in a shorter time and who may not know if an owner has terminated the general contractor.structural wood posits that only its approach comports with the requirement that courts interpret the mechanic lien statute liberally in order to protect lien claimants.see,first bank sledge,
although there are strong arguments supporting both interpretations,we conclude that the greater weight of authority supports page contention that the work ends when a contract is terminated.the history of the mechanic lien statute demonstrates the legislature intent to make retainage requirements dependent on individual contracts.a previous version of the mechanic lien statute phrased the retainage requirement as 
ten per cent of the contract price to the owner of such work,or ten per cent of the value of same,measured by the proportion that the work done bears to the work to be done,using the contract price or,if none,the reasonable value of the completed work as a basis of computing value.
act of june,ch.laws repealed current version at.in hayek western steel,the court interpreted this language to mean that the owner must retain ten percent of the project cost regardless of how many individual construction contracts were awarded.therefore,we held that a subcontractor who had supplied steel and concrete to the foundation contractor could bring a retainage claim not just for ten percent of the value of the foundation contract,but rather for ten percent of the entire cost of building the home.id.
the court decision in hayek focused on protecting lien claimants who might need to share in the retainage fund,based on the legislature broad extension of protection and sharing in this fund to a new class of persons materialmen.id.at.however,the legislature determined that hayek placed too great a burden on owners and original contractors by creating an unreasonable retainage requirement on owners who enter into original contracts.act of may,ch.laws repealed current version at.in response,the legislature amended the statute at its next regular session.the bill analysis stated that the original intent of the legislation was for the retainage requirement to apply to each individual contract,not the total cost of the job and that the bill purpose was to carry out the intent of the original legislation which created the retainage requirement by limiting the to each individual contract house comm.on judiciary,bill analysis.the new language added references to an original contract in the definitions of work and contract price.work was defined as any construction or repair which is performed pursuant to an original contract,and contract price was defined as the cost to the owner for any construction or repair which is performed pursuant to an original contract.act of may,ch,d.laws repealed current version at.
focusing on the work initially contemplated may give a subcontractor more time to perfect a lien,but it may also greatly delay payment for contractors in general.as justice walker pointed out in his hayek dissent,focusing on the entire project instead of the individual contracts means that a contractor who has fully performed by constructing the foundation of the building can not be paid in full until days after the painting contractor has finally completed the last work on the building.this may be several years after the work of the foundation contractor was completed.hayek,at walker,dissenting.under structural wood interpretation of the current statute,an owner who terminated a general contract before the construction project was completely finished would not have to release the ten percent retainage until thirty days after all the new contractors finished the job.even if an economic downturn postponed completion for years,the terminated general contractor could not claim its final payment until the project was later completed.such an indefinite delay in payment is,we believe,exactly what the legislature was trying to prevent when it added references to an original contract in its definitions of contract price and work.see.
hardship caused by the possibility of such delay would not be limited just to general contractors,but would also affect lien claimants generally.a longer retainage period would give potential lien claimants a longer time in which to file their affidavits,but would also delay a lien claimant ability to enforce a lien on the owner retainage.a subcontractor who had finished its work example,the subcontractor who laid the foundation for a take little comfort in having an extended period in which to claim a lien on the owner retained funds if those funds were retained for many months or years.
nor do we agree with structural wood contention that subcontractors need to be able to rely on the work initially contemplated under the original contract in order to know when the period begins to run.under our interpretation,it is true that a subcontractor would not be able to rely on a visual examination of the worksite in order to determine whether the work has been completed.a subcontractor who viewed a project and assumed that the lien affidavit was not yet due would run the risk that the general contract had been terminated and that the affidavit deadline had passed.but mere visual examination may not be enough under either interpretation.to borrow the analogy from the hayek dissent,even under structural wood interpretation a foundation subcontractor would likely have no way to know when an subcontractor finished painting,and therefore would not know when the work contemplated by the general contract was finished.recognizing this hardship,a recent treatise noted that i n many situations,it is difficult to ascertain when all the work is actually completed therefore,prudent claimants will file their lien no later than days after the date they have finished their own work on the job site.sterling steves brenda cubbage,the complete guide to mechanic materialman lien laws of texas.at ed.subcontractors who follow this precaution and file the lien affidavit within thirty days of completing their own work will remain fully protected,even if the general contract is terminated or abandoned.
finally,the dissent emphasizes that the legislature definition of completion does not include any reference to whether a contract is abandoned or terminated but simply defines completion as actual completion.at.however,the legislature did not define the word completion by itself rather,it defined the phrase completion of an original contract.moreover,the legislature specified that the term includ es any extras or change orders reasonably required or contemplated by the contract.id.thus,if the parties add additional work to the contract,the original contract will not be completed until that work is also completed.likewise,if the parties scale back a project,the original contract will be completed when the reduced work is completed.if the owner or the contractor terminates the contract,then no additional work can be contemplated under that original contract.
the mechanic lien statute recognizes that construction contracts often change as a project progresses.as one commentator has observed,the retainage requirement is calculated upon the contract price,as the same may be adjusted from time to time.eldon youngblood,youngblood on texas mechanics liens,b at ed.while the retainage may be adjusted upward if additional work is added to the contract,the price may also be adjusted downward.further,the commentator recognizes that terminated contracts are not uncommon he writes that o ne eventuality that usually adjusts the contract price and,commensurately,the amount of required retainage,is the abandonment of the work by the original contractor.id.
texas courts have long recognized that contract change the amount of funds required to be retained under the contract.see,mckalip smith masonry supply,writ ref dowdy hale supply,worth,no writ.it is therefore consistent to say that contract modifications can also change the work contemplated by the contract,and,by implication,the retainage period.when a contract is terminated,courts have modified the retainage requirement to require retainage of ten percent of the value of the work prior to termination,recognizing that no further payments are contemplated under a terminated contract.see,dowdy,at.likewise,no future work is contemplated under a terminated contract,and we therefore conclude that completion of work includes a situation in which the initial contract is terminated.
finally,we note that the legislature has recently mandated that contractors provide a disclosure statement to homeowners engaging in residential construction projects.the disclosure statement is not applicable in this case,as page hired seoplio for a commercial,not a residential,project.nevertheless,the disclosure statement offers guidance because it provides a description of an owner retainage duties under the mechanic lien statute,and these duties are the same in both residential projects and commercial projects.see.the disclosure statement informs the owner that during construction and for days after final completion,termination,or abandonment of the contract you should withhold or cause your lender to withhold percent of the amount of payments made for the work performed by your contractor.this is sometimes referred to as statutory retainage.b.the legislature description of the statutory retainage requirement indicates that the legislature did not intend to require an owner to hold on to the statutory retainage for more than thirty days after the contract termination.
we conclude that the construction contract and the work performed thereunder are complete at the time that the contract is terminated or abandoned,so that the lien affidavit must therefore be filed within thirty days of the contract termination.thus,we hold that structural wood affidavit was not timely filed in this case,as it was filed days after page terminated sepolio construction contract.we accordingly reverse the court of appeals judgment and render judgment that structural wood take nothing against page.
because i agree with the court of appeals that structural wood was not required to file its lien until thirty days after the work contemplated under the original sepolio contract was actually completed,i respectfully dissent.
structural wood components,was a subcontractor who provided supplies to mark sepolio.sepolio was a general contractor who agreed to do some remodeling work for herman page.following a payment disagreement,page terminated sepolio contract on april,and hired other contractors to finish the work he had originally contracted with sepolio to do.the work was finally completed on july.because sepolio never paid structural wood for the materials and labor it provided,structural wood filed a mechanic and materialman lien on may.in compliance with statutory requirements structural wood sent page notice of its claim on may,and a copy of the filed lien affidavit on may.page claims that structural wood did not timely file its lien affidavit because when page terminated sepolio contract on april,the work was deemed completed by that termination.page contends that the lien affidavit should have been filed on or before may,structural wood asserts that the work was not actually completed until july,and therefore,its lien affidavit was timely filed.
the texas property code requires that an owner retain ten percent of the contract amount during the time the work contemplated under an original contract is in progress,and for thirty days after the completion of the work the retainage statute requires that these funds be set aside specifically to ensure that subcontractors,artisans,mechanics,and others who supply material and perform labor are paid to have a valid lien against the retained funds,a subcontractor must meet only two requirements send the notices required by this chapter in the time and manner required and file an affidavit claiming a lien not later than the day after the work is completed.
the statute defines work as any part of construction or repair performed under an original contract.an original contract is completed when the work is actually completed,including any extras or change orders reasonably required or contemplated under the original contract,other than warranty work or replacement or repair of the work performed under the contract.
when called upon to interpret the texas mechanic and materialman lien statutes,recognizing that they are not exactly a model of clarity,we liberally construe them to protect the artisan,the laborer,and the materialman but here,the language of the statutes in question is clear and unambiguous,and we need do no more than ascribe to them their ordinary meaning the words of this statute support structural wood claim that it timely filed its lien affidavit,because it filed its affidavit well before the work was actually completed on july.
page argues that the legislature definition of work clearly mandates that work under an original contract is completed when that original contract is abandoned or terminated,but he offers no authority to support this clear mandate.instead,he cites statutory language that reads as follows 
indebtedness to an original contractor accrues on the last day of the month in which a written declaration by the original contractor or the owner is received by the other party stating that the original contract has been terminated or on the last day of the month in which the original contract has been completed,finally settled,or abandoned 
this provision does not in any way refer to when work is completed it merely establishes the point in time from which the owner indebtedness to the original contractor accrues.the provision is not definitional.furthermore,the mechanic and materialman lien statute does provide a definition of completion of work contemplated under a contract.and the legislature definition of completion does not include any reference to whether a contract is abandoned or terminated.it simply defines completion as actual completion.
the eleventh court of appeals considered this same work is considered completed for purposes of perfecting a retainage tdindustries,ncnb texas national bank in that case,a subcontractor filed a retainage lien against the bank.the bank claimed that the lien had not been timely filed.the court of appeals,however,held that even though an architect certified completion at the beginning of january,the work was not actually completed until the end of february when a pocket door required under the original construction contract was finally installed because the term completion was both legislatively defined and unambiguous,the court of appeals literally construed the term actual completion,according to the rules of common usage.installation of the pocket door was work required under the original contract,and therefore,the work was not actually completed until that pocket door was installed 
the eleventh court of appeals reasoning is persuasive.defining actual completion to mean actual completion is the only way to ensure that every subcontractor under an original construction contract is protected 
if,for example,the subcontractor who had installed the pocket door were sic not paid for his work,he should be entitled to the security of a ten percent retainage fund measured by the full contract price of the original contract.yet,if the time for filing his lien affidavit had already run at the time when he completed his work,he would have been divested of his rights through no fault of his own.there is no escaping the conclusion that completion means the performance of the last item of compensable and lienable work that is contemplated by the original contract 
the statute requires actual completion of the work,work being any part of construction or repair performed under an original contract.the workers hired by page were not hired to perform work different or unrelated to the remodeling work contemplated under the original contract.they were hired to complete the parts of construction or repair that were contemplated under sepolio original contract but left unfinished.
page has persuaded the court to hold that actual completion does really mean actual completion,and that the meaning of the term should be enlarged to include abandonment or termination of a contract.but that we can not do.we can not define completion differently from the legislature as page himself points out,we are bound by the statutory language t he courts,possessing no legislative powers,may not enlarge or alter the plain meaning of statutory language.wording in statutes is to be given its literal interpretation when that wording is clearly unambiguous.our duty here is to apply the words of the statute.the court today takes an unambiguous,ordinary phrase,alters its meaning,and turns it into a legal term of art.for no longer does actual completion mean actually completed it now means actually completed but not really because if the work is not actually completed,but is abandoned or terminated,that also means that it has been actually completed this can not be.the legislature has provided the definition of completion in clear,unambiguous terms.this court often complains of the lack of clarity in legislative pronouncements in the face of legislative clarity,it is incomprehensible that today,the court sabotages an ordinary,unambiguous phrase by infusing it with counterintuitive shades of meaning.
the original contractor,sepolio,never completed the work required under the original contract.that work had to be finished by others.the other contractors were not doing warranty work,and they did not replace or repair the work sepolio had already performed.they merely finished the job originally contemplated under sepolio contract.the work was not actually completed when page terminated sepolio contract on april.the work was actually completed on july.structural wood timely filed its lien.
the court points out that legislative history demonstrates the legislature intent to make retainage requirements dependent on individual contracts.in hayek western steel we held that the ten percent retainage requirement meant ten percent of the entire project.one ye
