plaintiff farmers appeal an award of costs to defendant modesto irrigation district mid,which the superior court made after denying plaintiffs petition for a writ of mandate to enforce the california environmental quality act ceqa plaintiffs contend the superior court erred in awarding mid for preparing the record of proceedings rop because mid impermissibly delegated the preparation of the rop to consultants,and mid did not submit adequate information from which to determine whether the amounts claimed as costs were necessary and reasonable.
the rop prepared by mid contains documents that were created after the project was approved.these postapproval documents do not reflect the proceedings that actually occurred,and they are not properly part of the rop.el morro community california of parks recreation th,d.thus,the time spent preparing them was not a necessary and reasonable cost of preparing the rop.the minimal factual information submitted by mid was insufficient to justify the unusually high per page cost for preparing the record.further,the information submitted did not allow the superior court to separate the time mid and its consultants reasonably spent assembling,organizing,and indexing documents that reflected the proceedings actually held from the time they spent with the rop that furthered their own interests.accordingly,the award of costs is reversed and the matter remanded to the superior court for further proceedings.
facts and proceedings 
mid is a california irrigation district organized under the irrigation district law,water code section et.mid operates facilities for the generation,transmission,and distribution of electric power and provides electric service within alameda,stanislaus,san joaquin,and tuolumne counties.
plaintiff wagner farms,is a california corporation.plaintiffs nita wagner and hans wagner are individuals who own orchards and reside in stanislaus county.
the lawsuit underlying this appeal arose out of mid proposal to construct high voltage electricity transmission lines from a switching station near westley to mid substation in rosemore and its preparation of an environmental impact report eir covering the proposed project.a segment of the route mid selected for the proposed transmission lines affects lands on which orchards owned by plaintiffs are located.
in january,insite environmental,a firm with an office in stockton,california,completed a environmental feasibility study feasibility study for mid that analyzed possible route segments for the proposed transmission line.mid used the feasibility study to select a preferred corridor for the transmission line.
on june,mid filed a notice of preparation that stated a preferred corridor would be analyzed in an eir,identified the preferred corridor,and showed that corridor and three alternative corridors on an attached map.a draft eir then was developed by eci mid engineering consultant for this project,its subcontractor,robert scott environmental services,and mid staff.
the board of directors of mid approved the draft eir,and it was distributed on july.the notice of availability for the draft eir stated that a copy of the draft eir had been placed at the stanislaus county libraries in modesto,newman,and patterson.the notice also stated that a hard copy of the draft eir could be obtained by mailing to electrical consultants,address in billings,montana.
the final eir and a newsletter announcing its availability were distributed on october.the board of directors of mid held a public meeting on november,at which it considered the final eir,certified it,adopted findings of fact regarding the significant environmental effects and project alternatives,and approved the project.
on december,plaintiffs filed a petition for writ of mandate challenging mid approval of the project,asserting various violations of ceqa,and requesting declaratory and injunctive relief.
on january,plaintiffs filed a request that mid prepare the rop.
on april,mid served counsel for plaintiffs with a notice that stated mid administrative record regarding the adoption of the kv transmission project,volumes through,has been certified and lodged with the court.
by letter dated april,mid provided counsel for plaintiffs with one copy of the,rop.the letter stated that the cost of copying the single set was and estimated the final cost of preparing the rop will be somewhere between.
on april,a senior staff attorney for mid sent counsel for plaintiffs a letter stating that the actual cost for copying and binding a single set of the rop was,not the indicated in the earlier letter.it appears the increase in amount was due to the sales tax charged by the copying service.in addition,the april letter stated 
the total cost of gathering,organizing and indexing the record is.this amount includes only the time spent by the district environmental compliance officer in accumulating,organizing and indexing the record the time spent by the district consultants who prepared the environmental impact report in gathering,copying,and shipping documents in their files and in reviewing the record for completeness and accuracy and the cost to the original administrative record lodged with the court.
the value of mid environmental compliance officer time was stated as based on regular hours at a weighted rate of,hours at a weighted rate of,and overtime hours at a weighted rate of.the cost of electrical consultants,work on the rop was reported as.
mid letter to counsel for plaintiffs included a copy of an april,letter that crystal kuntz,an assistant environmental coordinator at electrical consultants,sent to mid.her letter summarized the work electrical consultants,performed in preparing the rop and reported the charges for each month february,march april in four categories environmental coordinator services,assistant environmental coordinator services,copying and shipping and secretarial preparation of materials including expenses.though monthly project invoices are mentioned in kuntz letter,none are included in the appellate record and thus we must assume that none were provided to the court below.protect our water county of merced th,d if it is not in the record,it did not happen.
in the fall of,plaintiffs lost their ceqa case and a judgment was filed in favor of mid.in a separate appeal,this court concluded that the eir for the project complied with ceqa and affirmed the judgment.wagner farms,modesto irrigation district,supra.
in late november,mid filed a memorandum of costs totaling,which included a claim for preparing and filing the rop.an attachment to mid memorandum of costs categorized the cost of preparing and filing the rop as environmental compliance officer,consultant environmental coordinator services,and copying and binding less paid by plaintiffs.the consultant charges were supported with a copy of the april,letter from electrical consultants,to mid.the copying and binding costs were supported with a copy of a invoice from dittos,a printing company located in modesto,california,that produced five copies of the rop.
plaintiffs filed a motion to tax costs.they argued that mid impermissibly delegated the preparation of the rop to its consultants,that the amounts requested for preparation of the rop were not adequately supported,and that the exorbitant amounts spent were not necessary or reasonable.plaintiffs supported the motion with a declaration of counsel,which attached as exhibits the april and,letters from mid.
mid opposition was supported by a declaration of an attorney that stated the superior court requested a temporary replacement copy of the rop and that mid submitted the requested copy to the court.no other declaration or supporting evidence to substantiate the cost that mid claimed for time spent by mid environmental compliance officer in accumulating,organizing,and indexing the record was provided with the opposition.
in their reply to mid opposition,plaintiffs argued that the lack of detail supporting the hours spent on the rop was striking and that mid failed to carry its burden of showing the costs claimed were reasonable and necessary.
the superior court requested supplemental briefing addressing whether plaintiffs challenge to the costs of preparing the rop was barred by laches because plaintiffs never requested an estimate of cost before the rop was prepared,whether certain charges were permitted,and the applicability of the principles set forth in hayward area planning city of hayward th,d hayward.

discussion 
traditional,not administrative,mandamus was sought below 
plaintiffs ceqa petition sought a writ for traditional mandamus because the challenged of a transmission line in character.see western states petroleum superior court cal th,d,traditional and administrative mandamus in ceqa proceedings.as a petition for traditional mandamus,it was subject to the procedures for traditional mandamus set forth in code of civil procedure section and review under the standards contained in section.county sanitation dist.county of kern th,d see robie et,california civil litigation vast majority of proceedings challenging agency action for noncompliance with ceqa are traditional mandamus reviewed under.
stated in the obverse,plaintiffs ceqa petition did not challenge agency action that was adjudicative or and,thus,the writ sought can not be characterized as one for administrative mandamus.when a petition for administrative mandamus is sought in a ceqa proceeding,it is reviewed under the standards contained in section and is subject to the procedures for administrative mandamus set forth in code of civil procedure section.see western states petroleum superior court,supra,cal th at,d.
the distinction between sections administrative mandamus and traditional mandamus may be inconsequential when describing the abuse of discretion standard under which the agency action is reviewed.see generally remy et,guide to the cal.environmental quality act ceqa ed distinguishing relationship between and code civ,from relationship between and code civ.the distinction does matter,however,when it comes to identifying the rules of law applicable to an award of costs.
we note the distinction between traditional mandamus and administrative mandamus in ceqa proceedings to explain why we have not relied upon the provisions concerning costs set forth in code of civil procedure section see kostka zischke,practice under the cal.environmental quality act,code civ,contains several unique procedural provisions that ordinarily do not apply to ceqa cases reviewed under.
ii.award of costs for preparing the rop in a traditional mandamus case 
statutory provisions 
the last sentence of section,subdivision b provides that the parties shall pay any reasonable costs or fees imposed for the preparation of the record of proceedings in conformance with any law or rule of court.this language leads us to the general rules applicable to the award of costs,which are set forth in code of civil procedure sections,and.
first,except as otherwise expressly provided by statute,the party who prevails in any action or proceeding is entitled as a matter of right to recover costs.code civ,subd.b.
second,code of civil procedure section,subdivision a contains a list of items specifically allowed as recoverable costs,and subdivision b contains a list of items that are not allowable as costs,except when expressly authorized by law.an item neither specifically allowable under subdivision a nor prohibited under subdivision b may be allowed or denied in the discretion of the court if certain requirements are satisfied.code civ,subd.c.in particular,the item shall be reasonably necessary to the conduct of the litigation rather than merely convenient or beneficial to its preparation and shall be reasonable in amount.code civ,subd.c c.the requirement that a recoverable cost be reasonable in amount parallels the requirement in subdivision f of section that the party preparing the record of proceedings shall strive to do so at reasonable cost in light of the scope of the record.
principles from case law 
the foregoing statutory rules are supplemented by the following judicially created rules 
i f the items on a verified cost bill appear proper charges they are prima facie evidence that the costs,expenses and services therein listed were necessarily incurred.oak grove school dist.city title ins.d.decoto school dist.tile d.however,where the items are properly objected to,they are put in issue,and the burden of proof is upon the party claiming them as costs.oak grove school dist.city title ins,supra at.melnyk robledo d.
whether a cost item was reasonably necessary to the litigation presents a question of fact for the trial court and its decision is reviewed for abuse of discretion.citation.however,because the right to costs is governed strictly by statute citation a court has no discretion to award costs not statutorily authorized.citations.ladas california state auto.th,d.
standards applicable to preparation of record in ceqa proceedings 
based on the provisions of section,the provisions of the code of civil procedure concerning the award of costs to the prevailing party,and the principles stated in case law,we conclude that the prevailing party in a ceqa proceeding involving traditional mandamus may recover as costs the amounts it reasonably and necessarily incurred in preparing the rop.river valley preservation project metropolitan transit development bd.th,d river valley subject to necessary and reasonable standard and review for abuse of discretion,costs for preparing record,as well as transcribing and copying,may be recovered in ceqa proceeding.
in reviewing a case for an abuse of discretion,this court has recognized that i t is well established that t o exercise the power of judicial discretion,all material facts and evidence must be both known and considered,together with legal principles essential to an informed,intelligent and just decision.citations.oldham california capital fund,th,d.where a party making a request fails to present material information that it controls,the record may lack facts essential to support the lower court ruling in that party favor,id.at,d.
iii.amounts awarded to prepare rop in other cases 
river valley and mid proportionality argument 
in both its opposition to the motion to tax costs filed with the lower court and its appellate brief filed here,mid uses information from another ceqa case to support its claim that is a reasonable and necessary cost for preparing the rop here.it is telling,according to mid,that in river valley,the court awarded over for a a dministrative r ecord here,mid requests approximately in costs for an ar.see river valley,supra,th at,d.
we agree with mid premise that comparing the amount claimed to prepare an rop with the amount awarded in other cases can tell a court something about the request under review.prior experience with cost awards is part of the information used by courts in forming an initial impression of whether the amount requested is in the ballpark of what is reasonable,associates cal d,using ballpark metaphor to describe a proportionality analysis done to determine reasonableness of offer to compromise under code civ.though this initial impression may not determine the ultimate outcome,it may affect the amount of scrutiny the details underlying the request receive.to illustrate the point about initial impressions,the amount of d
