teichert construction teichert sought to overturn a decision of the california occupational safety and health appeals board the board which upheld a citation issued by the california department of industrial relations,division of occupational safety and health the division for violation of a safety order,and assessed teichert a civil penalty of.in teichert view,the safety order is unconstitutionally vague,and the board failed to determine whether teichert conduct was reasonable.teichert appeals from the superior court denial of its petition for a writ of administrative mandate.we shall affirm the judgment.
as we will explain,the requirement that hauling and earth moving operations be controlled in such a manner as to ensure that equipment or vehicle operators know of the presence of workers on foot in the areas of their operations is not impermissibly vague.a reasonable and practical construction of the regulation puts businesses,like teichert,on notice that they must control hauling and earth moving operations in a manner to ensure equipment operators know of a worker location on foot within the immediate vicinity of the operators,and simply informing equipment operators that workers will be on foot in the general area of such operations does not satisfy the requirement.sufficient evidence supports the board finding that teichert could have known with the exercise of reasonable diligence of the condition which violated the regulation.
on june,teichert employee robert mccorkle was involved in a terrible accident while on the job.he was hit by a scraper,a piece of earth moving equipment.fortunately,mccorkle was somehow thrown out from under the scraper and survived.however,he suffered serious bodily injuries.
after an investigation,the division cited teichert for a serious violation of general industry safety order,subdivision e,tit,subd.e,a regulation that requires hauling or earth moving operations to be controlled so that operators know of the presence of workers on foot in the areas of operation.teichert filed an appeal from the citation,and an evidentiary hearing was held before an administrative law judge alj.the alj issued a decision upholding the citation.
teichert sought and obtained reconsideration by the board,which issued a decision upholding the citation.by petition for a writ of administrative mandate,filed in the superior court,teichert unsuccessfully challenged the board decision.
california code of regulations,title,section,subdivision e states hauling or earth moving operations shall be controlled in such a manner as to ensure that equipment or vehicle operators know of the presence of rootpickers,spotters,lab technicians,surveyors,or other workers on foot in the areas of their operations.at the time of mccorkle accident,the law provided that a serious violation shall be deemed to exist in a place of employment if there is a substantial probability that death or serious physical harm could result from a serious exposure exceeding an established permissible exposure limit or a condition which exists,or from one or more practices,means,methods,operations,or processes which have been adopted or are in use,in the place of employment unless the employer did not,and could not with the exercise of reasonable diligence,know of the presence of the violation,former,subd.a stats,ch.
in reviewing the board factual determinations,both the trial court and this court apply the familiar substantial evidence rule,rick electric,occupational safety health appeals bd.th,d.we view the evidence in a light most favorable to the board decision,drawing all reasonable inferences and resolving all conflicts in the evidence in favor of the decision.crawford southern pacific cal d.viewed in this light,the evidence before the board reflects the following facts 
at the time of the accident,teichert was in the process of preparing a parcel of property for the construction of dwellings.the job consisted of moving earth from one side of the parcel,referred to as the cut area,to the other side,referred to as the fill area,where it would be deposited for the construction of pads.the job required dozers,scrapers,a compactor,and a blade.
the first step in the process required an operator to run a dozer in the cut area to loosen the earth,referred to as ripping.the scrapers would move into position to load the loose dirt.the scrapers being used on the job were not,they were push scrapers.this meant that when the scraper was in place,it would be pushed forward through the cut area by a dozer.once loaded,the scraper would be driven along a haul road to the fill area.after depositing the load,the scraper operator would return to the cut area.
when sufficient dirt had been moved onto a pad,the pad would be finished by the use of a compactor and then a blade.the scrapers would be directed to a new pad to begin placing fill.the haul road was constantly adjusted to reflect the new area of fill.witnesses established that once a pad was filled,scrapers should not be driven across it.
during the work,there were two,and sometimes as many as four,workers on foot at the jobsite.one worker was stationed at the cut area to direct the scrapers where to obtain their loads.one worker,in this case mccorkle,was stationed at the fill area.among other things,mccorkle job was to direct the scrapers where to deposit their loads.the grading foreman,stephen thomas,went back and forth between the cut area and the fill area,and was sometimes on foot.
one of the operators on this job was kathy hoyt.she was an apprentice.thomas testified that there are four levels for apprentices,with advancement to a new level after every hours of operation.he believed that hoyt had about hours of operation.on the first day of the project,thomas assigned hoyt to do the ripping at the cut area.he did not know hoyt but assigned her to the ripping job because she had worked for underground,where scrapers are not used.
on the day before the accident,a change in assignment was made.there was evidence that operators are paid,at least in part,based upon the amount of dirt they move.the operator who had been running the push dozer,mike mills,was described as a real high dollar operator.complaining that the scraper drivers were poor operators who did not keep up,he threatened to walk off the job.at thomas request,mills agreed to finish the day as the ripper operator.thomas asked hoyt whether she could operate a scraper.saying she thought that she could,hoyt added either that she was not very good at it or that she had not done it in a while.thomas moved a scraper operator to the push dozer and assigned hoyt to a scraper.he watched hoyt for a couple of loads and concluded that she could operate the scraper.
on the day of the accident,hoyt operated a scraper.near the end of the workday,two pads situated east and west of each other had received sufficient fill,and the fill area had been moved to the north.hoyt was driving her scraper from the cut area to the fill area when her scraper struck and knocked down a stake.at this point in time,there was some confusion at the worksite.
mccorkle was on the west pad that had received sufficient fill,and the east pad was undergoing compaction.mccorkle saw hoyt scraper leave the haul road and come onto the west pad in his direction.hoyt testified she saw mccorkle on the west pad and believed that he was signaling her to dump the load on the west pad.hoyt stopped her scraper next to mccorkle and told him of the broken stake.mccorkle said he would fix it.he then told hoyt to dump the load in the fill area and to return to the cut area.
hoyt believed that mccorkle had directed her to dump the load on the west pad,rather than on the pad to the north.this was not the right place to dump the dirt.after dumping the load on the west pad,hoyt drove onto the east pad and turned right to go back to the cut area.
because there is a huge blind spot to the right of a scraper,a scraper operator can see virtually nothing to the right side unless the operator stops and articulates the cab,which pivots independently of the scraper,or gets out and looks to the right.as hoyt made a right turn in
