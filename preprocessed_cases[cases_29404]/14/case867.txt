defendant intel corporation intel hired defendant turner construction company turner to act as general contractor on a construction project.turner hired superior automatic sprinkler superior to install a fire sprinkler system.plaintiff guy paul browne,an employee of superior,was injured in a fall from a ladder while working on the project.he brought this action against turner and intel,claiming that they acted negligently in removing from the work area,or causing to be removed,two means by which the fall could have been prevented,a system of safety lines intended to prevent just such injuries,and some hydraulic lifts elevated work platforms that would have permitted plaintiff to do the work without a ladder.the trial court granted summary judgment for defendants on the ground that their conduct did not affirmatively contribute to plaintiff injuries within the holding of hooker department of transportation cal th,d,hooker.we hold that this was error the furnishing and abrupt withdrawal of safety equipment could be found to constitute negligent performance of a voluntary undertaking,affirmatively contributing to plaintiff injuries and thereby subjecting defendants to liability.accordingly,we will reverse the judgment.
background 
plaintiff alleged in his complaint that on september,turner and intel caused him to fall and suffer injuries by negligently owning,maintaining,operating,and controlling a certain construction site.intel and turner jointly answered the complaint,generally denying its allegations and raising affirmative defenses not pertinent here.defendants propounded interrogatories asking plaintiff to state all facts on which he based his contention that they were liable for his injuries.he responded that while discovery and investigation were continuing,he believed intel had required to be removed,and turner had removed,the hydraulic lifts from the part of the project on which plaintiff was working,thereby requiring him to use a ladder as a work platform.he further asserted that his injuries resulted from each defendant negligently retained control of the subject jobsite.
in december,defendants jointly moved for summary judgment.in their statement of undisputed facts they asserted that turner had been the general contractor on a project for intel that plaintiff employer,superior,had been hired by turner to install a fire sprinkler system that the contract between turner and superior placed ultimate responsibility for injury prevention upon superior and that plaintiff was injured when he fell about nine feet from a ladder on which he was standing in an attempt to install some overhead sprinkler pipe in an area known as the copper gowning room.defendants acknowledged,and made no attempt to refute,plaintiff assertion that they had removed hydraulic lifts from the work area.they asserted various facts intended to show that they did not negligently supervise any relevant aspect of the work.
in opposition to the motion,plaintiff cited his deposition testimony that he had been required to use a ladder at the time of his injury because turner had removed the scissor lifts from the floor he was working on.one of his coworkers testified that intel and turner had wanted the lifts out of the room as part of a process by which as the room was getting cleaner,they kept moving things,equipment and everything,out of there.plaintiff also referred to a fall protection system,which defendants had installed,of catenary suspended anchoring cables to which workers would secure or tie off their safety lanyards.he noted that defendants themselves had a rule requiring all workers to tie off when their feet were more than six feet above the ground.defendants,however,had removed the fall protection system from the copper gowning room two months before he was injured,so that on the date of his fall,there was nothing for him to tie off to.plaintiff asserted that through this conduct,defendants had effectively determin ed that he would work in violation of the rule.
defendants raised numerous evidentiary objections to plaintiff opposition see pt.iii,post,but made no attempt to refute the propositions that they had originally furnished the catenary anchor system,then discontinued it while overhead work remained to be performed and they had also removed the scissor lifts,or caused them to be removed,immediately before plaintiff sustained his injuries.
the trial court issued a lengthy order in which it concluded that there was no evidence of any negligence by defendants that affirmatively contributed to plaintiff injuries as required by hooker,supra,cal th at,d.the court wrote that plaintiff was unable to point to any affirmative action that defendants took which directly contributed to plaintiff injury.the court found it undisputed that defendants retained control over safety conditions,and removed the scissors lift and tie off anchors from the room in which plaintiff was working before he began to work on the day of the accident this conduct,however,did not affirmatively contribute to plaintiff injury,because there was no claim that the ladder was defective,or that defendants ordered plaintiff to work without tying off.there is,at most,evidence that defendants were aware of an unsafe practice,no tie off anchors available to plaintiff while working more than six feet above ground,and failed to exercise the authority they retained to correct it,put the anchors back in.but there is no evidence that defendants exercise of retained control,the removal of the anchors or the scissors lift,affirmatively contributed to the dangerous practice of climbing a ladder more than six feet off the ground without first tying off.
the court entered judgment for defendants.plaintiff filed this timely appeal.
summary judgment 
code of civil procedure section entitles a defendant to summary judgment upon demonstrating that one or more elements of the plaintiff cause of action can not be established.code civ,subd.p see,subd.o.courts have recognized two ways in which a defendant may make such a showing.the first,which might be called positive refutation,consists of present ing evidence that,in the absence of conflicting evidence from the plaintiff,preclude s a reasonable trier of fact from finding a fact necessary to the plaintiff cause of action.kahn east side union high school dist.cal th,d,italics added kahn.in other words,the defendant comes forward with evidence concerning the actual events at issue,and establishing a version of those events that is incompatible with the plaintiff claims.alternatively,the moving defendant may show by competent proofs typically derived from discovery that the plaintiff lacks the evidence to prove a necessary fact.in this method,which might be called evidentiary negation,the defendant need not affirmatively prove anything about what actually occurred it is enough to show that there is insufficient evidence of what occurred,or insufficient evidence favorable to the plaintiff,to establish a necessary element of the cause of action.either way,if the defendant presents evidence sufficient to meet this threshold burden,the burden shifts to the plaintiff to show that a triable issue of one or more material facts exists as to that cause of action code civ,subd.p.however,t he burden of persuasion remains with the defendant as moving party.kahn,supra,cal th at,d.an appellate court review s the record and the determination of the trial court de novo.citation.ibid.
defendants motion was premised upon plaintiff claimed inability to prove an indispensable part of his cause of action,that their conduct affirmatively contributed to his injuries,or to the condition which precipitated his fall thus the pivotal question,as framed by defendants and filtered through the principles just noted,is whether defendants presented evidence preclud ing a finding that they affirmatively contributed to his injuries,or affirmatively demonstrating that plaintiff lacks the evidence to prove such affirmative contribution.we review de novo the trial court affirmative answer to that question.
ii.affirmative contribution 
over the past years the california supreme court has rendered a line of decisions limiting the liability of a hirer of an independent contractor for injuries to one of the contractor employees.prior to these cases it was widely held that the hirer could be liable to such workers for breach of a duty,often referred to as nondelegable,to protect workers from harm arising from a peculiar risk inherent in the work.see van arsdale hollinger cal d,overruled in privette superior court cal th,d,fn.privette rest d torts.if this doctrine were still available,it would clearly apply here,because the work in which plaintiff was engaged inherently involved a clear and distinct risk of falling,against which defendants might have been under a duty to require that precautions be taken.
however,in privette,supra,cal th at pages,d,the court held that imposing liability on such a basis was inconsistent with the policies underlying the workers compensation laws,which automatically afford the injured worker a remedy against his employer,but exempt the employer from liability in tort.in toland sunland housing group cal th,d,toland,the court reaffirmed that holding and extended it to a variation on peculiar risk theory,in which liability is predicated not on the hirer failure to require the contractor to take precautions see,but on the hirer own failure to take special precautions against the risk in question see.the court noted that liability under section had sometimes been characterized as vicarious while liability under section had been called direct.toland,supra,cal th at,d,see id.at,d.however,it declared this distinction misleading because liability under these sections is neither purely direct nor purely vicarious.id.at,d.under both sections,it held,the hiring person liability is cast in the form of the hiring person breach of a duty to see to it that special precautions are taken to prevent injuries to others in that sense,the liability is direct.yet,peculiar risk liability is not a traditional theory of direct liability for the risks created by one own conduct liability under both sections is in essence vicarious or derivative in the sense that it derives from the act or omission of the hired contractor,because it is the hired contractor who has caused the injury by failing to use reasonable care in performing the work.id.at,d,italics added.responding to justice werdegar partial dissent,justice kennard noted for the majority that it is always possible to characterize liability as direct by concocting a duty in a particular situation to prevent another from acting negligently id.at,fn,d,italics added.the dissent,she wrote,refuses to acknowledge any distinction between this artificial direct liability and the liability imposed on the hiring person for injuries resulting from the hiring person own conduct,such as,for example,concealing a hidden danger or insisting on use of an unsafe method to execute the work.ibid.under privette,the court said,the hirer has no obligation to specify the precautions an independent hired contractor should take for the safety of the contractor employees.id.at,d.it described privette as holding that employees of an independent contractor,because of the availability of workers compensation benefits,can not seek recovery under section of the restatement second of torts.id.at,d.as we concluded in privette,supra,cal th,d,justice kennard wrote,it is illogical and unfair that a landowner or other person who hires an independent contractor should have greater liability for the independent contractor negligence towards the contractor employees than the independent contractor whose liability is limited to providing workers compensation coverage.id.at,d.
in camargo tjaarda dairy cal th,d,camargo,the court extended toland and privette to bar a claim that was brought under the theory that the defendant negligently hired the independent contractor who in turn employed the plaintiffs decedent as a tractor driver.see.the court reaffirmed the underlying rationale that the hirer should not have to pay for injuries caused by the contractor negligent performance because the workers compensation system already covers those injuries.camargo,supra,cal th at,d.the court rejected the negligent hiring theory for the same reasons it rejected the peculiar risk theories at issue in privette and toland,while the proposed liability might be direct in some sense,it was essentially vicarious or derivative in that it depended on the negligent conduct of the contractor,and it was unfair to subject the hirer to civil liability while the actor primarily responsible for the injury was subject only to the limited liability imposed by workers compensation law.camargo,supra,cal th at,d.
in hooker,supra,cal th,d,the question was whether the hirer could be liable for negligent exercise of a retained power to control the performance of the work.see.the court held that a hirer of an independent contractor is not liable to an employee of the contractor merely because the hirer retained control over safety conditions at a worksite,but that a hirer is liable to an employee of a contractor insofar as a hirer exercise of retained control affirmatively contributed to the employee injuries.hooker,supra,cal th at,d.the court approved the analysis in a first district case holding that mere failure to exercise a retained power of control can not,by itself,make the hirer liable,because the hirer which in that case was the general contractor owes no duty of care to an employee of a subcontractor to prevent or correct unsafe procedures or practices to which the contractor did not contribute by direction,induced reliance,or other affirmative conduct.the mere failure to exercise a power to compel the subcontractor to adopt safer procedures does not,without more,violate any duty owed to the plaintiff.insofar as section might permit the imposition of liability on a general contractor for mere failure to intervene in a subcontractor working methods or procedures,without evidence that the general contractor affirmatively contributed to the employment of those methods or procedures,that section is inapplicable to claims by subcontractors employees against the general contractor.citation.hooker,supra,cal th at,d,quoting kinney csb construction,th,d,italics added.t he imposition of tort liability on a hirer should depend on whether the hirer exercised the control that was retained in a manner that affirmatively contributed to the injury of the contractor employee.we are persuaded that the holdings of privette and toland should also apply to employees claims under section at least where,as here,the sole factual basis for the claim is that the hirer failed to exercise a general supervisory power to require the contractor to correct an unsafe procedure or condition of the contractor own making,and there is no evidence that the hirer conduct contributed in any way to the contractor negligent performance by,inducing injurious action or inaction through actual direction,reliance on the hirer,or otherwise.the fairness rationale at the core of privette and toland applies equally to preclude imposition of liability on a hirer for mere failure to exercise a general supervisory power to prevent the creation or continuation of a hazardous practice,where such liability would exceed that imposed on the injured plaintiff immediate employer,who created the hazard.citation.hooker,supra,cal th at,d,quoting kinney,supra,th at,d,some italics added.
the accident at issue in hooker occurred when the plaintiff decedent,while operating a construction crane on a highway project,attempted to swing the boom after neglecting to reextend stabilizing outriggers,which he had retracted to allow other vehicles on the project.hooker,supra,cal th at,d.the plaintiff cited the defendant own rules requiring its supervisors to recognize,anticipate,and correct unsafe conditions,and deposition testimony by the defendant senior representative on the project to the effect that he was aware of the retraction of the outriggers,recognized its hazards,and possessed the power to compel safe procedures.ibid.the court noted the similarity of these facts to kinney,where the plaintiff was injured while engaged in a practice the hirer representatives acknowledged to be unsafe,and which they had the power to stop.id.at,d.such facts are insufficient to defeat a motion for summary judgment,however,because liability can not be imposed on the general contractor based upon a mere failure to require the subcontractor to take safety precautions,where the general contractor failure is not shown to have affirmatively contributed to the creation or persistence of the hazard causing the plaintiff injuries,quoting kinney,supra,th at,d.however,the imposition of liability is appropriate when the hirer conduct has affirmatively contributed to the injuries of the contractor employee,because the liability of the hirer in such a case is not in essence vicarious or derivative in the sense that it derives from the act or omission of the hired contractor,citation but t o the contrary,is direct in a much stronger sense of that term.hooker,supra,at,d,fn.omitted.
the court noted that to justify liability for negligent exercise of a power of control,the hirers affirmative contribution need not always be in the form of actively directing a contractor or contractors employee.there will be times when a hirer will be liable for its omissions.for example,if the hirer promises to undertake a particular safety measure,then the hirers negligent failure to do so should result in liability if such negligence leads to an employee injury.hooker,supra,cal th at,fn,d.
in a companion case,mckown stores,cal th,d,mckown,the court affirmed a judgment against a property owner who had asked the plaintiff employer,an independent contractor,to use the owner forklifts whenever possible,and who had supplied an unsafe forklift,causing injury to the plaintiff.the court held that a hirer is liable to an employee of an independent contractor insofar as the hirer provision of unsafe equipment affirmatively contributes to the employee injury.id.at,d,fn.omitted.liability for furnishing defective equipment was appropriate because,under traditional tort principles,it required active participation by the hirer an owner is not liable for injuries resulting from defective appliances unless he has supplied them or has the privilege of selecting them or the materials out of which they are made citation or unless he exercises active control over the men employed or the operations of the equipment used by the independent contractor.citation.citation.id.at,d,quoting mcdonald shell oil cal d,italics added by mckown.w here the hiring party actively contributes to the injury by supplying defective equipment,it is the hiring party own negligence that renders it liable,not that of the contractor.mckown,supra,cal th at,d,quoting court of appeal.the hirer was not relieved of liability by the fact that it did not insist on,but merely requested,use of the defective equipment the contractor was presumably loath to displease the owner,the world largest retailer,with whom the contractor had several contracts.mckown,supra,cal th at,d.it was reasonable to suppose that refusal to use the forklift would have generated ill will by resulting in additional expense,chargeable to the owner,as well as delaying the project for at least hours.id.at,d.nor was liability defeated by the jury attribution of the majority of fault to the contractor t he hirer affirmative contribution to the employee injuries eliminates the unfairness in imposing liability where the contractor is primarily at fault.mckown,at,d.
if the principle of these cases can be stated in a sentence,it appears to be that the liability of a hirer of an independent contractor for injuries to an employee of the contractor can not be predicated on the contractor negligence rather the hirer can only be liable where it injures a worker through its own negligence.of course this formula does not provide an adequate test by itself,because negligence consists of the breach of a duty of care,and each of the theories rejected in the above cases seems at first blush to involve such a breach of such a duty however,these cases may be understood,and are perhaps best understood,as resting on the principle that the hirer of an independent contractor has no duty to protect an employee of the contractor from the consequences of the contractor negligence.insofar as the plaintiff injuries result from the contractor negligence,without any affirmative contribution by the hirer,the latter can not be found to have violated any duty to the plaintiff.
here,none of these shown to apply.defendants made no attempt to demonstrate that plaintiff own independent negligent,let alone that its negligence was the sole,or even primary,cause of plaintiff injuries.even if such negligence had been shown without substantial evidence fell far short of establishing that defendants did not affirmatively contribute to plaintiff injuries.it is undisputed that they undertook to arrange and supply the means and methods of work,including safety systems and devices,which they then withdrew before the work was completed,leaving plaintiff with no safe means of completing the work.there was no evidence that this was done in the expectation that plaintiff employer could,would,or should make substitute arrangements.it is true that the catenary lines had been removed some two months before plaintiff injury,but there was no evidence that plaintiff employer had the opportunity,or would have been permitted,to replace those lines.in any event the failure to do so might not have constituted negligence so long as the hydraulic lifts were present.there is evidence,however,that defendants abruptly removed the lifts the day before the injuries,that they wanted the work finished without delay,and that they might not have permitted a lift to be brought back into the copper gowning room even if one had been obtained.in short the evidence raises the strong possibility,at least,that defendants not only actively contributed to plaintiff injuries,but actually created the situation in which they were likely to occur.defendants therefore failed to show that the principles and rationale of privette,toland,and hooker operated to bar liability.
it also bears noting that privette,toland,camargo,and hooker all concerned theories of liability propounded as exceptions to the general rule that a hirer is not liable for the negligence of an independent contractor.except as stated in following sections,the employer of an independent contractor is not liable for physical harm caused to another by an act or omission of the contractor or his servants,italics added.there is no reason to exempt the hirer from liability under circumstances where a complete stranger would be liable.nothing in these cases suggests that with respect to its own actual as distinct from imputed or constructive negligence,the hirer should enjoy any more freedom from liability to workers on its site than would an invitee or passerby.a hirer must be liable on general tort principles if,for example,he causes foreseeable harm by heedlessly shouting at a contractor employee,distracting him from some hazardous task in which he is obviously engaged.these cases only excuse the hirer from a duty to protect employees from the negligence of their own employer.where the hirer breaches a duty arising under general tort principles,nothing in these cases suggests that it may not be liable.
the facts here readily suggest that defendants may be liable under general tort principles for breaching a duty of care arising from their own voluntary endeavor to protect plaintiff and others from injury.i t is ancient learning that one who assumes to act,even though gratuitously,may thereby become subject to a duty of acting carefully,if he acts at all.citation.artiglio corning cal th,d,artiglio,quoting glanzer shepard.thus one who,having no initial duty to do so,undertakes to come to the aid of good samaritan has a duty to exercise due care in performance and is liable if a his failure to exercise care increases the risk of such harm,or b the harm is suffered because of the other reliance upon the undertaking.williams state of california cal d,citing rest d torts,see,coffee cal d,see also baji a pe
