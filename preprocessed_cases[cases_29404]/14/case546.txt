introduction 
at issue in this appeal is a trial court authority to amend a judgment to add the name of an additional judgment debtor.it involves a civil procedure game of like none we have before encountered.
second generation roofing,a roofing subcontractor involved in construction defect litigation,successfully defeated indemnity and related asserted against it by the project general contractor,hearn pacific corporation hearn.it then secured a roughly award of prevailing party attorney fees and costs against the general contractor,embodied in two separate orders,pursuant to a fee clause contained in the subcontract.it now appeals from an order denying its motion to amend the two attorney fees orders to add one of the general contractor insurers as a judgment debtor.the insurer,it maintained,had taken an assignment of the general contractor contractual indemnity rights during the litigation,had in fact been the entity that prosecuted the to final judgment in the general contractor name,and as such was the real party in interest liable on the resulting fee award.
its motion was brought under several provisions of the code of civil procedure,including section that provision states an action or proceeding does not abate by the transfer of an interest in the action or proceeding or by any other transfer of an interest.the action or proceeding may be continued in the name of the original party,or the court may allow the person to whom the transfer is made to be substituted in the action or proceeding,italics added.
for reasons not apparent in the record but ultimately disclosed at oral argument,the nominal judgment debtor,hearn,opposed the subcontractor effort to add its insurer as a named judgment debtor.it now continues to press that position on appeal,and even goes so far as to deny the validity of the assignment it executed,disavow sworn statements that its counsel filed below,and contradict allegations in its pleadings that are directly dispositive of the issues on appeal.we find its arguments troubling,to say the least,and its position puzzling.that an insured,faced with a liability imposed nominally upon it in excess of and increasing annually by percent see,would go to such lengths to protect its insurer from being named liable on that judgment debt suggests to us only one thing,which is exactly what this record shows too and its counsel revealed at oral argument the insurer,not its insured,is indeed conducting this litigation.
by virtue of the assignment taken in this case,hearn insurer is the real party in interest here.the trial court declined to amend the judgment to name the general contractor insurer as an additional judgment debtor.we hold that it abused its discretion under section,and reverse.
background 
hearn acted as the general contractor on a project in sonoma county for the construction of a building.in,the project owner brought suit for design and construction defects against multiple parties,including hearn and second generation roofing.hearn against second generation roofing and other subcontractors,alleging causes of action for breach of contract,professional negligence,express indemnity,implied indemnity,equitable indemnity,breach of warranties,comparative negligence and contribution 
two years later,in august,hearn executed an agreement assigning its rights and interests under its subcontracts to two insurers,north american specialty insurance company north american and rsui group.the assignment agreement states 
hearn hereby assigns to its defending insurers,north american specialty insurance company and rsui group,the insurers,all rights and interests under its subcontracts for the project located at healdsburg avenue,healdsburg,sonoma county,california,including but not limited to,any obligation of any subcontractor or supplier to defend,indemnify or hold harmless,or to pay attorneys fees in equity or by operation of law,to the extent of the defense costs or other expenses incurred by the lnsurers arising from and relating to deas family limited partnership hearn pacific corporation,et,sonoma county superior court case no.scv subject action.hearn agrees to this assignment provided,however,that hearn retains its rights and interest to the extent it has incurred defense costs or other expenses defending against the subject action,prosecuting its or satisfying or paying insurance policy deductibles or retentions.
the insurers may pursue their recovery along with hearn in hearn name in the subject action or any subsequent action.the effect of this agreement is cumulative along with any assignments to the insurers by operation of law or in equity.
this assignment should not be construed to limit the rights of either hearn or any of the insurers to be fully compensated for costs,expenses,attorneys fees,expert fees or any other expenses incurred because of or in connection with the subject action.
thereafter,in december,hearn settled with the plaintiff and all but two subcontractors,one of which was second generation roofing.
subsequently,in april,hearn filed a first amended against second generation roofing and the other remaining subcontractor.the amended pleading alleged causes of action for breach of a contractual duty to defend it in the underlying litigation,equitable contribution premised on a duty to defend hearn,express indemnity,breach of a contractual obligation to obtain insurance,equitable contribution for hearn defense costs premised on a breach of their duty to obtain insurance coverage,implied indemnity,and of fault.it sought indemnity from any damages or judgment entered in the plaintiff favor in the underlying case,reimbursement of its defense costs in the underlying case,and an award of prevailing party costs and attorney fees incurred in pursuit of the.
the amended,which was unverified,included allegations concerning the assignment.it alleged that hearn assigned its rights under the subcontracts with the,including second generation roofing,to its insurers on august,and that pursuant to and greco oregon mutual insurance d,hearn insurers are asserting claims in this action in the name of the sic hearn assigned to them by hearn through operation of law.the cited authority,greco oregon mutual insurance d,addresses the impact of an assignment on the proper parties to litigation id.at pp.it states,among other things,that if the assignment occurs after suit has been filed,the action may be continued in the name of the assignor,or the court may permit the assignee to be substituted therein code civ,and a judgment in favor of the assignor under these circumstances,when no change of party plaintiff has occurred,will be sustained.id.at.
the amended also alleged,pursuant to the court of appeal holding in searles valley minerals operations ralph parsons service company.searles,the fact that hearn did not literally pay its defense costs,after second generation roofing refused to,does not absolve second generation roofing from its obligation to pay hearn defense costs.the cited authority,searles,authorizes the assignee of contractual indemnity rights to recover the defense costs it paid on the assignor behalf by enforcing the assigned indemnity rights.searles,at pp.
later in the case,one of hearn attorneys filed a declaration in support of a motion for summary adjudication stating that,hearn defending insurers are suing in hearn name as transferees of hearn contractual indemnity rights,including the right to obtain equitable contribution for defense costs incurred herein from such as second generation roofing.
eventually,on april,the litigation terminated successfully in second generation roofing favor,with dismissal of the against it on procedural grounds.in the same order,the trial court awarded it in costs and granted a motion for attorney fees pursuant to a prevailing party attorney fee clause contained in the subcontract the court entered a later order,on june,awarding attorney fees in the amount of and hearn noticed an appeal from that ruling.
second generation roofing then moved under both code of civil procedure sections and,and pursuant to the court inherent powers,to amend both orders to name one of hearn two insurers,north american,as a judgment debtor owing the amounts awarded against hearn.second generation roofing argued that the had been prosecuted by north american as hearn assignee,in hearn purported name,and north american was in fact the true.in a footnote,it argued that a t this time,for its own reasons,second generation roofing does not seek an order providing it the same relief as against rsui group,the other insurer to whom hearn assigned its rights,according to the assignment agreement.its papers argued,too,that the award against hearn could not be readily collected,because hearn was merely a dba for another entity that by then was apparently a dissolved corporation 
the evidentiary basis for the motion consisted of the allegations of the first amended the assignment agreement,as authenticated in a declaration by the hearn board member who had entered into it,which had been filed in support of an earlier motion by hearn for summary adjudication and the sworn declaration of hearn counsel we have described,also submitted in support of an earlier summary adjudication motion.
hearn submitted no evidence in opposition other than a declaration by its counsel stating,in pertinent part,that hearn insurer north american agreed to defend hearn in this matter under a reservation of rights,which limits the terms of its participation in the litigation to the defense of hearn from the plaintiff claims.the scope of north american defense of hearn is closely circumscribed by the terms of north american insuring agreement and does not extend to a duty to indemnify hearn.
hearn also objected to the declaration by hearn board member that hearn itself had submitted in support of its motion for summary adjudication and to the assignment agreement that declaration authenticated and attached as an exhibit.it argued those materials were inadmissible and should be disregarded because they had been filed in support of a different motion.
hearn did not dispute the existence of the assignment.in its opposition memorandum of points and authorities,hearn stated that a fter hearn sought reimbursement from the subcontractors for its defense costs,under the provisions of the subcontract agreements,some of the subcontractors,including second generation,refused to reimburse hearn.accordingly,hearn assigned some of its contractual rights to its insurers so they might pursue the subcontractors separately to recover their defense costs.
the trial court denied the motion in an ruling.it sustained hearn objection to the board member summary adjudication declaration,ruling it inadmissible on the ground that it would be unfair to bind hearn by allegations,statements or concessions made in the context of a motion for summary adjudication for a wholly separate motion by second generation roofing to amend a judgment.it also ruled the motion was procedurally defective,since the trial court lost jurisdiction of the matter on hearn appeal of the judgment.
the court also denied second generation roofing motion on the merits.the fairest interpretation of its comments is that it understood a court power under section to amend a judgment to add additional judgment debtors to be limited to alter ego cases,and concluded second generation roofing had not proved hearn and its insurer were alter egos.
the court ruling under section is reflected in comments directed to the admissibility of second generation roofing evidence.the court stated even if the court were to accept the admissibility of hearn motion for summary adjudication declaration and accompanying assignment,the assignment does not extend any rights to hearn insurers which they did not already possess under the operation of law.ccp permits a case to proceed unabated upon a party assignment or partial assignment of rights to another party,with the case proceeding in the original party name.as such,hearn remains the only proper party in this matter.hearn partial assignment of rights that the subcontractors owe it under their subcontracts to its insurers does not alter the fact that the litigation may continue in hearn name.after hearn sought reimbursement from the subcontractors for its defense costs,under the provisions of the subcontract agreements,some of the subcontractors,including second generation roofing,refused to reimburse hearn.accordingly,hearn assigned some of its contractual rights to its insurers so they might pursue the subcontractors separately to recover their defense costs.accordingly,plaintiff purported evidence is inadmissible.
the trial court also ruled that second generation roofing motion was improper,reasoning the subcontractor exclusive remedy was to pursue a separate action against hearn insurers under insurance code section to recover against hearn insurance policy proceeds,subject to the terms of the policies.
this timely appeal followed.
discussion 
before turning to the merits,we first clarify that our review is based on all the evidence second generation roofing submitted in the trial court.on appeal,second generation roofing challenges the court exclusion of some of its evidence,and we agree the trial court erred.conversely,hearn contends the allegations of its first amended complaint must be disregarded on appeal,and we reject that contention.
a.the trial court erroneously excluded the stankowski declaration.
to recap,in support of its motion,second generation roofing submitted two declarations that had been filed previously in support of summary adjudication motions.one was the declaration of gordon stankowski in support of defendant hearn pacific corporation motion for summary adjudication against cross defendant second generation roofing,dated august,which attached a copy of the assignment agreement and authenticated it as an agreement stankowski,a hearn board member,had entered into on hearn behalf.the other was the declaration by one of hearn attorneys,which averred among other things that hearn defending insurers are suing in hearn name as transferees of hearn contractual indemnity rights,including the right to obtain equitable contribution for defense costs incurred herein from such as second generation roofing.
second generation roofing contends the trial court erroneously excluded both declarations,and while we agree the trial court erred,the record shows hearn objected to,and the trial court excluded,only the stankowski declaration,including the attached assignment agreement the trial court ruled this declaration was inadmissible because it was filed in support of a motion for summary adjudication.citing myers trendwest resorts,th myers,it reasoned that a motion for summary adjudication,and its accompanying papers,are not pleadings within the definition of ccp,and under myers it would be unfair to bind hearn by allegations,statements or concessions made in the context of a motion for summary adjudication for a wholly separate motion by second generation roofing to amend a judgment.
the trial court erred in excluding this declaration.myers offers no support for the court ruling the case deals with judicial admissions,not the rules of evidence.it holds that a factual concession in a separate statement of undisputed fact filed for purposes of a summary judgment motion does not constitute a binding judicial admission that estops a party from later contesting the fact at trial.myers,supra,th at pp.
hearn nonetheless argues the case is analogous,because the reasoning applied to any evidence not considered a pleading filed in support of a summary judgment motion,and urges us to extend myers to declarations.we disagree.myers distinguished a separate statement of undisputed fact from evidentiary materials such as declarations.see myers,supra,th at it is not evidence because not under oath or verified nor is it a judicial admission.furthermore,second generation roofing did not proffer the stankowski declaration in order to estop hearn from contesting any facts concerning the assignment it did so in order to prove the fact of the assignment and its terms.nothing in myers reasoning precludes a party from into evidence a declaration previously admitted into evidence on summary judgment,and we decline to extend myers to this wholly different situation.
nor was there any unfair ness to hearn.hearn was certainly free to respond with additional declarations or other evidence to try to rebut,or qualify,its board member earlier sworn statements,but it did do that.the only unfairness we perceive would be to allow it to proffer this sworn declaration as evidence but then later prevent its opponent from doing exactly the same thing.
hearn did not below,and does not now,contend the stankowski declaration is made inadmissible by any provision of the evidence code,and we agree with second generation roofing it should have been admitted see,except as otherwise provided by statute,all relevant evidence is admissible see also affidavit is prima facie evidence of the facts stated therein,declarations under penalty of perjury kulshrestha first union commercial cal th,a valid declaration has the same force and effect as an affidavit administered under oath bank of america trust savings ass taliaferro d,per curiam contract of assignment held properly admitted.
ordinarily,an appellate court may not rely upon evidence excluded by the trial court in reviewing the sufficiency of the evidence see shepherd turner cal,arditto putnam d,d appellate review,but here there is no point in a remand for the trial court to reconsider its ruling in light of this improperly excluded evidence.when there is no conflict in the relevant extrinsic evidence,as here,the interpretation of a contract presents a pure question of law for the appellate court.see parsons bristol development cal d.therefore,we will proceed to an analysis of the merits based upon our independent determination of the assignment agreement meaning.
b.the allegations of the first amended complaint are properly considered on appeal.
mounting yet another attack on the assignment,hearn argues for the first time on appeal that the allegations of its first amended complaint concerning the assignment have no evidentiary value,because the complaint was unverified.but because hearn did not object below to second generation roofing reliance on those allegations,the contention is forfeited.q uestions relating to the admissibility of evidence will not be reviewed on appeal in the absence of a specific and timely objection in the trial court on the ground sought to be urged on appeal.people waidla cal th.
furthermore,we agree with second generation roofing that these allegations constitute a binding judicial admission,and hearn evidentiary objection misses the point.hearn cites authority standing only for the proposition that the allegations of an unverified complaint may not be used by the pleading party offensively,as evidence against another party in the context of a contested motion,because the complaint was unverified and therefore could not serve as an affidavit.sheard superior court d.but a pleading party may be bound by the factual allegations it makes in a complaint,even if the complaint is not verified it is presumed that even an unverified pleading is filed with the consent of the client and should be regarded as an admission.staples hoefke d,see,reichert ins.cal d,allegation of unverified complaint held binding womack lovell th,same.this is consistent with the nature and purpose of a pleading,whether verified or not an admission in the pleadings is not treated procedurally as evidence,because it is fundamentally different from evidence it is a waiver of proof of a fact by conceding its truth,and it has the effect of removing the matter from the issues.valerio andrew youngquist construction th,quoting witkin,cal.procedure ed.pleading,pp.at least in the absence of some showing of mistake or inadvertence by the pleading party reichhert,at pp,and as long as the opposing party is not contesting the factual allegation see barsegian kessler kessler,th,there is nothing unfair or inappropriate about holding a party to the truth of its unverified factual allegations.therefore,we will not ignore hearn allegations in considering whether the trial court erred in denying second generation roofing motion.
we now turn to the merits.
the trial court abused its discretion in declining to amend t he judgment under code of civil procedure section.
the focus of much of the parties lengthy briefing,and the trial court ruling,is on code of civil procedure section,a provision that empowers trial courts to amend a judgment to add additional judgment debtors in appropriate circumstances and most frequently has been invoked in the context of alter egos see,danko th,misik th,greenspan ladt,llc th,or similar theories by which the corporate form of the original judgment debtor may be disregarded see,carolina casualty ins.ross law group,llp th,sole equity partner of dissolved limited liability partnership mcclellan northridge park townhome owners ass th,successor corporation.but it is unnecessary here to decide whether,and to what extent,the court equitable power to add an additional judgment debtor under section is limited to alter egos or similar scenarios.that question is somewhat complex,and the law unsettled.compare,tokio marine fire ins.western pacific roofing th,tokio marine triplett farmers ins.exchange th,with carolina casualty ins,at pp.carr barnabey hotel th,in re levander cir.
this case can be decided on a more straightforward ground.on its face,section applies only if the course of proceeding be not specifically pointed out by this code or the statute.here,the course of proceedings is specifically addressed by another provision of the code of civil procedure section,quoted ante,which was the alternate basis for second generation roofing motion.
section is derived without substantive change from former section.cal.revision com.under the case law construing that statute,trial courts have discretion to allow litigation to continue in the name of the original plaintiff rather than substitute the transferee.alameda county home inv.whitaker cal.but the transfer of a party interest in the subject of an action transfers the right to control the action.walker felt cal,see also crescent canal montgomery cal.and if the action does continue in the original party name,the original party remains as only a nominal party whereas the real party in interest is the transferee.see crescent canal,cal.at,tuffree stearns ranchos cal,tuffree.possibly the opposing party,for reasons readily perceptible,might be desirous of having the real party in interest substituted as a party to the record but if such party is willing to have matters stand statu quo,and the real party in interest is content to have matters proceed upon the old lines,t he real plaintiff or defendant simply uses the name of another in the further prosecution or defense of the action.tuffree,at.as witkin describes it,the transferee election to allow the proceeding to continue in the name of the original party is at most a matter of procedural convenience.witkin,cal.procedure ed.pleading.it appears that in this case,up until entry of the orders awarding fees and costs,the parties were content to allow matters to proceed in this fashion.
the statute was not meant to be used as a shield,however.for example,in keeling collection agency mckeever cal,the supreme court observed in dictum that the buyer of property at issue in a foreclosure suit could not avoid the requirement of an appeal bond through the device of continuing the appeal in the name of the nominal appellants sec tion,code civ.proc.rather than securing a substitution of parties.id.at.and the supreme court in dictum has recognized an opposing party right to ask that a transferee be substituted in under the statute.see higgins kay,supra,cal.at tuffree,supra,cal.at campbell west cal.in particular,authority not cited by the parties recognizes a trial court power to order that a judgment debtor transferee be substituted in as a party,and ordered bound by the judgment,so that a judgment creditor does not get left holding a judgment that proves difficult or impossible to collect.see erickson boothe d.
the trial court should have done so here.it gave no reason to continue the action solely in hearn name when second generation roofing sought to add north american to the two orders,and none appears.by contrast,second generation roofing had a liquidated right adjudicated by court order to collect its attorney fees and costs as a prevailing party.we hold in these circumstances it was an abuse of discretion to refuse its request to add the name of the real party in interest,hearn assignee,who pressed claims in the name of the party nominally adjudged liable by these orders.the trial court denial of this relief appears to be arbitrary 
furthermore,as second generation roofing argues,that relief is consistent with the law governing contractual attorney fees.had hearn insurer exercised its right to formally substitute in as the real party in interest,rather than remain on the sidelines and sue in hearn name,it could have been held directly liable for second generation roofing prevailing party attorney fees under the subcontract,as an assignee.see erickson concepts,th,erickson deciding the issue as a matter of law heppler peters th,heppler deciding the issue on the basis of conflicting extrinsic evidence,under substantial evidence standard california wholesale material supply,norm wilson sons,th,deciding the issue as a matter of law.that is because an assignee acceptance of the benefits of a contract containing a fee clause,by bringing suit,constitutes an implied assumption of the attorney fee obligations,unless there is evidence the parties did not intend to transfer those fee obligations erickson,at see also heppler,at pp.and that is true even if,like here,there is only a partial assignment of contractual rights.see erickson,at pp.indeed,even outside the attorney fee context,an assignee voluntary acceptance of the benefits of a contract may obligate the assignee to assume its obligations as a matter of law,even if the assignment agreement expressly excludes the obligations,as in the authority hearn cites.see melchior new line productions,th.hearn insurer can not evade responsibility for paying second generation roofing costs and legal fees solely because of its tactical choice to keep hearn name,not its own,on the case caption.we do not think the discretion afforded a trial court to continue an action in the transferor name under section was meant as a card,to insulate the real party in interest from exposure to liability for costs and fees when the litigation they pursue concludes unfavorably.
on appeal,hearn does not seriously address section.it contends the assignment is invalid,which we address below.it asserts north american was completely unaware of the subcontract terms and so could not assume its obligations but it cites nothing in the record to support that factual assertion,which is raised improperly for the first time on appeal and also is defied by the prayer for attorney fees in its complaint see note,ante.moreover,the authorities it cites do not involve parties who press suit to enforce assigned contractual rights but then,later,try to escape contractual burdens relating to the conduct of litigation.see recorded picture company productions nelson entertainment,th,unterberger red bull north america,th,but see,norcal mutual ins.newton th,distinguishing recorded picture.apart from that,it asserts without citing any legal authority or,again,any portion of the record that even if the assignment was valid,it only assigned a portion of the contract provisions and so the application of ccp is not applicable,and hearn remained the only party asserting its claims against second generation.
we disagree.it was hearn that first invoked this statute below,in paragraph of its first amended complaint.it alleged hearn insurers are asserting claims in this action in the name of the sic hearn assigned to them by hearn through operation of law.and it alleged they were doing so p ursuant to.for hearn to turn around now and argue the opposite that hearn remained the only party asserting its claims and that section does not apply without so much as even a nod to what it said in its pleadings,is baffling.there are limits to appellate advocacy,chief among them a duty of candor to the court.rules conduct,rule.it may be hearn has some explanation for its change of tune,but the explanation is not to be found in the pages of briefing hearn has filed on appeal,nor did it surface in any way at oral argument.responsible not to mention,effective appellate advocacy requires confronting serious potential obstacles,not burying one head in the sand to them,be they potentially controlling adverse authorities or problematic portions of the record.as has been said by the federal circuit that is home to chicago lincoln park zoo the ostrich is a noble animal,but not a proper model for an appellate advocate.gonzalez servin ford motor cir,posner.
furthermore,hearn current position is not the law.it is that former section applies to partial assignments too.this principle dates back more than a century.cerf ashley cal,it would be too narrow a construction of this section to hold that it applies only where the transfer is of the entire interest accord,crescent canal montgomery,supra,cal.at.this court addressed partial assignments in a decision of more modern vintage involving similar facts,in bank of orient superior court d.there,we held that an insurer to whom a cause of action had been partially assigned is an indispensable party who must be joined as a party plaintiff.id.at pp.in that context,we observed that former section has no application to instances where partial assignees or partial subrogees are required to be joined as indispensable parties bank of orient,at,italics omitted,which we understand to mean the court has no discretion in that situation to permit continued suit solely in the original party name.
on this record,it also appears the partial nature of this assignment is a red herring.it is true the language of the assignment agreement reserves for hearn some residual interest in claims for defense cost reimbursement against second generation roofing.specifically,hearn retained the right to seek reimbursement under the subcontracts to the extent it has incurred defense costs or other expenses defending against the subject action,prosecuting its or satisfying or paying insurance policy deductibles or retentions,while assigning to its insurers its right to seek reimbursement under the subcontracts to the extent of the defense costs or other expenses incurred by the insurers in the case.italics added.but it appears from the face of the amended complaint that hearn qua hearn did not assert any claim based on its retained,unassigned interest.that is,there is nothing on the face of the first amended complaint indicating that hearn itself sought reimbursement for litigation expenses it incurred out of its own pocket,as contrasted with the litigation expenses paid by its insurers.on the contrary,the first amended complaint alleges a complete assignment of rights,which suggests any unassigned rights were not in play hearn assigned its rights under the subcontracts with the to its insurers on august,it alleged that hearn insurers are asserting claims in this action in the name of the sic hearn italics added and it alleged that hearn did not literally pay its defense costs.that pleading also alleged that hearn presumably,its insurers are providing hearn with a defense from plaintiff claims in this action and are incurring costs for attorneys fees,experts,and other costs and expenses related to the subject litigation.so,any distinction between partial and complete assignments is immaterial.
these allegations,moreover,substantiate that the real party in interest was hearn insurer.a party whose litigation expenses are paid entirely by its insurer has no standing to recover its legal fees against a contractual indemnitor,because the party has suffered no contractual damage.see bramalea california,reliable interiors,th,bramalea.however,a party can pursue an indemnification action in its own name in that circumstance if,as was done here,it assigns its claim to its insurer.in that case,the insurer is the real party in interest but continued suit in the original party name is authorized by section.see bramalea,at pp,citing greco oregon mut.fire ins,supra,d,citing,inter alia,former code civ.some of these authorities are in fact the very ones hearn cited in the first amended complaint.
that hearn insurers were actually in the driver seat,pursuing this lawsuit,is also evidenced by the claims themselves,some of which were pursued by hearn insurers in their own right,not derivatively as assignees of hearn.specifically,the two causes of action for equitable contribution belonged to hearn insurers.such a claim may be asserted by multiple insurers of the same insured and the same risk,each of which has an independent standing to assert a right for equitable contribution when it has undertaken the defense indemnification of their common insured.truck ins.exchange superior court th.and,t his right is not the equivalent of standing in the shoes of the insured.ibid.
at oral argument,respondent counsel effectively conceded that the were litigated solely for the benefit of hearn insurer after the settlement.specifically,counsel i confirmed that the settlement resolved all claims against hearn,and that after the settlement there remained only the issue of the defense costs hearn insurer had paid on hearn behalf,ii acknowledged that hearn indemnity claims were assigned,iii disclosed that the assignment only purpose was to facilitate north american recovery of those defense costs,by avoiding the holding of bramalea,supra,th iv maintained he represents both hearn and its insurer which retained him,under the tripartite relationship that arises between an attorney,insurer and insured when the carrier retains counsel for its insured see generally bank of america,superior court th,and vi represented that pursuit of the after the assignment was for north american sole benefit,and that for all practical purposes hearn was indifferent as to the outcome of second generation motion because it has dissolved and effectively has no assets as to the latter point,too,it seems obvious to us that the undisputed circumstance that hearn might now be judgment proof is all the more reason it was inappropriate to deny second generation roofing motion,leaving it without recourse to the assets of the real party in interest who owned these claims,and controlled this case,after the assignment.
for all of these reasons,then,we reject hearn argument that hearn remained the only party asserting its claims against second generation.by all accounts,and as ultimately conceded by counsel,hearn qua hearn was out of this case following the assignment.the court abused its discretion in declining to amend the orders awarding attorney fees and costs to add north american name as a judgment debtor 
the trial court grounds for denying t he motiona.insurance code section 
as noted,the trial court articulated several reasons for denying second generation roofing motion,one of which was that second generation roofing sole remedy was to bring an action under insurance code section.however,that statute does not provide any remedy on this record,much less an exclusive one.
in appropriate cases,insurance code section enables a judgment creditor to bring a direct action against the judgment debtor insurer to satisfy the judgment out of policy proceeds one key requirement,however,is that the insurance policy covers the relief awarded in the judgment.miller am.home assurance th.in this case,hearn did not introduce any evidence its insurance policy would cover the award of prevailing party attorney fees and costs made to second generation roofing.the policy itself is not in the record,and the only evidence hearn did introduce disclaimed coverage on appeal,hearn adverts to that evidence in its brief and expressly disavows coverage again.it tells this court,north american has no obligation to satisfy judgments imposed upon its insured hearn.furthermore,as second generation roofing points out,an award of costs or attorney fees is typically not recoverable by a judgment creditor in a direct action against the insurer.see san diego housing com.industrial indemnity th,accord,clark california ins.guarantee th.so,for these reasons,the trial court had no basis to conclude there was a potential remedy under insurance code section.
but even if there were a remedy,we also agree with second generation roofing the statute is irrelevant,and in no way displaces a litigant right to amend a order to add the name of a judgment debtor who was the true party to the action,even when that party is an insurer.insurance code section authorizes a direct action against the insurer on the policy and subject to its terms and limitations,by such judgment creditor to recover on the judgment,subd.b.second generation roofing was not seeking to recover on a judgment out of insurance proceeds,or any other specific fund but to amend a judgment,to reflect the true name of a judgment debtor directly liable in its own name for the amounts awarded by that judgment.nor was it trying to recover on the policy.the relief it sought was premised on north american assignment and exercise of rights from hearn,not north american status as hearn insurer.we agree that if second generation roofing wished to proceed against policy benefits to satisfy these orders,it must assert a claim against hearn insurers under insurance code section,but that not what it was trying to do.
the trial court conclusion that second generation roofing only avenue for relief was to pursue a direct action under insurance code section has no support in either the text of the statute itself,or principles of statutory interpretation.as noted,that provision states that an action may be brought against the insurer on the policy by a judgment creditor in specified circumstances,subd.b.the trial court apparently construed this language to mean that recovery by an insured judgment creditor may be had against an insurer only by means of a direct action on the policy.but we can not insert that limitation under the guise of interpreting section.see county of santa clara escobar th.it is of course a cardinal rule of statutory construction that a law is to be interpreted by the language in which it is written,and courts are no more at liberty to add provisions to what is therein declared in definite language than they are to disregard any of its express provisions.id.at see also code civ,in construing statutes,court may not insert what has been omitted.the text of this statute contains no ambiguity,and so we presume the legislature meant what it said,and the plain meaning of the statute governs.people allegheny cas.cal th.nothing in the text of section declare s in definite language that a direct action against an insurer on the policy is a judgment creditor sole remedy see county of santa clara,at,and we decline to adopt that construction.
furthermore,nothing on the face of insurance code section exempts insurers from the operation of section of the code of civil procedure.there is simply no conflict between the text of these two statutes.the authorities hearn cites do not address this question.see webster superior court cal d,construing statutory stay governing insurance liquidation proceedings haisten grass valley medical reimbursement fund,cir,section held applicable to policy indemnifying loss from liability for personal injury,and constitutional as applied to contract.
at oral argument,hearn acknowledged there is nothing in the statute text that explicitly provides it is an exclusive remedy,but nonetheless argued for that construction because,in its view,subdivision b of section otherwise would be rendered completely unnecessary.we disagree.the argument is circular.subdivision b is the direct action remedy.see,subd.b.all policies of insurance covered by the statute,whether they contain the direct action language required by subdivision b,shall be construed as if such provisions were embodied therein.see id,first paragraph.hearn argument boils down to the illogical contention that the mere existence of the remedy makes it an exclusive one.
hearn cites no authority holding that insurance code section is a judgment creditor sole remedy against an adversary insurer,and we are aware of none.on the contrary,judgment creditors may sometimes pursue damages claims against the judgment debtor insurer.one california court has held they may do so in their own right,and seek tort damages as a beneficiary of the policy,if there is a final judgment rendered against the insured that is covered by the policy and the insurer refuses in bad faith to pay it.hand farmers ins.exchange th hand accord,low golden eagle ins.th,gulf ins.tig ins.th,harper wausau ins.th.and it is judgment creditors may bring suit under an assignment of rights from the insured in some instances too.for example,subject to some limitations,a judgment creditor may bring suit on an assigned claim the insurer wrongfully failed to settle within policy limits,in which case the measure of damages is the entire amount of the judgment even if it exceeds policy limits see comunale traders general ins.cal d,samson transamerica ins.cal d.a judgment creditor also may take an assignment of the insured claim that the insurer wrongfully refused to defend it.see risely interinsurance exchange of automobile club th,risely.and sometimes attorney fees on assigned claims are recoverable too,if sought by judgment creditors as tort damages under brandt superior court cal d.essex ins.five star dye house,cal th.
these cases also reflect that it is not uncommon for judgment creditors to assert,in a single lawsuit against an insurer,both damages claims assigned to them by the insured as well as a direct claim on the judgment under insurance code section.see,risely,supra,th at pp.archdale american internat.specialty lines ins.th,fn.the latter claim will not be viable if policy limits have been exhausted.archdale,at,fn,fn.but policy limitations that would otherwise apply in a direct action brought under insurance code section do not apply to an assigned bad faith claim.see camelot by the bay condominium owners scottsdale ins.th,fn.in most of these situations,what is really going on is the judgment creditor is attempting to satisfy all or part of its judgment through a claim for contract tort damages against the insurer,rather than through or,in addition to a direct action on the judgment.yet this entire body of law would be meaningless if the direct action provision of insurance code section constituted a judgment creditor sole avenue for relief against an insurer 
two published california opinions have rejected arguments the statute displaces other rights or remedies against insurers,and their reasoning applies equally here.in turner evers d supp,disapproved on other grounds in javorek superior court cal d,the appellate department of superior court held insurance code section does not override the remedy of garnishment,embodied by former section of the code of civil procedure.see turner,at pp.among other reasons,t here is nothing in section,subdivision b to indicate that it was intended to exempt insurers from garnishment and thus given them a benefit that other obligors of the insured do not enjoy.id.at see also id.at since section,subdivision b does not refer to garnishments,we should not expand it to nullify the application of section to insurers.and in roberts home insurance indemnity d roberts,our colleagues in division four held the statute was no bar to a personal injury plaintiff action against an insurer under louisiana direct action statute,which permits an injured plaintiff to sue the tortfeasor insurer directly on the policy without awaiting a final judgment against the insured.id.at pp.citing turner,the court reasoned in part,the statute is silent as to a direct action against the insurer before judgment is obtained against the insured.citation.that silence does not imply a legislative policy against allowing a claimant to pursue any rights which may have been created by contract or by another state direct action statute.ibid.we have described roberts as an exception to the rule that generally speaking the injured party may not directly sue an insurer of the alleged tortfeasor.hoteles camino real,superior court d.
the ninth circuit parted ways with turner and roberts in fireman fund ins.city of lodi,california cir,which held section conflicts with,and therefore preempted,a local law that would permit a direct action on an insurance policy before entry of a final judgment.see fireman fund,at pp.the ninth circuit acknowledged both decisions support the conclusion that does not set forth the exclusive set of circumstances under which one may initiate a direct action against an insurer.id.at.but it reasoned,there is greater authority to suggest that sets forth the exclusive set of circumstances under which a claimant may directly sue another policyholder liability insurer.ibid.that observation,however,is not supported by the cited authorities,none of which addresses whether insurance code section displaces other rights or remedies we therefore part ways with fireman fund to the extent its broad language is inconsistent with our decision.we find the reasoning of turner and roberts persuasive,insofar as their textual analysis of the statute is concerned,and equally pertinent to the application of section.indeed,this case presents even less reason to infer a potential conflict with insurance code section,because second generation roofing is not seeking to secure any policy benefits.
accordingly,we hold that insurance code section does not bar a judgment creditor motion under section to amend a judgment to add an insurer as a judgment debtor on the ground that the insurer is the real party in interest by virtue of its having taken an assignment of the rights and claims at issue in the case and litigated the case to final judgment.
subrogation 
in denying the motion,the trial court also commented that the assignment does not extend any rights to hearn insurers which they did not already possess under the operation of law.
second generation roofing suggests the court possibly had in mind here principles of insurance subrogation,and argues at some length that,if so,the point is irrelevant.it contends that regardless of what north american supposedly could have done,what it actually did was to take an assignment of rights from hearn and prosecute the rights assigned to it against second generation roofing in hearn name.
we agree.as previously explained,the transfer of hearn interests in the subcontracts made north american the real party in interest in this suit,and the existence of another potential remedy under subrogation principles is irrelevant to the application of section.second generation roofing also points out,correctly,that an insurer who pursues a subrogation claim steps into the shoes of its insured and,if unsuccessful,assumes the insured liability for contractual attorney fees to the prevailing party.see employers mutual liability ins.co tutor saliba cal th,allstate ins.loo th.so it would make little sense to refrain from making north american expressly liable for the attorney fees and costs awarded here based on the possibility north american might have pursued recovery against second generation roofing on a subrogation theory.
c.the trial court did not lack jurisdiction to amend the order.
the trial court also denied the motion on the ground that hearn notice of appeal from the june,attorney fees order divested the court of jurisdiction to amend the order to add north american as a judgment debtor.however,the earlier,april,award of costs was not appealed and so,at a minimum,the court could not have been divested of jurisdiction over it.
nor was the court divested of jurisdiction to amend the june,order.hearn appeal from that order was untimely and we have dismissed it.the automatic stay,when it applies,arises upon a duly perfected appeal.see sacks superior court cal d,see also.since hearn appeal was invalid,it did not affect the trial court jurisdiction to proceed.see central sav.bank lake cal,appeal from order ex parte kandarian cal,untimely appeal pazderka caballeros dimas alang,th,davis taliaferro d.
hearn new contentions on appeal 
finally,we come to a number of new arguments hearn has made on appeal in defense of the trial court ruling.
first,hearn argues the issue of amending these orders is not ripe because it has appealed the order awarding fees and costs.but the error of hearn contention is evident from the very authority it cites,pacific legal foundation california coastal com.cal d.as the supreme court explained in that case,the ripeness requirement prevent s judicial consideration of lawsuits that seek only to obtain general guidance,rather than to resolve specific legal disputes.id.at.it is rooted in the fundamental concept that the proper role of the judiciary does not extend to the resolution of abstract differences of legal opinion.ibid.while we agree with hearn that it would be a waste of judicial resources to consider altering a judgment to add a debtor if the court may dispose of the judgment entirely through hearn appeal seeking to reverse the judgment,that potential for mootness in no way renders these issues unripe.there is a present and existing,concrete dispute as to whether hearn insurer should be added to these orders.furthermore,as noted,we have now dismissed the other appeal as untimely,and so there is no longer even any potential that this appeal could become moot.
unreasonable delay 
reversing course from its position that it is premature for this court to address these issues,hearn also argues second generation roofing has waited too long to raise them.hearn contends second generation roofing unreasonably delayed more than four years after it knew of the assignment,and so the judgment should be affirmed under this court decision in alexander abbey of chimes d alexander.we held in alexander that a motion to amend a judgment to add a new judgment debtor under section must be timely made,and that waiting seven years to do so after the judgment became final,without explanation,was unreasonable.alexander,at pp.
alexander does not compel reversal.because hearn did not raise its delay theory below,it has been forfeited.see lachance valverde th.we also would reject the argument had it been preserved,because alexander does not apply and it also is distinguishable it arose under section,not section.a motion for substitution under former section may be granted after judgment has been entered,and even after an appeal has been taken.erickson boothe,supra,d.furthermore,the moving party in alexander waited seven years to file its motion under section after the judgment became final alexander,supra,d at second generation roofing moved far more quickly.it filed its motion to amend the two orders awarding attorney fees and costs only seven months after entry of the first order,and just five months after entry of the second order which is the ruling that determined the amount of attorney fees.this was reasonable.see in re levander cir,fn.
hearn belated attacks on the validity of the assignment 
for the first time on appeal,hearn also contends in scattershot fashion the purported assignment was invalid on a number of grounds.the position borders on frivolous,and also rests in large part on repeated violations of the rules of appellate briefing.
hearn never challenged the validity of the assignment below it merely urged the trial court to turn a blind eye to evidence of the assignment agreement when confronted with the stankowski declaration.so this theory has been waived.lachance valverde,supra,th at.
it also is untenable.hearn position on appeal contradicts binding judicial admissions in the first amended complaint that hearn assigned its rights under the subcontracts with the,including second generation roofing,to its insurers on august,and,moreover,that hearn insurers are asserting claims in this action in the name of the sic hearn assigned to them by hearn through operation of law the declaration of its board member,gordon stankowski,who swore under oath that i n my capacity as board member of hearn,i have personal knowledge of the assignment agreement dated august,which i entered into on behalf of hearn,and who also authenticated the assignment agreement as an agreement i entered into on behalf of hearn to assign the rights and interests of the subcontracts to north american specialty insurance company and rsui group,factual statements contained in the memorandum of points and authorities hearn filed below,which we have already described,acknowledging that hearn assigned some of its contractual rights to its insurers so they might pursue the subcontractors separately to recover their defense costs the trial court verbatim factual finding and,perhaps most egregiously,the sworn declaration by the very lawyer who signed hearn appellate brief,who declared under oath below that hearn defending insurers are suing in hearn name as transferees of hearn contractual indemnity rights hearn contention that the assignment is invalid,on any ground at all,is disingenuous.
again,if there was anything inaccurate about these positions hearn took in both its pleadings and in sworn statements of counsel,it perhaps might have proffered evidence in opposition to second generation roofing motion below to try to explain.but its attacks on the assignment validity at this late stage are based on nothing.no evidence whatsoever.
hearn also is wrong on the law.it argues that,at a minimum,the prevailing party attorney fee provision of the subcontract could not be validly assigned,because second generation roofing did execute the assignment agreement.in support,it cites civil code section,which states in relevant part the burden of an obligation may be transferred with the consent of the party entitled to its benefit,but not otherwise hearn misconstrues section.the provision is only intended to protect the party to be benefited from the effects of the assignment of an obligation.cutting packing packers exchange of california cal,italics added.it does not mean that without the other party consent an assignee can not assume contractual obligations,but simply that the assignor is not at the same time relieved of them.wiseman sklar.an assignor remains bound under the contract absent the consent to the assignment,but stands in the nature of a surety for the assignee for the performance of the obligation.cutting packing,at.hearn cites no authority holding the lack of a signature is fatal to an assignment.i n the absence of a statute or a contract provision to the contrary,there are no prescribed formalities that must be observed to make an effective assignment.it is sufficient if the assignor has,in some fashion,manifested an intention to make a present transfer of his rights to the assignee.amalgamated transit union,local,afl cio superior court cal th,italics added see,walmsley holcomb d,upholding assignment executed only by assignors.even oral assignments may be valid.see.here,as previously explained,hearn insurers are bound by their voluntary acceptance of the subcontract benefits.id.
hearn raises several other objections to the assignment,but none presented as any cognizable legal argument.it asserts,with no discussion,there is no evidence that stankowski was authorized to bind hearn to contracts.it also contends,with no citation to legal authority or to the record,that neither of the purported assignees ever received a copy of the assignment,nor did they ever assent to the assignment by executing or even orally agreeing to the assignment.as such,the purported assignment is invalid we disregard these points.they were not raised below see bardis oates th,fn.they are not supported by any citation to the record see dominguez financial indem.th,fn.cal.rules of court,rule a c they appear to be based upon matters outside the record see citizens opposing a dangerous environment county of kern th,fn.and with minor exception,they are not supported by any cogent argument or legal authority see,singh lipworth th,cahill san diego gas th.
in sum,we reject hearn belated attempts to challenge the assignment.
having determined that north american can not evade responsibility for being named as a judgment debtor,liable under the orders awarding fees and costs to second generating roofing,there remains the question of the appropriate remedy.
second generation roofing argues that t he real hearn also should remain liable
