a public entity awarded a public works contract to a contractor.although the contract documents required the contractor to provide a payment bond for the protection of its subcontractors,as required by law,the contractor did not provide a bond.the contractor began work on the project and failed to pay its subcontractors.the public entity subsequently terminated the contractor from the project,and the public works contract was assigned,with the consent of the public entity,to a replacement contractor.a subcontractor who had not been paid by the initial contractor brought suit against the public entity,alleging the public entity was liable for its negligence in allowing the initial contractor to commence work without having furnished a payment bond.the public entity acknowledged the initial contractor did not furnish a bond.however,the public entity sought judgment in its favor on the basis of a payment bond furnished by the replacement contractor when it,several months after the first contractor default,took over work on the public works contract.the trial court concluded the public entity had failed to establish the replacement contractor bond applied to claims of subcontractors whom the initial contractor had failed to pay.based on this ruling,the parties entered into a settlement for a stipulated judgment,providing for appellate court review of the trial court ruling.we agree with the trial court.the public entity also challenges the trial court ruling that the attorney fees incurred by the subcontractor in attempting to recover from other entities the amounts it was owed can be recovered as damages from the public entity under the tort of another theory.here,we agree with the public entity and conclude the trial court erred.we therefore modify the judgment to delete the award of attorney fees and otherwise affirm.
factual and procedural background 
los angeles unified school district lausd solicited proposals for local area network lan integration projects at various schools.for purposes of this project,lausd grouped clusters of schools into separate packages.in,lausd contracted with four different contractors,each of whom was given the contract for one or more packages.two of those contractors were wareforce,wareforce,and pacific bell telephone company,sbc datacomm sbc.
pursuant to their contracts with lausd,and pursuant to statute,the contractors were required to obtain payment bonds for the benefit of their subcontractors.wareforce failed to obtain a bond for its contract and lausd not only took no steps to force wareforce to do so,it allowed the work to commence on the project and even made payments to the contractor,all without it having complied with the bonding requirement.
after work commenced on the lan integration projects,wareforce failed to pay its subcontractors.ultimately,those subcontractors claimed wareforce owed them a total amount in excess of.included in that amount is approximately owed to electrical electronic control,eec,the eventual plaintiff in this action.
by may,eec had completed its work on the wareforce contract.in order to protect its right to payment,eec had served stop notices on lausd,requiring lausd to withhold from payments due wareforce sufficient funds to answer eec claims.numerous other subcontractors had also served stop notices on lausd with respect to wareforce failure to pay them.the record is not clear as to whether lausd withheld sufficient funds to pay the claims of all of wareforce subcontractors.
by july,it became clear that wareforce could not complete the packages it had contracted to complete.on july,an assignment agreement was executed by wareforce,sbc and lausd pursuant to which the parties agreed that wareforce would assign its contracts to sbc.however,sbc did not simply take over the terms of wareforce contracts.instead,the parties agreed that the terms of sbc previous contracts would apply.in other words,sbc would be assigned the contracts for wareforce packages,but the contracts would be amended to incorporate the terms and conditions governing the packages sbc had originally contracted to complete.the assignment included the right to any receivables wareforce had outstanding.the assignment agreement acknowledged that lausd was limited in its ability to make payments while stop notices remained in effect.therefore,sbc and wareforce agreed to use their best efforts to obtain appropriate releases bonds for those stop notices prior to seeking any additional payments.
while the record is not entirely clear,it appears that there were additional agreements between sbc and wareforce.sbc may have agreed to use wareforce as a subcontractor on some of the assigned packages.the record does not include the subcontract agreement but lausd did submit a partially executed rider to that agreement.the rider states that sbc had agreed to assume over of wareforce payables,which were enumerated in an attached appendix,and included the debt owed eec 
in october,sbc obtained two payment bonds from travelers casualty and surety company of america travelers.the bonds were intended to guarantee sbc payment of its subcontractors on the two lan installation projects sbc had undertaken.the first bond was intended to guarantee the work sbc had originally contracted to perform in july.the second bond,which is the bond at issue in this case,was clearly intended to guarantee the work sbc undertook to perform when it accepted the assignment of the wareforce contract.as we explain below,however,we are unable to conclude that the bond was intended to guarantee the performance of any other obligations sbc undertook via the assignment agreement,or any other contracts sbc simultaneously executed.rather,it appears that the bond was only intended to guarantee sbc payment of its subcontractors for the work it was to perform on the public improvement for lausd.
time passed,and eec remained unpaid.on november,eec contacted lausd and requested a certified copy of wareforce payment bond.on november,eec brought suit against wareforce,sbc,lausd and doe defendants.most of eec causes of action were against wareforce.as against sbc,eec alleged sbc agreed to assume eec payables and that it was a third party beneficiary of that agreement.as against lausd,eec sought to enforce its stop notices.on the chance that wareforce had obtained a payment bond,eec brought a cause of action on the bond against a doe defendant,indicating it would amend the complaint when lausd identified the surety.
in december,lausd informed eec that no payment bond was in existence,although in fact sbc had obtained and filed the bond,on which lausd would subsequently rely,in october.in august,eec brought the instant action against lausd,for breaching its mandatory duty to require wareforce to obtain a payment bond.the two cases were consolidated,although we will refer to the first action filed on november,as the underlying action.
sbc obtained a stop notice release bond.as a result,the stop notices were released and eec dismissed lausd from the underlying action.sbc then settled the underlying action with eec for an amount which was less than the amount owed eec by wareforce.as wareforce had filed bankruptcy proceedings,the underlying action was stayed against it.the underlying action was effectively terminated by sbc settlement.the only remaining litigation was eec current suit against lausd for negligently failing to require wareforce to obtain a payment bond.
eec also sought to recover its attorney fees in the underlying action as consequential damages in the instant action.lausd filed a motion to preclude eec recovery of attorney fees.eec argued that,had lausd not failed to require wareforce to post a payment bond,eec would have been able to recover against the bond and would not have had to pursue the underlying action.the trial court agreed,concluding that attorney fees may be recoverable as damages under the tort of another doctrine,and indicated this would be a matter for the jury.
the case proceeded toward trial.on august,one week before trial,a hearing was held.at the hearing,lausd indicated,for the first time,that it had recently discovered that there was,in fact,an applicable payment bond.the parties agreed the issue would have to be briefed.
on august,lausd filed its motion for judgment on the pleadings or to dismiss or,alternatively,to try legal issue of coverage under payment bond.lausd took the position that a bond had been obtained on the public works project in question,and that,therefore,lausd did not breach its duty to require a bond.however,the bond on which lausd relied had not been obtained by wareforce.instead,lausd relied on the bond which had been obtained by sbc from travelers in october,a few months after wareforce default and the assignment of its contract to sbc.the bond was intended to guarantee payment for all labor and material used or reasonably required for use in the performance of the contract.the contract was defined as a written agreement dated july,a contract with lausd for lausd ii fiber lan project according to the declaration of charles sprick,an lausd employee,the term lausd ii was used to refer to the contracts for the packages originally contracted to wareforce and subsequently assigned to sbc,to distinguish them from lausd i,the contract for the original packages sbc agreed to complete.
eec opposed the motion on various grounds,including that the bond did not cover work performed prior to its issuance and that the bond had nothing to do with wareforce lausd responded that the public works project for the packages originally assigned to wareforce is an indivisible whole,and that once sbc accepted the assignment,it stood in wareforce shoes,and its payment bond therefore applied to the entire project.
the trial court denied lausd motion.the trial court concluded lausd did not present sufficient evidence for the trial court to conclude,as a matter of law,that the bond applied to wareforce defaults.
based on the trial court ruling,the parties stipulated to entry of judgment.the parties agreed that eec was entitled to in damages,including for attorney fees in the underlying action.the parties stipulated to entry of judgment for eec in the amount of.the parties further agreed that lausd would appeal the trial court rulings regarding whether the bond covered eec claim and whether eec was entitled to attorney fees as damages the parties agreed to pay their own costs on appeal.
judgment was entered accordingly.lausd filed a timely notice of appeal.
contentions of the parties 
lausd contends the october,bond issued by travelers to sbc provides coverage for eec claim it was not paid by wareforce,based on the terms of the bond itself and the law regarding payment bonds.eec,on the other hand,contends that the bond covers only claims by subcontractors who provided work for sbc after the assignment,and does not retroactively reach wareforce defaults.the parties also dispute whether eec is entitled to damages for its attorney fees under the tort of another theory.
discussion 
standard of review 
although lausd dispositive motion sought alternative remedies,its purpose was clear to seek a determination as a matter of law that the october bond obtained by sbc provided coverage for eec claim against wareforce and therefore satisfied lausd statutory duty to require a payment bond.similarly,lausd appeals an adverse determination on its motion precluding eec from recovering attorney fees as a component of damages.as these are questions of law,our standard of review is de novo.fong westly th,d.
legal framework 
t he distinction between public and private works is due to the principle of sovereign immunity which precludes recordation of mechanic liens on public works.citations.subcontractors and material suppliers on public improvement projects have as remedies stop notices citations and actions on payment bonds.capitol steel fabricators,mega construction th,d.the remedies are cumulative a claimant may pursue either.id.at,d.
a payment bond may be filed with respect to a private work.however,such bonds are mandatory with respect to public works.every original contractor to whom is awarded a contract by a public entity involving an expenditure in excess of thousand dollars for any public work shall,before entering upon the performance of the work,file a payment bond with and approved by the officer or public entity by whom the contract was awarded,subd.a italics added.an original contractor is any contractor who has a direct contractual relationship with the owner.the bond must be in a sum not less than one hundred percent of the total amount payable by the terms of the contract.a contract is an agreement between an owner and any original contractor providing for the work of improvement or any part thereof.in other words,every contractor who directly contracts with a public entity to provide a work of improvement,or part of one,is required to file a payment bond in the amount of the contract price,when that price exceeds.
the public entity is statutorily mandated to require the contractor to provide a bond,when a bond is necessary.the public entity also has the duty to determine whether the surety on the bond is an admitted surety insurer,and to investigate the sufficiency of the bond.walt rankin associates,city of murrieta th,d walt rankin.if the public entity fails in these duties,subcontractors who are unable to recover against the insufficient bond have a cause of action against the public entity.id.at,d.in walt rankin,the city required the contractor,a s part of the bid solicitation process and the award of the contract,to provide a payment bond.the contractor provided a payment bond from red sea,a foreign lending institution,and a statement from california secretary of state acknowledging that red sea had filed its annual statement showing its address for service of process.id.at,d.the city accepted the bond without any further inquiry.when the contractor failed to pay its subcontractor,it was discovered that red sea was not licensed as a surety and was not a corporation authorized to do business in california when the unpaid subcontractor sued the city for failing to perform its statutory duty,the trial court ruled that the city had no duty to investigate the surety on a payment bond.on appeal,the division two of the fourth appellate district disagreed.reading civil code section in conjunction with the bond and undertaking law code civ,et,the court concluded that the public entity had a mandatory duty to require that the payment bond be executed by an admitted surety insurer and to exercise reasonable diligence to investigate the sufficiency of the surety.walt rankin associates,city of murrieta,supra,th at,d.i f the city had properly determined that red sea was not an admitted surety insurer as it had a duty to do,the city would have been required to reject red sea as surety and the contractor as well unless and until the latter came up with a payment bond properly provided by an admitted surety insurer or by otherwise sufficient sureties.therefore,because the city did not comply with its duty to determine whether red sea was an admitted surety insurer,its breach of that duty proximately resulted in the subcontractor injuries,nonpayment of the remainder due under its subcontract.id.at,d.
if a public entity is liable to an unpaid subcontractor for proceeding with a public works contract when it has failed to make certain the contractor provided a payment bond from an admitted surety insurer,it follows that a public entity is equally liable for proceeding with a public works contract when it has failed to make certain the contractor provided a payment bond entirely.in this case,lausd proceeded with the wareforce contract without requiring wareforce to provide a bond,in violation of civil code section and the duty set forth in walt rankin.additionally,lausd paid wareforce on the contract,although no bond had been filed,in violation of civil code section.it therefore appears clear that lausd violated its duties to wareforce subcontractors when lausd allowed wareforce to commence work on the project and paid wareforce long before sbc ever obtained the bond on which lausd now seeks to rely.
interpretation of a payment bond
