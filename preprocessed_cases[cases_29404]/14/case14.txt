this appeal requires us to determine which of two commercial general liability cgl insurance policies should be considered primary for coverage of a claim arising from an accident at a construction site in portland,maine.at the time of the subject claim,wright ryan construction,wright ryan was insured under its own cgl insurance policy,issued by acadia insurance company acadia,and appeared as an additional insured on a subcontractor cgl policy,issued by aig commercial insurance of canada aig.wright ryan and acadia filed a complaint for a declaratory judgment that aig was obligated to defend wright ryan and for compensation of costs incurred by acadia in wright ryan defense.on for summary judgment,the district court granted judgment in aig favor,holding that acadia cgl policy provided primary coverage for the accident claim,with the aig policy affording solely excess coverage.
appealing from this grant of summary judgment,wright ryan and acadia contend that the district court erred as a matter of law in its interpretation of the other insurance clauses of the two cgl policies,which govern priority of coverage between overlapping insurance policies.according to plaintiffs,a proper reading of these other insurance clauses dictates that the aig policy be deemed primary.we agree and therefore reverse.
the salient details of this insurance dispute are uncontested.wright ryan,a maine construction company,was hired by the university of southern maine as the general contractor for the construction of a building known as university commons.wright ryan in turn subcontracted with the canadian company norgate metal,norgate for the fabrication and erection of structural steel for the project.although wright ryan had its own cgl insurance policy,wright ryan required norgate,as a condition of the subcontract,to obtain cgl insurance for the university commons project in the amount of million and name wright ryan as an additional insured on the policy.norgate procured the requisite coverage through aig which issued a certificate of liability insurance to wright ryan and the university of southern maine naming them additional insureds to norgate policy,providing insurance coverage on a primary and basis for all liability arising out of norgate premises or operations.
in august,thomas behrens,an employee of a company hired by norgate to assist with the erection of structural steel,tripped while dismounting from a ladder at the construction site and fell through an unguarded stair opening.behrens fell four stories and landed on wet pavement at ground level,suffering serious injuries.a little over six months later,behrens filed suit against wright ryan in maine superior court for negligence in connection with the accident.norgate and behrens employer were joined as defendants in a later amended complaint.
upon receipt of the complaint,wright ryan sent a letter to norgate and aig tendering to them the defense of the behrens suit under norgate cgl policy.with no response forthcoming from either aig or norgate,wright ryan cgl carrier,acadia,assumed responsibility for the company defense.acadia succeeded in settling the suit against all three defendants for in.
wright ryan and acadia filed a complaint for declaratory judgment against aig in late in the federal court for the district of maine,seeking a declaration that aig was obligated to defend wright ryan in the behrens lawsuit.following settlement of the behrens lawsuit,wright ryan and acadia amended their complaint to seek reimbursement for the settlement payment and over of attorney fees incurred in wright ryan defense.
the parties each moved for summary judgment,and the matter was submitted to a magistrate judge for review.the magistrate judge recommended decision reached two key conclusions.first,it concluded that behrens accident arose out of norgate premises or operations,and thus wright ryan was entitled to coverage under norgate aig policy.second,it concluded that the aig policy was excess to wright ryan acadia policy for purposes of the behrens claim.because the amount expended to defend and settle the behrens suit was well within the limits of the acadia policy which the magistrate judge concluded to be primary coverage for the behrens claim the magistrate judge recommended that aig motion for summary judgment be granted.adopting the magistrate judge recommended decision in its entirety,the district court judge entered judgment against acadia and wright ryan.
this timely appeal followed.
the issue in this appeal is straightforward.aig has not challenged the district court holding that wright ryan is entitled to coverage for the behrens claim under its policy.the sole and determinative question is whether the district court correctly held wright ryan acadia cgl policy to be primary and the aig policy excess.reviewing the court legal construction of the insurance contracts de novo,see penn am.ins.lavigne,cir,we arrive at the opposite conclusion.
under maine law,which the parties agree governs the interpretation of the insurance policies here,the paramount principle in the construction of contracts is to give effect to the intention of the parties as gathered from the language of the agreement viewed in the light of all the circumstances under which it was made.greenly mariner mgmt.group,cir quoting whit shaw assocs.wardwell,me internal quotation marks omitted.unambiguous provisions in insurance contracts,as with any other contract,must be interpreted as written,giving force to their plain meaning.id.citing jack tracy,me.the mere fact of a dispute over the meaning of a particular provision does not render that provision ambiguous it will be so deemed only when an ordinary person would not understand that the provision has a single accepted meaning.id.
to untangle the priority of the acadia and aig policies,we focus on a provision entitled other insurance,present in near identical form in both contracts.these provisions are not unique to the insurance contracts at issue here.other insurance provisions are a standard element of liability insurance policies,intended to govern the relationship between and obligations of insurers whose policies provide overlapping coverage for the same claim or loss.see lee russ thomas segalla,couch on insurance ed.there is just such an overlap here.wright ryan has coverage for the behrens claim under both the acadia policy and the aig policy.wright ryan is a party to and appears as the named insured on the acadia policy,and,while not a party to the aig policy,wright ryan has been added as an additional insured to that policy for all liability arising out of norgate premises or operations.thus,we look to the policies other insurance provisions to determine which of these coverages is primary.
other insurance provisions typically take one of three forms an escape clause,which completely denies coverage when other insurance is available a pro rata clause,which operates to share coverage of a claimed loss with other available insurance policies or an excess clause,which extends coverage for a claim only when other insurance available for the claim has been exhausted.see home ins.paul fire marine ins,cir.the provisions at issue here are of the third,excess variety.the relevant portions of the two provisions read as follows 
primary insurance 
this insurance is primary except when,below,applies 
excess insurance 
this insurance is excess over 
any of the other insurance,whether primary,excess,contingent,or on any other basis a that is coverage for your work 
any other primary insurance available to you covering liability for damages arising out of the premises or operations for which you have been added as an additional insured by attachment of an endorsement.
when this insurance is excess,we will have no duty to defend the insured against any suit if any other insurer has a duty to defend the insured against that suit.
the above language renders the policies excess in two situations where there exists another insurance policy covering your work,a term defined in both the aig and acadia policies as w ork or operations performed by you or on your behalf and where there exists ano
