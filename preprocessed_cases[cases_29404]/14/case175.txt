century asphalt materials,llc,sold construction materials to contractor technology,a general contractor for the state of texas.contractor technology paid century but before the checks cleared,the contractor filed for bankruptcy.the bankruptcy court held that contractor technology payments to century were unauthorized transfers and ordered that century return the payments to the trustee.on summary judgment,the court,after returning the parties to the positions they were in when the checks were delivered,held that century had with this reset of time perfected its bond claims for the materials.century had sent the claims to paul travelers insurance company,contractor technology surety,after it had returned the payments to the trustee.paul appealed to the district court,which reversed.century appealed.
in march,century delivered materials to contractor technology,a contractor involved in various public works improvement projects for the state of texas.contractor technology had retained paul as a surety to provide payment bonds for its suppliers.as payment for the materials,contractor technology issued its first check for to century on april,and its second check for on may.these checks cleared on may and,but not before contractor technology filed for bankruptcy on may.contractor technology chapter trustee filed an adversary proceeding against century on november,urging that the checks were unauthorized transfers realizing that under the bankruptcy proceeding it might have to relinquish the payments that it had received from contractor technologies,on december,century filed a complaint against paul in bankruptcy court.on july,the bankruptcy court avoided and rescinded contractor technology transfers to century,as century had feared it would do.the trustee and century disputed the actual amount due and settled at.on august,the bankruptcy court issued an order approving compromise and settlement requiring century to pay and to the trustee within ten days of the order.the order stated,
on the date that the first settlement payment is delivered to the trustee the first repayment date,the parties are returned to their respective positions as they existed on may,with respect to the obligations owed by the debtor to century asphalt that were originally satisfied any and all applicable deadlines existing on may,with respect to the claim satisfied by the delivery of the first check shall continue to run from the first repayment date.
the order contained identical language for the second check,replacing first repayment date with second repayment date and may,with april.having returned the payments it originally received,century then attempted to obtain payment for the materials by making a bond claim.on august,century sent notice and a sworn statement of account to paul pursuant to the procedures required for bond claims under texas government code chapter,also known as the mcgregor act 
paul filed a motion for summary judgment with the bankruptcy court,arguing,inter alia,that century had failed to meet the act notice requirements with respect to timing.section of the act,notice required for claim for payment for labor or material,provides in relevant part,
a to recover in a suit under section on a payment bond for a claim for payment for public work labor performed or public work material delivered,a payment bond beneficiary must mail to the prime contractor and the surety written notice of the claim.
b the notice must be mailed on or before the day of the third month after each month in which any of the claimed labor was performed or any of the claimed material was delivered.
c the notice must be accompanied by a sworn statement of account that states in substance 
the amount claimed is just and correct and 
all just and lawful offsets,payments,and credits known to the affiant have been allowed 
paul maintained that because century delivered the materials in march,under the act it was required to provide notice of a bond claim on or before june,the fifteenth day of the third month after the materials were delivered,and that it failed to meet this deadline.paul further argued that century had failed to meet several of the act substantive notice requirements and that century could not claim the broad protections contained within the act for material suppliers to state contractors,as it was requesting funds that had been transferred in bankruptcy,not reimbursement for defaulted materials payments.finally,it asserted that the bond claim failed because century asphalt has already been paid and therefore,it can not satisfy the texas government code for recovery on a bond claim.in other words,it urged that bond claims under the mcgregor act are for defaulted payments,not payments made and later rescinded in bankruptcy.
century filed a cross motion for summary judgment,asserting that it had met all of the act substantive requirements.its central argument was that the bankruptcy court avoidance of the payments brought the parties back to their original positions,making century an unpaid supplier subject to the act broad protections.century maintained that its bond notice of august,was timely because the bankruptcy court order provided that applicable deadlines for claims originally satisfied by delivery of the checks would run from the dates on which century had to return the money to the repayment dates.in other words,pursuant to the court order the repayment dates became the dates when contractor technology defaulted on its payments to century.because century furnished the bond notice within three days of the repayment date,century argued,it furnished bond notice well within chapter window.century also argued that texas courts have held that chapter should be liberally construed,that the act only requires substantial compliance,and that the texas legislature intended for the act to protect material suppliers like century.in a footnote,century urged the court to apply equitable tolling because chapter limitations would effectively bar century asphalt,through no fault of its own,from seeking to recover on the payment bonds 
the bankruptcy court denied paul motion for summary judgment and granted century cross motion.its holding rested on two central points of reasoning.first,the court held that in determining a bond beneficiary compliance with the notice requirements of chapter,substantial compliance is considered all that is necessary to properly perfect a claim.the court determined that because it avoided contractor technology payments to century for materials,contractor technology payments were payments that never occurred.therefore,the repayment dates the dates on which the court ordered century to return the payments to the the dates on which contractor technology failed to pay century for its materials.under the bankruptcy court reasoning,century need only have provided notice of a bond claim to paul on the fifteenth day of the third month after century returned the funds to the trustee.the bankruptcy court concluded that it would consider century as never having been paid for its public work material provided and that,as a result,century falls within the bounds of requesting payment from the surety as provided by chapter.
the bankruptcy court second line of reasoning rested on equitable tolling.it observed that 
the present case may be differentiated from traditional equitable tolling in that equitable tolling deals with the tolling of statutes of limitation.the notice requirement under the mcgregor act is not a statute of limitation.it is a statutorily defined condition precedent to filing a bond claim.
the bankruptcy court held that although chapter notice requirement is not a statute of limitation,it could apply equitable tolling to further the mcgregor act purpose of protecting entities that provide materials and labor to texas public works projects.it also concluded that equitable tolling was applicable because t he present case certainly falls within the category of extraordinary circumstances making it impossible for plaintiff to timely assert his claim.
paul appealed,and the district court reversed,remanding to the bankruptcy court for entry of
