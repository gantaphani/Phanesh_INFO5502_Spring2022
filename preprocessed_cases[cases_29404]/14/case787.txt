the city of american canyon city adopted a mitigated negative declaration for a development project that was to be constructed in two phases.after the negative declaration and the project approval became final,the developer changed the size and type of retail development proposed for phase two of the project,replacing a shopping center with a supercenter that combined a discount store and a full grocery store.the city approved the supercenter proposal without requiring supplemental environmental review under the california environmental quality act ceqa pub.resources code,et or a major modification approval or conditional use permit under its zoning ordinance.
we conclude that the city prejudicially violated ceqa.first,the city unreasonably minimized the size increase in the phase two retail component.that error fatally undermined the validity of the city updated traffic analysis.the city determination that the project changes would not substantially increase the project impact on traffic is not supported by substantial evidence.second,the city failed to proceed as required by law when it refused to consider the extraterritorial effects of the proposed supercenter,specifically the urban decay effects that might result from store closures in neighboring cities caused by economic competition from the supercenter.
we also conclude that the city prejudicially violated its zoning ordinance by approving the supercenter without approving a major modification application.we reject the appellants other claims of zoning ordinance violations.
background 
master plan approval in 
on july,lake street ventures developer applied for land use approvals for a development called napa junction project project to be located on a site on highway in american canyon the project consisted of three main components,a hotel,residences with a park,and retail space.the developer planned to develop the project in two phases of approximately acres each.phase one consisted of approximately square feet of retail space,the hotel and the multifamily housing.phase two added about square feet of retail space in various size buildings and pad sites on the northern half of the property.
with its application for design permit of phase one,the developer submitted a site plan and a landscape plan.the site plan showed a detailed layout of the phase one area,but the phase two area was simply a blank space with the notations sf developable area and a future road indicated by dotted lines running north to south.the project landscape plan,on the other hand,showed a detailed layout for phase two,which included a roadway,parking areas,and at least eight retail buildings or pads.
in october,the city issued an initial study and mitigated negative declaration of environmental impact mnd.the mnd incorporated the project site plan,which showed an essentially blank phase two area.the mnd also incorporated a traffic study mnd traffic study,which analyzed site access to and internal circulation within the project based on the landscape plan,which showed a detailed layout for the phase two area.
in accord with the planning commission recommendation,the city council adopted the mnd and approved the project in december by adopting a zoning ordinance and map amendment,a general plan amendment,and a tentative map.
supercenter proposal in 
in july and august,applied for a design permit and a sign program for the proposed construction of a supercenter in the phase two area of the project.the proposed supercenter would operate seven days a week,hours a day and would include a full service grocery department in addition to a general merchandise department.the planning commission staff reported,the proposed site plan would locate an approximately building and a outdoor garden center on a site at the northeast corner of the napa junction property,separated by a parking lot from highway.an outdoor seasonal event sales area of square feet is proposed in the parking lot near the southern building entrance and would occupy parking spaces when in use.the remaining portion of phase ii at the southeast corner of highway and napa junction road is reserved for future uses and will be subject to separate design review.
public concern about the proposed supercenter emerged almost immediately.american canyon community united for responsible growth appellant formed and demanded ceqa review.city staff advised the planning commission that further ceqa review was unnecessary the subject project includes square feet of commercial uses excluding the stockroom,employee use area and seasonal events sales area,which when added to the square feet of commercial uses currently planned for phase i,is consistent with the square feet evaluated by the mitigated negative declaration for the entire napa junction project.because there are no substantial changes that have occurred that would require revisions to the mitigated negative declaration,further california environmental quality act documentation is not needed.following a public hearing and the receipt of conflicting legal opinion letters from the city attorney and appellant,the planning commission approved the supercenter on the condition that the hours be restricted to to midnight.the commission found that further environmental review of the project was not required.
appellant appealed the commission decision to the city council,and appealed the restriction on its operating hours.the city manager provided the city council with a fiscal impact report analyzing the costs and revenues the city could expect if the supercenter proposal went forward.in response,appellant submitted its own expert study of the economic effects of the supercenter,which included regional store closures that could lead to urban decay.appellant also submitted several studies of the effects of supercenter development in other areas of the country.
city staff released a revised trip generation analysis for the project,which evaluated the number of vehicle trips that would be generated by the project if it included the supercenter.using as the square footage of the supercenter,the analysis projected traffic at levels below those projected in the mnd traffic study.appellant responded by submitting its own traffic studies that concluded the project with the supercenter would generate significantly more traffic than had been projected in the mnd traffic study.
following public hearings,the city council approved the design permit application and sign program and reversed the planning commission restriction on the supercenter operating hours.the city issued a notice of determination that the project would not have a significant effect on the environment.
trial court proceedings 
appellant filed a petition for writ of mandate in the superior court seeking revocation of the city approval of the supercenter proposal.appellant argued the approval violated ceqa and the city zoning ordinance.citizens against poor planning,an organization that formed after the supercenter was approved,and stacy su collectively,citizen appellants also filed a petition for a writ of mandate challenging the supercenter approval and also asserted ceqa and zoning ordinance violations.the actions were consolidated in the superior court.
the trial court denied the petitions.it concluded that the city determination that no supplemental environmental review was necessary was supported by substantial evidence in the administrative record.on the alleged zoning ordinance violations,the court found either that the city complied with the ordinance or that its noncompliance was nonprejudicial.
both petitioners appealed.appellant raises several ceqa issues and argues the city prejudicially violated its zoning ordinance.the city filed a protective arguing it did not violate its zoning ordinance.citizen appellants filed an appeal that focuses on a single ceqa issue,whether the city violated ceqa by failing to consider impacts.while the appeals were pending,appellant filed two petitions for writs of supersedeas seeking stays of construction of the supercenter.this court denied both petitions and expedited briefing of the appeals.
discussion 
after discussing the applicable standard of review,we address the ceqa issues raised on appeal and then proceed to the zoning ordinance issues.
standard of review 
judicial review in an administrative mandamus action is limited to ascertaining whether the respondent has proceeded without,or in excess of jurisdiction whether there was a fair trial and whether there was any prejudicial abuse of discretion.abuse of discretion is established if the respondent has not proceeded in the manner required by law,the order or decision is not supported by the findings,or the findings are not supported by the evidence.code civ,subd.b.this standard governs our review of the city compliance with ceqa and with its zoning ordinance.lucas valley homeowners county of marin d.lucas valley code civ,pub.resources code,see also bowman city of petaluma d,fn.same standard of review under.
the scope of our review is identical with that of the superior court.desmond county of contra costa th,d.we examine all relevant evidence in the entire record,considering both the evidence that supports the administrative decision and the evidence against it,in order to determine whether or not the findings of the agency are supported by substantial evidence.id.at,d.substantial evidence is evidence of ponderable legal significance,reasonable in nature,credible,and of solid value,evidence that a reasonable mind might accept as adequate to support a conclusion.ibid.the burden is on the appellant to show there is no substantial evidence to support the findings of the agency.id.at,d.
ii.ceqa issues 
after providing an overview of the relevant legal standards under ceqa,we address and reject appellant argument that section does not govern our review because phase two is a new project.we then apply the standards of section,considering first whether the city accurately identified the changes in the project second,whether the project changes would have a substantially increased effect on traffic and third,whether the city violated ceqa by refusing to consider possible extraterritorial urban decay effects of the supercenter.
when a local agency intends to carry out or approve a project covered by ceqa,the agency must prepare and certify the completion of an environmental impact report eir if the project may have a significant effect on the environment,subd.a.an eir is required whenever it can be fairly argued on the basis of substantial evidence that the project may have significant environmental impact.citations.friends of davis city of davis th,d.when,on the other hand,t here is no substantial evidence,in light of the whole record before the lead agency,that the project may have a significant effect on the environment,the lead agency must prepare a negative declaration to that effect,subd.c guidelines,subd.f.the agency must prepare a mitigated negative declaration when a n initial study identifies potentially significant effects on the environment,but a revisions in the project plans or proposals made by,or agreed to by,the applicant before the proposed negative declaration and initial study are released for public review would avoid the effects or mitigate the effects to a point where clearly no significant effect on the environment would occur,and b there is no substantial evidence,in light of the whole record before the lead agency,that the project,as revised,may have a significant effect on the environment,subd.c guidelines,subd.f.
as noted above,the city adopted an mnd for the project and approved the project in.since the time limitations for challenging the mnd have expired,the city compliance with ceqa at that stage of the proceedings is conclusively presumed.appellants do not contest the city compliance with ceqa when it approved the project in.
when an agency has prepared an eir,it shall not require a subsequent or supplemental eir to be prepared unless,as relevant here,substantial changes are proposed in the project which will require major revisions of the environmental impact report,subd.a.although the statute speaks only in terms of the eir,ceqa guidelines apply section to project changes following an agency adoption of a negative declaration or a mitigated negative declaration as well as an eir,and this interpretation has been upheld.guidelines,benton board of supervisors d.
guidelines section provides in part a when a negative declaration has been adopted for a project,no subsequent eir shall be prepared for that project unless the lead agency determines,on the basis of substantial evidence in the light of the whole record,one or more of the following substantial changes are proposed in the project which will require major revisions of the previous negative declaration due to the involvement of new significant environmental effects or a substantial increase in the severity of previously identified significant effects b if changes to a project occur after adoption of a negative declaration,the lead agency shall prepare a subsequent eir if required under subdivision a.otherwise the lead agency shall determine whether to prepare a subsequent negative declaration,an addendum,or no further documentation.
section and guidelines section hereafter,collectively referred to as section represent a shift in the applicable policy considerations.the low threshold for requiring the preparation of an eir in the first instance is no longer applicable instead,agencies are prohibited from requiring further environmental review unless the stated conditions are met.citation.friends of davis,supra,th at,d.s ection comes into play precisely because review has already occurred,the time for challenging the sufficiency of the original eir has long since expired,subd.c,and the question is whether circumstances have changed enough to justify repeating a substantial portion of the process.bowman,supra,d at.
the issue before us is whether,in light of the whole record,there is substantial evidence to support the city determination that the proposed changes in the project would not create significant new or substantially increased environmental effects requiring major revisions in the mnd or preparation of an eir.see guidelines,a snarled traffic obstructs progress city and county of san francisco th,d.
section applies 
as a preliminary matter,we conclude section governed whether further environmental review of the supercenter proposal was required under ceqa.appellant argues that the project is not subject to section because the supercenter proposal was essentially a new project,not a change in the original project.
in support of its argument,appellant relies on sierra club county of sonoma th,d.sierra club discussed section in the context of tiered eirs.sierra club,at,d.a separate statutory scheme within ceqa governs tiered eirs.tiered eirs are used when an agency prepares a program eir for an extensive land use proposal that will encompass multiple projects.sierra club,at,d.an eir is required for a project within the larger program if the project may cause significant effects on the environment.id.at,d.this standard applies unless the agency determines the project is subject to section.sierra club,at,d,subd.b.in the context of tiered eirs,sierra club held that section governed only when the question is whether more than one eir must be prepared for what is essentially the same project.sierra club,at,d,emphasis added.the project at issue was a proposal to change the mining and agricultural use designations for specific parcels of land and to allow mining on one of the newly designated mining parcels.the court held that this project was not essentially the same as the proposal considered in the program eir,a proposed management plan for gravel and hardrock mining.id.at,d.thus,section did not apply.sierra club,at,d.
here,the supercenter proposal was not a specific application of a larger management plan that was evaluated in a program eir.rather,it was a proposed change from a shopping center to a supercenter in phase two of the same multiuse development that was evaluated in the mnd.this project change is comparable to the project changes held to be subject to section in several appellate court decisions the reconfiguration of a medical research and laboratory complex in fund for environmental defense county of orange d.the modification of a proposed subdivision in bowman,supra,d.and the relocation of a winery in benton,supra,d.sierra club,supra,th at,d.section applies to the project change.
b.the city did not accurately identify the changes to the project 
the first step in determining whether supplemental environmental review is required under section is to identify the changes in the project that were not considered in the original environmental review document.aspects of the project that were known at the time of the mnd are not subject to our review because the mnd,even if flawed,is final and not subject to reconsideration.the parties disagree about how the supercenter proposal differed from the original project.we conclude that the supercenter proposal substantially changed the type and size of the retail component of phase two.
identity of tenant 
preliminarily,we reject respondents assertion that this appeal is fundamentally a challenge to the identity of the tenant in phase two,rather than to the nature of the development.the identity of a tenant is irrelevant to ceqa review.maintain our desert environment town of apple valley th,d.here,appellants base their argument on the particular type of retail use proposed,a supercenter consisting of a discount store combined with a full grocery store,rather than the identity of the company that plans to operate the supercenter.it may be that is the only company that operates supercenters in this region,but that fact does not convert appellants arguments into a challenge to the identity of the tenant.
it also may be that appellants are motivated by opposition to policies that are unrelated to the environmental effects of this proposed supercenter development.those motivations are also irrelevant to our analysis.as the fifth district declared in a similar ceqa case challenging the construction of a supercenter,we give no weight to insinuations that is a destructive economic force inherently inferior to smaller merchants,or that community organizations opposing are front organizations defending the narrow economic interests of unionized workers or economic competitors.w e have no underlying ideological agenda and have strictly adhered to the accepted principle that the judicial system has a narrow role in land use battles that are fought through ceqa actions.bakersfield citizens for local control city of bakersfield th,d.our role is to decide whether there is substantial evidence in light of the whole record to support the city determination that this supercenter proposal would not have significant new or substantially increased effects on the environment requiring major revisions in the mnd or preparation of an eir.
change in type of retail use 
the city attorney argued to the superior court that the character of the retail development in phase two had not changed the real land use was determined in december of.the footprint was clearly established.it was known to be a big box store.somewhat weakly revives the point on appeal.the record does not support the argument.
the original project proposal stated,phase two will complete the smaller retail buildings and pad sites along the highway frontage as well as add larger retail box tenants deeper into the north east quadrant of the site.the landscape plan depicted three adjoining box stores at the east end of the phase two area and smaller retail pads on the northern and eastern edges of the site.by visual comparison,the box stores each appear to be less than the size of the proposed supercenter.there was no indication that these box stores would encompass a full grocery in addition to a discount merchandise outlet,or that they would operate seven days a week,hours a day.
a supercenter is a unique type of retail operation.when the particular type of retail business planned for a proposed project will have unique or additional adverse impacts,then disclosure of the type of business is necessary in order to accurately recognize and analyze the environmental effects that will result from the proposed project.a rendering plant has different environmental impacts than a chandler.in the retail context,supercenters are similarly unique.unlike the vast majority of stores,many supercenters operate hours per day seven days a week.such extended operational hours raise questions concerning increased or additional adverse impacts relating to lights,noise,traffic and crime.bakersfield citizens for local control,supra,th at,d.there is also evidence in the record that supercenters draw from a larger regional market than more typical shopping centers with the same total square footage of retail space and thus may have unique traffic impacts.
change in size of retail component 
the most significant change in the project was the increase in the square footage of retail space in the phase two area.the building represented a percent increase in the size of the retail component of the phase two area,originally projected to be square feet of retail space.the city own zoning ordinance,by way of comparison,classifies a percent increase in the square footage of an approved structure a major modification of a project.american canyon zoning ord.hereafter,zoning ord,subd.b.
the city staff reports,the developer drawings,and letters clearly stated that the proposed supercenter would consist of a building,a outdoor garden center,and a seasonal sales area,for a total of square feet.the city council resolution approving the supercenter proposal acknowledged these physical dimensions.nevertheless,the staff reported to the planning commission that the proposal resulted in a net decrease in the square footage of retail space in the project as compared to the original master plan the subject project includes square feet of commercial uses excluding the stockroom,employee use area and seasonal events sales area,which when added to the square feet of commercial uses currently planned for phase i,is consistent with the square feet evaluated by the mnd.emphasis added.the city attorney similarly informed the planning commission,the total project square footage including non napa junction buildings would total square feet,which is approximately square feet less than the total square footage evaluated by the mnd and excludes approximately square feet of stockroom and employee use area.emphasis added.the city attorney concluded that the net decrease in retail square footage meant there was no substantial change in the project requiring supplemental environmental review under section.the planning commission adopted this analysis.the city council acknowledged the physical dimensions of the supercenter,but concluded there were no substantial changes in the project that would require revisions to the mnd.appellant repeatedly objected to the city square footage analysis during the administrative proceedings.
the city provided no reasoned basis for excluding some areas of the proposed supercenter for purposes of evaluating changes in the size of the project retail component.on appeal,the city and defend the city staff square footage analysis as consistent with a definition of gross leasable area in the city general plan.the definition of gross leasable area appears in the economic development element of the general plan.respondents provide no explanation why this definition is relevant to whether size changes in the project were significant for purposes of environmental or other land use planning review.
even assuming the definition is relevant,it does not support the city analysis.the general plan defines gross leasable area as the total gross floor area designed for tenants occupancy and exclusive use.it is the area for which tenants pay rent and the area that produces income.the storage and employee use areas of the supercenter building would be occupied by the tenant for the exclusive use of their agents and employees.the tenant would pay rent for those areas.storage and employee use areas help to produce income because they provide a supply of merchandise to sell and of employees to do the selling.
the city exclusion of storage and employee use square footage is arbitrary for an additional reason.in its initial evaluation of the project,the city relied on the square footage of retail space indicated on the project plans,without making adjustments for storerooms and employee use areas.by making adjustments in the square footage of the supercenter proposal and then comparing that adjusted square footage to the unadjusted square footage of retail space in the original project,the city makes an inapt comparison.the city cites no evidence and makes no argument to justify using different methods of calculating the square footage of the supercenter and the other retail spaces.absent such a foundation,the city comparison is distorted and can not support the conclusion that the square footage of the project retail component did not materially change.
courts have acknowledged that an increase in the size of a development project can be a substantial change triggering subsequent environmental review.concerned citizens of costa mesa,dist.agricultural cal d.in fund for environmental defense,supra,d,the court rejected an argument that a size increase triggered subsequent environmental review,but the case is distinguishable.in that case,the agency acknowledged and evaluated the size increase the increase in square footage was offset by an insignificant change in the project footprint and a decrease in the height of the overall project and the agency reasonably concluded the increase would not affect the project traffic impacts or otherwise require revisions in the original eir.id.at.here,the city minimized the size increase the increase in square footage was not offset by stability in the project footprint or reductions in its height and,as we will discuss further,there is no reasoned basis for the city conclusion that the size increase would have no traffic impacts.
the city conclusion that the supercenter proposal did not materially increase the size of the retail component of the project is not supported by substantial evidence.
c.the city determination that the project changes would not have significant environmental effects requiring supplemental environmental review was an abuse of discretion 
we conclude that the city did not accurately identify the supercenter proposal changes to the type and size of retail uses in the phase two area.the city determination that the supercenter proposal was not likely to create environmental effects requiring supplemental environmental review is therefore flawed.as to the traffic impacts of the supercenter proposal,the city determination was not supported by substantial evidence.as to the urban decay effects of the supercenter proposal,the determination must be set aside because the city failed to proceed as required by law by failing to consider extraterritorial urban decay effects of the proposed supercenter.
the city determination that the supercenter would not have substantially increased traffic impacts is not supported by substantial evidence in the record 
the city low calculation of the supercenter square footage fatally undermines its conclusion that the supercenter proposal would have no significant effects on traffic requiring supplemental environmental review 
the mnd traffic study for the original proposal assumed the project would include square feet of retail development.diagrams in the traffic study depict phase two as consisting of several small retail pads.the trip generation factor used in the study to project traffic impacts was based on the retail shopping center category in an industry trip generation manual.according to the trip generation table in the study,the shopping center category of use was predicted to generate morning peak hour trips and evening peak hour trips per square feet.at this rate,the retail component of the project was projected to generate daily peak hour trips.the project as a whole including the hotel,residences and retail areas was projected to generate daily peak hour trips.
subsequently,in response to public comments about potential traffic impacts of a supercenter,the city had its expert prepare a revised trip generation analysis.the revised analysis used as the square footage of the supercenter and applied the discount store trip generation factor,which was higher than the retail shopping center trip generation factor used in the mnd traffic study.for the remaining square feet of retail space in the project,the analysis applied a lower specialty retail trip generation factor.using these factors,the supercenter was projected to generate morning and evening peak hour trips daily.the total retail component was projected to generate and morning and peak hour trips for a total of.after adjustments for captured and trips,which were required by the california department of transportation caltrans and had not been used in the mnd traffic study,the project as a whole including the hotel,residences and retail areas was projected to generate daily peak hour trips,as compared to in the mnd traffic study.the staff report stated,this additional analysis shows an overall reduction in the number of peak hour trips compared to the mnd traffic study the potential traffic impacts of the overall napa junction project,assuming the implementation of required mitigation measures,would be unchanged.
had the revised trip generation analysis used square feet as the supercenter square footage,the estimated morning peak hour trips generated by the supercenter would have been in the morning and in the evening.the estimated peak hour trips for the total retail component would have been in the morning and in the evening,for a total of.after adjustments,the total daily peak hour trips for the project as a whole including the hotel,residences and retail areas would have been rather than the in the revised trip generation analysis.compared to the total daily peak hour trips projected in the original mnd traffic study,the figure represents a trip increase 
nothing in the record explains the city use of for the square footage of the supercenter in the revised trip generation analysis.the analysis itself is a document consisting of two tables and footnotes,none of which explains how the relevant square footage of the supercenter was determined.the staff report to the city council makes the naked assertion that square feet was used because the storeroom and employee space will not generate vehicle trips.appellant traffic expert,on the other hand,opined that the proper square footage for the supercenter in the trip generation model used in the city studies was.she defended that opinion by reference to the same manual the city expert had used to obtain the trip generation factors 
based on appellant expert opinion,an increase of peak hour trips could be a substantial change requiring supplemental environmental review.the expert opined,based upon our engineering judgment and practice elsewhere in the state,a percent increase in traffic or peak hour trips can cause the level of service los at studied intersections to degrade to the next los.appellant expert further observed that caltrans requires traffic studies when a project generates to peak hour trips and the adjacent state route is operating at level of service e or level of service is a measure of traffic congestion at intersections,which ranges from a little or no delay to f extreme traffic delay.the level of service analysis in the mnd traffic study indicates that the level of service at intersections near the project ranged from a to e.a increase could have a significant effect on those intersections that were already operating at level of service 
this case is readily distinguishable from cases where courts have upheld an agency decision not to require supplemental environmental review under section.the significant distinction is that the city based its section analysis on an inaccurate piece of information,that the supercenter was only square feet in size.this inaccuracy resulted from the city minimizing or underreporting the size of the structure in assessing the environmental effects of the project changes.in each of the cases cit
