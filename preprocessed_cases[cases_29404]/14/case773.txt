joseph and carole ciraulo appeal from the trial court order denying their petition for a writ of mandate.the ciraulos had sought an order requiring the city of newport beach the city to grant them a variance from the ordinary strictures of its building code,and thereby allow then to retain the portion of their home which had been constructed in violation of that code.the ciraulos argue the trial court order must be reversed for two reasons first,they assert the court abused its discretion in denying their request to take limited discovery to augment the administrative record in support of their estoppel claim and second,they contend the court prepared an insufficient statement of decision.
for its part,the city contends not only that both the trial court discovery order and its statement of decision were proper,but that the ciraulos mandate petition was not timely filed and served,and should have been denied on that basis alone.we affirm the trial court decision.in our view,the mandate petition was timely,as the applicable statute of limitations was stayed until the city actually served the written notice required by code of civil procedure section however,we also conclude the trial court acted within its discretion in denying the ciraulos request to take discovery.their proposed augmentation was in support of their claim the city should be estopped from denying them a variance,because one of its inspectors had actually lied to the city council in claiming that their improper alteration of the structure had taken place only after the initial framing inspection.but the ciraulos were fairly apprised of the inspector statement prior to their administrative hearing before the city council,and thus had an opportunity to address it in that proceeding.what more,we can not see how this distinction is significant.
the real problem in this case is that the ciraulos can not distance themselves,legally or equitably,from the actions of their as they might like to at this point.it is undisputed that the ciraulos had authorized him to proceed with an expansion of their structure,beyond the scope approved by the city,and delegated to him the responsibility to ensure it was done properly.rather than obtaining permission for the change,he proceeded without it,apparently hoping the city would acquiesce once the improper expansion was completed.his misconduct is attributable to the ciraulos,and dooms their claim for equitable relief.
finally,we conclude the ciraulos had no right to a statement of decision under section,because the trial was completed in less than a day,and they failed to request one at the time the case was submitted for decision.
the ciraulos obtained a building permit in february,allowing them to demolish an existing duplex structure,and replace it with a single family home.the permit allowed for,among other things,a structure to be built on the home rooftop deck.the purpose of this structure was to house an elevator shaft.the city zoning ordinance specifically allowed a elevator structure to extend five feet higher than the usual height limit otherwise imposed by the ordinances.however,at some point after the permit had issued,the ciraulos and their contractor decided to significantly enlarge the rooftop structure,from the approved square feet to approximately square feet.the expanded area,five times what had been approved,was to include a bathroom,an elevator foyer,small storage area,and a fireplace.according to the ciraulos,they told their contractor they wanted the rooftop structure to be enlarged only if properly approved by the city.he assured them he would obtain all necessary approvals of the city.however,despite that promise,the contractor never sought a permit for the expanded structure.
city inspections of the construction commenced in february of.on may,a city inspector reviewed the building roof framing building ht.there is conflicting evidence regarding whether the rooftop structure had already been enlarged at the time of that framing inspection.the ciraulos claim it was,and that the framing was actually inspected,and approved,in that expanded form.the city contends,however,that the initial framing inspector reviewed,and approved,a rooftop structure which was in compliance with the original plans.the city claims the structure was improperly enlarged only after this initial inspection.
in june of,the ciraulos architect prepared drawings,which reflected the changed dimensions of the rooftop structure,in connection with a request for a permit to install fire sprinklers in the home.the city approved that sprinkler permit on june.subsequent inspections of other phases of construction occurred in june,july,and september of.it was not until the inspection of september,that the ciraulos were ordered to obtain approval for all revisions to floor deck added square footage to walls at elevator shaft and toilet area.
in march of,the ciraulos applied to the city planning commission for a variance to allow them to retain their enlarged rooftop structure.a hearing on the variance request was scheduled for may.in connection with that hearing,the planning commission staff prepared a report which included a discussion of the relevant facts,and an analysis of the criteria applicable to the variance.
the staff report expressly stated the conclusion that the ciraulos had originally framed the rooftop structure in accordance with the approved plans,and it was only after the rooftop framing inspection that the additional framing for the unpermitted improvements on the third level was done the report theorized that the subsequent inspectors would have simply assumed the rooftop structure remained in the form approved,and would not have independently inquired.additionally,the staff report noted that any failure of the city subsequent inspectors to address the issue was attributable to the ciraulos own conduct.they and their contractor had an affirmative obligation to inform the inspectors of any changes to their plans,but had failed to do so.
the report also noted that grant of a variance must be based upon specific findings,including there are exceptional circumstances applicable to the land,building or use which do not apply generally to other properties in the same district the grant of a variance is necessary for the preservation and enjoyment of substantial property rights the grant of the variance is consistent with the purposes of the code and would not constitute a special privilege and the grant of the variance would not be materially detrimental to the public welfare.
the report concluded the ciraulos had not demonstrated a basis for any of these findings.their property was not exceptional for the neighborhood they had no cognizable property interest in the portion of the structure which they created illegally their expanded roof structure would amount to a special privilege and the project could be deemed detrimental because it does further the goals of the existing height limit.
at the hearing,the ciraulos introduced witness statements,photographs,and letters from several others in the community supporting the grant of a variance.they specifically argued that the portion of the staff report stating that the expanded framing had been done only after the framing inspection was incorrect,and even offered a dated photo purporting to demonstrate the expanded framing actually predated the framing inspection ciraulo also offered to have witnesses come forth and state under oath,if necessary,that that structure was first constructed in may.
the ciraulos also argued that their situation was unique because they were innocent of any wrongdoing,and had expressly asked their contractor,who they thought was a good contractor if he had gone to the city for approval of the expansion of the roof structure.he told them not to worry about it.he also assured them later that it had passed inspection.
the planning commission unanimously denied the variance on may.while expressing sympathy for the ciraulos,the commissioners stated they simply had no authority to grant a variance,as the ciraulos could not meet any of the standards required to justify one.had the ciraulos sought the variance before construction began,it would certainly have been denied,and the fact they proceeded with the construction in the absence of that permission simply could not be viewed as a factor in their favor.as one of the commissioners expressed it,we really need to send a message that no one should be encouraged to do this and then to come in later and ask for forgiveness essentially instead of asking for permission up front.
the ciraulos appealed that decision to the city council,which set the matter for hearing on june.in connection with that appeal,the planning department staff issued another report,this time to the city council.similar to the report generated to the planning commission hearing,the city council staff report said,the framing of the unpermitted improvements on the third level was done after the initial framing inspections that were conducted in early may of.
additionally,an attached memo indicated that the inspector who had approved the roof framing on may,had expressly confirmed that the dimensions of the elevator shaft framing were in accordance with the building plans at the time of that inspection.
at the hearing before the city council,this contention was again addressed.the building director presented a chronological listing of the events during construction.he noted that t he initial inspections were normal and everything conformed to the plans.he explained that the framing inspector did not notice the alteration in the rooftop structure,because the framing was done per the approved plans.
by contrast,the ciraulos contended the city should have found out about the problem on may,when the framing and building height inspection was conducted and approved.they emphasized that the framing was never changed,that there had been no deception and that they had pictures to prove this.the ciraulos acknowledged that while they had never sought a permit for the expanded roof structure,they had had asked their contractor to do so.he,in turn,had assured them everything was okay.the ciraulos asserted that they had always acted in good faith,and that the grant of a variance should be an issue of equity and fairness,and a balance of hardships.when asked whether the contractor misconduct should be the responsibility of the city or the property owner,the ciraulos suggested that in this case,the city had reason to know this particular contractor reputation,and thus should have been paying closer attention.
at the conclusion of the hearing the city council voted unanimously to deny the variance.again,there was sympathy expressed for the ciraulos,and a suggestion that although they had acted in good faith,they had been victimized,to a degree by their contractor.however,the council agreed there were no grounds to justify the grant of a variance.
the city sent letters to the ciraulos on june,notifying them of the city denial of their requested variance,and informing them that the city attorney office will be contacting you separately to discuss options.then,on june,the city attorney sent them another letter,reiterating the fact of the denial,and advising them that section provides the time within which judicial review must be sought of this decision.
on september,the ciraulos sought that judicial review by filing a petition for writ of mandate.four days later,on september,they served that petition on the city.the city responded with a motion for judgment on the pleadings,arguing that the ciraulos were obligated,pursuant to government code section,to both file and serve their petition within days of the date the city rendered its decision on the variance.although the city conceded the ciraulos filing of their petition had been timely under that rule,it argued their service of it had not.
the ciraulos opposed the motion,arguing the city had expressly represented to them that their time for proceeding on the mandate petition was governed by section.after some obvious struggle,the court denied the motion.
the ciraulos then filed a motion seeking the right to take limited discovery to assist them in proving their claim that the city should be precluded from denying their requested variance,based upon the concept of estoppel,as well as on evidence that city employees had engaged in intentional misconduct in connection with the administrative proceeding.what the ciraulos sought to do was take the deposition of the building inspector who had conducted the may,rooftop framing and building height inspection.the ciraulos contended that,contrary to the representation made by that inspector in connection with the administrative proceedings,the rooftop structure actually had been in its expanded form when that inspection occurred.the ciraulos contended that based upon that altered state of facts,the city should be held responsible for having approved the expanded structure on that date,and consequently estopped from denying the ciraulos post hoc variance request.
the ciraulos also claimed the additional discovery was necessary to establish an estoppel based upon the fact the city was at all times aware the general contractor they hired actually had a history of making unauthorized modifications to approved construction plans,similar to the modification in this case.the ciraulos believed that proof of such knowledge would be sufficient to establish the city should have undertaken more significant efforts to ensure he was not attempting to do so in this case.
the ciraulos allegation of agency misconduct was related to their first estoppel claim,and based upon the assertion the framing inspector was actually ordered by his supervisor to lie to the city council,in order to cover up the fact he had initially inspected and approved the framing of the expanded structure.the ciraulos claimed they were not made aware of this conspiracy until days after the city council had issued its decision,and thus had no opportunity to raise it at the hearing.the court denied the motion requesting limited discovery.
thereafter,both parties submitted trial briefs,as well as the administrative record,and the court heard brief oral arguments during its morning session on october.at the close of arguments,the court took the matter under submission,telling the parties it intended to reach its decision quickly.neither party requested a statement of decision.
the next day,the court issued a order,explaining its reasoning in denying the writ.the court explained it found no error in the city evaluation of the factors necessary to justify a variance the evidence in the record supports the denial of the request in rejecting the ciraulos estoppel argument,the court explained the factors which contribute to the finding of an estoppel are not present here in that regard,the court specifically noted that although the evidence suggests that the city approval was based on a structure built to the plans,the plaintiffs admit they knew that the structure was not built as approved,relying upon the contractor.the court concluded that such a state of facts could not support an estoppel against the city,as the party seeking to raise an estoppel against the government must somehow have changed his position in reasonable reliance on government representations or conduct.
the ciraulos filed several objections to the court order,claiming the court failed to make certain essential findings.the court issued a minute order overruling most of the objections,while also concluding the ciraulos were not,in any event,entitled to a statement of decision.
the first issue raised by the city is whether the ciraulos failed to timely serve their writ petition,in accordance with government code section.the issue of whether that statute,which includes a specific stricture as to the date of service,rather than the mere filing limitation contained in section,should be applied to this case is rife with complexity.luckily,we need not tarry in it.
section,subdivision f,expressly requires the city to give the ciraulos notice that their time for filing a petition writ of mandate is governed by that statute i n making a final decision the local agency shall provide notice to the party that the ti
