petitioner atlantic marine construction,a virginia corporation,entered into a subcontract with respondent management,a texas corporation,for work on a construction project.the subcontract included a clause,which stated that all disputes between the parties would be litigated in virginia.when a dispute arose,however,filed suit in the western district of texas.atlantic marine moved to dismiss,arguing that the clause rendered venue wrong under a and improper under federal rule of civil procedure b.in the alternative,atlantic marine moved to transfer the case to the eastern district of virginia under a.the district court denied both motions.it concluded that a is the exclusive mechanism for enforcing a clause that points to another federal forum that atlantic marine bore the burden of establishing that a transfer would be appropriate under a and that the court would consider both public and factors,only one of which was the clause.after weighing those factors,the court held that atlantic marine had not carried its burden.
the fifth circuit denied atlantic marine petition for a writ of mandamus directing the district court to dismiss the case under a or to transfer it to the eastern district of virginia under a.the court agreed with the district court that a is the exclusive mechanism for enforcing a clause that points to another federal forum that dismissal under rule b would be the correct mechanism for enforcing a clause that pointed to a nonfederal forum and that the district court had not abused its discretion in refusing to transfer the case after conducting the analysis required by a.
a clause may be enforced by a motion to transfer under a,which provides that f or the convenience of parties and witnesses,in the interest of justice,a district court may transfer any civil action to any other district or division where it might have been brought or to any district or division to which all parties have consented.
a section a and rule b allow dismissal only when venue is wrong or improper.whether venue is wrong or improper depends exclusively on whether the court in which the case was brought satisfies the requirements of federal venue laws.title,which governs venue generally,states that e xcept as otherwise provided by law this section shall govern the venue of all civil actions brought in federal district courts.a.it then defines districts in which venue is proper.see b.if a case falls within one of b districts,venue is proper if it does not,venue is improper,and the case must be dismissed or transferred under a.whether the parties contract contains a clause has no bearing on whether a case falls into one of the specified districts.
this conclusion is confirmed by the structure of the federal venue provisions,which reflects congress intent that venue should always lie in some federal court whenever federal courts have personal jurisdiction over the defendant.see b.the conclusion also follows from this court decisions construing the federal venue statutes.see van dusen barrack,stewart organization,ricoh.
b although a clause does not render venue in a court wrong or improper under a or rule b,the clause may be enforced through a motion to transfer under a,which permits transfer to any other district where venue is proper or to any district to which the parties have agreed by contract or stipulation.section a,however,governs transfer only within the federal court system.when a clause points to a state or foreign forum,the clause may be enforced through the doctrine of forum non conveniens.section a is a codification of that doctrine for the subset of cases in which the transferee forum is another federal court.sinochem int l malaysia int l shipping.for all other cases,parties may still invoke the residual forum non conveniens doctrine.see,at.
c the court declines to consider whether a defendant in a action could obtain dismissal under rule b if the plaintiff files suit in a district other than the one specified in a clause.petitioner did not file a motion to dismiss under rule b,and the parties did not brief the rule application.
when a defendant files a a motion,a district court should transfer the case unless extraordinary circumstances unrelated to the convenience of the parties clearly disfavor a transfer.no such exceptional factors appear to be present in this case.
a normally,a district court considering a a motion must evaluate both the private interests of the parties and considerations.but when the parties contract contains a valid clause,that clause represents their agreement as to the most proper forum,stewart,at,and should be given controlling weight in all but the most exceptional cases,at kennedy,concurring.the presence of a valid clause requires district courts to adjust their usual a analysis in three ways.first,the plaintiff choice of forum merits no weight,and the plaintiff,as the party defying the clause,has the burden of establishing that transfer to the forum for which the parties bargained is unwarranted.second,the court should not consider the parties private interests aside from those embodied in the clause it may consider only public interests.because factors will rarely defeat a transfer motion,the practical result is that clauses should control except in unusual cases.third,when a party bound by a clause flouts its contractual obligation and files suit in a different forum,a a transfer of venue will not carry with it the original venue rules.see van dusen,supra,at.
b here,the district court application of a did not comport with these principles.the court improperly placed the burden on atlantic marine to prove that transfer to the parties contractually preselected forum was appropriate instead of requiring,the party acting in violation of the clause,to show that factors overwhelmingly disfavored a transfer.it also erred in giving weight to the parties private interests outside those expressed in the clause.and its holding that public interests favored keeping the case in texas because texas contract law is more familiar to federal judges in texas than to those in virginia rested in part on the district court mistaken belief that the virginia federal court would have been required to apply texas rules instead of virginia.

on writ of certiorari to the united states court of appeals for the fifth circuit 
justice alito delivered the opinion of the court.
the question in this case concerns the procedure that is available for a defendant in a civil case who seeks to enforce a clause.we reject petitioner argument that such a clause may be enforced by a motion to dismiss under a or rule b of the federal rules of civil procedure.instead,a clause may be enforced by a motion to transfer under a,supp.v,which provides that f or the convenience of parties and witnesses,in the interest of justice,a district court may transfer any civil action to any other district or division where it might have been brought or to any district or division to which all parties have consented.when a defendant files such a motion,we conclude,a district court should transfer the case unless extraordinary circumstances unrelated to the convenience of the parties clearly disfavor a transfer.in the present case,both the district court and the court of appeals misunderstood the standards to be applied in adjudicating a a motion in a case involving a clause,and we therefore reverse the decision below.
petitioner atlantic marine construction,a virginia corporation with its principal place of business in virginia,entered into a contract with the united states army corps of engineers to construct a center at fort hood in the western district of texas.atlantic marine then entered into a subcontract with respondent management,a texas corporation,for work on the project.this subcontract included a clause,which stated that all disputes between the parties shall be litigated in the circuit court for the city of norfolk,virginia,or the united states district court for the eastern district of virginia,norfolk division.in re atlantic marine constr.
when a dispute about payment under the subcontract arose,however,sued atlantic marine in the western district of texas,invoking that court diversity jurisdiction.atlantic marine moved to dismiss the suit,arguing that the clause rendered venue in the western district of texas wrong under a and improper under federal rule of civil procedure b.in the alternative,atlantic marine moved to transfer the case to the eastern district of virginia under a.opposed these motions.
the district court denied both motions.it first concluded that a is the exclusive mechanism for enforcing a clause that points to another federal forum.the district court then held that atlantic marine bore the burden of establishing that a transfer would be appropriate under a and that the court would consider a nonexhaustive and nonexclusive list of public and private interest factors,of which the clause was only one such factor.united states ex rel.management,atlantic marine constr,wl,wd.giving particular weight to its findings that compulsory process will not be available for the majority of witnesses and that there would be significant expense for those willing witnesses,the district court held that atlantic marine had failed to carry its burden of showing that transfer would be in the interest of justice or increase the convenience to the parties and their witnesses.at see also,at.
atlantic marine petitioned the court of appeals for a writ of mandamus directing the district court to dismiss the case under a or to transfer the case to the eastern district of virginia under a.the court of appeals denied atlantic marine petition because atlantic marine had not established a clear and indisputable right to relief,at see cheney united states dist.court for,mandamus petitioner must satisfy the burden of showing that his right to issuance of the writ is clear and indisputable internal quotation marks omitted brackets in original.relying on stewart organization,ricoh,the court of appeals agreed with the district court that a is the exclusive mechanism for enforcing a clause that points to another federal forum when venue is otherwise proper in the district where the case was brought.see,at the court stated,however,that if a clause points to a nonfederal forum,dismissal under rule b would be the correct mechanism to enforce the clause because a by its terms does not permit transfer to any tribunal other than another federal court,at.the court of appeals then concluded that the district court had not clearly abused its discretion in refusing to transfer the case after conducting the analysis required by a,at see cheney,supra,at permitting mandamus relief to correct a clear abuse of discretion internal quotation marks omitted.that was so even though there was no dispute that the clause was valid.see,at,at concurring opinion.we granted certiorari.
atlantic marine contends that a party may enforce a clause by seeking dismissal of the suit under a and rule b.we disagree.section a and rule b allow dismissal only when venue is wrong or improper.whether venue is wrong or improper depends exclusively on whether the court in which the case was brought satisfies the requirements of federal venue laws,and those provisions say nothing about a clause.
section a provides that t he district court of a district in which is filed a case laying venue in the wrong division or district shall dismiss,or if it be in the interest of justice,transfer such case to any district or division in which it could have been brought.rule b states that a party may move to dismiss a case for improper venue.these provisions therefore authorize dismissal only when venue is wrong or improper in the forum in which it was brought.
this question whether venue is wrong or improper is generally governed by,supp.v that provision states that e xcept as otherwise provided by law this section shall govern the venue of all civil actions brought in district courts of the united states.a emphasis added.it further provides that a civil action may be brought in a judicial district in which any defendant resides,if all defendants are residents of the state in which the district is located a judicial district in which a substantial part of the events or omissions giving rise to the claim occurred,or a substantial part of property that is the subject of the action is situated or if there is no district in which an action may otherwise be brought as provided in this section,any judicial district in which any defendant is subject to the court personal jurisdiction with respect to such action.b when venue is challenged,the court must determine whether the case falls within one of the three categories set out in b.if it does,venue is proper if it does not,venue is improper,and the case must be dismissed or transferred under a.whether the parties entered into a contract containing a clause has no bearing on whether a case falls into one of the categories of cases listed in b.as a result,a case filed in a district that falls within may not be dismissed under a or rule b.
petitioner contrary view improperly conflates the special statutory term venue and the word forum.it is certainly true that,in some contexts,the word venue is used synonymously with the term forum,but makes clear that venue in all civil actions must be determined in accordance with the criteria outlined in that section.that language can not reasonably be read to allow judicial consideration of other,extrastatutory limitations on the forum in which a case may be brought.
the structure of the federal venue provisions confirms that they alone define whether venue exists in a given forum.in particular,the venue statutes reflect congress intent that venue should always lie in some federal court whenever federal courts have personal jurisdiction over the defendant.the first two paragraphs of b define the preferred judicial districts for venue in a typical case,but the third paragraph provides a fallback option if no other venue is proper,then venue will lie in any judicial district in which any defendant is subject to the court personal jurisdiction emphasis added.the statute thereby ensures that so long as a federal court has personal jurisdiction over the defendant,venue will always lie somewhere.as we have previously noted,congress does not in general intend to create venue gaps,which take away with one hand what congress has given by way of jurisdictional grant with the other.smith united states,internal quotation marks omitted.yet petitioner approach would mean that in some number of cases those in which the clause points to a state or foreign court venue would not lie in any federal district.that would not comport with the statute design,which contemplates that venue will always exist in some federal court.
the conclusion that venue is proper so long as the requirements of b are met,irrespective of any clause,also follows from our prior decisions construing the federal venue statutes.in van dusen barrack,we considered the meaning of a,which authorizes a district court to transfer any civil action to any other district or division where it might have been brought.the question in van dusen was whether a allows transfer to a district in which venue is proper under but in which the case could not have been pursued in light of substantive limitations on the suit.see,at.in holding that transfer is permissible in that context,we construed the phrase where it might have been brought to refer to the federal laws delimiting the districts in which such an action may be brought,at,noting that the phrase may be brought recurs at least times in,at.we perceived no valid reason for reading the words where it might have been brought to narrow the range of permissible federal forums beyond those permitted by federal venue statutes.at.
as we noted in van dusen,a shares the same statutory context as a and contain s a similar phrase.at.it instructs a court to transfer a case from the wrong district to a district in which it could have been brought.the most reasonable interpretation of that provision is that a district can not be wrong if it is one in which the case could have been brought under.under the construction of the venue laws we adopted in van dusen,a wrong district is therefore a district other than those districts in which congress has provided by its venue statutes that the action may be brought.at emphasis added.if the federal venue statutes establish that suit may be brought in a particular district,a contractual bar can not render venue in that district wrong.
our holding also finds support in stewart.as here,the parties in stewart had included a clause in the relevant contract,but the plaintiff filed suit in a different federal district.the defendant had initially moved to transfer the case or,in the alternative,to dismiss for improper venue under a,but by the time the case reached this court,the defendant had abandoned its a argument and sought only transfer under a.we rejected the plaintiff argument that state law governs a motion to transfer venue pursuant to a clause,concluding instead that federal law,specifically a,governs the district court decision whether to give effect to the parties clause.at.we went on to explain that a motion to transfer under a calls on the district court to weigh in the balance a number of factors and that the presence of a clause will be a significant factor that figures centrally in the district court calculus.at.
the question whether venue in the original court was wrong under a was not before the court,but we wrote in a footnote that t he parties do not dispute that the district court properly denied the motion to dismiss the case for improper venue under a because respondent apparently does business in the northern district of alabama.see c venue proper in judicial district in which corporation is doing business.at.in other words,because made venue proper,venue could not be wrong for purposes of a.though dictum,the court observation supports the holding we reach today.a contrary view would all but drain stewart of any significance.if a clause rendered venue in all other federal courts wrong,a defendant could always obtain automatic dismissal or transfer under a and would not have any reason to resort to a.stewart holding would be limited to the presumably rare case in which the defendant inexplicably fails to file a motion under a or rule b.
although a clause does not render venue in a court wrong or improper within the meaning of a or rule b,the clause may be enforced through a motion to transfer under a.that provision states that f or the convenience of parties and witnesses,in the interest of justice,a district court may transfer any civil action to any other district or division where it might have been brought or to any district or division to which all parties have consented.unlike a,a does not condition transfer on the initial forum being wrong.and it permits transfer to any district where venue is also proper,where the case might have been brought or to any other district to which the parties have agreed by contract or stipulation.
section a therefore provides a mechanism for enforcement of clauses that point to a particular federal district.and for the reasons we address in part iii,infra,a proper application of a requires that a clause be given controlling weight in all but the most exceptional cases.stewart,supra,at kennedy,concurring.
atlantic marine argues that a is not a suitable mechanism to enforce clauses because that provision can not provide for transfer when a clause specifies a state or foreign tribunal,see brief for petitioner,and we agree with atlantic marine that the court of appeals failed to provide a sound answer to this problem.the court of appeals opined that a clause pointing to a nonfederal forum should be enforced through rule b,which permits a party to move for dismissal of a case based on improper venue.at.as atlantic marine persuasively argues,however,that conclusion can not be reconciled with our construction of the term improper venue in to refer only to a forum that does not satisfy federal venue laws.if venue is proper under federal venue rules,it does not matter for the purpose of rule b whether the clause points to a federal or a nonfederal forum.
instead,the appropriate way to enforce a clause pointing to a state or foreign forum is through the doctrine of forum non conveniens.section a is merely a codification of the doctrine of forum non conveniens for the subset of cases in which the transferee forum is within the federal court system in such cases,congress has replaced the traditional remedy of outright dismissal with transfer.see sinochem int l malaysia int l shipping,for the federal court system,congress has codified the doctrine see also notes following historical and revision notes section a was drafted in accordance with the doctrine of forum non conveniens,permitting transfer to a more convenient forum,even though the venue is proper for the remaining set of cases calling for a nonfederal forum,a has no application,but the residual doctrine of forum non conveniens has continuing application in federal courts.sinochem,at internal quotation marks and brackets omitted see also ibid.noting that federal courts invoke forum non conveniens in cases where the alternative forum is abroad,and perhaps in rare instances where a state or territorial court serves litigational convenience best internal quotation marks and citation omitted.and because both a and the forum non conveniens doctrine from which it derives entail the same standard,courts should evaluate a clause pointing to a nonfederal forum in the same way that they evaluate a clause pointing to a federal forum.see stewart,at scalia,dissenting section a did not change the relevant factors which federal courts used to consider under the doctrine of forum non conveniens quoting norwood kirkpatrick.
an amicus before the court argues that a defendant in a action should be able to obtain dismissal under rule b if the plaintiff files suit in a district other than the one specified in a valid clause.see brief for stephen sachs as amicus curiae.petitioner,however,did not file a motion under rule b,and the parties did not brief the rule application to this case at any stage of this litigation.we therefore will not consider it.even if a defendant could use rule b to enforce a clause,that would not change our conclusions that a and rule b are not proper mechanisms to enforce a clause and that a and the forum non conveniens doctrine provide appropriate enforcement mechanisms 
although the court of appeals correctly identified a as the appropriate provision to enforce the clause in this case,the court of appeals erred in failing to make the adjustments required in a a analysis when the transfer motion is premised on a clause.when the parties have agreed to a valid clause,a district court should ordinarily transfer the case to the forum specified in that clause only under extraordinary circumstances unrelated to the convenience of the parties should a a motion be denied.and no such exceptional factors appear to be present in this case.
in the typical case not involving a clause,a district court considering a a motion or a forum non conveniens motion must evaluate both the convenience of the parties and various considerations ordinarily,the district court would weigh the relevant factors and decide whether,on balance,a transfer would serve the convenience of parties and witnesses and otherwise promote the interest of justice.a.
the calculus changes,however,when the parties contract contains a valid clause,which represents the parties agreement as to the most proper forum.stewart,at.the enforcement of valid clauses,bargained for by the parties,protects their legitimate expectations and furthers vital interests of the justice system.at kennedy,concurr
