after a bench trial in this diversity case,the district court ordered robert lang and his construction business,lang brothers,collectively lang to pay dan ryan builders,dan ryan limited damages for breach of contract.dan ryan appeals,seeking additional damages.we affirm.
we briefly summarize the relevant facts,which are undisputed 
lang owned seventy acres of land in west virginia,on which he sought to build a housing development,crystal ridge development.in,pursuant to a lot purchase agreement lpa,lang subdivided the land and contracted to sell dan ryan all lots in crystal ridge.the lpa detailed the responsibilities of both parties,including lot inspection,fill compaction,and building schedules.
the parties also entered into a number of other written contracts in connection with the development,including a contract with independent contractor fill slope contract.they agreed in that contract that lang would construct a fill slope that would provide grading on certain lots to accommodate the construction of houses.lang completed the grading work and was paid in full by dan ryan.
in,dan ryan paid lang for the first twelve lots in accord with the lpa.dan ryan also entered into additional contracts with lang including a second fill slope contract.in,dan ryan purchased another five lots,and lang continued to work on the infrastructure of the crystal ridge development.
in march,cracks appeared in the basement slab and foundation walls of a partially constructed house on one of the first lots that dan ryan had purchased.an engineering firm engaged by dan ryan concluded that stabilization of that house,as well as of another house displaying similar cracks,required remediation.these problems and their associated costs exacerbated existing tensions between dan ryan and lang,ultimately leading to a divorce the parties term between the two.the parties memorialized the divorce in the first amendment to lot purchase agreement the amendment.under the amendment,dan ryan agreed to purchase from lang the remaining lots in crystal ridge,and the parties development responsibilities were apportioned differently.
in december,the slope behind the lot that had first exhibited cracks began sliding downhill toward a nearby highway.a geotechnical study concluded that the slope had failed due to its natural composition,soil type,and poor construction.dan ryan also encountered difficulties related to crystal ridge stormwater management system,development permits,and entrance drive.
in december,dan ryan filed this lawsuit against lang seeking monetary damages.in its complaint,dan ryan asserts three causes of action.initially and principally,dan ryan alleges negligence by lang in connection with construction of the fill slope.second,dan ryan alleges that lang breached several of its contractual duties under both the lpa and the amendment.the third cause of action alleges fraudulent misrepresentation by lang dan ryan abandoned this last claim at trial.
following several conferences and numerous pretrial submissions,the district court held a bench trial.the court admitted many exhibits and considered testimony from more than a dozen witnesses.after extensive submissions the court issued a detailed,order setting forth findings of fact and conclusions of law.
on the contract claim,the district court awarded dan ryan in damages and in interest for breach of the lpa and the amendment with respect to claims for repairs on the road leading to crystal ridge.the court found that dan ryan had failed to carry its burden of proof with respect to other asserted breaches of the lpa and the amendment,those relating to an entrance easement,a stormwater management and erosion control system,and other miscellaneous bad work.accordingly,the court denied further contract damages.the district court then rejected dan ryan negligence claim.the court reasoned that this claim failed under west virginia gist of the action doctrine,which bars recovery in tort when the duty that forms the basis of the asserted tort claim arises solely from a contractual relationship.dan ryan timely noted this appeal.
we review a judgment following a bench trial under a mixed standard of review factual findings may be reversed only if clearly erroneous,while conclusions of law,including contract construction,are examined de novo.roanoke cement falk,cir.on appeal,dan ryan does not challenge the district court resolution of its claim for breach of the lpa and the amendment.rather,dan ryan appeals only the court determination that the gist of the action doctrine bars its tort claim,and the court failure to recognize that its tort claim was really a claim for breach of the fill slope contracts 
dan ryan offers two reasons why the district court erred in its gist of the action holding.we consider each in turn.
first,citing greenlaw united states,dan ryan contends that the principle of party presentation ought to have prevented the district court from relying on the gist of the action doctrine.the party presentation principle generally cautions a federal court to consider only the claims and contentions raised by the litigants before it.dan ryan asserts that the party presentation principle applies here because neither it nor lang raised the gist of the action doctrine in submissions to the district court.
greenlaw is the supreme court most robust articulation of the party presentation principle.there,in language on which dan ryan rests its claim,the court stated that in the first instance and on appeal,we rely on the parties to frame the issues for decision.greenlaw,at.but although greenlaw paints the concept of party presentation in broad brushstrokes,its holding is much narrower,an appellate court may not alter a judgment to benefit a nonappealing party.greenlaw,at.in fact,other than in greenlaw,the court has invoked the party presentation principle only twice,both times in stressing the limits of the principle.see wood milyard,courts may sua sponte consider defenses overlooked by the state in habeas cases arizona california,courts may sua sponte raise a preclusion defense the parties failed to raise in special circumstances.
moreover,neither in greenlaw nor in any other case has the court ever suggested that the party presentation principle constrains a court fundamental obligation to ascertain controlling law.a party failure to identify the applicable legal rule certainly does not diminish a court responsibility to apply that rule.the judiciary would struggle to maintain the rule of law were it limited to the parties competing assertions about what the law requires.for this reason,it is well established that w hen an issue or claim is properly before the court,the court is not limited to the particular legal theories advanced by the parties,but rather retains the independent power to identify and apply the proper construction of governing law.kamen kemper fin.thus,the supreme court has long recognized that a court may consider an issue antecedent to and ultimately dispositive of the dispute before it,even an issue the parties fail to identify and brief.bank of or.indep.ins.agents of,quoting arcadia ohio power,alterations in original.
here,west virginia gist of the action doctrine is just such an antecedent and dispositive issue,since it goes to the duty element of any west virginia tort claim.the gist of the action doctrine requires plaintiffs seeking relief in tort to identify a duty breached by the alleged tortfeasor.see gaddy eng g bowles rice mcdavid graff love,llp.t he determination of whether a plaintiff is owed a duty of care by a defendant must be rendered by the court as a matter of law.lockhart airco heating cooling,internal quotation marks and citation omitted.to determine whether dan ryan established all of the required elements of a tort claim under west virginia law,the district court necessarily had to consider the gist of the action doctrine and identify the source of any asserted duty.
we must therefore reject dan ryan contention that the party presentation principle barred the district court,when adjudicating a west virginia tort claim,from considering whether the elements of such a claim had been met 
dan ryan also contends that the district court erred in holding that the gist of the action doctrine dooms its tort claim.this contention is meritless.given that dan ryan tort claim rests on lang asserted negligence in performing two contracts the lpa and the amendment and not on any duty independent of those contracts,the gist of the action doctrine does indeed bar that claim.
to prevail in a negligence suit,the plaintiff must prove by a preponderance of the evidence that the defendant owed a legal duty to the plaintiff.strahin cleavenger,emphasis added.under the gist of the action doctrine,a party to a contract can prevail on a negligence claim only if he can demonstrate the breach of some positive legal duty imposed by law because of the relationship of the parties,rather than from a mere omission to perform a contract obligation.lockhart,at internal quotation marks and citation omitted in other words,the negligence action in tort must arise independent of the existence of the contract.id.internal quotation marks and citation omitted.if the action is not maintainable without pleading and proving the contract,where the gist of the action is the breach of the contract,either by malfeasance or nonfeasance,it is,in substance,an action on the contract,whatever may be the form of the pleading.cochran appalachian power,internal quotation marks and citation omitted.
only two years ago,in gaddy,the west virginia supreme court of appeals reiterated this requirement.there,the court unequivocally held that a plaintiff can not recover in tort if the complaint does no more than include the bare bones averment that defendants negligently breached their agreement with the plaintiff.at.here,a bare bones recitation is all that the amended complaint offered with respect to the fill slope claims dan ryan alleged only that lang negligently performed or failed to perform various development obligations under the lpa and amendment causing substantial damage to dan ryan property.
gaddy further explains,in words that resonate here,that recovery in tort will be barred if any of the following factors is demonstrated where liability arises solely from the contractual relationship between the parties when the alleged duties breached were grounded in the contract itself where any liability stems from the contract and when the tort claim essentially duplicates the breach of contract claim or where the success of the tort claim is dependent on the success of the breach of contract claim.gaddy,at.here,of course,dan ryan specifically alleges that lang liability for negligent perform ance of two contracts the lpa and the amendment caused its damages,and thus that its tort claim asserting negligence in constructing the fill slope arises from these contracts.
in its briefing on appeal,dan ryan points to one additional source of lang supposed duty t he common law duty of care owed by a contractor.appellant br.but if,as dan ryan contends,the gravamen of the breach was the failure to construct the fill slope in a good and workmanlike manner,id.at,lang breached not an independent legal duty but an implied warranty arising out of in fact,created by the lpa and the amendment.see thacker tyree,in the area of construction contracts,there is general recognition that an implied warranty of fitness and workmanlike quality attaches to such contracts.
in sum,this is precisely the kind of case in which plaintiff claims are simply breach of contract claims masquerading as tort claims.gaddy,at.see also covol fuels,llc pinnacle mining,llc,slip op.at cir gist of the action doctrine applicable where party tort claims simply recast its claim for breach of contract.the district court did not err in invoking the gist of the action doctrine,and in concluding that dan ryan negligence claim was actually a claim for breach of contract.thus,dan ryan negligence claim fails as a matter of law.
alternatively,dan ryan now seeks damages under contract claims never alleged or even asserted before the district court.specifically,dan ryan contends that the district court should have awarded it damages for a breach of the fill slope contracts.
nowhere in its pleadings did dan ryan assert such a claim.the district court pointed out that dan ryan did not reference the fill slope contracts in its original complaint.indeed,neither dan ryan amended complaint,nor its listing of contested issues of fact and law,nor its proposed findings of fact and conclusions of law even mentions the fill slope contracts let alone alleges that lang breached them.dan ryan concedes,as it must,that this is so.nevertheless,dan ryan maintains that the absence of explicit reference to the fill slope contracts in the pleadings is of no consequence,because a claim as to breach of those contracts was tried by consent,as permitted by federal rule of civil procedure b.appellant br.
that rule provides that an issue not raised by the pleadings will be treated as if it were raised,provided it is tried by the parties express or implied consent.b.of course,rule b does not offer a failsafe for any and every faulty pleading.rather,the rule sets forth an exception to the general rules of pleading when the facts proven at trial differ from those alleged in the complaint,and thus support a cause of action that the claimant did not plead.gilbane.fed.reserve bank of richmond,cir.but b ecause notice to the defendant of the allegations to be proven is essential to sustaining a cause of action,rule b applies only when the defendant has consented to trial of the factual issues and will not be prejudiced by amendment of the pleadings to include them.id.emphasis added.thus,rule b requires that a party expressly or impliedly consent to trial on an unpled claim and not be prejudiced by doing so.dan ryan can not satisfy the rule requirements.
first,the record offers no support for dan ryan assertion on appeal that lang expressly consented to trial of any claim of breach of the fill slope contracts.dan ryan maintains lang did so by including,among its contested issues of fact,the question of whether the lang defendants are liable to dan ryan for breach of contract in relation to the fill slope contracts.j.but lang single reference to a breach of the fill slope contract in its memorandum does not constitute consent this submission demonstrates only that lang regarded breach of the fill slope contracts as a potential issue,which might be raised by dan ryan at trial.dan ryan mistakes lang caution in this regard for consent.
in fact,as early as the final pretrial conference,lang pointed out the absence of any reference to the fill slope contracts in the amended complaint.lang counsel specifically noted that there were additional agreements that were not attached as exhibits to the complaint and distinguished the obligations in those unpled contracts from the obligations in the lpa and the amendment,on which dan ryan did rest its contract claims.similarly,in its submission,lang noted that although the fill slope contracts were introduced as evidence at trial,they were not even mentioned anywhere within the complaint or amended complaint and so could not provide dan ryan with a basis for recovery.far from consenting to trial of unpled issues,then,lang consistently and expressly disclaimed any consent to trial on the unpled claim of breach of the fill slope contracts.
moreover,in dan ryan own submissions to the district court it confirmed that it did not advance such a claim.rather,when dan ryan raised contract claims at trial,it expressly identified the pertinent contracts that formed the source of the asserted breach the lpa and the amendment not the fill slope contracts.furthermore,after trial,in its proposed findings of fact and conclusions of law,dan ryan set forth in numbered paragraphs each of the damage awards sought for breach of the lpa and the amendment.dan ryan did not devote a numbered paragraph to any damage claim under the fill slope contracts.dan ryan did not propose that the district court find that lang breached the fill slope contracts.and dan ryan did not ask the district court to hold that lang had any specific obligations arising out of t
