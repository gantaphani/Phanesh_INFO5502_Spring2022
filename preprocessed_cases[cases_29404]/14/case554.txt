a few months before the enactment of legislation leading to the great dissolution of california redevelopment agencies the petaluma community development commission issued bonds to fund certain projects.the commission was the redevelopment agency agency for the city of petaluma city,and the newly funded projects included an interchange and roadway of highway the rainier project.
the city,as successor to the agency,submitted various recognized obligation payment schedules rops that included expenditures of bond proceeds for the rainier project the department disapproved certain of these expenditures because they were pursuant to contracts to which the agency was not a party.the city brought a petition for a writ of mandate,seeking an order to require the department to approve these expenditures.the trial court denied the petition.
on appeal,the city contends the department abused its discretion in disapproving rops items relating to the use of bond proceeds for the rainier project.it contends the bonds are enforceable agreements that require the proceeds be spent on specified projects,including the rainier project.the city argues the department refusal to approve these expenditures is an unconstitutional impairment of contracts.focusing on what it believes will be the result of the department action,defeasance of the bonds the city contends the department had no authority to order defeasance and abused its discretion in failing to defer to the city and its oversight board on the decisions relating to the bonds.
as we will explain,although the bonds at issue are enforceable obligations,no enforceable obligation to use those bond proceeds specifically to fund the rainier project appears in the record.accordingly we shall affirm,holding in the published portion of our opinion that the department did not abuse its discretion in disapproving rops items relating to the rainier project.in the unpublished portion of our opinion,part ii of the discussion,post,we conclude that the city remaining contentions also fail.
background 
the law dissolving redevelopment agencies 
in the aftermath of world war ii,the legislature authorized the formation of community redevelopment agencies in order to remediate urban decay.citations.the community redevelopment law was intended to help local governments revitalize blighted communities.citations.it has since become a principal instrument of economic development,mostly for cities,with nearly redevelopment agencies now active in california.california redevelopment matosantos cal th,matosantos.redevelopment agencies used a tax increment funding method.under this method,those public entities entitled to receive property tax revenue in a redevelopment project area the cities,counties,special districts,and school districts containing territory in the area are allocated a portion based on the assessed value of the property prior to the effective date of the redevelopment plan.any tax revenue in excess of that amount the tax increment created by the increased value of project area property goes to the redevelopment agency for repayment of debt incurred to finance the project.citations.in essence,property tax revenues for entities other than the redevelopment agency are frozen,while revenue from any increase in value is awarded to the redevelopment agency on the theory that the increase is the result of redevelopment.citation.id.at.
over time,a perception had grown that some redevelopment agencies were used as shams to divert property tax revenues that otherwise would fund general local governmental services,and legislative efforts were made to address these concerns.citations.city of emeryville cohen th,emeryville.these concerns grew as the state financial condition worsened.responding to a declared state fiscal emergency,in the summer of the legislature enacted legislation assem.bill.enacted as stats,ch.assembly bill that bars redevelopment agencies from engaging in new business and provides for their windup and dissolution.matosantos,supra,cal th at.
assembly bill consists of two principal components,codified as new parts and of division of the health and safety code part to is the freeze component it subjects redevelopment agencies to restrictions on new bonds or other indebtedness new plans or changes to existing plans and new partnerships,including joint powers authorities to.cities and counties are barred from creating any new redevelopment agencies.existing obligations are unaffected redevelopment agencies may continue to make payments and perform existing obligations until other agencies take over.part purpose is to preserve redevelopment agency assets and revenues for use by local governments to fund core governmental services such as fire protection,police,and schools,subd.a.
part to is the dissolution component.it dissolves all redevelopment agencies and transfers control of redevelopment agency assets to successor agencies,which are contemplated to be the city or county that created the redevelopment agency,subd.j,subd.b.part requires successor agencies to continue to make payments and perform existing obligations.however,unencumbered balances of redevelopment agency funds must be remitted to the county for distribution to cities,the county,special districts,and school districts in proportion to what each agency would have received absent the redevelopment agencies.see,subd.d,subd.a.matosantos,supra,cal th at.
under the dissolution law,all redevelopment agencies and redevelopment agency components of community development agencies were to be eliminated,subd.a.a ll authority,rights,powers,duties,and obligations previously vested with the former redevelopment agencies,under the community redevelopment law,are hereby vested in the successor agencies,subd.b.here,the city acts as successor agency to the agency,subd.j.the successor agency is obligated to e xpeditiously wind down the affairs of the redevelopment agency under the direction of the oversight board,subd.h.the oversight board consists of appointed members and has fiduciary responsibilities to holders of enforceable obligations,subd.i,subd.a.enforceable obligations include bonds and any payments required under the indenture,subd.d a,but exclude any agreements or contracts between the city that created the redevelopment agency and the former redevelopment agency,subd.d.
the successor agency prepares a rops for each fiscal period,setting forth the minimum payment amounts for enforceable obligations,and the rops must be approved by the oversight board,subds.g h,subd.l.the rops is also submitted to the department and the california state controller,who have authority to require documentation relating to any enforceable obligation,subds.l c a.the department then makes its determination of the enforceable obligations and the amounts and funding sources of the enforceable obligation,subd.m.in addition,the department has authority to review actions of the oversight board and to eliminate or modify any item on a rops,subd.h.a successor agency or oversight board can not restore funding for an enforceable obligation that was reduced or deleted by the department,unless the restoration reflects decisions made during a meet and confer process with the department or a court order,subd.a.
each county takes the property tax proceeds the tax increment that would have gone to the former redevelopment agency and places such money in a redevelopment property tax trust fund the trust fund,subd.d.money in the trust fund is used to pay the former redevelopment agency required contributions to schools,enforceable obligations approved on a rops,and administrative costs,subd.a.any remaining money is distributed to local taxing entities,subd.a.
the rainier project 
the rainier project will extend rainier avenue to the west of highway by means of an undercrossing of the highway.the project is part of a larger project to widen the highway in sonoma county to handle increased population.in january,the city and the agency each adopted resolutions to proceed with project studies and environmental documents for the rainier project.the agency was to contribute to the city for the project.
that spring,the city had entered into two agreements relating to the rainier project.the first was a professional services agreement with metropolitan planning group,for,to provide planning assistance and coordination.the second was a professional design services agreement with urs corporation americas,an engineering consultant,for,to prepare an environmental impact report and other services.both agreements were to terminate on december.
in january,the city and the agency entered into a cooperative agreement to provide for the agency financing of certain redevelopment projects.the agency agreed to pay the city over for the construction of the rainier project.
in march,shortly before assembly bill was enacted,the agency issued in series bonds.the series bonds were tax increment bonds and secured by a pledge of and first lien on certain tax revenues relating to the funded projects.jp morgan chase bank,was the original purchaser of all the bonds.the series bonds were issued for the purpose of providing funds to finance qualified redevelopment projects with respect to the project areas.the bulk of the series bonds million were to be used to finance the rainier project.
in june,the city entered into an amendment to a cooperative funding agreement with the sonoma county transportation authority scta.under this amendment the city was to provide for ps e plans,specifications,estimates and up to for the construction phase of the rainier project.
disputed rops claims 
the oversight board to the successor agency to the agency approved three different rops for the periods ending june,rops i,december,rops ii,and june,rops iii.the department disapproved various items as not qualifying as enforceable obligations on each rops.as relevant here,the department disapproved the cooperative agreement between the city and the agency on all three rops.on rops i,the department disapproved items relating to the agreement between the city and scta.on rops iii,the department found the three agreements relating to the rainier project discussed above urs,metropolitan planning group,and scta were not enforceable obligations because the agency was not a party to the agreements 
the city requested a meet and confer session as to rops iii.after further review following the meet and confer session,the department continued to deny the items related to the rainier project,finding they did not qualify as enforceable obligations.
writ petition 
the city petitioned for a writ of mandate,claiming the department abused its discretion in disqualifying legitimate enforceable obligations relating to the rainier project on rops i and iii.the city framed the issue as whether the successor agency should be compelled to renege on financial commitments made by petaluma former redevelopment agency to the city and other private and public third parties,such as the scta,to expend tax increment funds and bond proceeds to assist with funding of a crucial highway infrastructure improvement,which is a component of and funded arrangements for the widening of highway through sonoma county.
the city sought a writ of mandate directing the department to reinstate and recognize items on rops i and iii related to the rainier project as enforceable obligations,and directing the sonoma county auditor controller to distribute funds from the trust fund to permit the city as successor agency to pay the items on rops i,ii,and iii relating to the rainier project.
the trial court denied the petition.the court found the agreements at issue were not enforceable obligations because the agency was not a party to them,as required under the dissolution law.it next found resolutions of the city and the agency regarding funding of the rainier project were not enforceable obligations finally,the court found the issuance of the bonds did not create an enforceable obligation to use the bond proceeds to fund the rainier project.
discussion 
iwhether use of bond proceeds for the rainier project is an enforceable obligation 
the city contends the department abused its discretion in denying the items on rops iii relating to the rainier project.the city contends the series bonds are enforceable obligations and the terms of the indenture and the first supplement to indenture supplement require that the proceeds of the bonds be spent on qualified redevelopment projects,one of which is the rainier project 
resolution of this issue requires interpretation of both the dissolution law and the supplement.w here the issue is one of statutory construction or contract interpretation,and the evidence is not in dispute,the de novo standard of review applies citation.people international fidelity ins.th.
section,subdivision d a defines an enforceable obligation to include bonds,including the required debt service,reserve,and other payments required under the indenture or similar documents governing the issuance of the outstanding bonds of the former redevelopment agency.section of the supplement provides it constitutes a continuing agreement to secure the full payment when due of principal of and premium,if any,and interest on all series bonds.certainly,repayments to the bondholders are enforceable obligations.indeed,the dissolution law provides that in allocating moneys in the trust fund,first priority shall be given to debt service payments on tax allocation bonds,subd.a a.the question here is whether use of the bond proceeds to make payments on the various contracts relating to the rainier project contracts to which the agency was not a party are payments required under the indenture.
language of supplement 
section of the supplement provides that the series bonds have been issued for the purpose of providing funds to finance qualified redevelopment projects with respect to the project areas.ten million dollars of the sale proceeds are to be deposited into the series project account.the certificate regarding use of proceeds states the proceeds of the series bonds will be used to finance qualified redevelopment projects as defined in an exhibit and are expected to be funded in accordance with the estimated schedule set forth in the exhibit.the exhibit identifies two projects the old redwood highway interchange project with an estimated of million,and the rainier project with an estimated of million.
these provisions limit the use of the bond proceeds to the identified projects.contrary to the city argument,however,nothing in the language requires that the rainier project actually be funded or constructed.unlike the express agreement to pay principal and interest,there is no commitment to build the rainier project.as the trial court found,the supplement requires only that if the bond proceeds are used,they must be used for the identified projects.it does not separately mandate that the identified projects be built.whether the indenture has other requirements regarding the use of bond proceeds we can not say because it is not part of the record.as a reviewing court,we usually consider only matters that were part of the record when the judgment was entered.citation.ragland bank national th.
the city relies on section,subdivision i,which provides that successor agencies are required to,continue to oversee development of properties until the contracted work has been completed or the contractual obligations of the former redevelopment agency can be transferred to other parties.bond proceeds shall be used for the purposes for which the bonds were sold unless the purposes can no longer be achieved,in which case,the proceeds may be used to defease the bonds.in interpreting different provisions of a statute,we consider portions of a statute in the context of the entire statute and the statutory scheme of which it is a part curle superior court cal th.section details the obligations of the successor agency it does not define enforceable obligations.we do not read this provision on the duties of a successor agency to enlarge and supersede the specific definition of an enforceable obligation in section.see estate of kramme cal d,principle that specific statute controls and takes priority over a general statute encompassing the same subject.he
