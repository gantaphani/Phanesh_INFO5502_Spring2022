john soldano and his wife,denise,sued the united states under the federal tort claims act,b ftca,for damages arising out of a serious motorcycle accident that occurred on a major road in yosemite national park.the district court granted summary judgment against the soldanos,finding that their claims of governmental negligence failed for lack of evidence or were barred by the discretionary function exception to the ftca,a.we affirm in part,but reverse the district court application of the discretionary function exception to the soldanos claim that the government failed to set a safe speed limit at the accident site.
a.the accident 
on june,john soldano was driving his new motorcycle west on the big oak flat road in yosemite national park,a road familiar to soldano,who had driven it many times.sitting behind him as his passenger was his wife,denise.they were cruising between and,consistent with the road speed limit.
as the soldanos came around a bend in the road approaching the cascade creek bridge,they were startled to find a van stopped in their lane.the van was waiting to turn left across the road double,solid yellow lines to enter the cascade creek bridge vista point adjacent to the road.john soldano claims he attempted to brake,but had to veer into the eastbound lane and oncoming traffic when he realized he had insufficient room to stop before colliding with the van.as a result,the soldanos crashed into another van,and john soldano suffered severe injuries rendering him a paraplegic.soldano was also cited for improper crossing of double,solid yellow lines.
in a deposition,soldano testified that the collision occurred about one minute after he exited the big oak flat road second tunnel.he described the road as curving around a large,solid granite mountain on his right just before the location of the collision,and said that it was the granite mountain that obstructed his vision of the stopped van.he did not identify any road or hillside maintenance issues that contributed to the accident.
in april,the soldanos sued the united states under the ftca.their complaint alleged that the government,through the department of the interior,national park service and superintendent of yosemite national park,caused or contributed to the collision by improper design of,and failure to maintain,the road and adjacent area.the soldanos specifically alleged that the location of the collision constituted a dangerous condition and concealed trap or hidden hazard causing the soldanos to be surprised by stopped traffic.they faulted the government for the negligent placement of traffic signs,among other things,and alleged that the dangerous condition of the roadway was the proximate cause of their injuries.they sought damages for past and future medical expenses,lost earnings and earning capacity,emotional distress and loss of consortium.after a hearing,the district court granted the government motion for summary judgment,finding that a lack of evidence or the discretionary function exception to the ftca barred all of the soldanos claims.
b.the road and park policies 
the big oak flat road road is a road with wide lanes and a northwest to southeast orientation.it is one of the principal routes for traffic in and out of the park and is heavily traveled during the summer tourist season.the segment of the road where the accident occurred includes three tunnels,three bridges and the cascade creek bridge vista point.eight other pullouts punctuate the road,which was constructed between and and has been neither redesigned nor reconstructed since its creation.
the road is a part of the national park system of roads.in,the national park service created the park road standards standards to establish policies for the design and construction of the nation park roads.in,it prepared new standards to be applied as existing roads are reconstructed or when new roads are constructed.the standards state that i n most parks,a road system is already in place,having been constructed in accordance with the national park service policies.the standards are intended to be applied uniformly to both new construction and reconstruction of park roads on a servicewide basis to the extent practicable,based on projections of actual,or planned and controlled use,and they acknowledge that o n rehabilitation,restoration and resurfacing projects,the standards applicable to new construction and reconstruction will in some instances not be attainable.finally,the standards set forth the purpose of national park roads 
p ark roads are designed with extreme care and sensitivity with respect to the terrain and environment through which they are laid lightly onto the land.
each segment of every park road should relate to the resource it traverses in a meaningful way and should constitute an enjoyable and informative experience in itself while providing the visitor the utmost in visual experience a park road should be fundamentally designed to maintain an overall continuing sense of intimacy with the countryside or area through which it passes.
the purpose of park roads remains in sharp contrast to that of the federal and state highway systems.park roads are not intended to provide fast and convenient transportation they are intended to enhance visitor experience while providing safe and efficient accommodation of park visitors and to serve essential management access needs.
the placement and use of signs in yosemite is similarly governed by park service policies,in particular those set forth in the national park service sign manual sign manual.the sign manual delineates a number of factors that park managers are to consider in determining where to place signs.managers should weigh such potentially competing ends as minimal intrusion,avoidance of unnecessary proliferation of signs and the safety of visitors in deciding whether to use a particular sign at a particular location.
the yosemite national park superintendent,michael tollefson,has averred that the park service overall road policy decisions made pursuant to the standards involve balancing preservation of natural resources,visitor enjoyment and safety and the park service limited financial and human resources.the superintendent has further stated that balancing such considerations requires the exercise of discretion,and that decisions on the road design and construction,including the placement of scenic vistas and signs on it,are not governed by mandatory statutes,regulations or policies,but rather by noncompulsory policies as set forth in the standards and the sign manual.
standard of review 
we review the district court summary judgment de novo.see buono norton,cir.we must determine,viewing the evidence in the light most favorable to the nonmoving party,whether there are any genuine issues of material fact and whether the district court correctly applied the substantive law.olsen idaho state bd.of,cir.
discussion 
this appeal turns on the resolution of two questions whether the district court properly rejected the soldanos claim that the road was negligently maintained,as not supported by admissible evidence and whether the court erred in determining that the discretionary function exception shields the government from liability for the rest of the soldanos claims.
negligent maintenance 
the soldanos claim that the government failure properly to maintain the site of the accident was a proximate cause of their injuries.more specifically,they contend that overgrowth along the road at the site of the accident made the road speed limit too high,in violation of minimum specifications set forth in the standards.in support of their claim,the soldanos expert witness,ronald shields,a traffic engineer,stated 
the nearly vertical upward sideslope for the westerly road direction significantly reduces the available sight distance to feet based on the caltrans highway design charts.actual sight distance observed in at the westbound curve approaching the cascade creek bridge was feet as a result of vegetation blocking the line of sight.pursuant to the edition of park road standards,the reduction of sight distance caused by the vegetation would place the maximum allowable design speed below miles per hour 
if the design speed and corresponding speed limit had been reduced and the vegetation had been maintained to increase the stopping sight distance,john soldano would have had sufficient time to stop before reaching the rear of the stopped van and would not have been required to swerve into the oncoming lane of traffic.
shields report is the only evidence the soldanos presented concerning the state of vegetation and its effect on the road safety.the report,however,does not establish that vegetation was overgrown or even existed in,because shields conclusions were based on his observations in.the district court correctly recognized,therefore,that t he soldanos provide no evidence to describe or depict the vegetation at issue and how it obscured vision at the time of the collision and instead merely rely on their expert general statements of vegetation overgrowth without supporting underlying facts.the same deficiencies prevent shields declaration from calling into question john soldano own statement that it was the rock wall that blocked his view.
accordingly,the district court did not err in granting summary judgment to the government on the soldanos negligent maintenance claim.see.c anderson liberty lobby,d.
negligent design,placement of signs and speed limit 
the soldanos also allege that the road was negligently designed at the site of the accident.first,they claim that the park service negligently designed the road by omitting signs warning of the danger of vehicles stopped on a blind curve.second,they contend that the road speed limit was negligently set too high relative to its design,because the standards permit a speed limit only where a sight distance meets or exceeds feet.here,the nearly vertical sideslope of the road reduces the sight distance of a vehicle in the position of the soldanos to feet according to the soldanos expert interpretation of california department of transportation highway design charts 
given the circumstances of the accident and their expert analysis,the soldanos have presented evidence sufficient to create triable issues with respect to their claims that the park service design of the road required warning signs and a lower speed limit at the accident site.we therefore turn to consider whether the district court erred in finding that the discretionary function exception to the ftca bars these claims.
discretionary function exception 
a party may bring an action against the united states only to the extent that the government waives its sovereign immunity.valdez united states,cir.the ftca waives the government sovereign immunity for tort claims arising out of the negligent conduct of government employees acting within the scope of their employment.id.thus,the government can be sued under circumstances where the united states,if a private person,would be liable to the claimant in accordance with the law of the place where the act or omission occurred.b.
the ftca waiver of immunity is limited,however,by the discretionary function exception,which bars claims based upon the exercise or performance or the failure to exercise or perform a discretionary function or duty on the part of a federal agency or an employee of the government,whether or not the discretion involved be abused.a.this exception restores the government immunity in situations where its employees are carrying out governmental or regulatory duties,faber united states,cir,and it marks the boundary between congress willingness to impose tort liability on the united states and the desire to protect certain decisionmaking from judicial.conrad united states,cir citing berkovitz united states,d.
to determine whether the challenged conduct falls within the discretionary function exception,we employ a analysis.first,we determine whether the challenged actions involve an element of judgment or choice.valdez,at quoting united states gaubert,d.our inquiry looks to the nature of the conduct,rather than the status of the actor,and the discretionary element is not met where a federal statute,regulation,or policy specifically prescribes a course of action for an employee to follow.berkovitz,at.internal quotation marks and citation omitted.in such event,our inquiry is at an end,and the discretionary function exception does not apply because the employee has no rightful option but to adhere to the directive.id.
however,if an element of choice or judgment is involved,we move to the second step of the analysis and determine whether that judgment is of the kind that the discretionary function exception was designed to shield.gaubert,at.quoting berkovitz,at.the exception protects only governmental actions and decisions based on considerations of public policy.id.at.quoting berkovitz,at.in other words,only those decisions grounded in social,economic,and political policy will be protected by the discretionary function exception.childers united states,cir.the exception will apply if the discretionary decision made is a permissible exercise of policy judgment,conrad,at,even if the decision is an abuse of the discretion granted.see a.
we acknowledge that the distinction between protected and unprotected decisions can be difficult to apprehend,but this is the result of the nature of governmental fall along a spectrum,ranging from those totally divorced from the sphere of policy analysis,such as driving a car,to those fully grounded in regulatory policy,such as the regulation and oversight of a bank.whisnant united states,cir citing united states,cir additional citation omitted.
notwithstanding the occasionally fine line between protected and unprotected activities,general principles exist.in particular,we have declined to find the discretionary function exception applicable where the challenged governmental activity involves safety considerations under an established policy rather than the balancing of competing public policy considerations.ara leisure servs.united states,cir internal alteration omitted.in ara leisure services,the park service decision to design the denali park road in alaska without guardrails was grounded in social,economic and political policy,but the park service failure to maintain a pass on that road in safe condition was not.there was no clear link between park service road policies and the condition of the pass,so the government failure to maintain the road fell in the category of ordinary negligence that the ftca did not immunize from suit.id.at quoting aslakson united states,cir.
in summers united states,cir,we similarly held that the park service failure to identify and warn of the danger of hot coals to barefoot visitors to a park beach resemble d more a departure from the safety considerations established in service policies,akin to the situation in ara,than a mistaken judgment in a matter clearly involving choices among political,economic,and social factors.id.at.and in seyler united states,cir,the discretionary function exception did not preclude a claim against the bureau of indian affairs by a motorcyclist injured on an indian reservation road that had no posted speed limit signs.the decision not to provide such signs was not of the nature and quality that congress intended to shield from tort liability,and nothing in the record demonstrated that the failure to post any speed limits actually resulted from a protected policy decision.id.at.
most recently,in oberson dep t of agriculture,cir,we held that the forest service,in raising the speed limit on a snowmobile trail to without first assuring the safety of travel up to that speed,did not make a decision grounded in public policy or competing policy considerations.id.at.although the decision to open a particular trail or to adopt a speed limit after warranting the safety of that speed was protected,the service c ould not claim that its failure to warn of hazardous conditions at that speed wa s protected by the discretionary function exception.id.at emphasis added.this was especially true given the absence of evidence that the agency failure to post a warning or to remedy a known hazard was the product of a policy choice.id.at.
