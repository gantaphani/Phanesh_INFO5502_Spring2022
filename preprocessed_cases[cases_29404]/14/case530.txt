in,the legislature enacted labor code section a statute that barred the admission of california occupational safety and health act provisions in employee negligence actions against nonemployers.labor code section created an exception to the common law rule,codified in evidence code section,that statutes may be admitted to establish a standard or duty of care in negligence actions.
in,the legislature substantially amended section,which now provides in part sections and of the evidence code shall apply to this division and to occupational safety and health standards adopted under this division in the same manner as any other statute,ordinance,or regulation.we granted review to decide whether,and to what extent,the amendments repealed the ban on the admission of provisions in third party negligence actions.we conclude that the amendments restore the common law rule and allow use of provisions to establish standards and duties of care in negligence actions against private third parties.
however,this case involves a preamendment accident.the use of provisions to establish the standard of care and to shift the burden of proof to defendant was an impermissible retroactive application of the amendment,and the error was not harmless.we therefore affirm the court of appeal reversal of judgment for plaintiff.
procedural and factual background 
on december,plaintiff rowdy elsner,a roofer employed by hoffman roofing,injured his right ankle when a scaffold collapsed beneath him at a construction site in the city of coronado.defendant carl uveges was the general contractor for the project,a pair of homes.the day before the accident,sean frey,a carpenter employed by uveges,had constructed the temporary wood plank scaffold to assist his installation of plywood panels on the second story of the structure.uveges acknowledged that he was directly responsible for supervising and controlling the work in order to ensure required safety practices were followed.
elsner sued uveges and uveges joint venturer on the project,asserting causes of action for negligence,premises liability,breach of nondelegable duty,failure to provide a safe place of work,and peculiar risk in january,before trial,uveges moved in limine for an order excluding references to provisions and their alleged violation.he argued that under section,testimony that the scaffolding violated provisions was inadmissible for any purpose in an employee third party action.see spencer macdonald constr.d.mackey campbell construction d.the trial court denied the motion.it ruled that as a result of the amendments to section,which took effect january,provisions were now admissible in a third party action.
the matter proceeded to jury trial against uveges only.based on its in limine ruling,the court permitted testimony by elsner expert as to how the scaffold violated provisions.having granted a separate evidentiary motion made by elsner during trial,the court also prevented uveges from eliciting expert testimony that the scaffold as constructed was customary and met the standard of care for such construction jobs.it gave the jury special instructions based on duties created by the labor code,and regulations setting standards for the nailing,anchoring,size,and railing of scaffolds,tit.the court then instructed the jury on the principles of negligence per se 
the jury returned a special verdict finding uveges percent negligent and his negligence a cause of elsner injuries.it found elsner employer not negligent the jury awarded elsner in economic damages,in noneconomic damages,and costs.it awarded state fund.
on appeal,uveges argued that notwithstanding the amendments to section,the admission of testimony concerning applicable provisions,the exclusion of uveges expert testimony,and the issuance of jury instructions based on negligence per se were error.the court of appeal agreed and reversed.it concluded that when the legislature amended section,it did not intend to change the existing rule against admitting provisions in third party actions to establish negligence per se.we granted review.
discussion 
interpretation of section statutory background 
the provisions of are intended to assur e safe and healthful working conditions for all california working men and women by authorizing the enforcement of effective standards,assisting and encouraging employers to maintain safe and healthful working conditions,and by providing for enforcement in the field of occupational safety and health.until,these provisions were routinely admitted in workplace negligence actions to show the standard of care,and their violation was treated as negligence per se.see,de cruz reid cal d,kuntz del webb constr.cal d,porter montgomery ward,cal d,armenta churchill cal d.
in,the legislature enacted section,which originally provided it is the intent of the legislature that the provisions of this division shall only be applicable to proceedings against employers brought pursuant to the provisions of chapter commencing with section and commencing with section of part of this division for the exclusive purpose of maintaining and enforcing employee safety.neither this division nor any part of this division shall have any application to,nor be considered in,nor be admissible into,evidence in any personal injury or wrongful death action arising after the operative date of this section,except as between an employee and his own employer.stats,ch.thereafter,both this court and the courts of appeal consistently held that section barred the introduction of provisions in actions between employees and third party tortfeasors.see,griesel dart industries,cal d,felmlee falcon cable tv th,d.
in,the legislature passed assembly bill reg.sess,which substantially amended section and various other provisions of the labor code relating to worker safety.as amended,section now provides it is the intent of the legislature that the provisions of this division,and the occupational safety and health standards and orders promulgated under this code,are applicable to proceedings against employers for the exclusive purpose of maintaining and enforcing employee safety.neither the issuance of,or failure to issue,a citation by the division shall have any application to,nor be considered in,nor be admissible into,evidence in any personal injury or wrongful death action,except as between an employee and his or her own employer.sections and of the evidence code shall apply to this division and to occupational safety and health standards adopted under this division in the same manner as any other statute,ordinance,or regulation.the testimony of employees of the d ivision of occupational safety and health shall not be admissible as expert opinion or with respect to the application of occupational safety and health standards.it is the intent of the legislature that the amendments to this section enacted in the regular session shall not abrogate the holding in brock state of california d.we must determine the effect of these amendments.
statutory interpretation 
in interpreting section,we seek to ascertain the legislature intent so as to effectuate the purpose of the law.in re cal th,d.we begin with the language of section.see wilcox birtwhistle cal th,d,people cruz cal th,d.
the key sentence of labor code section is in its second paragraph sections and of the evidence code shall apply to this division and to occupational safety and health standards adopted under this division in the same manner as any other statute,ordinance,or regulation.evidence code section allows judicial notice of state statutes and regulations,subd.a.evidence code section allows proof of a statutory violation to create a presumption of negligence in specified circumstances it codifies the common law doctrine of negligence per se,pursuant to which statutes and regulations may be used to establish duties and standards of care in negligence actions while adding this language,the amendments to labor code section also deleted language precluding admission of provisions in third party actions,eliminating a sentence that read neither this division nor any part of this division shall have any application to,nor be considered in,nor be admissible into,evidence in any personal injury or wrongful death action arising after the operative date of this section,except as between an employee and his own employer,as added by stats,ch,deleted by stats,ch.
in combination,the new language and the deletion indicate that henceforth,provisions are to be treated like any other statute or regulation and may be admitted to establish a standard or duty of care in all negligence and wrongful death actions,including third party actions.
nevertheless,uveges argues that the references to evidence code sections and serve a far more limited purpose.he contends that assembly bill reg.sess.assembly bill was an omnibus workers compensation reform bill,that the first paragraph of amended labor code section confines admissibility of provisions to actions against employers,and that the references in the second paragraph to evidence code sections and were intended only to make those sections applicable to workers compensation actions and administrative proceedings against employers.he points out that the references to these evidence code sections replaced an earlier proposed amendment providing this division and the occupational safety and health standards and orders promulgated under this code may have application to,be considered in,or be admissible into,evidence in any personal death or wrongful death action.assem.bill,as amended in.uveges argues,and the court of appeal agreed,that the deletion of clear language admitting provisions in third party actions reflected a desire to return to the rule of inadmissibility.we disagree.
first,uveges interpretation is at odds with the plain language of section.unlike the version,the current first paragraph does not say that provisions are admissible only in actions against employers.nor does the second paragraph contain any language suggesting that its effect is limited to workers compensation suits or administrative proceedings.
second,uveges interpretation is belied by the legislative history and purpose behind the amendments.to the extent a statutory text is susceptible of more than one reasonable interpretation,we will consider a variety of extrinsic aids,including the ostensible objects to be achieved,the evils to be remedied,the legislative history,public policy,contemporaneous administrative construction,and the statutory scheme of which the statute is a part.wilcox birtwhistle,supra,cal th at,d,quoting people woodhead cal d.had the legislature truly intended to reverse course and leave in place a general ban against admission of provisions,one would have expected it to drop the amendment entirely and simply revert to the original language of the statute,as it did for numerous other sections in the course of its consideration of assembly bill it did not.instead,both the preliminary and final versions of the amendment deleted the original language,language that had imposed a ban in clear and unmistakable terms.notwithstanding the august revision in wording,the legislative counsel digest accompanying the final chaptered bill still described the amendment to section as a departure from law excluding provisions.legis.counsel,assem.bill,stats,ch.
moreover,contrary to uveges assertion,assembly bill was not an omnibus workers compensation reform bill,but an omnibus measure intended to increase civil and criminal sanctions against those who maintain unsafe working conditions.a series of fatal industrial accidents provided the impetus for the bill.com.on public safety,analysis of assem.bill,as amended.assemblyman darrell steinberg introduced the bill as a worker health and safety measure designed to prevent injuries and close loopholes in various laws relating to workplace safety standards.assem.com.on public safety,analysis of assem.bill,as introduced.to that end,the bill strengthened civil,criminal,and administrative enforcement mechanisms for ensuring workplace safety.ibid.the los angeles county district attorney,a bill cosponsor,pushed for a repeal of the ban on using provisions in wrongful death and personal injury lawsuits,and the repeal was included as part of the expansion of civil remedies available for violation of safety standards.the net effect of the proposed reforms was to increase significantly the sanctions available against those in control of workplace safety,with the goal of deterring unsafe practices and reducing the number and severity of future accidents.this overall purpose is consistent with our reading of the plain language of the amendments as allowing provisions in third party suits and thereby facilitating private suits against workplace tortfeasors.see day city of fontana cal th,d.
third,uveges interpretation is inconsistent with the structure of section,which addresses public administrative proceedings in the first paragraph and private court actions in the second paragraph.as originally adopted,the first paragraph allowed the division of occupational safety and health to introduce provisions when proving employer violations see,in re ritter plastering,cal.osha app.bd.lexis in re hudson plastering,cal.osha app.bd.lexis.in contrast,the second paragraph governed private actions by injured parties and prohibited use of those same provisions except against one own employer see,spencer macdonald constr,supra,d at.
the amendments retained this subject matter division.assembly bill left in place the first paragraph broad rule of admissibility for provisions in public administrative enforcement proceedings in contrast,the bill substantially revised the second paragraph rules for private actions by injured parties.it deleted the clause admitting provisions in first party suits by employees against their own employers but excluding provisions from third party suits the bill retained the distinction between private first party and third party suits,but only for the issuance or failure to issue a citation neither the issuance of,or failure to issue,a citation by the d ivision of occupational safety and health shall have any application to,nor be considered in,any personal injury or wrongful death action,except as between an employee and his or her own employer.assem.bill,as introduced.this subject matter division indicates that the references to evidence code sections and relate to their use in private actions,not public enforcement proceedings.
fourth,uveges suggested interpretation renders part of section superfluous.the issue of negligence does not arise in either the strict liability workers compensation scheme or administrative enforcement proceedings,and thus a provision allowing application of negligence per se in those contexts would serve no real purpose.we will avoid constructions that render parts of a statute surplusage.arnett dal cielo cal th,d,brown superior court cal d.
instead,the most sensible explanation of the august amendment is this as originally drafted,the proposed amendment to section could have been interpreted to offer greater admissibility for provisions than for other statutes and regulations.instead of simply restoring the state of affairs,under which statutes could be admitted to establish a presumption of negligence only when the requirements of evidence code section were met,the original version of assembly bill would have provided an independent basis for admitting provisions whether or not these threshold criteria were met.the august amendment cured that anomaly consistent with the purpose articulated in an earlier bill summary,it effectively reextended to provisions the usual rule of admissibility of statutes and regulations in court proceedings.see com.on public safety,analysis of assem.bill,as amended.in doing so,the amendment also reextended the limits on admissibility,including the requirements that the exercise of due care be in issue,the statute actually apply to the defendant,the injured party be a member of the class the statute was intended to protect,and the injury result from an occurrence the statute was designed to prevent,subd.a.
uveges argues that a late change in the amendments precludes interpreting them as allowing admission of provisions in third party suits.on september,the senate added a sentence stating it is the intent of the legislature that the amendments to this section enacted in the regular session shall not abrogate the holding in brock state of california d.assem.bill,as amended in.in brock,the plaintiffs were injured in an explosion and fire at a paper plant.they sued numerous defendants,including the state of california.they contended that under,the state had a statutory duty to inspect facilities to ensure they were safe that it had breached that duty,and that the plaintiffs could maintain a tort action based on the breach.brock state of california,supra,d at.brock.the trial court sustained a demurrer,and the court of appeal affirmed.relying on section,the court of appeal rejected the plaintiffs attempt to make any duty of inspection enforceable in tort d operating control over safety conditions rests with the employer alone.since third parties,including the state,are not in control of such operations the legislature sensibly limited the applicability of the safety provisions to actions involving employers alone.brock,at.
uveges argues,and the court of appeal agreed,that the insertion of a reference to brock was intended to reinstate the broad ban on admission of provisions against third parties to show negligence per se.in contrast,elsner argues that the reference to brock was intended not to negate the general repeal of that ban,but to preserve an exception for suits against the state of california based on the duty to inspect worksites and enforce safety rules as to such suits,plaintiffs would still be precluded from using these statutory duties to support negligence liability.we conclude elsner narrower interpretation is correct.
first,when interpreting a statute,we must harmonize its various parts if possible,reconciling them in the manner that best carries out the overriding purpose of the legislation.russell stanford university hospital cal th,d.an interpretation of the brock clause as applying only to state duty suits avoids any contradictions with other parts of section.if we were to interpret the brock clause as preserving the general exclusion of provisions in third party suits,it would conflict with that portion of the statute admitting such provisions under evidence code sections and.the narrow reading of the brock clause is also consistent with the general purpose of assembly bill,a measure intended to deter unsafe workplace practices by expanding sanctions for the violation of safety standards.
second,elsner interpretation of the holding in brock is consistent with the line we have drawn between holdings and mere descriptive language harris capital growth investors xiv cal d.the holding of a case is coextensive with its particular facts.ibid.because under the facts of brock,the only issue was whether the state of california could be sued for breach of its duties,brock holding encompassed only the conclusion that the state could not be sued for any breach.the brock court recited the language of former section in arriving at this conclusion brock,supra,d at,but under harris this recitation of a relevant statute was descriptive language about the then extant state of the law,not a holding.
third,this interpretation explains why the legislature chose to reference brock,of all cases.had the legislature intended to leave in place a general ban against admission of provisions,it might have simply reverted back to the original language of the statute or chosen any of a number of more frequently cited cases to stand for the general proposition that regulations are inadmissible.see,griesel dart industries,supra,cal d at,widson international harvester d.spencer macdonald constr,supra,d at.like holmes dog that did not bark the fact the legislature did neither of these things is instructive and suggests that the aspects of brock the legislature intended to preserve are unique to that case.the one unique aspect of brock is its holding that breach of the state duty to enforce safety rules does not give rise to tort liability.brock,supra,d at.
fourth,the amendment subsequent legislative history supports the conclusion that the brock reference was not intended to change the rule allowing admission of provisions for purposes of negligence per se.after the senate amended assembly bill,the assembly was required to concur in the changes.the assembly floor analysis explained that under assembly bill,as amended september,and passed by the senate on september,the effect of the senate amendments was to c larify that cal osha statutes and regulations,but not citations or orders,may be admitted into evidence,in the same manner as other statutes and regulations.assem.floor analysis,assem.bill,as amended.
after the assembly passed assembly bill,the department of industrial relations submitted an enrolled bill report to the governor reflecting the same understanding as explained by the enrolled bill report,the amendment to section would change existing law to make statutes and regulations enforceable by the division of occupational safety and health admissible in personal injury and wrongful death lawsuits so that litigants in these actions could use these provisions as standards for determining negligence.of industrial relations,enrolled bill on assem.bill prepared for governor davis.the enrolled bill report noted that brock,supra,d,was the leading authority for excluding provisions establishing state mandatory duties from private lawsuits and concluded that the amendment relating to brock was probably intended to retain this partial state immunity.we agree.
finally,uveges contends that the amendment of an entirely different section,section,demonstrates the legislature did not intend to change the existing ban.assembly bill also added section,subdivisions b and c,the latter of which provides it is the intent of the legislature,in adding subdivision b to this section to codify existing regulations with respect to the responsibility of employers at worksites.subdivision b of this section is declaratory of existing law and shall not be construed or interpreted as creating a new law or as modifying or changing an existing law.but this subdivision plainly refers only to the changes made to section,subdivision b,which codified an existing regulation see,tit,it does not apply to any other section of assembly bill.as discussed throughout the bill legislative history,the purpose of the bill was to change existing law and specifically to expand civil and criminal penalties for failure to maintain a safe workplace.when the legislature amends a statute,we will not presume lightly that it engaged in an idle act.california teachers governing bd.of rialto unified school dist.cal th,d.thus,we reject the assertion that despite having substantially reworked the language of section,the legislature intended no change in the law.
amici curiae on behalf of uveges argue that our interpretation of assembly bill generates equal protection and due process problems because on the one hand,it allows an injured plaintiff to submit a provision as proof of the standard of care,while on the other,it prevents a defendant from submitting evidence that the division of occupational safety and health investigated and issued no citation.amici curiae also complain that the statute unfairly permits employers,but not nonemployers,to submit proof that they were not cited for a violation.these comparisons are misleading.assembly bill is evenhanded,as it prevents nonemployer defendants from showing that no citation was issued but also prevents nonemployee plaintiffs from showing that a citation was issued.a legislative judgment was made that in third party cases such evidence,on either side,ought not to play a role in the jury deliberations.defendants have no constitutional entitlement to use such evidence,and its exclusion does not render unconstitutional an otherwise routine extension of the doctrine of negligence per se.nor is there any constitutional infirmity in the differing treatment of first party cases there too,the legislature created a level playing field,allowing employers to introduce proof of no citation,but also allowing employees to introduce proof that a citation was issued,evidence from which nonemployers like uveges are shielded.
we summarize our conclusions.the first paragraph of section addresses the applicability of provisions to administrative proceedings brought by the division of occupational safety and health against employers to enforce worker safety standards.the provisions of are broadly applicable to such proceedings.this paragraph has no bearing on actions such as the one in this case.
the second paragraph of section catalogues the rules for the admissibility of provisions in trial court personal injury and wrongful death actions.in general,plaintiffs may use provisions to show a duty or standard of care to the same extent as any other regulation or statute,whether the defendant is their employer or a third party.the lone exception arises when the state is the defendant based on actions it took or failed to take in its regulatory capacity in such cases,provisions remain inadmissible to show liability based on breach of the statutory duty to inspect worksites and enforce safety rules.
ii.application of section 
retroactivity 
in this case,elsner expert testified to the content of various provisions for purposes of establishing the relevant standard of care,tit.the jury was instructed on the requirements of these provisions,instructed on the duties imposed by sections,and,and instructed on negligence per se.this testimony and these instructions were consistent with section as amended.however,uveges contends the application of amended section to this case violates the presumption against the retroactive application of laws because the accident occurred before assembly bill took effect on january,
new statutes are presumed to operate only prospectively absent some clear indication that the legislature intended otherwise.tapia superior court cal d,tapia evangelatos superior court cal d,aetna cas.surety.acc.com.cal d,aetna casualty.however,this rule does not preclude the application of new procedural or evidentiary statutes to trials occurring after enactment,even though such trials may involve the evaluation of civil or criminal conduct occurring before enactment.tapia,at.this is so because these uses typically affect only future future conduct of the trial.such a statute is not made retroactive merely because it draws upon facts existing prior to its enactment instead,t he effect of such statutes is actually prospective in nature since they relate to the procedure to be followed in the future.citations.for this reason,we have said that it is a misnomer to designate such statutes as having retrospective effect.id.at.
in deciding whether the application of a law is prospective or retroactive,we look to function,not form.tapia,supra,cal d at,aetna casualty,supra,cal d at.we consider the effect of a law on a party rights and liabilities,not whether a procedural or substantive label best applies.does the law change the legal consequences of past conduct by imposing new or different liabilities based upon such conduct tapia,at.does it substantially affect existing rights and obligations aetna casualty,at.if so,then application to a trial of preenactment conduct is forbidden,absent an express legislative intent to permit such retroactive application.if not,then application to a trial of preenactment conduct is permitted,because the application is prospective.
the amendments to section were used in three ways in this case to allow provisions to be introduced to establish a duty of care,to allow provisions to be introduced to establish the standard of care,and to allow the burden of proof to shift to uveges once a violation of was found.we consider each in turn.
the admission of provisions imposing broader duties on a defendant than existed under the common law expands the defendant liability.it attaches tort liability to the violation of statutes and regulations that previously could give rise only to civil and criminal penalties.see.because such a use impos es new or different liabilities based upon past conduct tapia,supra,cal d at,it is retroactive.
here,however,the admission of sections,and did not expand uveges common law duty of care.these provisions imposed on uveges the duty to furnish a safe place of employment,to use safe practices and procedures,and to provide and use appropriate safety devices and safeguards.but uveges already owed elsner a common law duty to provide safe equipment w hen a hirer of an independent contractor,by negligently furnishing unsafe equipment to the contractor,affirmatively contributes to the injury of an employee of the contractor,the hirer should be liable to the employee for the consequence of the hirer own negligence.mckown stores,cal th,d.at trial,this case proceeded on a single theory uveges negligently furnished unsafe scaffolding that contributed to elsner injury.that frey,uveges agent,constructed the scaffolding from which elsner fell was undisputed.also undisputed was that when uveges furnished scaffolding for the construction project,he had a common law duty to furnish safe scaffolding.the principal issues were breach,causation,and comparative negligence whether the scaffolding met the standard of care,whether any defects contributed to elsner injuries,and whether elsner own conduct contributed to his injuries.thus,uveges can not complain that the jury verdict in this case arose from a retroactive expansion of his duty of care.
we reach a different result with respect to the use of provisions to establish the standard of care and shift the burden of proof.morris pacific electric railway company cal d,is instructive.in morris,an automobile driver sued the defendant railway following a collision with one of the defendant trains.the railway requested,and was erroneously denied,an instruction that if the plaintiff was speeding,he was contributorily negligent as a matter of law and was barred from recovery.id.at.before this court,the plaintiff argued that any error was harmless because after the accident and trial the legislature changed the presumption of negligence arising from speeding from a conclusive to a permissive one and shifted the burden of proof to the opposing party to prove that the driver was in fact negligent.id.at.we rejected the notion that these legislative changes were purely procedural and evidentiary and thus would apply prospectively to any retrial,rendering the error in the first trial harmless.instead,we held that the defendant had a substantive right to have the case tried under the rules of negligence per se applicable at the time of the accident,and that the changes in the application of negligence per longer letting the speed limit define the plaintiff standard of care and shifting the burden of proof to the not be applied retroactively to a preamendment accident.id.at.
the same principles and conclusions apply in this case,where the trial court instructed the jury on new postaccident rules with respect to the standard of care and burden of proof.though superficially procedural and evidentiary,assembly bill new rules would,if applied here,change the legal consequences of uveges past conduct by making him potentially liable for conduct that might have satisfied the applicable common law standard of care but not specific provisions.to allow a jury in to decide whether uveges had breached his duty of care in by considering provisions not previously admissible would be to apply the new law of today to the conduct of yesterday.fox alexis cal d,quoting pitts perluss cal d.nothing in the text of assembly bill or its legislative history indicates that the legislature intended retroactive application.thus,application of amended section to this case was error.
harmless error analysis 
we consider whether the error was harmless.we will not reverse a judgment unless after an examination of the entire cause,including the evidence,it appears the error caused a miscarriage of justice.cal,art.vi.in the case of civil state law error,this standard is met when there is a reasonable probability that in the absence of the error,a result more favorable to the appealing party would have been reached.soule ge
