statement of the case 
procedural background 
on july,a grand jury indicted anderson and two corporate defendants,bill harbert international construction,bhic and bilhar international establishment harbert international establishment bilhar,for conspiracy to violate of the sherman antitrust act,count one and conspiracy to defraud the united states under count two.anderson pleaded not guilty to both counts of the indictment.before trial began,bilhar negotiated a plea agreement with the government in which bilhar pleaded guilty to count one and paid a fine of million.in return,the government dismissed the indictment against bhic.
anderson went to trial and the jury found anderson guilty on both counts.anderson moved for a judgment of acquittal at the close of the government case,at the close of all evidence,and after the jury returned its verdict.the district judge denied the motion each time.anderson was sentenced to months of incarceration and was ordered to pay a fine of.the district court allowed anderson to remain free pending the outcome of any appeal.anderson then perfected this appeal.
factual background 
anderson served as president of bilhar from to.bilhar is the foreign affiliate of bhic,an alabama corporation whose business consisted primarily of providing support services to the bidding and construction of international projects.
as a result of the camp david peace accords in the late,the united states agreed to fund construction projects to improve the treatment of drinking and waste water in egypt.the egyptian government awarded the projects based on sealed competitive bids from companies prequalified by usaid.in turn,the companies were paid by usaid.the projects included pump stations,pipelines,and wastewater treatment facilities.
several companies,including bilhar,were prequalified to bid on the egyptian usaid projects.bilhar and bhic established a joint partnership with jones construction jones of north carolina and was prequalified as a bidder for usaid.a bill harbert entity held a controlling share of the joint venture throughout the prequalification stages.
three other companies,abb susa,susa,the george fuller company fuller,and construction,also bid on at least one of the three contracts.these companies were either subsidiaries of or wholly owned by foreign.philipp holzmann,a german company headquartered in frankfurt,owned jones.peter schmidt,a prominent leader in the conspiracy,was the supervisor of holzmann international operations and a member of its management board.he also supervised holzmann subsidiaries such as jones.abb asea brown boveri,a company,was the parent company of susa.the archirodon group,a panamanian company,owned fuller.bilfinger berger bhbh,a german company,was the parent company of.
the prequalified bidders conspired to manipulate the competitive bids on the contracts by designating which company would win the bid in question before the bids were submitted.the bidders also arranged loser fees,lucrative subcontracts,or promises of winning future bids for the other bidders.the winning bidder added these costs into its bid.as a result,usaid paid not only an inflated price for the project,but also the loser fees for the bidders.
in,usaid solicited bids from prequalified bidders to connect a wastewater treatment facility to pumping stations with nineteen kilometers of pipe in cairo,egypt.three entities were prequalified to bid on the project the joint venture,and fuller.prior to the opening of the bids on august,peter schmidt contacted dieter kadenbach,a member of supervisory board.kadenbach met schmidt at schmidt offices in frankfurt,germany.representatives of the other bidders,including anderson,were also present.schmidt proposed that the companies rig the bids on contract to ensure that would win the contract.schmidt contacted kadenbach several weeks later and sought to work out the details.they agreed that would submit a higher bid than.in exchange,schmidt agreed to pay two to three percent of the price of contract,or about.
schmidt also worked out bid rigging agreements with representatives from fuller,the third qualified bidder on contract.on august,gunter niebergall,a holzmann employee schmidt supervised,negotiated the terms of an agreement with constantine iatrou,an employee of archirodon,fuller parent company.the agreement provided that fuller would only serve as a subcontractor to on the project.holzmann agreed to compensate fuller for not bidding by either awarding fuller a subcontract and paying archirodon a fee equal to three percent of the remaining contract value,or holzmann would pay archirodon a five percent fee of contract.additionally,would not bid against fuller for future usaid projects of approximately the same value.these details were specifically enumerated in the agreement.
the same day this agreement was signed,a letter was sent on harbert letterhead to the contract project owner,cairo wastewater organization cwo,on behalf of the joint venture.the letter informed cwo that needed to increase its previously submitted bid by three to five percent due to price changes and other circumstances.
when the bids were opened,bid of million was the low bid.bid million and fuller did not submit a bid at all.before the bids were opened,engineers for cwo estimated the cost would be about million.because of the large discrepancy,cwo and usaid engaged in a series of competitive negotiations with and and scheduled a second round of bids for december.
prior to the december bidding,schmidt met with iatrou,anderson,and several others on december.they discussed the august agreement and negotiated a lower payoff on the scheme.anderson wrote down the new agreement and signed it.schmidt scratched out anderson name on the document because he was an american and this agreement was between european companies.schmidt and iatrou signed the document instead.
the companies revised bids were opened on december.was awarded contract on april.payment for services on the contract was made directly to from the treasury.made its payments to,fuller,and holzmann as they had agreed.when confusion arose as to when the payments between the conspirators were due,anderson,schmidt,iatrou,and others met in frankfurt,germany.iatrou and schmidt corresponded frequently about the issue,always referring to anderson in the letters as our friend or their contact in the completed the work on contract in.the total contract price was.earned a profit of on the project.
contract involved the construction of large sewer tunnels in alexandria,egypt.was originally the only bidder on the contract,but their bid was deemed too high by cwo and usaid.bids were solicited a second time,to be due on november.two months before the bidding date,schmidt called a meeting in his frankfurt offices with werner hoffmeister,a representative of parent company.anderson also attended the meeting.schmidt asked hoffmeister to rig bid such that could win the contract.hoffmeister told schmidt that was very interested in competing for the project.moreover,because there was another prequalified bidder,mk,based in boise,idaho,there could be no effective agreement unless all three bidders agreed.schmidt said he would ask anderson to contact mk.anderson did not make any response to this request,and hoffmeister understood that anderson would follow through with schmidt instructions.two mk representatives testified that anderson had not discussed with them rigging their bid,but anderson did take a trip to boise less than a month before the bidding date of contract.his hotel receipt for the trip shows mk business address as his contact information.
two weeks after the frankfurt meeting,schmidt called hoffmeister to inform him that mk would not agree to rig the bids.schmidt and hoffmeister therefore agreed to include a loser fee in their bids such that if either company won the contract,it would pay the other a set sum of money 
at a joint venture meeting prior to the bid date on contract,anderson told johnny ollis,an employee of,that anderson needed room to maneuver in setting the bid.ollis responded that they still needed to submit a competitive bid.anderson replied that all the companies were on board and part of the frankfurt club.holzmann had set it up,he said.ollis was distressed by anderson comments and changed the subject.
ultimately,mk submitted a bid on the contract but did not submit one.won the bid and paid a reduced lump sum.
in,cwo solicited bids for a wastewater treatment project in egypt referred to as abu rawash.the bids were due on july.prior to the due date,schmidt contacted giovanni greselin,a susa supervisor,and requested that greselin come to frankfort to discuss construction contracts.greselin went to frankfurt knowing that schmidt would propose a agreement.
at the meeting,schmidt proposed an arrangement in which would bid high on contract and susa would bid high on a project in europe.the parties also agreed that would be paid about million in exchange for submitting a higher bid.greselin indicated that he was interested in the deal but did not have the authority to close the deal.
while greselin was in frankfurt,schmidt introduced him to a representative of.at trial,greselin could not remember or did not know the representative name.anderson own expense reports indicated,however,that he was in frankfurt about the time of the meeting for marketing,even though had no construction jobs in frankfurt.gordon burles,a area manager,kept anderson informed about the progress of contract,and anderson himself forwarded correspondence related to the project to schmidt.a letter from anderson to the cwo project manager clearly indicated that harbert,with anderson as its vice president,was the sponsoring partner of the joint venture.
after the meeting concluded,greselin met with his supervisor luigi ruggieri.greselin showed ruggieri a handwritten agreement or minutes from the meeting.ruggieri realized the agreement was illegal and destroyed the document,but nevertheless gave greselin permission to continue discussions with schmidt that would allow susa to win the contract.greselin oversaw the completion of the susa bid.when the bids were opened,susa had indeed submitted a lower bid than and was awarded the contract.schmidt met with ruggieri and made arrangements for susa payment to holzmann of million.a swiss subsidiary of holzmann sent susa an invoice for the million,and it was paid within a month.susa grossed a profit of more than million on the project.the last payment from the treasury to susa on the project was dated september.
the overarching conspiracy 
at trial,the government theory of the case was that the three contracts were part of one overarching conspiracy.this theory was essential to the government case in order to connect anderson to the bid rigging schemes on contracts and.the statute of limitations for a claim brought under the sherman act is five years,and the final payments on the first two contracts were made by january.the indictment against anderson was not returned until july.the final payments on contract,however,did not occur until september.thus,if the three contracts are part of an overarching conspiracy,the last act of the conspiracy did not take place until september,and the indictment would have been timely filed.the jury accepted the government argument and convicted anderson of conspiring to defraud the united states under the sherman act and.
the defendant raises the following issues on appeal 
whether there was sufficient evidence presented at trial to sustain anderson convictions.
whether the district court erred in its instruction of the jury concerning jurisdiction.
whether the district court used the proper sentencing guideline in sentencing anderson.

iv.analysis 
sufficiency of the evidence 
the jury found anderson guilty of violating the sherman antitrust act which provides that e very contract,combination in the form of trust or otherwise,or conspiracy,in restraint of trade or commerce among the several states,or with foreign nations is illegal.anderson was also found guilty of violation of,which provides that individuals may be fined or imprisoned for up to five years,or both,who conspire either to commit any offense against the united states,or to defraud the united states,or any agency thereof in any manner or for any purpose and who do any act to effect the object of the conspiracy.
anderson argues that the evidence presented at trial was insufficient to sustain his convictions for four reasons.first,he argues the government failed to prove the single,overarching conspiracy alleged in the indictment.second,he alleges that the charges against him are barred by the statute of limitations.third,he contends that the government failed to prove he knew of or was connected to any agreement,an essential element of a conspiracy.fourth,he avers that the government failed to establish subject matter jurisdiction over the foreign conduct in this case.
evidence of a single,overarching conspiracy 
anderson argues the evidence presented at trial fails to prove a single,overarching conspiracy encompassing the,as alleged in the indictment.he asserts that the negotiations on the contracts were wholly separate and that the government failed to present evidence of rigging or attempting to rig all three bids.the government responds that the evidence presented at trial was in accord with the allegations of the indictment and that a reasonable jury could have found a single conspiracy on the evidence presented at trial.two issues are thus before the court the substantive aspect of whether the government indeed established a single conspiracy,and,the procedural aspect of whether there is a material variance between how anderson was charged and what the government evidence established at trial.
anderson main argument is that the government evidence failed to establish and the jury wrongly found a single overarching conspiracy.this court narrowly reviews this argument we may reverse a jury finding that a single conspiracy existed only if the evidence,viewed in the light most favorable to the government,could not permit reasonable jurors to have found,beyond a reasonable doubt,that there was a single conspiracy.united states taylor,cir quoting united states brito,cir.three relevant factors determine whether a single conspiracy existed whether there was a common goal,the nature of the scheme,and the overlap of the participants.chastain,cir.no material variance exists if a reasonable fact finder could have found the existence of a single conspiracy.id.
we conclude that a reasonable jury could have found a single conspiracy on the facts of this case.first,the common goal of the overarching scheme was to steal from the united states by inflating the winning bids.the written agreement on the first contract,shows a common goal among the conspirators to reciprocate on future contracts,including contract,the third contract in this case.
second,anderson alleged comments to johnny ollis about the frankfurt club of bidders implies a group of individuals involved in a single enterprise.additionally,those involved in the scheme by which the bids were rigged worked in a consistent manner on all three contracts.schmidt contacted the participating bidders and arranged a meeting in frankfurt.the representatives of the bidders agreed which company would win the bid and what the others would receive for bidding high.the bid prices were raised to accommodate the higher anticipated profits as well as the losers fees.
finally,although the participants were different in each meeting,there was substantial overlap.schmidt clearly had a leading role in all three negotiations.this circuit permits the finding of a single conspiracy where a key man directs the activities,coordinating the individual efforts of various combinations of people.united states taylor,at.the jury also had testimonial evidence that anderson himself was present during the rigging of the bids on all three contracts.although some of the evidence presented at trial may be less than credible,as anderson argues,the weight of the evidence considered as a whole is sufficient to support the jury finding that the scheme was a single,overarching conspiracy.
because we hold that a reasonable fact finder could have found the existence of a single conspiracy,we necessarily conclude that no material variance existed between the indictment and the evidence presented at trial.see chastain,at.
statute of limitations issues 
the parties agree that the statute of limitations period for a charge brought under both the sherman antitrust act and is five years.anderson contends,however,that the charges brought against him were because the government failed to prove an overarching conspiracy,and the only purportedly illegal acts his involvement in contracts and to which the government connected anderson were completed more than five years before the indictment against him was filed.the final payments on contracts and were made by january.the indictment against anderson was not returned until july,than six and a half years later.the final payments on contract,however,did not occur until september.
as we concluded above,the government presented sufficient evidence to permit the jury to conclude that the three contracts were part of a single,overarching conspiracy.anderson was personally involved in the negotiations of the first two contracts,contracts and.furthermore,contrary to anderson assertion,circumstantial evidence indicates that anderson was in frankfurt during the negotiations of contract,knew about the negotiations,and agreed with the scheme.
the final payment of contract was not made until september,within the five year limitations period.anderson contends that because this payment was not an overt act in furtherance of the conspiracy but merely the result of the conspiracy,the statute of limitations bars prosecution against him.see united states doherty,cir.in doherty,however,the result of the conspiracy found not to extend the statute of limitations was the receipt of a salary.id.at.in this case,the final payment on contract and the acceptance of that payment was part of the conspiracy to illegally obtain government funds under the contract.see united states girard,cir united states walker,cir.the conspiracy continued until the conspirators received the full economic benefits anticipated by their scheme.girard,at.
because each of the contracts were part of the conspiracy and the last payment for contract occurred within the five years prior to anderson indictment,the evidence compels the conclusion that the charges against anderson were not barred by the statute of limitations.
anderson knowledge of and connection to the agreements 
anderson correctly asserts that an essential element of a conspiracy is that the alleged conspirator knew of and voluntarily participated in the agreement.united states gypsum,d.anderson maintains that he did not know of or voluntarily participate in the agreements essential to the conspiracy,and argues that the government has not proved that he did.
nevertheless,anderson participation in the conspiracies can be established at least by circumstantial evidence,if not by direct evidence.see united states lyons,cir.the government need only prove that anderson knew the general nature and scope of the conspiracy.united states clark,cir.anderson alleges the government failed to produce sufficient evidence to permit a reasonable fact finder to conclude he knew of the illegal agreements.because we construe the evidence in the light most favorable to the government and draw all reasonable inferences in its favor,it is difficult for anderson to establish that he knew nothing of the conspiracy and.the following is an abbreviated list of the evidence presented by the government suggesting anderson had knowledge of the illegality of the schemes 
a letter prepared for anderson signature written on august,the same day as the agreement on contract,raising bid price on the contract,inviting the inference that anderson knew the bid was being raised pursuant to the illegal agreement 
testimony by iatrou that anderson was present and taking part in the discussion at the december,meeting in which the agreement on contract was discussed and amended and that anderson wrote down the agreement 
testimony from witnesses,including schmidt,that anderson was schmidt contact in the united states 
payments pursuant to contract made from accounts,raising the inference that anderson knew of the transactions and approved their distribution 
testimony that anderson told johnny ollis that the agreement on contract had been set up by the frankfurt club,implying that anderson knew the bidding process had been subverted 
anderson purported presence at numerous meetings at which bids were rigged or agreements were discussed.
while the government evidence may not be overwhelmingly persuasive,taken together,it is more than sufficient to permit a reasonable fact finder to conclude anderson had knowledge of the agreements.anderson objection is therefore unfounded.
subject matter jurisdiction 
the sherman act reaches conduct outside the borders of the united states,but only when the conduct is intended to and does in fact produce a substantial effect on commerce in the united states hartford fire ins.california,d.in,congress enacted the foreign trade antitrust improvements act,a ftaia,to limit american courts jurisdiction over international commerce to transactions that affect the american economy.the ftaia provides that antitrust law does not apply to foreign commerce unless the conduct has a direct,substantial,and reasonably foreseeable effect on domestic commerce,and the effect gives rise to a claim under the sherman act.anderson contends the court lacked jurisdiction to entertain the sherman act charges against him because the activity at question in this case took place in foreign countries and the government failed to prove that it had a substantial effect on domestic commerce.anderson relies upon united states nippon paper indus,cir,for the proposition that his alleged conduct affected only foreign markets,as the structure of usaid is designed to target foreign markets in need of american economic assistance.
anderson jurisdictional arguments must be rejected for two reasons.first,the ftaia does not apply to the facts of this case.on its face,the ftaia only applies to conduct involving trade or commerce with foreign nations.there is no indication congress intended the ftaia to apply to government programs such as usaid in which the government pays companies who have bid against other companies to complete construction projects in foreign countries.virtually all of the money flowing in a usaid program is between the government and companies.al
