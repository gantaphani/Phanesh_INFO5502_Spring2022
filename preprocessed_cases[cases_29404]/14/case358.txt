the issue in this environmental case is whether the district court properly ordered the state of alaska to consider improving existing ferry service between juneau and the communities of haines and skagway before proceeding with expensive construction of a new ferry terminal and highway through a national forest.we hold the district court was correct under settled environmental law.
intervenor state of alaska appeals the district court judgment in favor of southeast alaska conservation council and five other groups collectively,seacc in their suit against the federal highway administration fhwa,the department of transportation,the forest service,the department of agriculture,and individual federal officials.alaska argues the district court erred in holding that the environmental impact statement eis issued by the fhwa for the juneau access improvements project violated the national environmental policy act nepa by failing to consider as a project alternative any plan that would improve existing ferry services in lynn canal,alaska,without the construction of new roads,ferries,or terminals.the district court vacated the fhwa record of decision rod,which approved alaska preferred alternative for the project,and enjoined all construction and activities that depended on the issuance of a valid eis,until one was prepared.we have jurisdiction under,and we affirm.
facts procedural history 
in the early,the alaska department of transportation and public facilities adot initiated the juneau access improvements project project to improve surface access between juneau and the communities of haines and skagway in the lynn canal corridor of southeast alaska.access to juneau is possible by air and water.
the available public surface transportation to and from juneau is the alaska marine highway system amhs,a ferry system operated by adot that provides transportation to many of alaska southeast coastal communities.amhs service from juneau connects to the continental highway system in prince rupert,british columbia,and bellingham,washington,to the south,and in haines and skagway to the north.the most commonly used access route to the continental highway system is the northbound ferry.
because the project would involve federal lands,federal funds,and environmental impacts,adot needed to obtain approvals and permits from several federal agencies,including the fhwa.in june,adot and the fhwa issued a draft eis for the project,as required by nepa.see ar.over the next two years,adot analyzed comments submitted regarding the draft eis and conducted further studies.in january,governor tony knowles announced that adot preferred alternative for the project was a plan in the draft eis calling for the construction of a highway along the eastern side of lynn canal to a new ferry terminal to be built near the katzehin river delta,but stated that the alternative would not be actively pursued during his administration because of its high cost.he directed adot to discontinue most work on the eis.
in,governor frank murkowski ordered the completion of the eis.because more than three years had passed since the release of the draft eis,adot,in december,reevaluated the adequacy of the earlier study.see a.adot determined,and the fhwa concurred,that there were sufficient changes in project alternatives and potential environmental impacts to warrant preparation of a supplemental draft eis.adot and the fhwa released the supplemental draft in january,and allowed public comment until march.among those who submitted comments was plaintiff appellee seacc.
the supplemental draft eis analyzed ten alternatives for the project.all but the first involved substantial construction expenditures.the alternatives included no action alternative continuation of existing mainline amhs service and fast ferry service in lynn canal,with the previously scheduled addition of a ferry shuttle service between haines and skagway alternatives,and various plans that would include construction of a highway along the eastern coast of lynn canal the east lynn canal highway that either stretched all the way to skagway or stopped at some point short of skagway where a new ferry terminal would be constructed to provide shuttle service to and from skagway and haines alternative building two new ferry terminals slightly north of juneau one on the east and one on the west side of lynn canal to provide ferry service between juneau and a mile highway to haines that would be constructed on the western coast of the canal the west lynn canal highway,with ferry service also offered between haines and skagway and alternatives,and four marine alternatives that would consist of constructing new ferries to operate in addition to continued mainline service in lynn canal.the supplemental draft eis identified alternative as the preferred alternative for the project.under alternative,the east lynn canal highway would extend from juneau to skagway,and a new ferry terminal would be constructed on the eastern shore of lynn canal near the katzehin river delta to provide shuttle service to haines.
in its comment letter to the fhwa,seacc asserted that the supplemental draft eis violated nepa.among other contentions,seacc argued that the analysis of project alternatives in the supplemental draft eis was inadequate because it failed to consider practicable ways of improving ferry service without expenditure of significant capital funds.citing to referendum votes and survey results,seacc asserted that a majority of the community in the lynn canal corridor preferred improving existing amhs ferry services over building a network of new roads.despite this public support,however,the supplemental draft eis failed to analyze as a project alternative any plan that would make changes to improve existing ferry services without expending significant capital funds for new roads,terminals,or ferries.seacc attached as an exhibit to its comment letter a may study by a consulting firm that suggested changes in ahms management structure,operations,and financial planning that would reduce costs to the state while improving the existing ferry service.seacc also suggested that scheduling changes,including revisions to current ferry routes,could be made to the existing services that would provide greater flexibility and improved opportunity for travel at a reduced user cost.
in august,adot issued a press release announcing that it had changed its preferred alternative for the project from alternative to alternative.alternative would terminate the new east lynn canal highway at a point north of the katzehin river delta,where a new terminal would be built to provide shuttle ferry service to skagway and haines.that service,in turn,would be supplemented by the new shuttle between skagway and haines contemplated in the no action alternative.the change in preference from alternative to alternative was necessitated by the fact that a portion of the east lynn canal highway,as envisioned by alternative,would run through lands subject to f of the department of transportation act.section f prohibits the secretary of transportation from authorizing the use of federal funds to finance the construction of highways through a public park,recreation area,wildlife and waterfowl refuge,or historic site,unless there is no prudent and feasible alternative to using that land.c.alternative did not run through lands subject to f.
adot and the fhwa issued the final eis in january.the final eis dropped three project alternatives considered in the supplemental draft eis alternatives,and from consideration,because the fhwa had determined that they would involve lands protected under f of the department of transportation act.it retained the remaining seven project alternatives included in the supplemental draft eis alternatives,and,and provided an analysis of each.the final eis identified alternative,involving construction of a new highway and ferry terminal,as the preferred alternative.in analyzing the environmental consequences of each of the remaining alternatives,the final eis identified several adverse environmental impacts that might result from the selection and completion of the preferred alternative.these included the loss of acres of wetlands and acres of terrestrial habitat,including acres of forest in reserves established by the united states forest service usfs,the possibility of up to a reduction in the brown bear habitat capability of the areas impacted by the construction of the east lynn canal highway,and the possible relocation of bald eagle nests,since the east lynn canal highway would be located within half a mile of bald eagle nests,and within feet of of those nests.responses to comments received during the comment period for the supplemental draft eis were included in an appendix to the final eis.addressing seacc concern that the eis analysis of ferry alternatives did not consider practicable ways of improving ferry services without expending significant public funds,adot and the fhwa said only that it could not increase service in the lynn canal without reducing service elsewhere 
t he no action alternative is a projection of future lynn canal service based on existing amhs assets and the most recent southeast alaska transportation plan.amhs has experimented with different levels and types of service in lynn canal and would likely continue to do so in the future.while there are many opinions on ways to improve ferry service in lynn canal,there is no way amhs can meet the purpose and need for the project solely by making changes to the current operational model.absent construction of new vessels,an increase in capacity would require reduction in service outside of lynn canal.
adot began distributing the final eis to the public and made the document available electronically on its website in late january.the environmental protection agency published notice of the availability of the final eis in the federal register on february.see notice of availability of environmental impacts statements.adot encouraged interested parties to submit their comments on the final eis by march.seacc,on march,submitted a comment letter addressing the organization concerns with the final eis.seacc faulted the final eis as unreasonable for not considering an alternative to the project that would increase capacity and flexibility without requiring substantial initial capital expenditures.seacc said 
rather than building new ferries,roads,or terminals,adot could make more efficient use of the assets it currently owns.through more efficient management and scheduling,capacity can be increased dramatically,costs to the state and user can be lowered,and flexibility and reliability can be increased.all of this can be accomplished without the enormous initial expense of money,tremendous dangers,and ecological and cultural damage that would accompany adot preferred alternative.
seacc argued that the failure to consider such an alternative in the final eis violated nepa.
to remedy this deficiency,seacc proposed a better ferry service alternative that included specific changes to improve the current ferry system in lynn canal,without resorting to the construction of new ferries or terminals.the suggested changes included modifications to the current ferry schedule,reassigning mainline vessels,increasing the staff at the ferry terminals,increasing the reservation staff,upgrading the reservation website,producing and maintaining a reliable schedule two years in advance,increasing marketing,reducing fares,and improvements to the management structure.seacc explained that other configurations of this plan were possible,including the reassignment of vessels from other communities during periods of peak demand in lynn canal.seacc acknowledged that such changes would lower service to the communities from which the vessels were reassigned,but stated such reassignments would be temporary and predictable,meaning schedules could be developed far in advance to mitigate inconvenience.
on april,the fhwa issued an rod approving alternative as the proposed action for the project.in an appendix to the rod,the fhwa responded to the substantive comments it had received on the final eis.addressing seacc concern that the eis should have included an analysis of a project alternative that improved ferry services using existing assets,the fhwa said 
the final eis explains that a tsm alternative would require taking vessels from other parts of the system.reducing service in other parts of the system,or using vessels made available by vessel replacement in other system parts,would merely shift costs,avoiding capital costs in lynn canal while increasing operation cost.
on may,adot sent a letter to the fhwa requesting a right of way for the project from the usfs.the fhwa forwarded the request to the usfs,and on may,the usfs consented to the fhwa appropriation of the portion of the right of way that is on lands within the tongass national forest,for the purpose of constructing the east lynn canal highway.
in august,seacc commenced this action under the administrative procedure act apa seeking review of the project on the grounds that it violated nepa,the national forest management act,the bald eagle protection act,and the endangered species act.seacc complaint sought both declaratory and injunctive relief.it named federal agencies and officials as defendants,but the state of alaska sought and received permission to intervene as a defendant in the action.
seacc moved for summary judgment.seacc argued that the fhwa violated nepa when it refused to consider in the eis a reasonable alternative that called for improved ferry services using existing resources,and that the fhwa justifications for not considering this alternative were arbitrary.the district court granted seacc motion,holding that nepa had not yet been complied with.the court ruled that the eis failed to satisfy nepa requirements to consider or properly reject proposed alternatives.alaska envtl.ctr.kempthorne,cir.thus,the court vacated the rod,remanded the usfs decision granting a right of way to the fhwa,and enjoined all construction on the project and any activities dependent on the issuance of a valid eis.the court entered its final judgment in this matter on april,and the state timely appealed on june.see frap a b.the federal defendants appeal was voluntarily dismissed september.they have filed no briefs in this appeal.
