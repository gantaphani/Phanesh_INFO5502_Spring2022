procedural background 
plaintiff sued to recover the outstanding balance had failed to pay it under their contract.plaintiff first amended complaint alleged the following claims breach of written and oral contracts against open book account against account stated against common counts for work,labor,services materials furnished against action on a payment bond against lumbermens action on a contractor license bond against star insurance company and action on a stop notice release bond against safeco.the complaint prayed for judgment in the total amount of 
no cause of action was alleged against pinner,although it was identified as a defendant in the caption and in the body of the first amended complaint.pinner participated in the lawsuit,however,through trial and postjudgment motions.pinner,lumbermens,and safeco filed an answer containing a general denial and affirmative defenses.
before trial,plaintiff argued that evidence of pinner reliance on the release was inadmissible because it did not support an equitable estoppel defense for the sureties as a matter of law.the trial court rejected plaintiff argument the court concluded the doctrine of equitable estoppel was available as a defense to the sureties under the circumstances of this case,and approved a special verdict form asking the jury to make findings of fact relevant to whether the defense had been proven.
the jury found in favor of pinner,lumbermens,and safeco,and made the special finding that pinner reasonably relied on the release.judgment was entered in favor of pinner,lumbermens,and safeco.the court granted pinner,lumbermens,and safeco motion for prevailing party attorney fees and costs.
plaintiff appealed from both the judgment and the postjudgment order awarding pinner attorney fees and costs,arguing the trial court erred by concluding,as a matter of law,that the defense of equitable estoppel was available to lumbermens on the payment bond claim,based solely on pinner reliance on the release substantial evidence did not support the jury finding plaintiff intended that others rely on the release and the trial court erred by awarding pinner attorney fees and costs.
in an unpublished opinion,this court reversed the judgment,holding the trial court erred by concluding that lumbermens could assert equitable estoppel as a defense against plaintiff action on the payment bond,based solely on pinner reliance on an incorrect release.oldcastle precast pinner construction company,may,wl nonpub.opn.in light of our holding,we did not reach plaintiff other arguments regarding the sufficiency of the evidence plaintiff intended others to rely on the release or the award to pinner of attorney fees and costs.
following remand,plaintiff filed a motion for summary judgment,or for summary adjudication,of three specified causes of action the breach of written contract claim against the action for recovery on the payment bond against lumbermens and the action for recovery on the stop notice release bond against safeco.in support of the motion,plaintiff filed a separate statement setting forth proposed undisputed material facts.plaintiff relied on proposed undisputed material facts through in seeking judgment against,through in seeking judgment against lumbermens,and through in seeking judgment against safeco.plaintiff also filed plaintiff attorney declaration which authenticated certain documents plaintiff lodged with the court a notice of lodgment with attached exhibits including certain trial documents and testimony the declaration of plaintiff regional product manager and attached exhibits and a request that the court take judicial notice of certain documents filed earlier in the case to which the pertinent documents were attached.the separate statement cited portions of those filed documents as supporting evidence for plaintiff proposed undisputed material facts.
in opposing the motion,defendants filed a responsive separate statement of disputed material facts,which only listed plaintiff proposed undisputed material facts,and plaintiff had relied upon those four facts in the portion of its separate statement addressing its claim against lumbermens.as to each of those proposed undisputed material facts,the responsive separate statement stated the nature of defendants dispute and cited to pages through of the trial testimony of president,salvador altamirano.those seven pages of trial testimony were authenticated by defendants attorney,newton kellam,in his declaration,also filed in opposition to plaintiff motion.defendants did not propose any additional material facts disputed or undisputed in the responsive separate statement.
defendants did not file or otherwise assert any evidentiary objections to the evidence relied upon by plaintiff in its motion.plaintiff,however,filed objections to altamirano trial testimony relied on by defendants on the grounds they misstated his testimony and altamirano lacked personal knowledge of the assertions attributed to him.

discussion 
defendants contend the trial court erred by granting summary judgment against lumbermens on plaintiff claim for action for recovery on the payment bond and against safeco on plaintiff claim for recovery on a stop notice release bond.as we explain in detail post,plaintiff met its initial burden of proof on its claims against defendants.neither lumbermens nor safeco,however,met its burden of establishing a triable issue of material fact as to any element of the claim asserted against it or as to any available affirmative defense.the trial court,therefore,did not err by granting summary judgment against defendants.
standard of review and burdens of proof 
a trial court properly grants summary judgment where no triable issue of material fact exists and the moving party is entitled to judgment as a matter of law.citation.we review the trial court decision de novo,considering all of the evidence the parties offered in connection with the motion except that which the court properly excluded and the uncontradicted inferences the evidence reasonably supports.citation.merrill navegar,cal th,d.
section,subdivision p of the code of civil procedure provides for purposes of motions for summary judgment and summary adjudication a plaintiff or has met his or her burden of showing that there is no defense to a cause of action if that party has proved each element of the cause of action entitling the party to judgment on that cause of action.once the plaintiff or has met that burden,the burden shifts to the defendant or to show that a triable issue of one or more material facts exists as to that cause of action or a defense thereto.the defendant or may not rely upon the mere allegations or denials of its pleadings to show that a triable issue of material fact exists but,instead,shall set forth the specific facts showing that a triable issue of material fact exists as to that cause of action or a defense thereto.
the supreme court has explained h ow the parties moving for,and opposing,summary judgment may each carry their burden of persuasion production depends on which would bear what burden of proof at trial.again,in reader digest superior court cal d,we held to the effect that the placement and quantum of the burden of proof at trial were crucial for purposes of summary judgment.citation.thus,if a plaintiff who would bear the burden of proof by a preponderance of evidence at trial moves for summary judgment,he must present evidence that would require a reasonable trier of fact to find any underlying material fact more likely than,he would not be entitled to judgment as a matter of law,but would have to present his evidence to a trier of fact.by contrast,if a defendant moves for summary judgment against such a plaintiff,he must present evidence that would require a reasonable trier of fact not to find any underlying material fact more likely than,he would not be entitled to judgment as a matter of law,but would have to present his evidence to a trier of fact.aguilar atlantic richfield cal th,d,fns.omitted.
plaintiff met its initial burden of proof against lumbermens on the elements of its case,but lumbermens did not meet its burden of establishing the existence of a triable issue of material fact with respect to any of those works payment bonds 
public works payment bonds,governed by civil code section et,provide a cumulative remedy to unpaid subcontractors on public works projects.unlike private works contracts,an unpaid subcontractor on a public works project may not seek recovery from the real property.p rinciples of sovereign immunity do not permit liens for persons furnishing labor or supplies on public property citation.in the place of a lien,the unpaid subcontractor may proceed against the general contractor by way of the payment bond requirements of civil code section et.these statutes give to materialmen and laborers who furnish material for and render services upon public works an additional means of receiving compensation.citation.federal ins.superior court th,d,italics omitted.
civil code section,subdivision c requires that public works payment bonds inure to the benefit of materialmen and subcontractors of any tier of a public works project and that any such materialmen or subcontractors may maintain a direct action against the sureties,subd.c payment bond must,by its terms,inure to the benefit of any of the persons named in section so as to give a right of action to those persons or their assigns in any suit brought upon the bond federal ins.superior court,supra,th at,d.a surety liability under a public works payment bond arises when a contractor fails to pay for work performed by materialmen or subcontractors under the contract.federal ins.superior court,supra,th at,d.
plaintiff met its initial burden of proof on its claim for recovery on the payment bond.
in moving for summary judgment against lumbermens on its claim for recovery on the payment bond,plaintiff provided evidence establishing the following the project is a public works construction project pinner and entered into a subcontract under which subcontractor agreed to install concrete pilings for the project and plaintiff entered into a under which plaintiff agreed to supply concrete piling materials to for the project plaintiff supplied prestressed concrete piling materials to that satisfied the requirements of the contract documents and were not defective or deficient owed plaintiff for the prestressed concrete piling materials but only paid plaintiff,leaving an unpaid balance of lumbermens,as surety,posted the payment bond with the county of orange which,in conformity with civil code section,provided,if any subcontractor fails to pay for any materials used in or for or about the work under the contract the surety shall pay for the same plaintiff prepared a preliminary notice which was received by pinner on june,and plaintiff prepared a written notice on bond claim,dated october,which was received by lumbermens on october.
defendants neither objected to the evidence relied upon by plaintiff nor argue plaintiff failed to produce evidence relevant to any element of its claim.instead,citing hamburg stores,th,d,defendants argue plaintiff has not met its initial burden of proof because it failed to establish facts negating certain affirmative defenses,including release and estoppel.defendants contend they produced evidence that at least raised triable issues of material fact regarding the validity and issuance of the releases in question,and pinner reliance on the release and plaintiff did not meet its burden of proof that no such issues existed.
plaintiff initial burden of proof in moving for summary judgment,however,did not include disproving any affirmative defenses asserted by defendants.as discussed ante,code of civil procedure section,subdivision p provides a plaintiff meets the burden of showing there is no defense to a cause of action if that party has proved each element of the cause of action.upon meeting that burden,the burden shifts to the defendant to show that a triable issue of one or more material facts exists as to that cause of action or a defense thereto.code civ,subd.p,italics added see also aguilar atlantic richfield,supra,cal th at,d,summary judgment law in this state no longer requires a plaintiff moving for summary judgment to disprove any defense asserted by the defendant as well as prove each element of his own cause of action all that the plaintiff need do is to prove each element of the cause of action weil brown,cal.practice guide civil procedure before trial the rutter group,when plaintiff moves for summary judgment u nlike former law,it is not plaintiff initial burden to disprove affirmative defenses and asserted by defendant.hamburg stores,supra,th,d,in which the defendants moved for summary judgment,does not hold otherwise.
therefore,plaintiff met its initial burden of proof in moving for summary judgment against lumbermens by carrying its burden of producing evidence establishing the elements of its claim for recovery on the payment bond without regard to potential affirmative defenses.
lumbermens did not meet its burden of establishing a triable issue of material fact as to any of the elements of an action on a payment bond.
as discussed ante,once the plaintiff has met the initial burden,the burden shifts to the defendant or to show that a triable issue of one or more material facts exists as to that cause of action or a defense thereto.the defendant or may not rely upon the mere allegations or denials of its pleadings to show that a triable issue of material fact exists but,instead,shall set forth the specific facts showing that a triable issue of material fact exists as to that cause of action or a defense thereto.code civ,subd.p.
defendants do not contend lumbermens carried the burden of producing evidence establishing a triable issue of material fact with regard to any of the evidence produced by plaintiff in meeting its initial burden.the responsive separate statement did not advance additional disputed or undisputed material facts.although it challenged four of plaintiff proposed undisputed material facts,each of them related to the availability of affirmative defenses,not to the elements of recovery on a payment bond 
plaintiff met its initial burden of proof against safeco,but safeco did not meet its burden of establishing the existence of a triable issue of material fact as to any of the elements of plaintiff case.notice release bonds 
in addition to seeking recovery on a payment bond,a subcontractor can recover sums due for supplies provided to a public works project by serving a stop notice,under civil code section et,upon the public entity responsible for the public works project.it is the duty of the public entity,upon receipt of a stop notice,to withhold from the original contractor money due or to become due to that contractor in an amount sufficient to answer the claim stated in the stop notice and to provide for the public entity reasonable cost of any litigation thereunder.
civil code section authorizes the posting of a stop notice release bond as follows if the original contractor or subcontractor disputes the correctness or validity or enforceability of any stop notice,the public entity may,in its discretion,permit the original contractor to file with the public entity a bond executed by a corporate surety,in an amount equal to percent of the claim stated in the stop notice conditioned for the payment of any sum which the stop notice claimant may recover on the claim together with his costs of suit in the action,if he recovers therein.upon the filing of such bond with the public entity,the public entity shall not withhold any money from the original contractor on account of the stop notice.the surety or sureties upon such bond shall be jointly and severally liable to the stop notice claimant with the surety or sureties upon any payment bond see department of industrial relations seaboard surety th,d although an action on a payment bond may be joined with an action on a stop notice claim,the two are independent remedies and one is cumulative to the other.
plaintiff carried its initial burden.
in addition to reiterating the undisputed material facts established to support summary judgment on the payment bond against lumbermens,plaintiff also produced evidence establishing that after failed to pay it for concrete piling materials for the project,plaintiff filed a stop notice with the county of orange in the amount of on january,and safeco,as surety,posted a stop notice release bond in the amount of percent of the amount of the stop notice filed by plaintiff,and the county of orange released the money that would otherwise have been withheld from pinner as a result of the stop notice filed by plaintiff.
in the opening brief,defendants generally argue that plaintiff did not meet its initial burden of proof with regard to its motion for summary judgment.however,the responsive separate statement did not mention plaintiff claim against safeco or offer any opposition to it.furthermore,defendants did not object to plaintiff supporting evidence and do not argue plaintiff failed to produce evidence in support of an element of the case for recovery on a stop notice release bond against safeco.defendants do not even address any elements of a case for an action on a stop notice release bond in either of their appellate briefs.
the trial court,therefore,correctly concluded plaintiff carried its initial burden in establishing its claim for an action on a stop notice release bond and the burden shifted to safeco to either produce evidence disputing any element of plaintiff claim or produce evidence demonstrating a triable issue of material fact as to an affirmative defense.
safeco did not carry its burden of showing the existence of a triable issue of material fact as to any element of plaintiff stop notice release bond claim.
as the responsive separate statement fails to identify plaintiff claim for action on the stop notice release bond against safeco,it also fails to state that any of plaintiff proposed undisputed material facts were in dispute,or advance any additional facts that would show the existence of a triable issue of material fact as to any element of that claim.neither of defendants appellate briefs argues safeco showed the existence of a triable issue of material fact as to an element of plaintiff claim against it.defendants,therefore,did not show the existence of a triable issue of material fact as to plaintiff case for recovery on the stop notice release bond.
defendants failed to carry their burden of proving a triable issue of material fact as to any affirmative defense against the payment bond claim or the stop notice release bond claim.
we next address whether lumbermens or safeco carried its respective burden of showing the existence of a triable issue of material fact as to any available affirmative defense.as noted in sections iii.and iii.of this opinion,defendants responsive separate statement does not identify plaintiff claim for action on the stop notice release bond against safeco or offer any opposition to that claim.code civ,subd.b providing trial court discretion to grant summary judgment motion when opposing party fails to comply with separate statement requirement.for purposes of our analysis,we construe the contents of the responsive separate statement to apply to plaintiff claims against both defendants.because lumbermens and safeco arguments regarding affirmative defenses overlap,we address them together.for the reasons discussed post,we conclude neither lumbermens nor safeco carried its burden.
defendants failed to show the existence of a triable issue of material fact as to whether plaintiff waived or released its claims against them.
defendants contend they successfully opposed plaintiff motion for summary judgment by showing the existence of a triable issue of material fact as to whether plaintiff waived or released its claims.code of civil procedure section,subdivision b requires that an opposition to a motion for summary judgment shall include a separate statement that responds to each of the material facts contended by the moving party to be undisputed,indicating whether the opposing party agrees or disagrees that those facts are undisputed.the statement also shall set forth plainly and concisely any other material facts that the opposing party contends are disputed.each material fact contended by the opposing party to be disputed shall be followed by a reference to the supporting evidence.failure to comply with this requirement of a separate statement may constitute a sufficient ground,in the court discretion,for granting the motion.see weil brown,cal.practice guide civil procedure before trial,supra,failure to comply with this requirement may,in the court discretion,constitute a sufficient ground for granting the motion.
the requirement of a separate statement from the moving party and a responding statement from the party opposing summary judgment serves two functions to give the parties notice of the material facts at issue in the motion and to permit the trial court to focus on whether those facts are truly undisputed.parkview villas,supra,th,d.
the entire substantive portion of defendants responsive separate statement states as follows 
the responsive separate statement reference,is to the trial testimony of altamirano copies of those pages of trial testimony were attached to kellam declaration.through altamirano testimony,defendants contend they demonstrated the existence of a triable issue of material fact as to whether was aware that the release was a mistake or agreed to rescind and replace the release with a corrected release.
the trial court,however,properly sustained plaintiff evidentiary objections to altamirano testimony on the grounds the responsive separate statement misstated altamirano testimony and altamirano lacked personal knowledge of assertions defendants attributed to him.in the cited pages of trial testimony,altamirano did not testify whether agreed to rescind,discard,and replace the release with a corrected release.nor did he testify was unaware the release was a mistake until september.
as pointed out in plaintiff evidentiary objections,altamirano testified about general practices of requesting releases and forwarding them to prime contractors,without regard to the events surrounding receipt of the subject release.he testified an employee handled such releases.he did not testify whether that employee,or any other employee responsible for handling releases,was aware the release was a mistake or agreed to its rescission and replacement with a corrected release.
aside from citing to altamirano testimony,defendants did not offer any evidence to show the existence of a triable issue of material fact as to whether plaintiff waived or released its claims.nor did defendants advance any additional material facts on this subject.
at oral argument,defendants argued plaintiff separate statement itself created a triable issue of material fact as to the applicability of release or waiver.not so.although the separate statement acknowledged the release,it also cited admissible evidence showing that,within to minutes,agreed to rescind and discard the release and replace it with a corrected release.
therefore,defendants failed to carry the burden of showing the existence of a triable issue of material fact as to whether plaintiff waived or released its claims against them.
safeco failed to show a triable issue of material fact as to the affirmative defense of equitable estoppel.
defendants contend the trial court erred by granting plaintiff motion for summary judgment against safeco because defendants properly raised the defense of equitable estoppel to plaintiff claim for action on the stop notice release bond.we first address defendants contention the trial court erred by relying on our earlier opinion to conclude the affirmative defense of equitable estoppel was unavailable to safeco as a matter of law.oldcastle precast pinner construction company,supra.
in our prior opinion,we held,as a matter of law,lumbermens could not assert the affirmative defense of equitable estoppel as surety on the payment bond,solely based on pinner reliance on an incorrect release signed by plaintiff.oldcastle precast pinner construction company,supra.lumbermens does not argue otherwise in this appeal.
our prior opinion did not address the same question as to safeco as surety on the stop notice release bond under civil code section.a surety may defend an action on a public works stop notice release bond based on any defense the general contractor could assert to payment of the claim,defects in performance of work by claimant.croskey et,cal.practice guide insurance litigation the rutter group,milo equipment elsinore valley mun.water dist.d.contractor as a principal is liable on stop notice release bond.a general contractor possible defenses against an action on a stop notice release bond inure to the benefit of the bond surety.thus,if equitable estoppel were proven as a defense in favor of pinner,that defense would inure to the benefit of safeco.
thus,the trial court incorrectly granted summary judgment against safeco on the basis that our earlier opinion compelled such a result.however,the trial court also granted summary judgment against defendants on the ground no triable issue of material fact existed as to plaintiff claims against them.we therefore next consider if defendants established a triable issue of material fact as to whether plaintiff might be equitably estopped from asserting its claim against safeco.
to prove equitable estoppel,one must show a representation or concealment of material facts made with knowledge,actual or virtual,of the facts to a party ignorant,actually and permissibly,of the truth with the intention,actual or virtual,that the ignorant party acted on it and the ignorant party relied on it.san diego mun.credit union smith d.the responsive separate statement does not identify equitable estoppel as a defense raised in opposition to plaintiff motion for summary judgment or the elements of that defense.
defendants contend the portion of kellam declaration summarizing the trial testimony of a pinner representative,denny orem,is sufficient to show the existence of a triable issue of material fact that pinner relied to its detriment on the release it is not.neither kellam declaration nor orem testimony is referenced in the responsive separate statement.the trial court,therefore,had discretion not to consider such evidence.san diego watercrafts,wells fargo bank th,d whether to consider evidence not referenced in a separate statement rests with the sound discretion of the trial court,and we review the decision to consider or not consider this evidence for an abuse of that discretion.
nothing in the record,however,shows the trial court did not consider kellam declaration,and defendants do not argue otherwise on appeal.even assuming the trial court considered the summary of orem trial testimony contained in kellam declaration,that summary is insufficient to establish a triable issue of material fact.orem sworn testimony was not before the trial court,and no copies of the trial transcript were attached to kellam declaration or otherwise before the trial court on the motion for summary judgment.thus,the court had before it only kellam description of such testimony,which neither demonstrated orem personal knowledge of pinner reliance on the release nor her competence to testify
