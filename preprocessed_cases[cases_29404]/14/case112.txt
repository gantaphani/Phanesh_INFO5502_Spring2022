the question which we must answer on this appeal is whether the district court properly approved two settlement agreements among the litigants over the objection of one of the parties,kvaerner kvaerner.because we hold that the district court did not err,we affirm.
this litigation arose from a million project involving the construction of a steel plant in alabama.the project owner,ipsco steel,ipsco hired kvaerner as its project manager.under the project management agreement pma,kvaerner was responsible for recommending the contracts that ipsco awarded to various subcontractors and suppliers.the pma also specified that kvaerner was ipsco agent for the purpose of administering supplier contracts and managing and coordinating suppliers work and that,in connection with liens and disputes,kvaerner was to protect ipsco interests at all times.
the pma prescribed certain penalties and incentives.kvaerner expressly warranted that the aggregate cost of the project would not exceed a guaranteed maximum price of million and that it would reimburse ipsco for any costs in excess of million.if,however,the aggregate cost came in below the guaranteed maximum price,ipsco promised to share of the savings with kvaerner.
the pma anticipated that certain disputes would arise with the suppliers and it authorized kvaerner to serve as ipsco litigation manager.the relevant provision,which is section x in the pma,reads 
the project manager kvaerner shall be primarily responsible for the management and resolution,either with its own resources or through legal counsel or other consultants,of claims and disputes between suppliers and with suppliers within the guaranteed portion of the project provided that kvaerner shall promptly inform and keep ipsco fully informed of such claims and disputes and any negotiations or legal proceedings with such suppliers and that any final resolution or settlement of such dispute shall be subject to ipsco approval and ipsco interests are otherwise at all times protected 
appendix at.
the pma also included an insurance component.specifically,the pma required ipsco to procure at least million of professional liability insurance covering kvaerner,the subconsultants,and the design professionals.to satisfy this obligation,ipsco hired marsh usa,marsh,an insurance broker,who in turn procured a million policy from liberty mutual insurance company liberty mutual.the policy was a wasting policy,whereby costs of defending legal actions would be deducted from the total amount of available coverage.
on kvaerner recommendation,ipsco awarded the contract to complete the design and construction of the primary buildings to blaine construction corporation blaine.less than one year into the project,blaine discovered design errors in its work and abandoned the project,which caused significant disruptions and delays.
in response to blaine unexpected abandonment,ipsco and kvaerner entered into a written agreement reinforcing their ipsco and kvaerner agency relationship and amending certain aspects of the pma.the amending agreement,which estimated the losses resulting from blaine abandonment to be in the range of million to million,provided that any proceeds ultimately recovered from blaine or its insurers,if any,would be paid solely to ipsco,but that such recovered funds would be applied as a credit against the aggregate cost under the pma.
under the terms of the amending agreement,ipsco and kvaerner agreed kvaerner would pursue recovery from blaine,liberty mutual and marsh for damages resulting from blaine conduct.more important,ipsco and kvaerner agreed their respective roles in that dispute would be governed by section x of the pma.see amending agreement the rights and responsibilities of kvaerner and ipsco in respect of the blaine action will be governed by section x of the pma.app.
construction action coverage action 
at about the same time,ipsco and kvaerner filed suit against blaine in the district court for the western district of pennsylvania,where kvaerner has its principal place of business.the complaint sought to recover the damages caused by blaine abandonment and design errors.for ease of reference,we will refer to this lawsuit as the construction action.
blaine then turned to liberty mutual and demanded both defense and coverage under the million wasting policy that liberty mutual had issued.when liberty mutual denied coverage on the ground that it had allegedly never received proper notice that blaine was an insured under the policy,blaine filed suit against liberty mutual in the western district of pennsylvania seeking a declaration from the court that it was covered under the policy.blaine also asserted claims against marsh,the insurance broker,because marsh had issued an advice of insurance three years earlier assuring blaine that it was covered by the liberty mutual policy.we refer to this lawsuit as the coverage action.
the following year,ipsco and kvaerner entered into a confidential settlement agreement with blaine the construction action settlement.under that agreement,the parties agreed to submit the issue of blaine liability to an arbitration panel and,in the event the arbitration panel found blaine liable,the parties agreed to enter a million stipulated judgment against blaine in favor of ipsco.blaine,however,had empty pockets,so ipsco and kvaerner further agreed that they would satisfy the million judgment,if any,by looking solely to blaine insurers.
to that end,the construction action settlement required blaine to continue prosecuting the coverage action against liberty mutual and against marsh.blaine was prohibited from settling any of its claims without prior written approval from ipsco and kvaerner.upon learning of the construction action settlement,the district court stayed both the construction action and coverage action,presumably because a finding of no liability in the arbitration proceeding would put an end to both lawsuits.
alabama action against kvaerner 
meanwhile,ipsco filed a lawsuit against kvaerner in federal court in alabama seeking more than million in various cost overruns on the project.these cost overruns included damages resulting from blaine abandonment of construction.because kvaerner is insured under the million policy issued by liberty mutual,almost all of the defense costs that it incurred in the alabama lawsuit have been paid by liberty mutual.accordingly,each dollar spent on kvaerner defense reduced liberty mutual coverage under its wasting policy.it was estimated at oral argument that million had been expended to that time.
liberty mutual settlement 
while the arbitration proceeding was pending,ipsco,blaine,and liberty mutual commenced settlement discussions.apparently,kvaerner was invited to participate in these discussions,but declined to do so.in may,ipsco,blaine,and liberty mutual reached a settlement that resolved all of the outstanding claims in the construction and coverage actions except those claims involving marsh the liberty mutual settlement.under the liberty mutual settlement,i ipsco and kvaerner agreed to release all claims that they had asserted in the construction action against blaine,and ii blaine agreed to release all claims that it had asserted in the coverage action against liberty,ipsco and kvaerner.in return,liberty mutual agreed to pay million to ipsco.
immediately after the liberty mutual settlement was reached,ipsco mailed a letter to kvaerner which read 
as you know,pursuant to section x of the pma,kvaerner has been acting as agent and litigation manager for ipsco in the pennsylvania legal proceedings against blaine and related insurance coverage litigation against liberty and marsh,marsh.
blaine,ipsco,and liberty have now concluded a settlement agreement to resolve the pennsylvania proceedings as to all parties except marsh.a copy of the settlement agreement is enclosed.
pursuant to the pma,ipsco hereby directs kvaerner,as its agent,to confirm in the space provided below that kvaerner consents to the enclosed settlement agreement insofar as any such consent might be required from kvaerner.please return a countersigned copy of this letter.
kvaerner refused to consent to
