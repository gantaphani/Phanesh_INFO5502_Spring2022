under the circumstances of this case we hold that the tolling provision contained in code of civil procedure section does not apply to extend the period set forth in section within which plaintiffs can file actions based on latent construction defects.as a result we find that certain of the consolidated actions are so that the trial court was required to grant the summary judgment motion brought on that basis by defendants inco development corporation and inco homes corporation inco.we,therefore,grant inco petition for writ of mandate seeking review of that denial.
facts and procedural history 
this is a construction defect case.inco developed and constructed each of the homes in the reunion subdivision in adelanto that are the subject of this litigation.
inco moved for summary judgment on the ground that the statute of limitations under section for latent defects barred action as to of the homes involved.as to these homes,completion certificates were recorded on or before may,commencing the period for filing action for latent construction defects the first of the lawsuits brought by individual residents was filed may.
inco had filed bankruptcy on october,and the bankruptcy action was dismissed and the stay lifted on may.
plaintiffs filed an opposition in which they argued that the statute of limitations was tolled for the period from october through may,during which the bankruptcy stay was in effect.
the trial court denied summary judgment on the ground that the limitations period is subject to the tolling provision of section 
inco seeks writ review,contending that section is a statute of repose and is not subject to the tolling principles of section.
normal effect of a bankruptcy stay is to toll statutes of limitation 
the filing of a bankruptcy petition operates as an automatic stay of the commencement or continuation of a judicial proceeding against the debtor that was or could have been commenced before the commencement of the bankruptcy proceeding.a.
a bankruptcy stay has been held to be a statutory prohibition within the meaning of section,so that the period of time of the automatic stay is not counted as part of the limitations time.schumacher worcester th,d schumacher kertesz ostrovsky th,d.
under normal circumstances,the effect of the bankruptcy stay here would seem to be the statute of limitations is extended months.see schumacher,supra,th at,d.however,inco argues that the tolling provision of section is not applicable because we are dealing with a special statute of repose,section.
ii.section is a special statute of repose 
inco principally relies on the supreme court decision in lantzy centex homes cal th,d,lantzy,where the court held that section statute of limitations for latent construction defects is not subject to a general rule of equitable tolling while promises or attempts to repair are pending.lantzy,supra,cal th.at,d.
the court expressly did not decide in lantzy whether section is subject to the several separate statutes that specify when certain limitations periods will be tolled,for example,sections defendant absence from state,plaintiff minority or insanity,plaintiff incarceration,pending restitution order against defendant,plaintiff disability by virtue of state of war,injunction against commencement of action.lantzy,supra,cal th at,fn,d,italics added.
inco contends that the statutory tolling provision contained in section should not apply to extend section limitations period for the same reasons that the supreme court found equitable tolling should not apply.in lantzy,the court stated a broad rule would contravene the legislature clear intent,at the time it adopted section,to ensure a generous but firm cutoff date for suits.moreover,the extraordinary length of the limitations period set forth in section weighs strongly against the need for such a tolling rule as a matter of fair procedure.lantzy,supra,cal th at,d.
a statute of repose has nothing to do with the date of injury,but bars all suits after the expiration of a specified time from the manufacture or delivery of a product or a transaction.see burroughs precision airmotive th,d manufacture of plane miguel country funding cir consummation of loan transaction.it does not cut off an existing right of action,but rather provides that nothing which happens thereafter can be a cause of action.
section does have characteristics of a statute of repose.it is not dependent upon traditional concepts of accrual of a claim,but is tied to an independent,objectively determined and verifiable event,the date of substantial completion of the improvement.that date may very well predate the time when a potential plaintiff purchases the property.a suit to recover for a construction defect generally is subject to limitations periods of three or four years,depending on whether the theory is breach of warranty,subd.or tortious injury to property,subds.b,c.unlike these statutes of limitations which begin to run only when the defect was or should have reasonably been discovered,the period in section imposes an absolute requirement that a lawsuit to recover damages for latent defects be brought within years of substantial completion of the construction,whether or not the defect was or even could have been discovered within that period.lantzy,supra,cal th at,d.
although lantzy did not expressly refer to section as a statute of repose,two courts of appeal have done so.in chevron superior court th,d,the court of appeal held that while an action alleging a continuing nuisance or trespass may be brought at any time before the nuisance or trespass has been abated or within the limitations period of section,subdivision b,the period of section controlled.it stated that t he continuing nuisance or trespass theory allows for deferral of the starting date of the statute of limitations in much the same way as does the discovery rule.neither theory or rule may override the statute of repose created by the legislature fixed starting point and outer limit for latent construction defects t he event which triggers the period is the date of substantial completion of the improvement.citations.chevron superior court,supra,th at,d gaggero county of san diego th,d.
thus,we conclude that section is a statute of repose.while this characterization is not necessarily dispositive of the issue whether section is subject to tolling under section because of a bankruptcy stay,it does serve to distinguish section from garden variety limitations statutes that simply provide for various periods for the commencement of specified actions.
iii.statutory tolling under section does not extend the statute 
we must now determine and effectuate legislative intent in order to decide the specific issue whether the tolling provisions of section apply to extend the limit set forth in section.woods young cal d.
it has been repeatedly stated in this regard that the enactment of section reflected a legitimate concern that expanding concepts of liability could imperil the construction industry unless an appropriate limitations period was adopted.lantzy,supra,cal th at,d.as explained in lantzy,in choosing the lengthy period,the legislature struck a balance between allowing a fair time to discover and sue upon latent construction defects and protecting a vital industry from the damaging consequences of indefinite liability exposure.for latent deficiencies,the lawmakers rejected shorter periods in favor of a limit in the upper range of those previously adopted by other jurisdictions.moreover,by placing exemptions in the latent defect statute for personal injury,willful misconduct,and fraudulent concealment,the legislators demonstrated an intent to pick and choose the particular exceptions they wished to allow and those particular aspects of the prior case law they wished to embrace.the implication arises that except as stated,and for important policy reasons,the legislature meant the generous period set forth in section to be firm and final.lantzy,supra,cal th at,d.
lantzy observed that,the plain language of section suggests that the limitations period is not subject to extension for reasons not stated in the statute itself.it decl
