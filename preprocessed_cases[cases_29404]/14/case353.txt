we decide whether the public has a common law or first amendment right of access to materials filed in support of search warrant applications after an investigation has been terminated.we hold that a qualified common law right of access applies.we decline to reach the constitutional question.
background 
christopher kortlander owns and operates the custer battlefield museum in garryowen,montana.beginning in,the united states investigated kortlander for unlawfully attempting to sell migratory bird parts and for fraudulently misrepresenting the provenance of historical artifacts for sale.during that investigation,two search warrants were executed in and,and the court sealed the affidavits supporting the warrant applications.the government ultimately declined prosecution of any criminal charges.
in,kortlander asked the district court for a copy of the search warrant applications and supporting affidavits.he initially sought a personal copy of the entire file,while leaving the file sealed to the public.later,however,he asked that the warrant applications be ordered unsealed and fully disclosed.citing cases discussing the public qualified first amendment right of access to judicial proceedings,he asserted that search warrant papers are presumptively public judicial records,adding that u nfettered disclosure is entirely appropriate and fitting in this case and should be effectuated forthwith.
the united states attorney office initially opposed kortlander request in its entirety,citing the need to protect witness,informant and grand jury secrecy.the government objections said that portions of the search warrant affidavits refer to witness testimony and documentary evidence collected by the grand jury,as well as informant statements,and identif y undercover officers.
later,however,the government dropped its blanket objection to giving kortlander access to the records,acknowledging that kortlander and his attorney had already learned the details of investigation in the course of negotiation in the case,including informant and undercover officer identities and grand jury material.the government therefore no longer ha d concerns about disclosure of sensitive law enforcement witness information.
nonetheless,the government urged the court to limit dissemination of the material to kortlander personal review for inclusion in any future court filings,citing privacy interests of third parties.the government said 
c oncerns have been raised that information collected by kortlander may be posted on web sites.the ninth circuit has explained that the privacy interests of the individuals identified in the warrants and supporting affidavits supports the conclusion that material not be made available for public dissemination.times mirror united states,cir.
consequently,should the court unseal the warrant applications in this matter,the government requests that any order limit dissemination of the material to kortlander personal review for inclusion in any future court filings.
the district court granted kortlander request for access to the warrant materials,but limited kortlander access in accordance with the government suggestions the court noted that t he government does not object to the unsealing of the records for kortlander personal review inclusion in future court filings,but does have concerns about the information being posted on websites.the court accordingly directed the government to provide a copy to kortlander counsel for dissemination to kortlander,but advised kortlander that the information is to be used only for personal review inclusion in any future court filings.kortlander is ordered not to post the warrant applications on any websites.the court did not make any findings beyond citing unspecified concerns about internet postings articulating a justification for the restrictions imposed.kortlander timely appealed 
discussion 
the law recognizes two qualified rights of access to judicial proceedings and records,a common law right to inspect and copy public records and documents,including judicial records and documents,nixon warner commc ns,footnote omitted,and a first amendment right of access to criminal proceedings and documents therein,press enter.superior court.kortlander contends that he has a right to unfettered access to the search warrant materials under both standards.we address the common law question first.
common law right of access 
the first step in any inquiry under the common law right of access is whether this right applies at all to the type of documents at issue.see kamakana city cnty.of honolulu,cir a narrow range of documents is not subject to the right of public access at all because the records have traditionally been kept secret for important policy reasons.quoting times mirror united states,cir.our case law has identified two categories of documents that are not covered by the common law right of access grand jury transcripts and warrant materials in the midst of a investigation.id.citing times mirror,at.we review this threshold question de novo.see times mirror,at.
whether the common law right of access applies to warrant materials after an investigation has ended is a question of first impression in this circuit.we have held that the common law right of access does not apply to warrant materials during the stage of an ongoing criminal investigation.id.at.but we expressly reserved whether the common law right of access applies to warrant materials after an investigation has been terminated.id.we answer that question today,and hold that,as the government concedes,the common law right of access applies under these circumstances in doing so,we join a number of courts that have reached the same conclusion.see,in re eyecare physicians of,cir in re newsday,cir baltimore sun goetz,cir united states wells fargo bank account number,d,in re times,d,commonwealth fenstermaker,see also in re search warrant for secretarial area outside office of gunn,cir bowman,concurring 
we agree with these courts that warrant materials are judicial records and documents.nixon,at recognizing a common law right to inspect and copy public records and documents,including judicial records and documents.in baltimore sun,the fourth circuit offered persuasive reasons for treating search warrant affidavits as judicial records 
the requirement that warrants issue only upon oath or affirmation showing probable cause is embodied in the fourth amendment.a judicial officer must review the affidavit to determine whether the warrant should issue.this initial review is subject to further review by district and appellate courts upon motion to suppress the objects seized in the search.federal rule of criminal procedure g directs the judicial officer to file the warrant and all papers in connection with it with the clerk of the district court.the papers are then available for use in a subsequent criminal trial if its sufficiency is questioned.we therefore conclude that affidavits for search warrants are judicial records.
at footnote omitted.affidavits in support of seizure or search warrants are central to a court probable cause determination.wells fargo,d at.they therefore clearly fall within the definition of judicial documents.see also fenstermaker,at d ocuments upon which a magistrate bases a decision to issue an arrest warrant are clearly judicial in character.
we also agree with these courts that warrant materials fall outside the narrow range of documents that are not subject to the right of public access at all because the y have traditionally been kept secret for important policy reasons.kamakana,at quoting times mirror,at.as we acknowledged in times mirror,at,warrant materials have not historically been accessible to the public during the early stages of criminal proceedings.warrant application proceedings are highly secret in nature and have historically been closed to the press and public.wells fargo,d at see also baltimore sun,at p roceedings for search warrants are not open to the public.gunn,at h istorically the process of issuing search warrants involves an ex parte application by the government and in camera consideration by the judge or magistrat
