richard millard,a heating and air conditioning hvac technician employed by a hvac subcontractor,was injured when he was working in the attic of a commercial building that was being remodeled under the general supervision of the general contractor,biosources,biosources.millard alleges that the lights went out suddenly and he fell through the ceiling.millard filed suit against biosources.
the trial court granted summary judgment on millard complaint,finding biosources as the general contractor and electrical contractor had no duty of care to millard under either the labor code or under the doctrine of retained control,and the decisions privette superior court cal th,d,privette and hooker department of transportation cal th,d,hooker barred his action.
on this appeal millard asserts the court erred in granting summary judgment because privette did not bar his action as biosources retained control of the electrical work biosources owed a duty to him under labor code section biosources failure to exercise control of safety on the jobsite affirmatively contributed to millard injuries biosources failure to fulfill its assumed duty to determine the reason the lights went off previously on the day he was injured was an omission that affirmatively contributed to his injuries and the court failed to determine whether millard action included a cause of action for negligence per se.we affirm.
factual and procedural background 
a.the incident 
millard was an employee of apex mechanical systems,apex.apex was hired as a subcontractor to install upgrades to the hvac system as part of a tenant remodel project on property located at rehco road in san diego the project.biosources was the general contractor and electrical contractor for the project.
apex employees,including millard,were directed by apex as to the means and methods of work assignments on the job site.biosources exercised general supervisory control over the project,but did not direct the means or methods of millard work.
on the morning of the incident,millard was troubleshooting the hvac system in an attic space.at that time,the lights were on in the attic space.the attic space could be traversed by a narrow catwalk consisting of wide steel beams that had no handrails.
sometime around noon,biosources electrician wayne corcoran inadvertently turned out the light in the attic when he tripped an unmarked circuit breaker while working at the electrical panel.millard and another apex employee exited the attic space using a flashlight and reported the problem to corcoran,who said he would look into it.the problem was corrected by corcoran switching the breaker back on.
at approximately that day,millard was working alone in the attic space.millard alleges that the lights in the attic went out while he was in the process of traversing the catwalk,causing him to lose his equilibrium.this caused him to step in a light fixture,which gave way,causing him to fall through the ceiling to the room below.worker compensation insurance covered millard injuries sustained in the accident.
two biosources employees who had been present at the project earlier that day,electrician corcoran and job superintendent mark farnum,had both left for other job sites approximately one hour prior to the accident.no biosources personnel were working or present at the project when millard fell from the attic space.
no one was working at the electrical panel and no one was found to have touched either of the two switch plates which control the lights in the attic space.one switch plate is located approximately feet off the floor,next to the attic entry hatch,and can be reached only by climbing a ladder.the other switch is inside the attic space.it was standard practice to leave the attic lights on at all times.
at the time of the incident,the only other workers on site were two other members of apex crew,an employee of the flooring subcontractor,and an employee of the caulking subcontractor.immediately after millard fell,the lights in the attic space were found to be on.as first aid was being rendered to millard immediately following the incident,millard informed his coworker,tyler sterling,that the lights in the attic had flickered before he fell.some time later,millard told another apex coworker,paul perry,the lights in the attic had flickered.at his deposition,millard denied telling anyone that the lights flickered and testified that the lights had gone out.
biosources motion for summary judgment 
biosources brought a motion for summary judgment,arguing that millard action was barred by the privette doctrine,and the retained control exception did not apply because biosources did not affirmatively contribute to millard injuries.millard opposed the motion,asserting biosources violated applicable osha regulations privette did not apply because biosources duty was created by the labor code under the case elsner uveges cal th,d,elsner and biosources affirmatively contributed to his injuries by failing to conduct a safety meeting or post a safety tag near the electrical panel and light switch to the attic light.
c.the court ruling 
the court granted biosources motion for summary judgment.the court first noted that millard complaint does not allege a cause of action for n egligence per s the court then framed the issue to be decided as whether biosources as the general contractor,owes a legal duty to millard to either have a safety meeting or to post a safety tag near the electrical panel and light switch to the attic light,and whether this conduct affirmatively contributed to millard injuries.the court rejected millard argument that elsner supplanted privette and hooker and found it not to be controlling it is factually distinguishable in that in elsner the general contractor admitted to actions improperly constructing scaffolding which gave way,which contributed to the event.additionally,elsner was not a summary judgment motion but involved in limine motions and jury instructions.further,elsner did not expressly do away with the doctrines developed in privette and hooker which insulate a general contractor from liability for injuries to employees of subcontractors except when actions of the general contractor affirmatively cause or contribute to the injury causing event.the court then found biosources has shown that nothing it did or failed to do affirmatively contributed to millard injuries.finally,the court found that millard failed to submit admissible evidence to raise a material issue of fact that privette does not apply or that biosources owed millard a duty due to retained control.
discussion 
applicable summary judgment standards 
the summary judgment procedure determines whether there is evidence requiring the procedure of a trial.t he trial court in ruling on a motion for summary judgment is merely to determine whether such issues of fact exist,and not to decide the merits of the issues themselves.citation.the trial judge determines whether triable issues of fact exist by reviewing the affidavits and evidence before him or her and the reasonable inferences which may be drawn from those facts.morgan fuji country usa,th,d.however,a material issue of fact may not be resolved based on inferences if contradicted by other inferences or evidence.aguilar atlantic richfield cal th,d.
to prevail on a motion for summary judgment,a defendant must show one or more elements of the plaintiff cause of action can not be established or that there is a complete defense to that cause of action.code civ,subd.p.the evidence of the moving party is strictly construed and that of the opponent liberally construed,and any doubts as to the propriety of granting the motion are to be resolved in favor of the party opposing the motion.branco kearny moto park,th,d.the trial court does not weigh the evidence and inferences,but merely determines whether a reasonable trier of fact could find in favor of the party opposing the motion,and must deny the motion when there is some evidence that,if believed,would support judgment in favor of the nonmoving party.alexander codemasters group,th,d.consequently,summary judgment should be granted only when a moving party is entitled to judgment as a matter of law.code civ,subd.c.
because a motion for summary judgment raises only questions of law,we independently review the parties supporting and opposing papers and apply the same standard as the trial court to determine whether there exists a triable issue of material fact.city of san diego gypsum th,d southern cal.rapid transit dist.superior court th,d.in practical effect,we assume the role of a trial court and apply the same rules and standards that govern a trial court determination of a motion for summary judgment.lopez university partners th,d.we liberally construe the evidence in support of the party opposing summary judgment wiener southcoast childcare centers,cal th,d,and assess whether the evidence would,if credited,permit the trier of fact to find in favor of the party opposing summary judgment under the applicable legal standards.aguilar atlantic richfield,supra,cal th at,d.
ii.the privette doctrine and exceptions 
common law peculiar risk doctrine 
at common law a person who hired an independent contractor was not liable to third parties for injuries caused by the contractor negligent performance of the work.privette,supra,cal th at,d.there were numerous exceptions to this general rule,including one that came to be known as the peculiar risk doctrine.ibid.under this doctrine,the person who hired an independent contractor to perform inherently dangerous work could be held liable for tort damages when the contractor negligent performance of the work caused injury to others.id.at,d.the principal rationale for this exception to the general rule of nonliability was to ensure that an innocent bystander who was injured by a contractor negligence would have a source of compensation even if the contractor was insolvent.hooker,supra,cal th at,d.it was also based on the recognition that a hirer who was held vicariously liable to the injured claimant under the peculiar risk doctrine was entitled to seek equitable indemnity from the contractor whose negligence caused the injury,thus providing some assurance that the ultimate responsibility for the harm caused by the peculiar risk of the work would be borne by the person at fault for the injury.privette,supra,cal th at fn,d.to the extent the contractor was insolvent,the doctrine shifted the risk of loss to the person who contracted for and thus primarily benefited from the contracted work.id.at,d.
the peculiar risk doctrine was eventually expanded to allow an employee of a subcontractor to recover from a nonnegligent hirer usually,a general contractor or a property owner for injuries caused by the subcontractor negligence.privette,supra,cal th at,d.
in privette the california supreme court reconsidered the applicability of the peculiar risk doctrine and concluded that the injured employee of a negligent subcontractor could not sue the nonnegligent hirer under that doctrine.it reasoned that california previously expansive view of the peculiar risk doctrine gave the employee an undue windfall relative to other employees injured on the job,whose recoveries would be limited to those damages recoverable under the worker compensation law,and created the anomalous result of imposing greater liability on a nonnegligent hirer than that of the contractor whose negligence actually caused that injury.privette,supra,cal th at,d.the court concluded that the workers compensation system was adequate to promote workplace safety and to protect the interests of the injured employee and that no societal interest was advanced by such an application of the peculiar risk doctrine,holding because workplace injuries are covered by workers compensation,liability under the doctrine of peculiar risk does not extend to the employees of an independent contractor hired to do dangerous work.id.at,d,see also id.at,d.
applying privette,the california supreme court has also held that a person who hires an independent subcontractor to do inherently dangerous work,but fails to contractually or otherwise require that the subcontractor take special precautions to avoid the peculiar risks involved in the work,can not be held liable under the peculiar risk doctrine for injuries to the subcontractor employee.toland sunland housing group,cal th,d.the court stated that its decision was premised on policy whether the peculiar risk liability of a general contractor,a landowner,or any other hirer of an independent contractor should,consistent with its common law origins,be limited to protecting third parties such as innocent bystanders or neighboring landowners against the possible insolvency of the hired contractor at fault,or whether such liability should extend to the independent contractor employees as well.as we concluded in privette it is illogical and unfair that a landowner or other person who hires an independent contractor should have greater liability for the independent contractor negligence towards the contractor employees than the independent contractor whose liability is limited to providing workers compensation coverage.id.at,d.
the high court reiterated this point in camargo tjaarda dairy cal th,d,holding that a hiring property owner or general contractor is not liable for injuries to employees of its independent contractors based on the theory that the owner or contractor was negligent in hiring the independent contractor.
retained contribution exception 
in the california supreme court,in hooker,supra,cal th,d,was presented with the issue whether the hirer of an independent contractor could be held liable for injuries to the contractor employee resulting from the contractor negligence under the theory that the hirer retained control of the work but negligently exercised that control.the high court held that a hirer of an independent contractor was not liable to an employee of the contractor merely because the hirer retained control over safety conditions at a worksite,but was liable to such an employee insofar as its exercise of retained control affirmatively contributed to the employee injuries.id.at,d.the court reasoned that imposing tort liability where the hirer exercise of retained control affirmatively contributed to the injury was consistent with privette and its progeny because the liability of the hirer in such a case is not in essence vicarious or derivative in the sense that it derives from the act or omission of the hired contractor.citation.to the contrary,the liability of the hirer in such a case is direct in a much stronger sense of that term.id.at,d,see also mckown stores,cal th,d,holding that a hirer is liable to an employee of an independent contractor insofar as the hirer provision of unsafe equipment affirmatively contributes to the employee injury in such a case it is the hiring party own negligence,not that of the contractor,that renders it liable.
affirmative contribution occurs where a general contractor is actively involved in,or asserts control over,the manner of performance of the contracted work.citation.such an assertion of control occurs,for example,when the principal employer directs that the contracted work be done by use of a certain mode or otherwise interferes with the means and methods by which the work is to be accomplished.citations.citation.hooker,supra,cal th at,d.
in this case,millard did not submit evidence sufficient to raise a triable issue of fact that biosources affirmatively contributed to millard injuries.biosources did not control the means and methods of millard work.no biosources personnel were at the work site at the time millard fell.
millard attempts to connect the incident in the morning when corcoran mistakenly tripped a circuit breaker while working on an electrical panel with the accident that occurred that afternoon.however,corcoran could have no connection to the attic lights to going out or flickering in the afternoon as he was not present at that time.moreover,millard has presented no evidence that the circuit breaker was tripped again immediately prior to his fall.the only evidence before the court was that the lights in the attic space were on immediately following millard fall.although millard speculates that the tw
