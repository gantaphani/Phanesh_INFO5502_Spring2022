appellant octoviano cortez appeals from the judgment entered in favor of respondents lourdes and omar abich collectively the abiches following the trial court order granting their motion for summary judgment.we affirm.
factual and procedural background 
in,the abiches embarked on a remodeling project of their home in pasadena.they wanted to add a new roof,master bedroom,master bath,and a garage to their home,adding over square feet.the abiches hired miguel quezada ortiz,among others,to perform the remodel.although what ortiz was hired to do is in dispute,appellant claims ortiz was hired to demolish the roof.ortiz did not have a contractor license,which the abiches concede was required.the abiches did not ask ortiz if he had a license and were unaware that he did not have one.omar abich obtained the necessary permits from the city of pasadena,but did not supervise the work.the abiches moved out of the house,and the project started in october or november.
ortiz hired appellant on the first day of the job,believing he was supposed to help ortiz demolish the roof,appellant went up on the roof without being given any specific instructions to do so.appellant conceded he saw that half of the roof was gone.as he climbed on the roof,he observed ortiz and another worker removing nails from the remaining portion.after taking two steps,he fell through the roof and suffered a fractured spine.
in january,appellant sued ortiz,alleging general negligence failure to warn and failure to make work area safe and premises liability negligence in maintenance,management,and operation of premises in march,he amended his complaint to add the abiches as doe defendants.
in april,the abiches filed a motion for summary judgment,contending they had no duty to warn appellant of the condition of the roof because he went up there on his own accord and any danger was open and obvious.they also argued that the work safety requirements of california occupational safety and health act osha contained in labor code section et did not apply to the residential remodeling project.
appellant responded that because they failed to hire a licensed contractor,the abiches were his employer.as such,he alleged they had a duty to maintain a safe working environment as required by osha and failed to do so.recognizing that osha does not apply to workers who provide household domestic service,subd.d,appellant asserted that the remodeling job did not fall within the definition of such services.he argued that even if osha did not apply to the abiches,there was a triable issue of fact concerning whether his duties required him to get on the roof and whether the dangerous condition of the roof was open and obvious.
the trial court ruling granting summary judgment stated,inter alia,the only disputed facts are immaterial to the legal issue to be decided.the court finds as a matter of law that plaintiff was not an employee of the abich defendants.pursuant to labor code section,subdivision h,plaintiff is excluded from being an employee of the abich defendants,and pursuant to labor code,plaintiff is the employee of defendant ortiz.see cedillo worker compensation appeal board th,d.it is undisputed that plaintiff was on the premises to perform work,that he was hired by defendant ortiz,and that he was injured on the first day of work.there is a dispute concerning whether a license was required to perform the work plaintiff was hired to do.there is a dispute about whether plaintiff voluntarily went up on the roof or whether he believed it was his job to help ortiz.neither of these disputes of fact is material to the issue of whether plaintiff was employed by the abich defendants.plaintiff contention that the abich defendants were required to comply with osha requirements fails as a matter of law because they were not plaintiff employer.even if they were found to be his employer,this contention fails as it is unsupported by any citation to a california cas e in which osha compliance was imposed on a homeowner.to the extent plaintiff seeks to hold the abich defendants liable as homeowners on a concealed danger theory,the court finds as a matter of law that the abich defendants had no duty to inspect the roof for soft spots in order to ensure the safety of the workers.the roof of a house undergoing a remodeling project does not present a concealed danger but an open and obvious one.
discussion 
standard of review 
a trial court properly grants summary judgment where no triable issue of material fact exists and the moving party is entitled to judgment as a matter of law.citation.merrill navegar,cal th,d.
if a defendant establishes that one or more elements of a cause of action can not be established or that there is a complete defense to that cause of action,the burden shifts to the plaintiff to show that a triable issue exists as to one or more material facts.doe california lutheran high school th,d,citing aguilar atlantic richfield cal th,d.if the trial court finds that no triable issue of fact exists,it then has the duty to determine the issue of law.california school of culinary arts lujan th,d.
on appeal,we review the trial court decision de novo.merrill navegar,supra,cal th at,d.we view the evidence in a light favorable to appellant as the losing party.saelzler advanced group cal th,d.
ii.appellant theories of liability 
a.the duty to provide a safe workplace 
appellant contends that the abiches were his employer,even though they did not hire him directly,because ortiz was an unlicensed contractor.he relies on labor code section which provides a rebuttable presumption that a person who performs services for which a license is required is an employee rather than an independent contractor.appellant argues that because ortiz was unlicensed,both ortiz and appellant were the abiches employees.
relying on sections and,subdivision h and cedillo workers comp.appeals board,supra,th,d cedillo,the trial court found that the abiches were not appellant employer for any purpose.to the extent it believed the abiches were shielded from potential tort liability because they were not appellant employer,the trial court was incorrect.
in cedillo,a homeowner hired an unlicensed and uninsured roofing contractor to repair his roof,and the contractor in turn hired another individual to perform the work.that individual,one jaime rodriguez,began work on the homeowner roof and was injured while in the course of repairing it.cedillo,supra,th at,d.after the workers compensation judge found the homeowner was rodriguez employer,the homeowner and his insurer the provider of homeowners insurance filed a reconsideration motion with the workers compensation appeals board board.relying on section,subdivision h,the board ruled that rodriguez was not the homeowner employee notwithstanding the presumption in section,that an unlicensed contractor is not an independent contractor but an employee,it determined that for purposes of workers compensation coverage,the contractor was rodriguez employer.as the contractor was uninsured,the board ordered the director of industrial relations director to pay rodriguez benefits.the director appealed on the contractor behalf.id.at,d.
the appellate court agreed with the board.it reasoned that if section were read in isolation,the contractor would escape liability under the workers compensation law by being uninsured and escape liability in court because he was unlicensed.this would have the undesired effect of rewarding a contractor who flouted the law by being unlicensed and uninsured.thus,the court found the board correctly concluded that under section,for workers compensation purposes,a worker could be an employee of both the hiring party the homeowner and the unlicensed contractor.because section,subdivision h barred the homeowner from being rodriguez employer,the responsibility fell to the contractor to insure against any injury.id.at,d.
however,cedillo is distinguishable because,unlike our case,it did not involve a negligence claim by an employee against a homeowner.the issue was whether the homeowner or the unlicensed contractor was the worker employer for purposes of the workers compensation law.
