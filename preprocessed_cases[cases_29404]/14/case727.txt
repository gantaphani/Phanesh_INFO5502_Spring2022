real parties in interest spanos construction,spanos and stores,appeal from a judgment granting a peremptory writ of mandate that set aside the approvals for a square foot retail store to be constructed in the mixed use zone of a spanos commercial and residential development in the city of stockton city called spanos park west also known as the business park the approvals were based on a letter to spanos from the city community development department director director stating that it has been determined by an i nitial staff review that the plans for the store were in substantial conformance with a master development plan adopted by the city.
the master development plan mdp is based upon the provisions of the california environmental quality act ceqa that apply to projects that will be carried out pursuant to a development agreement.pub.resources code,subd.a.the mdp is an alternative to a project or program eir,subds.a and b,tit,subd.a,hereinafter ceqa guidelines.the anticipated projects are not subject to further environmental review if considered in a master environmental impact report eir,subd.b.
the city approved the acre spanos park west pursuant to the mdp and allied enactments that condition the application of the mdp,including a density transfer development agreement density agreement that requires the construction of high density housing in the mx zone.the original project was to include business and residential development but was later changed to retail and residential development.the environmental review of the project was contained in a master eir and a supplemental eir.after the environmental review had been completed,spanos informed the city it desired to build a store on parcels of the business park designated solely for high density residential development by the density agreement and the mdp.
the plaintiffs challenge the validity of the director letter as an approval of the project and the trial court agreed.real parties argue that the plaintiffs may not do so because the period of limitations expired days after the filing,on february,of a notice of determination that the project was exempt from ceqa.the complaint was filed july,more than days after the filing of the notice of determination.in such a case section precludes review of a claim that a public agency has improperly determined that a project was exempt from ceqa,subd.d,subd.b.
under ceqa guidelines section,subdivision c,the day period of limitations runs w here the public agency filed a notice of exemption in compliance with section italics added.subdivision a of ceqa guidelines section conditions the filing of the notice of exemption on the approval of the project by a public agency.
thus,under section and the ceqa guidelines the limitations period will not run if,the director letter did not constitute an approval of the project,or,the director was not authorized by a public agency,the city,to approve the project.
the director action was contained in a letter to spanos,labeled status report,that said it has been determined by an i nitial staff review that the plans were in substantial conformance with the mdp.the letter was not posted,published or otherwise made public,notwithstanding that the mdp authorizes an appeal by a ny interested person to the city planning commission of any decision of the director within days of the decision.mdp.
for these reasons we shall conclude that the director letter did not constitute an approval of the project.
we also conclude that the director letter did not constitute a determination by a public agency since the director was not delegated and could not have been delegated authority to approve a project requiring environmental review.mdp kleist city of glendale d.the trial court found that t he change from residential to a superstore retail unit is a major change in the development plan that requires a discretionary act that triggers a ceqa review.
real parties assume that plaintiffs may not challenge whether the director improperly determined that he had authority to act for the city.they misread section.the term improperly determined does not modify public agency and hence the limitations period of that section does not apply to the jurisdictional question whether the director had authority to act for the city.
we shall affirm the judgment.
discussion 
iintroduction and facts 
the real parties do not challenge the trial court findings of fact and we include them as appropriate.
overview of the project 
the trial court described the spanos park west project as follows 
this lawsuit involves the development of spanos park west,which is located on the southwest corner of eight mile road and interstate in stockton.the project involves the development of acres with the original intent that the primary components would be business and residential.after a period of time,the primary components were changed to retail and residential due to the decline of business activity at that time.the initial environmental document transmittal form called for residential units on acres.it also provided for of office space on acres.the spanos park west mdp also contemplates two primary land use policies policy,and high density residential development policy.the same mdp also states that residential uses represents approximately per cent of the proposed land use in the plan area with four separate parcels for potential residential development.these four parcels are identified as parcel s,and.the store is to be located on parcels and.
b.the spanos park west planning approvals 
on december,spanos requested that the city council amend the city general plan and zoning regulations and adopt a development agreement that would transfer spanos obligation to construct residential minimum of residential units from the existing high density residential sites within the residential component to a proposed mixed use mx portion of the spanos west project.
the request was approved by the city council on january,by the adoption of an integrated set of enactments in compliance with the city planning code they conditioned the application of the mdp because the transfer of the units to the mixed use zone required an amendment to the city general plan,amendments to the city zoning ordinances,and a density agreement,which mandates that spanos construct residential units within the zone in order to comply with the policy of the general plan 
for this reason the mdp states that it provides a comprehensive description of all land uses proposed for the business park consistent with the objectives,policies,general land uses,and programs of the city general plan.the mdp also provides all development within the plan area is meant to be developed according to the primary use identified by spanos business park conceptual site plan,figure,and table,land use summary.italics added.
table lists as the primary land use for parcels,and.in the text following the table,the mdp provides that t he residential development program for spanos business park consists of multifamily units.four parcels gross acres within the plan area are proposed for multifamily high density residential development.the residential density would be units per gross acre.
the trial court concluded table ar only designates parcel s,and for residential use.of these lots only parcel has been used for residential use.lot was used for office space and of course parcels and are used for this superstore.for this reason alone the writ of mandate should issue.
lastly,the density agreement notes that the city of stockton general plan provides that city shall maintain an adequate supply of land designated as residential to meet the requirements of general plan housing element.for that reason it states that spanos has agreed to provide for and construct a minimum of nine hundred thirty five units within the mixed use component of the project.the density agreement recites that city code section requires that a development agreement be completed to implement the mdp recitals and it recites spanos commitment to construct a minimum of units as part of the development of the business park and that i n exchange for the benefits to the public of the residential development within the business park,spanos desires to receive assurance that city shall grant permits and approvals for the development of the project.in order to effectuate these purposes,the parties desire to enter in this agreement.
for these reasons the trial court found that the store was to be placed on lots and and that b y approving this retail complex on lot s and it not only exceeds the retail limit of the mdp but it also prevents the construction of residential units.that led the court to find that t he change from residential to a superstore retail unit is a major change in the development plan that requires a discretionary act which triggers a ceqa review.
c.the environmental review 
as noted,the mdp is based upon the provisions of ceqa that apply to projects that will be carried out pursuant to a development agreement,subd.a.
to meet the requirements of ceqa,a master environmental impact report may be prepared for a project that which will be carried out or approved pursuant to a development agreement,subd.a.the report must descri be the anticipated subsequent projects that would be within the scope of the master environmental impact report,including t he maximum and minimum intensity of any anticipated subsequent project,such as the number of residences in a residential development and t he anticipated location and alternative locations for any development projects,subd.b b c.it is the intent of the legislature that a master environmental impact report shall evaluate the cumulative impacts,growth inducing impacts,and irreversible significant effects on the environment of subsequent projects to the greatest extent feasible.environmental review thereafter is limited to projects not considered by the master report.
the spanos park west project involves the redesign,development and operation of the previously approved spanos park west project in northwest stockton,that was reviewed in a prior eir.consequently,it is the subject of a supplemental environmental impact study seir is that focus es on the proposed project revisions 
the seir reviewed the environmental consequences of an integrated set of documents,the proposed mdp,development agreement,density transfer development agreement,and related planning and zoning amendments that were jointly approved by the city council on january,since the project was not authorized by these documents,it was not subject to environmental review in the seir 
the notice of preparation of the seir for the mdp recites that the development agreement specifies the terms and conditions for the development of the component and will ensure that applicant will develop the component consistent with the mdp.the draft seir states that h igh density residential uses will be provided on parcels,and.these residential uses are intended to serve residents seeking the convenience of a highly concentrated urbanized setting that minimizes the reliance on personal vehicles and optimizes the relationship between home and the workplace.
d.the director letter 
on october,the director received approval from the spanos business park design review board mdp of spanos site plan for construction of a retail development on approximately acres within the spanos business park 
the director responded with a letter labeled status report regarding site plan,landscape plan,elevation and design store,dated december,that said,in effect,that an i nitial staff review has determined that the site plan and elevations are in substantial conformance with the mdp.the letter was addressed to doucet associates,representing spanos,and ccd to spanos and various employees of stockton.the letter was not posted,published or otherwise made public.
the director was informed by letter from spanos,dated the next day,december,and headed amendment to density transfer development agreement,that spanos presently lacks the space within the component of spanos park west necessary to accommodate the six hundred twenty seven units.the letter from spanos to the director was signed as approved by the director on december.see fn,infra.
apparently,it was unclear to spanos whether the december,letter from the director to spanos constituted an approval of the project.spanos sent a reply to the december letter,dated february,from spanos lawyers,to the director,stating spanos understanding that the letter of december,constituted your approval of the site plan and seeking to confirm that your december,letter was the decision required by section and that as a result the day period for filing an appeal of that decision has expired.italics added.
thus,the public was not informed of the director decision on december,the form of the letter was such as to induce spanos to seek a confirmation that it constituted an approval,and the only formal notice of the decision was the filing with the county clerk two months later,on february,of a notice of determination,also signed by the director,which recites that it is in compliance with section,subdivision b of the public resources code,and that the director has determined inter alia that the site plan applicable to the project conform s to the standards set forth in the mdp,which determination is a ministerial action not subject to ceqa review under b and ceqa guidelines.
we will consider the remaining facts when appropriate to the discussion.
the director determination did not constitute an approval 
the trial court ruled that the director letter is not a formal order of approval and for that reason the notice of determination,filed february,does not start the limitation to challenge the government action.
spanos argues that the trial court did not have authority to substitute its decision for that of the director in determining that the letter did not constitute an approval.it cites to western states petroleum superior court cal th,d.however,western states concerns a review of the record of a administrative decision.
the case is inapposite.the trial court did not review the facts determined in a action of a public agency.rather,it reviewed the legal question whether the form of the director purported decision,a letter denominated status report stating that an initial staff review had determined that the project was in substantial conformance with the mdp,constituted a final determination of a public agency.the letter was sufficiently unclear to prompt spanos to seek a confirm ation that the letter was the decision required by section 
the formal requirements of an approval turn on the nature of that which is decided.ceqa guidelines section,subdivision a provides in relevant part the exact date of approval of any project is a matter determined by each public agency according to its rules,regulations,and ordinances.
the rules and conditions of the mdp,section,provide that a ny interested person aggrieved by the decision of the director approving a proposal for compliance with the mdp has days to appeal to the planning commission since the rule provides for appeals by members of the public,it contemplates that such an approval by the director must be capable of being known by the public,either because the approval is posted or published or otherwise distributed to the public.
the letter of december,was not such an approval,because the letter was described as a status report,thereby failing to inform the public that it was a final project approval,as the trial court found,and,so far as the administrative record shows,the letter was not posted,published,or otherwise made public at the time,so members of the public would not know to exercise their appeal rights.moreover,the letter,although it did state that the status report concerned a retail store,did not state the size of the store or its location on specific parcels in the mx zone of spanos park west,or that it displaced units of housing required by the density agreement,or other information that would have put the public on notice of the nature and consequences of the project.
if the letter of december,was,in fact,made public at the time,it was the city duty to include that fact in the administrative record.section,subdivision e,provides in pertinent part e the record of proceedings shall include,but is not limited to,all of the following items all staff reports and related documents prepared by the respondent public agency with respect to its compliance with the substantive and procedural requirements of this division and with respect to the action on the project.all notices issued by the respondent public agency to comply with this division or with any other law governing the processing and approval of the project.
in keeping with this statute,it has been held that the duty to prepare an administrative record demonstrating compliance with ceqa falls squarely on the public entity.protect our water county of merced th,d.the consequences of providing a record to the courts that does not evidence the agency compliance with ceqa is of project approval.citations.id.at,d.
here,the administrative record was prepared by the city of stockton.see,subds.a and b.it fails to show that the approval letter of december,was made public at the time so as to allow members of the public to appeal to the planning commission.at oral argument,counsel for real party spanos conceded the letter of december had not been made public.the administrative record therefore fails to demonstrate a timely valid project approval.
since there was no valid approval of the project,there was no valid notice of exemption,and the statute of limitations set out in section,subdivision d,did not begin to run county of amador el dorado county water agency th,d.rather,the statute of limitations was days from the date of the public agency decision to carry out the project,or,if a project is undertaken without a formal decision by the public agency,within days from the date of commencement of the project,subd.d see county of amador,supra,th at,d.
in this case,the date of the public agency decision to carry out the project and the commencement of the project occurred at the earliest on june,if then,when the city granted a use permit to sell alcoholic beverages in the new store.see miller city of hermosa beach th,d issuance of building permit.plaintiffs filed their petition on july,well within the period.
the period of limitations is dependent upon approval of a project by a public agency 
section,subdivision d,provides that a n action or proceeding alleging that a public agency has improperly determined that a project is not subject to ceqa pursuant to subdivision b of section subdivision b is applicable to ministerial projects shall be commenced within days from the date of the filing by the public agency of the notice of determination authorized by subdivision b of section.italics added.a failure to meet this deadline precludes review of a claim that a public agency has improperly determined that a project is exempt from ceqa.see,subd.d,subd.b italics added.
section,subdivision d,is amplified by the ceqa guidelines.under ceqa guidelines section,subdivision c,the day period of limitations runs w here the public agency filed a notice of exemption in compliance with section italics added.section,subdivision a,applies only w hen a public agency decides that a project is exempt from ceqa and the public agency approves or determines to carry out the project italics added.an approval is therefore a necessary requirement for the commencement of the limitations period pursuant to section.
argues that public resources code section,subdivision d requires that an objector challenge a determination that a project is exempt from ceqa within days of the agency filing of a notice of exemption.the filing and posting of a notice of determination or exemption constitutes constructive notice to all potential challengers,and no further notice is needed to trigger the limitations period.the notice of determination was filed on february.the complaint was filed july.
alternatively,argues that plaintiffs claims are barred by the catchall deadline measured from the date of the approval by the director,december,subd.a ceqa guidelines,subd.d.ceqa guidelines section,subdivision c a,provides that the period of limitations runs from the date of the public agency decision to carry out or approve the project italics added.the complaint,filed on july,did not meet this deadline.
thus,in either case advanced by the real parties,approval by a public agency is a predicate to the commencement of the statute of limitations.see county of amador el dorado county water agency,supra,th at,d.
accordingly,we next address whether the director determination constituted an action by a public entity,the city.
the director was not delegated authority to approve the project 
as noted,the statute of limitations under ceqa guidelines section,subdivision c does not begin to run from the filing of the notice of exemption of the project unless the city,a public agency,has approved the project and that turns on whether the director was delegated or could have been delegated the authority by the city to make the determination.
ceqa places limitations on the authority of a public agency to delegate its responsibilities regarding the review of the environmental consequences of a project.kleist,supra,d.the court said the state guidelines require that the body or administrative official having final approval authority over a project involving a substantial effect upon the environment review and consider an eir before taking action to approve or disapprove the project.ceqa guidelines,subd.g.the requirement exists in part because only by this process will the public be able to determine the environmental and economic values of their elected and appointed officials id.at.see also vedanta society of california california quartet,th,d planning and conservation league department of water resources th,d delegation is inconsistent with the purpose of the review and consideration function since it insulates the members of the council from public awareness and possible reaction to the individual members environmental and economic values.
although the ceqa guidelines say that a public agency may delegate its decision making authority to any person within a public agency permitted by law to approve or disapprove the project at issue ceqa guidelines,that does not extend to a decision to approve a project with environmental consequences.a footnote to ceqa guidelines section regarding the meaning of permitted by law refers to the kleist decision.
the question whether the director was permitted by law to approve the store is critical to this case.if the director was not delegated authority by the city to approve the project his letter of approval did not constitute a decision by a public agency,as required by section and ceqa guidelines section.
section of the mdp sets out the procedures by which a proposed project is deemed within the matters considered in the master eir for the mdp.it authorizes the director to approve a project which substantially conforms to the mdp,is within the uses permitted by the mdp,and thereby has been considered for its environmental consequences.by contrast,a project which is not within the uses permitted by the mdp has not been reviewed for environmental sufficiency.
section provides amendments to the land uses and development standards contained within the mdp can be separated into two classes.minor amendments,amendments that the director finds are consistent with the intent and purpose of the mdp and major amendments,include a request for an alternative project or use that the director finds is not presently included as an alternative project or use within the mdp and is a project or use which is inconsistent with and does not share the same or similar characteristics of an allowed use identified within the mdp.
although the mdp authorizes the director to find that a project conforms to the mdp,it does not authorize the director to approve a project which is not within the mdp or has environmental consequences.that is,it does not grant authority to the director to determine his own jurisdiction and hence does not authorize the director to mistakenly find that the project is within the mdp 
thus,section of the mdp provides that m ajor site specific changes,such as a request for a project or use which is not consistent with and does not share the same or similar characteristics of an allowed use identified within the mdp may be approved,provided the design review board for spanos business park recommends to the city of stockton that the city issue a conditional use permit for the project or use and that the city of stockton city planning commission approves the proposed project or use and issue a conditional use permit.if the planning commission determination is appealed to the city council its decision is subject to the conditions,inter alia,t hat the proposed project is in conformance with the city general plan and t hat the proposed project of use would not adversely impact the environment 
for these reasons the mdp,read in the light of kleist and its progeny,marks the line of review authority between projects that previously have been reviewed for their environmental consequences,which the director may approve,and projects that have not,which he may not approve.
conclusion and disposition 
for the reasons set forth above,the director determination that the project was in substantial conformance with the mdp violated the residential requirements of mdp,as mandated by the general plan and density transfer development agreement,violated the limited review authority delegated the director by the city,and violated the provisions of ceqa that preclude the delegation of a public agency authority to review a project that may have environmental consequences.
accordingly,the director determination did not constitute an approval by a public agency as required by public resources code section,subdivision a,and ceqa guidelines.for that reason neither the determination nor the notice of determination were valid and the period of limitations for challenging the determination did not commence.
the decision of the trial court granting a peremptory writ of mandate barring all approvals of the development of the superstore is affirmed.the plaintiffs are granted their costs on appeal.cal.rules of court,rule a.
the majority opinion reached its conclusion that the statute of limitations did not run by wrongly voiding a ceqa approval.it did this by claiming the city did not give timely notice of its approval even though the city did in fact give notice and improperly ruling in favor of plaintiffs claims on the merits.neither ground is a legitimate basis for tolling the statute of limitations.i therefore dissent.
approval and lack of notice 
relying on county of amador el dorado county water agency th,d county of amador,the majority opinion concludes a public agency approval must not be defective procedurally in order for it to trigger the limitations period.county of amador,however,did not so hold.there,the issue was not whether the statute of limitations ran because the approval was procedurally defective it was whether the statute ran where there had been no approval at all.we concluded there was no approval in that case because the public agency action did not,as required by ceqa,commit the agency to a definite course of action in regard to a project intended to be carried out by any person.ceqa guidelines,subd.a.county of amador,supra,th at,d.
here,there is no dispute that the planning director letter of december,which was included in the administrative record,committed the city to a definite course of action.by approving the project,rightly or wrongly,as a ministerial project,the city bound itself to allowing the development to proceed.except for the building permit,which is also ministerial,no other approvals were needed from the city before the project could be built.this was so even though the director denoted his letter as a status report.thus,for purposes of ceqa,the letter was an approval.
despite ceqa clear definition of an approval,the majority opinion claims the director letter was not an approval because it was not made public at the time it was issued and thereby deprived the public of an opportunity to exercise its appeal rights under the mdp.contrary to the majority opinion holding,nothing in ceqa or the city own rules specifies that the failure to give public notice of a ministerial approval voids the approval.
assuming the director was required to give public notice of his ministerial approval,the failure to give notice excused plaintiffs only from having to exhaust their administrative remedies before bringing this action.ceqa requires no party to exhaust administrative remedies where the public agency failed to give the notice required by law.pub.resources code,subd.e.thus,plaintiffs were under no requirement to appeal the director decision to the planning commission,as otherwise required by city ordinance,before bringing this action.
however,the failure to give notice did not excuse plaintiffs from complying with the statute of limitations once the city in fact gave notice of its approval by posting the notice of exemption on the project.mcqueen board of directors d,disapproved on other grounds in western states petroleum superior court cal th,fn,d,posting of notice of exemption triggered statute of limitations even though plaintiff received inadequate notice of project and was excused from exhausting available administrative remedies.the statute of limitations begins to run once the notice of exemption is posted following the agency approval,regardless of whether plaintiffs had notice of the approval at the time it happened or had notice of administrative remedies accompanying that approval.ceqa guidelines,subd.c.
indeed,the director not giving public notice here at the time of his approval is a red herring.the city notice of exemption gave the plaintiffs notice of the approval and cured the director omission.moreover,it extended to plaintiffs days to challenge the approval in court from the date of the notice of exemption,instead of the days allowed from the approval date to challenge the approval before the planning commission.plaintiffs suffered no prejudice from not being notified of the planning director letter prior to the posting of the notice of exemption.
in short,the majority opinion relies on an inapplicable case and the specious ground of notice to void an approval that meets the requirements of ceqa.the opinion conclusion is contrary to ceqa.
ruling on the merits 
besides improperly voiding the approval on the basis of notice,the majority opinion unacceptably rules on the merits of the case to overcome the bar imposed by the statute of limitations.it asserts the director decision was not an approval because he could not have been delegated authority,and in fact was not delegated authority,to approve a project such as this that is inconsistent with the mdp and required further environmental review.majority at.this reasoning posits the very issue the complaint sought to resolve as the basis for determining whether the limitations period ran.the director purported abuse of authority is not a valid ground for nullifying the statute of limitations.
the majority opinion reaches its conclusion on this argument based on faulty premises.contrary to the opinion assertions,ceqa authorized the city to delegate limited authority to the director,and the city in fact delegated that authority to the director.first,ceqa authorizes the city to assign specific functions to its staff,including the authority to determine whether a project is exempt and the f iling of notices.ceqa guidelines,subds.a.
kleist city of glendale d,relied upon by the majority opinion,is not to the contrary.that case held the functions of considering an eir or a negative declaration prepared for projects not exempt from ceqa and making findings in response to significant effects identified in a final eir can not be delegated.id.at.nothing in kleist prohibits a lead agency from delegating the authority the city delegated to the director a project is exempt from ceqa.
second,the city in fact delegated to the director the authority to determine the project was exempt from ceqa and was consistent with the mdp,and to approve the project.a city ordinance assigns to the director the responsibility to determine whether a project is
