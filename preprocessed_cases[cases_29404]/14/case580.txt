introduction 
plaintiff even zohar construction remodeling,sued bellaire townhouses,llc and samuel fersht,individually and as trustee of the fersht family living trust collectively defendants,in a dispute regarding development and construction of a condominium project.
after the trial court denied defendants motion to compel arbitration,defendants failed to file a responsive pleading to plaintiff complaint.pursuant to plaintiff requests,the trial court ultimately entered a million default judgment against defendants.
citing section,subdivision b defendants moved for mandatory relief,relying upon an affidavit of fault executed by their attorney.the trial court denied the motion,finding the attorney affidavit not credible and too general.
several weeks later,defendants filed a motion to renew their request for relief,supported by a more detailed attorney affidavit of fault.plaintiff opposed the motion on multiple grounds,including defendants failure to satisfactorily explain why they had not presented the evidence contained in the more detailed affidavit in their first motion for relief.on several separate occasions,the trial court stated that it did not find the attorney second affidavit credible and that defendants had failed to meet the foundational requirements for a motion to renew found in section,subdivision b.nonetheless,the trial court felt bound by standard microsystems winbond electronics th,d standard microsystems,a decision that held that section,subdivision b does not apply to a renewed section,subdivision b motion for mandatory relief based upon an affidavit of attorney fault.as a result,the trial court granted defendants motion and set aside the defaults and default judgment.
we reverse.first,we find that the trial court correctly concluded that defendants did not satisfactorily explain their failure to present earlier the evidence proffered in their attorney second affidavit of fault.second,we decline to follow standard microsystems.its conclusion that section requirements do not apply to a renewed motion for mandatory relief from default based upon an affidavit of attorney fault ignores section clear and unambiguous language that it applies to all renewal motions and undermines the legislature goal to limit repetitive motions based upon facts that,with the exercise of due diligence,could have been but were not presented at the first hearing.we therefore conclude that the trial court lacked jurisdiction to consider the renewed motion.on that basis,we reverse and direct the trial court to reinstate the defaults and default judgment.
factual and procedural background 
the lawsuit and entry of the default judgment 
in march,plaintiff filed and served its lawsuit.
in may,defendants filed a petition to compel arbitration.
on august,the trial court denied the petition to compel arbitration.on august,plaintiff properly served defendants by mail with notice of entry of that order.as a result,defendants had until september,to respond to plaintiff complaint,subd.a.defendants did not file any responsive pleading.
on september,plaintiff notified defendants attorney daniel andrew gibalevich gibalevich by email and fax that it would request entry of default the following week unless a responsive pleading was filed immediately.no pleading was forthcoming.
on september,and october,at plaintiff requests,the clerk of the superior court entered defendants defaults.
on november,plaintiff moved for entry of a default judgment.
on december,the trial court,after conducting a hearing,entered a default judgment plus interest against defendants.
defendants first motion for relief 
on december,defendants moved for relief.their pleading is entitled notice of motion for mandatory relief under to vacate defaults and default judgments.notwithstanding the reference in the motion caption to mandatory relief,the body of the motion argued that gibalevich had committed both excusable neglect and inexcusable neglect.gibalevich declaration,offered in support of the motion,also improperly conflated the two concepts.he averred 
beginning the end of august and through the first part of november of,i had to spend substantial amounts of time away from the office.i had to attend to certain personal issues that required my undivided attention.i believed that i had sufficient staff to assure competent handling of client files.my associates were instructed to notify me immediately of issues that would require my personal attention.it appears that my staff failed to maintain this file in accordance with this firm policies and procedures.
due to my frequent absences,i failed to file and serve the responsive pleading.since the responsive pleading was never filed or served,defaults were taken against the defendants.had i filed the responsive pleading on time,prior to defaults being taken,the defaults and possible default judgments would have been avoided.it is clear that my mistake and excusable neglect resulted in the entry of defaults and default judgments against the defendants.italics added.
plaintiff opposed the defense request for relief.essentially,plaintiff urged that gibalevich was not credible to the extent that his declaration suggested that he was unaware of the deadline to file a responsive pleading.plaintiff submitted multiple documents court orders,emails,faxes to establish gibalevich had been aware that his clients response to the complaint was due by september and when defendants failed to file a pleading by september,plaintiff informed gibalevich that it intended to request entry of a default unless the deficiency was cured immediately.
further,plaintiff noted that gibalevich claim of inattentiveness was not credible given that his mother is married to defendant fersht.plaintiff opined that the defaults were part of a concerted plan in which defendants engaged with gibalevich to delay this matter and drive up the attorney fees and costs for plaintiff.
in addition,a declaration from even zohar,plaintiff sole owner,impeached gibalevich claim that,during the relevant time period,he had spent substantial time away from his law practice.zohar averred that during his numerous communications in the fall of,defendant fersht repeatedly told him that during this period that gibalevich was very successful,busy in his law practice and frequently in court.
on january,the trial court conducted a hearing on the motion.it noted that while the motion was predicated upon the mandatory relief section of section,gibalevich declaration fuzzes up the issue by referring to his mistake and excusable neglect in paragraph.as far as the mandatory relief aspect,it entirely too vague and conclusory.
in regard to the language about excusable neglect in his declaration,gibalevich told the court t hat was a mistake in the language,because there was no intent on my behalf to ask for any kind of discretionary relief,it was always under mandatory relief.although gibalevich asked if he could file an additional declaration outlining the extent of the personal problems he was having and what mandated his absence from the office and his failure to follow up on this matter,he made no offer of proof as to what that declaration would aver.the court rejected gibalevich request,stating it would rule upon the motion as submitted.
the trial court denied the motion.its order explains 
defendants have moved for mandatory relief under code of civil procedure section.
the motion is denied.the gibalevich declaration is not credible,in light of the showing made by plaintiff,and it is entirely too general.it does not show attorney gibalevich is solely at fault in not filing a timely responsive pleading.moreover,attorney gibalevich tries to have it both ways see paragraph of his declaration,which claims he has demonstrated excusable neglect.he has not demonstrated excusable neglect.
defendants second motion for relief 
on january,defendants filed their second motion,entitled,as was their earlier unsuccessful motion,notice of motion for mandatory relief under to vacate defaults and default judgments.the motion contained no reference to the statutory provision governing renewals of previously denied motions section,subdivision b.instead,the motion simply explained that during the hearing on the first motion,the trial court made an observation that although in his motion,defense counsel was requesting mandatory relief under section b,defense counsel declaration was not sufficiently clear and made contentions under the discretionary portion of section b.despite defense counsel argument,the court denied the motion.in order to address court concerns regarding the perceived generality of defense counsel declaration,and to avoid harm to the defendants,at the hands of their attorney,this motion follows.
to support the claim for mandatory relief,defendants offered another declaration from gibalevich in which he averred the following 
on august,investigators with the los angeles district attorney office served a search warrant at my office the investigation focused on medical providers and not on me or my practice o ne of my associates,savransky,resigned his position right after the search.that left me and gina akselrud as the only attorneys in my office 
in my effort to secure the return of my client files,i engaged shkolnikov,a criminal defense attorney.i volunteered to assist him in his research and drafting efforts 
i spent all of my time on efforts to return my client files.i researched and wrote many drafts of the motions that were filed.this consumed me.i was working on this most of the day,every day.when i was in front of the computer,i thought of nothing else.
i began to obsess over my reputation and the disclosures that i had to make to judges and opposing counsel alike about the search i have to confess that this feeling of embarrassment is the reason why i failed to set out these facts in the declaration previously filed.i will never forget that day or the hell that followed i did experience a period of time,from middle of september through october of,where i stayed away from the office,for days at a time.i was ashamed and embarrassed.i was embarrassed in front of my employees,opposing counsel and judges that i had to face.this feeling of embarrassment is still with me.
due to my frequent absences,my state of mind and obsession with getting my client files back,i neglected this matter.i failed to enter a responsive pleading and did not respond to plaintiff emails notifying me of the default.since the responsive pleading was never entered,defaults and default judgments were taken against my clients,the defendants.
had i filed the responsive pleading on time,prior to defaults being taken,the defaults and default judgments would have been avoided.it is clear that my mistake,inadvertence and neglect resulted in the entry of defaults and default judgments against my clients,the defendants herein.italics and boldface added.
defendants motion included two additional declarations.
the first declaration was from akselrud,gibalevich associate.she confirmed the execution of the search warrant on august,and savransky resignation the following day.in addition,akselrud averred that gibalevich was frequently absent from the office from the end of august through november and that approximately in the middle of september of,she noticed that the stress of the situation was taking its toll on gibalevich he stayed away from the office preferring to work at home.it seemed that he only worked on getting his client files back.all else took a back seat.he began to obsess over it.he did answer his phone nor respond to email.italics added.however,the next portion of akselrud declaration contradicted her claim as well as that made by gibalevich in his declaration that gibalevich worked only on the search warrant issue.she explained because so many of the files taken when the search warrant was executed were active litigation files,gibalevich and i,had to make many appearances,in the civil matters,to continue hearings and trials.much of my and his time was spent in attempts to recreate files and throw ourselves on the sword by explaining what transpired to clients,opposing counsel and judges.italics added.
the second declaration was from shkolnikov,the attorney representing gibalevich in a matter of in re search warrant.shkolnikov averred,as had akselrud,that gibalevich was frequently absent from his office through november.in addition,shkolnikov made the same contradictory averments that akselrud and gibalevich had made as to what gibalevich did and did not do.on the one hand,shkolnikov declared that gibalevich devoted all of his time and effort to getting the files and his property back but,on the other hand,shkolnikov declared that gibalevich and akselrud had to make all appearances to continue hearings and trials,many on shortened notice or on ex parte basis.
on january,defendants filed an ex parte application seeking an order to stay plaintiff execution on its million default judgment pending a ruling on its renewed motion for relief.the motion caption as well as a declaration from gibalevich acknowledged,for the first time,that the second motion for relief was brought pursuant to section,subdivision b 
on january,the court conducted a hearing on the defense application.it granted the application to stay execution on the judgment and continued the matter for a hearing on the merits of the renewed motion for relief.in the course of the hearing,the court stated that the facts contained in gibalevich second declaration are not new facts.you could have presented all of that with your original motion.the court further indicated that it did not find gibalevich new declaration credible.the court told gibalevich y ou are presenting an entirely different story with this application than you have presented to the court originally.in your first declaration,y ou tried to blame it on a miscalendaring when the evidence is that your office received multiple,multiple notices before the defaults were entered in all different kinds of ways.and,frankly,your story about being obsessed with this search warrant for the entire period of time is just not credible.you originally told the court you had to be out of the office for substantial periods of time.now you saying you conducting all kinds of research on your computer in your office.you not credible,gibalevich.italics added.gibalevich responded d uring the original hearing on the first motion,your honor,i did not blame it on a miscalendaring at no time am i placing blame on anybody else.the court replied that directly contrary to your first declaration.
plaintiff opposition to the renewed motion made several arguments.first,it argued that defendants had failed to comply with section,subdivision b because they had failed to demonstrate why the new information gibalevich stress caused by the execution of the search warrant had not been presented in the first motion.next,it argued that gibalevich latest explanation was not credible.lastly,it claimed that the decision not to file a responsive pleading to the complaint was a deliberate choice defendants and gibalevich made together as part and parcel of their continuing gambit of delay.
defendants reply to plaintiff opposition cited,for the first time,standard microsystems,supra,th,d,a case decided more than two years earlier.essentially,standard microsystems held that section,subdivision b does not apply to renewed motions for mandatory relief brought pursuant to section subdivision b.we will discuss the opinion in detail when evaluating plaintiff contention.defendants reply also included a declaration from fersht denying any complicity in gibalevich failure to file a responsive pleading 
at the hearing on the renewed motion,the trial court again expressed its disbelief of gibalevich gibalevich argued that the only difference between his first and second declarations was that he provided additional facts to the court setting the background as to why he was unavailable and why he did not file it.gibalevich claimed that t he story never changed.the trial court responded it changed every time you presented it,gibalevich.you do not have a footing in reality,sir.
as to whether defendants were complicit in gibalevich failure to respond to the complaint,plaintiff argued the court should find that fersht declaration denying any such complicity not to be credible because it had not been filed earlier.that is,plaintiff suggested that were fersht telling the truth,defendants would have proffered his declaration at the outset of the section litigation.in regard to its theory that defendants were involved in the decision to let the matter go to default,plaintiff relied upon defendants actions and statements,from both before and after the complaint was filed,that plaintiff believed indicated a defense intent to thwart any effort by plaintiff to recover any money from defendants.
in an order filed after the hearing,the trial court granted the motion.in relevant part,the order explains 
before the court is the second attempt by daniel gibalevich,attorney at law,to obtain vacation of his clients default entered september,and default judgment filed december.
attorney gibalevich first blamed the default and default judgment entered against defendants on the lawyers he employed in his office in this first motion,attorney gibalevich argued both that he was entitled to mandatory relief on the ground of attorney fault and on the ground of excusable neglect on his part.
when he lost the first motion,attorney gibalevich filed another motion.the second motion fails to comply with the requirements of section b.in this motion,attorney gibalevich changed his story and blamed the default and default judgment on his having become obsessed with the consequences of a search warrant executed on his office by the los angeles county district attorney.neither the search warrant nor its consequences concerned the files of the defendants in this action.
the associate akselrud in gibalevich office did not support the claim in attorney gibalevich december,declaration that she failed to maintain the case file or notify gibalevich of the entry of default and default judgment against defendants.
d efendants cite standard microsystems winbond electronics,th,d,which holds that insofar as any conflict actually exists between section and section b,it must be resolved in favor of section b.plaintiff argues that this case is an outlier,but the court does not agree.the decision seems correct,and this court is bound to follow it.the legislature has determined that even in cases involving conduct such as that demonstrated by attorney gibalevich,where no part of the fault is shown to be attributable to the defendant clients,relief is mandatory.italics added.
the court vacated the defaults and default judgment,directed the clerk to file defendants proposed answer,and ordered gibalevich to pay to plaintiff the attorney fees and costs it had incurred in connection with the default s and default judgment and defendants attempts to have them vacated.
this appeal by plaintiff follows.
discussion 
plaintiff contends defendants failure to comply with section deprived the lower court of jurisdiction to reach the merits of their renewed section b motion as a matter of law.e.we agree.
section,subdivision b provides for mandatory relief from default if the moving party request is supported by an attorney sworn affidavit attesting to his mistake,inadvertence,surprise,or neglect unless the court finds that the default was not in fact caused by the attorney mistake,inadvertence,surprise,or neglect,subd.b.the purpose of the mandatory relief provision is to alleviate the hardship on parties who lose their day in court due solely to an inexcusable failure to act on the part of their attorneys.citation.thus,the legislature created a narrow exception to the discretionary relief provision for default judgments citation.zamora clayborn contracting group,cal th,d.the range of attorney conduct for which relief can be granted in the mandatory provision is broader than that in the discretionary provision,and includes inexcusable neglect.leader health industries of america,th,d.but if the default occurred as a result of an intentional strategic decision by defense counsel,relief is not available.jerry shell equilon enterprises,llc th,d.
here,the trial court denied defendants first motion for relief because it found that gibalevich declaration was far too conclusory to require the grant of relief based upon a theory of attorney fault.this ruling was not an abuse of discretion.in order to obtain relief,the moving party must submit an affidavit from the attorney containing a straightforward admission of fault.state farm fire casualty pietak th,d.gibalevich first declaration did not meet that test.
defendants second motion proffered a declaration from gibalevich that purported to explain his fault as an inattentiveness caused by an obsessive reaction to the execution of a search warrant at his office.but,as gibalevich later acknowledged,because the motion sought to renew the previously denied motion,the motion was governed by section,subdivision b 
section is designed to conserve the court resources by constraining litigants who would attempt to bring the same motion over and over.darling,hall rae kritt th,d.to that end,subdivision b of section,as amended in provides,in relevant part a party who originally made an application for an order which was refused may make a subsequent application for the same order upon new or different facts or circumstances in which case it shall be shown by affidavit what new or different facts or circumstances are claimed to be shown.case law has included the additional requirement that the party seeking to renew a previously denied motion based upon new or different facts must provide a satisfactory explanation for the failure to produce the evidence at an earlier time.new york times superior court th,d see also california correctional peace officers virga th,fn,d,and witkin,cal.procedure ed.proceedings without trial.the trial court finding that the moving party did not establish the predicate facts for a section motion is reviewed for abuse of discretion.lucas santa maria public airport dist.th,d.
subdivision e was added to section in at the same time subdivision b was amended.stats,ch.subdivision e provides this section specifies the court jurisdiction with regard to renewals of previous motions,and applies to all applications for the renewal of a previous motion no application for the renewal of a previous motion may be considered by any judge or court unless made according to this section.italics added.if the predicate requirements set forth in subdivision b are not met,the trial court lacks jurisdiction to consider the renewal motion.see,kerns cse ins.group th,d.
these amendments were intended to clarify that no renewal motion can be heard unless the motion is based on new or different facts,circumstances,or law because the legislature sought to reduce the number of renewals of previous motions heard by judges in this state.stats,ch.
in this instance,gibalevich declaration failed to adequately explain why he had not included the facts about the search warrant execution and his response thereto in his first declaration.these events took place from september to november.information about them was obviously in gibalevich possession when he filed the first motion in december and the relevance of the events if true was patent.gibalevich only explanation for not having presented this information earlier was that he was embarrassed.the trial court did not find this explanation credible.that finding a finding defendants do not contest is binding upon us.johnson pratt whitney canada,th,d.given the inadequacy of the defense showing,the trial court did not abuse its discretion in finding that defendants had failed to establish the predicates for relief under section,subdivision b.however,rather than denying the renewed motion,the trial court proceeded to address the motion on its merits and grant relief,finding it was bound by standard microsystems.
the relevant facts in standard microsystems,supra,th,d are the following.attorney a advised the defendants that they did not have to answer the plaintiff complaint because he believed that the plaintiff attempt to serve them by mail was ineffective.id.at,d.defendants followed that advice and no responsive pleading was filed.id
