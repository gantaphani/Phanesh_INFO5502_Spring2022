in this case we are asked to determine the enforceability of a clause requiring homebuyers who sue the builder to submit the dispute to binding judicial reference.in contrast to the trial court,we find the provision enforceable,and grant the relief sought by petitioner.
statement of facts 
petitioner woodside homes of california,woodside is a developer of home tracts.real parties in interest buyers purchased homes from petitioner affiliate sales arm under standard contracts which required any lawsuit relating to the condition,design or construction of any portion of the purchased home to be submitted to judicial reference pursuant to code of civil procedure sections,former subdivision,and through.among the more significant provisions for the conduct of the reference are the following the referee is to be a retired judge or attorney with substantial experience in real estate matters the parties shall be entitled to discovery,with the referee to supervise and enforce orders a stenographic record of the trial is to be made,but will be confidential except as necessary for posthearing motions and appeals the referee shall render a statement of decision with findings of fact and conclusions of law and the decision may be entered as a judgment,but is also appealable.
the contracts also provide that,seller shall not be required to participate in the judicial reference proceeding unless it is satisfied that all necessary and appropriate parties will participate.the parties are to share costs and the referee fees equally,unless the referee orders otherwise.each party shall remain responsible for their own attorneys fees.
in reliance upon these provisions,woodside moved to compel a reference.although buyers complaint named only woodside and does,woodside represented that the subcontractors on the project were all bound by agreements to participate in any reference of disputes related to their work.
buyers objected on several grounds,but the general thrust of their argument was that the provision for mandatory judicial reference was unconscionable and unenforceable.in agreeing with buyers,the trial court was particularly concerned with five provisions confidentiality compensation of the referee the possibility that a mere attorney might be selected woodside unilateral power to decline to participate and the lack of provisions for mediation woodside sought review.
discussion 
general principles of enforceability 
first,we must point out that this is not an arbitration case,and therefore not all authorities dealing with arbitration agreements are directly relevant.for example,one case on which woodside particularly relied,basura home th,d basura involved the effect of the federal arbitration act on code of civil procedure section,which is intended to preserve a homebuyer right to litigate disputes despite the fact that the sales contract contains an arbitration clause because this case does not involve arbitration,neither the statute nor the federal act applies 
however,we recognize that a binding judicial reference is substantially similar to nonjudicial arbitration,and a similar approach is therefore justified in evaluating the enforceability of the provisions.
california has historically had a friendly policy towards arbitration agreements.keating superior court cal d,disapproved on other grounds sub nom.southland keating,d see also armendariz foundation health psychcare services,cal th,d,armendariz.such agreements are valid,enforceable and irrevocable,save upon such grounds as exist for the revocation of any contract.code civ.that is,california recognizes and approves of such agreements,but they are not given special consideration rather,they are evaluated under the same standards as any other contract which a party seeks to avoid.armendariz,at,d,bolter superior court th,d.
although the doctrine of unconscionability was judicially created see armendariz,supra,cal th at,d,civil code section now provides a statutory basis for refusing to enforce a contract which the court finds as a matter of law to have been unconscionable at the time it was made the crucial term,unconscionable,is not defined,but the law has clearly established that the term has both a procedural and a substantive element.the former takes into consideration the parties relative bargaining strength and the extent to which a provision is hidden or unexpected,while the substantive element requires terms that shock the conscience or at the least may be described as harsh or oppressive.hour fitness,superior court th,d.both elements must be present,but the more substantively oppressive the contract term,the less evidence of procedural unconscionability is required to come to the conclusion that the term is unenforceable,and vice versa.armendariz,at,d.in the context of arbitration,california courts currently reflect considerable concern that arbitration not become an instrument of injustice when forced upon consumers.see engalla permanente medical group,cal th,d,conc.opn.of kennard,engalla.
it has been held that the party who prepared and submitted a contract containing unexpected or harsh terms has the burden of showing that the other party had notice of them ellis mckinnon broadcasting th,d,but also that the party asserting unconscionability as a defense has the burden of establishing that condition.westlye look sports,th,d.in the related context of arbitration,the party seeking to compel arbitration has the burden of showing the existence of a valid agreement,while the opposing party has the burden of proof with respect to any defense to enforcement.engalla,supra,cal th at,d.
application to this case 
because of its close similarity to this case,as well as due to its origin in another division of this court,we begin by reviewing the recent decision by division one of this court in pardee construction superior court th,d pardee,which resulted in the invalidation of a clause requiring judicial reference of disputes in the same context of tract homes.in large part the contracts and circumstances were effectively equivalent to those in this case,and we will only note the differences 
procedural unconscionability 
in pardee,the homes were described by both sides and the court as entry level pardee,supra,th at,d and the court assumed that the buyers therefore had little bargaining power when dealing with the.the court found,or assumed,that all of the homes in the developments not only contained the judicial reference provisions,but that none of them had been successfully stricken by the buyers,who therefore had been shown to have little choice.id.at,d.
in this case,woodside merely asserted that all of the plaintiffs in this action had initialed and accepted the provisions for judicial was no concession that no buyer had stricken them.nor was there any evidence concerning any buyer disagreement or attempt to reject the provisions.the homes ranged in price from to,with only two of the priced below.there was no evidence that this was entry level or or upper level,and no evidence concerning the availability of housing stock in the region.armendariz,supra,cal th at,d,in which the court felt able to state as a fact that few employees are in a position to refuse a job because of an arbitration requirement.
the opinion in pardee describes the contracts provisions for judicial reference as buried in the form contracts and physically difficult to read as printed in dense,capital letters.it also noted that the caption of the paragraph in question did not explain the essence of the judicial reference provisions or otherwise convey anything meaningful to an purchaser.finally,the court found it a surprise component that the contract made no mention of referee fees.pardee,supra,th at,d.
although comparisons are difficult in that the pardee opinion does not include a copy of the sales contract as an appendix,we do not think the contracts here can be described as misleading or hard to penetrate.although the contracts are several pages long,and contain a great deal of small print,the buyers were necessarily made aware of the existence of the judicial reference provision because they had to initial the paragraph separately.wheeler joseph hospital d,quoted in powers dickson,carlson campillo th,d.while the print of the provisions is small and does not stand out,immediately above the spaces for the buyers initials is the large,bolded statement by initialing below,the parties acknowledge that they have read and understand the foregoing and accept that they are waiving their right to a jury trial.the caption judicial reference of disputes does not contain the arguably misleading addition present in pardee trial by judge in court of competent jurisdiction.and although it is true that the caption does not explain the essence of the judicial reference provisions pardee,supra,th at,d,we do not believe that a caption is required to do so significantly,perhaps the most important aspect of the judicial fact that it does not involve a clearly and conspicuously set forth.the paragraph also notes that a reference will require fees for the referee,and sets out the presumptive method of apportionment.
thus,the contracts here lack most,if not all,of the procedurally unconscionable factors found to exist in pardee.insofar as that court also relied on the circumstances of the sales,in this case there is no evidence of either de facto coercion,lack of choice,or ignorance and unsophistication on the part of the buyers,and we will not read anything additional into the record.
even if we do assume an imbalance in bargaining power,and that woodside,as the stronger party,presumably prepared the contracts with an eye to its own advantage,and even if we also assume that woodside would not have countenanced the striking of the judicial reference provisions,the buyers have nevertheless only shown a low level of procedural unconscionability because,as we have found above,the elements of surprise or,a fortiori,misrepresentation see ellis mckinnon broadcasting,supra,th at,d were not present.in order to prevail,therefore,the buyers must have established a high level of substantive unconscionability.
substantive unconscionability 
again we will take pardee as the starting point.in that case,the judicial reference necessarily included the waiver of the right to jury trial.the specific terms also prohibited the recovery of punitive damages.as noted above,there was no provision for the referee fees,which left open the possibility that a buyer might be liable for all the fees.pardee,supra,th at,d.in this case,there is no limitation on damages while fees are to be shared evenly unless the referee determines otherwise.
the trial court here also was concerned about several other factors,some present or possibly present in pardee and some not.the trial court disliked woodside power to opt out,the lack of any provision for attorneys fees,the possibility that a could be selected the confidentiality of the transcript,and the lack of provisions for mediation.in our view,none of these issues is of substantial weight.
it is quite true that an agreement for alternative dispute resolution which is not binding upon the party insisting on it may be deemed unfair there must be a modicum of bilaterality.armendariz,supra,cal th at,d.in this case,woodside was not required to participate in the judicial reference unless it was satisfied that all necessary and appropriate parties will participate.however,woodside persuasively pointed out that it had required all or virtually all of its subcontractors to agree to participate in any judicial reference proceeding and that the provision was designed to ensure that the entire dispute could be resolved in one setting,whether by reference or trial the contract bound it to act in good faith in attempting to secure the participation of the subcontractors.certainly there is nothing to indicate how or why woodside might manipulate this provision to its advantage.
as for the possibility that an attorney who had never been a judge might be selected as a referee,the law governing references accepts such persons as qualified referees.see code civ.we think the trial court fear that an attorney referee might be unqualified to apply the rules of evidence and that type of thing was unjustified speculation.equally to a large extent rebutted by woodside the trial court concern that mediation or settlement conferences would be unavailable.there is no reason to make the illogical supposition that if both sides thought that informal attempts to resolve the dispute might be useful,they would not arrange such attempts,and woodside in fact pointed this out.the contracts also specifically provided that the referee could require prehearing conferences.
as for the provision that both sides would bear their own attorneys fees,this,as woodside pointed out,merely restated the american rule of general applicability code civ,city and county of san francisco sweet cal th,fn,d.it took nothing away from the buyers and was neither harsh nor oppressive.
finally,the trial court was concerned with the provision that the transcript of the reference proceeding was to remain confidential unless needed for appeal.assuming,arguendo,that buyers correctly assert that this provision is illegal,that does not make it unconscionable as to them.the factors which prohibit even the parties from agreeing to secret judicial proceedings bear on the extent to which the salutary effects of open proceedings serve the public interest.see nbc subsidiary,superior court cal th,d,et passim.these concerns have nothing to say about the fairness or desirability of a secrecy provision with respect to the parties themselves,and we see nothing unreasonable or prejudicial about it 
furthermore,even if the provision is unenforceable,we agree with woodside that it is severable.civil code section provides that even if a court finds a provision in a contract to be unconscionable,it has the option to enforce the remainder of the contract.this approach has been taken in the context of arbitration clauses containing objectionable terms.see bolter superior court,supra,th at,d,commenting that i t is not necessary to throw the baby out with the bath water if a challenge is in fact made to this provision as the matter proceeds towards resolution,or thereafter,severance would seem reasonable.
we are left,then,with the waiver of the right to jury trial and the issue of expense.
the contracts in this case,in contrast to those in pardee,contain an express basic rule for the even division of the expenses of the judicial reference,with an additional provision authorizing the referee to direct payment at his or her discretion.insofar as the pardee court was concerned that the contract before it made no mention of such fees at all,woodside contract did at least indicate to buyers that the process of judicial reference would involve expenses for the referee and thus the procedural element of surprise is not present.however,the underlying issue of fees requires some consideration.in pardee,counsel indicated that a typical referee in san diego charged to per hour.here,the trial court speculated that costs could run up to per hour.either figure demonstrates the possibility for substantial expense,and an argument can be made that,compared with the free access to the court itself,a contract which imposes upon the weaker party the possibility of such exposure is unconscionable.
it is still frequently assumed,or stated without discussion,that arbitration and,by analogy,a general judicial reference provides economies both of time and expense.see vandenberg superior court cal th,d,engalla,supra,cal th at,d.however,as suggested in pardee,the possibility that the fees of an arbitrator or referee may be burdensome especially to the weaker party has also been recognized.in fact,where the plaintiff is attempting to seek redress for the violation of a statutory or constitutional right,any provision requiring him to pay costs in excess of those incident to normal litigation is invalid.see,armendariz,supra,cal th at,d.considerable attention has also been paid to the problem of nonconsensual judicial reference of,discovery disputes,where one party is genuinely unable to pay the costs.see code civ,apportionment of such fees taggares superior court th,d,and ca
