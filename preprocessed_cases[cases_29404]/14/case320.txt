this case stems from a and reconstruction project on faraon street in joseph,missouri the faraon project.the city of joseph the city sued southwestern bell telephone,swbt,claiming that the city incurred additional contractor costs because swbt failed to move its underground telephone lines for the faraon project.swbt moved for summary judgment on all claims and asked the district court to strike the affidavit of roger sparks,the engineer of streets and sewers for the city.the district court granted summary judgment to swbt and struck sparks affidavit,concluding that it was a sham affidavit.the city appeals,arguing that the district court erred in striking sparks affidavit determining that the city failed to establish a claim for promissory estoppel against swbt and determining that the city failed to establish a claim for negligent misrepresentation against swbt.we affirm.
background 
in,the city announced its plans to make improvements on faraon street.the city hired olsson associates olsson to provide design services and services to the city and to act as the city representative on the faraon project.on may,olsson informed the affected utility companies by letter.in addition,olsson sent plan sheets to the utilities and requested that they review the locations of their facilities and return the plan sheets to olsson.swbt received a copy of the letter and the request to return the plan sheet.
by june,swbt knew that it would have to move its lines and facilities for the faraon project.sometime between may and november,swbt decided to replace the existing lines and install new lines throughout the entire length of the faraon project.however,comco designs comco,swbt contractor,did no work on designing the placement of the new lines during this time period.
on november,olsson sent swbt a letter stating that the faraon project would commence in may or june of.on november,the city held a utility coordination meeting to ensure that the parties involved with the faraon project were not delayed in their work.swbt employee bill hansen,manager of engineering design,attended the meeting.at that time,hansen thought swbt existing line would only minimally interfere with the faraon project.
on february,olsson mailed swbt a final design plan for the first phase of the faraon project.in the accompanying letter,olsson informed swbt that the city would begin construction of the faraon project in june or july of.swbt did not object to this schedule.
on april,pursuant to swbt work request on january,comco provided work prints to swbt for the abandonment of the existing lines and the installation of new lines in connection with the faraon project.none of comco plans showed a temporary relocation of existing swbt telephone lines and facilities.to implement comco prints,swbt needed to review the drawings to ensure that they coincided with swbt overall plan to relocate its existing telephone lines and facilities obtain a price from a contractor to implement the drawings and obtain the approval of lloyd baskett,director of engineering construction for swbt.however,prior to the end of may,no one at swbt had reviewed the work prints.
in april,roger sparks,city engineer for streets and sewers and the project manager for the faraon project,became concerned that swbt would impede road construction.the city april meeting for prospective bidders confirmed sparks concerns.at the meeting,chip cocoran of olsson recorded in a section of his notes entitled utility relocation that t elephone is the most significant conflict,design of relocation underway,no work yet.two fibers and pari in phase.
subsequently,olsson kent evans inquired of swbt about the time frame for swbt moving its cables.kraig arthur,manager of engineering design for swbt,took the call from evans because he was filling in for hansen while he was on medical disability leave.during the phone conversation,evans indicated to arthur that olsson would like to have swbt work finished by the end of june.arthur said that would probably be possible.arthur was aware that the city planned to start construction on the faraon project in july.arthur told evans that he would discuss swbt time frame with john garrett,swbt construction manager,and get back to him.
when arthur asked garrett whether swbt could have its lines moved by the end of june,garrett told arthur that swbt could have its lines moved by that time.arthur also reviewed swbt prints to install the new telephone lines and facilities.pursuant to evans request,arthur sent a letter to evans on may,which stated southwestern bell telephone plans to have the telephone cables moved to the south by the end of june.we will start work in the next few weeks.if you have any questions,please call emphasis added.arthur did not have his letter to evans reviewed or approved by his supervisors at swbt before he sent it.arthur testified that when he sent the letter,he had no reason to believe that swbt could not move its cables by the end of june.
on may,the city attached arthur letter,along with letters from other utilities,to an addendum to its bid documents.the city,however,failed to inform arthur or anyone else at swbt that it would provide arthur letter to bidders on the faraon project.on may,the city selected loch sand and construction company loch sand as the lowest bidder.swbt never received a copy of the contract between the city and loch sand.
at the beginning of may,sparks did not know what methods swbt would use to relocate its facilities on faraon street.sparks testified that the city did have a commitment from swbt in any way that they sic would be done.then,on may,three and a half weeks after the city received arthur letter,sparks spoke with hansen,who had returned from medical leave,about arthur letter.when asked what he recalled about his conversation with hansen,sparks stated that what he recalled was in the he sent to cocoran about his conversation with hansen.in the,sparks stated 
talked with the telephone company today sw bell.the lead engineering guy,bill hansen,was surprised to here sic that we have a letter from them stating that they would be clear of the construction by july.he thought they might be started by then.this leaves us in a slight predicament.i never could figure out how they were going to relocate before the contractor completed the cuts and fills anyway i have asked bill to get his people together for a meeting with us and perhaps the contractor to figure out how this can be done 
when questioned about the during his deposition,sparks stated that hansen told him that swbt would not have its lines and cables moved prior to june,and that swbt might start with the relocation by july,but that swbt would not be finished by that time.sparks testified that the slight predicament he referred to in his was loch sand wanting to commence work at the same time that swbt would be relocating therefore,they would have to work together or around each other.
despite sparks deposition testimony,the city relies on sparks affidavit which sparks signed the same day that the city suggestions in opposition to the defendant motion for summary judgment was due to the which sparks claims that hansen told him that swbt would start work before the end of june and that swbt was committed to working ahead of the city contractor so that swbt would not interfere with the contractor work.
the city legal troubles arise because loch sand encountered delays in the performance of its contract with the city due to swbt and other utilities relocation or replacement of their utility lines.the city issued loch sand a notice to proceed notice despite having no firm dates for completion of the utility work.sparks testified in his deposition that on june,he assumed loch sand would have some interference from swbt of an undetermined extent.
swbt claims that it could not relocate its cables before the city completed its process of obtaining from adjacent landowners through eminent domain proceedings.neither party disputes,however,that in the first stage of the faraon project,no issues existed as of april,that would have prevented swbt contractor from replacing swbt lines.the city contends that at all times during the faraon project,sufficient room existed in the for swbt to install its new telephone lines and facilities.the city asserts that within the first feet of the project,swbt had to feet of existing in which to work.according to the city,by june,the city had obtained the,with the exception of three properties involved in a condemnation proceeding.all of the city assertions are based on the aforementioned affidavit sparks executed after his deposition.swbt responds that no evidence exists that sparks had either sufficient personal knowledge or experience to support these assertions.neither party disputes,however,that joseph light power previously advised the city,in writing,that it could not move its poles and lines until after the city obtained the.
in addition,joseph light power told swbt that it could not dig within ten feet of the power poles to lower swbt existing cables because the power poles would collapse,meaning swbt could not move its power lines for a period of time.the city,relying on sparks affidavit,claims that swbt contractor refused to relocate any of swbt telephone lines and facilities until loch sand had completed a substantial portion of the excavation work for the first stage of the faraon project.swbt,however,relies on sparks deposition in which he testified that,in early july,swbt contractor stopped work because it could not relocate the phone lines because of the power poles.
on september,the city settled claims made by loch sand.in the settlement agreement,loch sand executed a release in favor of the city.the agreement did not extinguish the liability,if any,of swbt to loch sand.loch sand and swbt never entered into an agreement or contract.the city filed suit against swbt,arguing that it incurred additional contractor costs because of swbt failure to move its underground telephone lines.the city asserted five claims against swbt,including promissory estoppel and negligent misrepresentation swbt subsequently filed a motion for summary judgment on all claims and asked the court to strike sparks affidavit as contradictory to spark deposition testimony.the district court granted swbt summary judgment on all claims and struck sparks affidavit,finding that glaring contradictions existed between sparks deposition testimony and his affidavit.
ii.discussion 
the city raises three arguments on appeal that the district court erred in striking spark affidavit from the record that the district court erred in granting summary judgment to swbt on the city claim of promissory estoppel and that the district court erred in granting summary judgment to swbt on the city claim of negligent misrepresentation.we review a district court grant of summary judgment de novo.stuart general motors,cir.
striking of sparks affidavit 
the city first argues that the district court erred in striking sparks affidavit from the record,claiming that sparks subsequent affidavit does not directly contradict his previous deposition testimony.the city relied on sparks affidavit in response to swbt motion for summary judgment.swbt counters that the district court did not err in striking the affidavit because it amounted to a sham affidavit under this court precedent.
under federal rule of civil procedure c,we will sustain an entry of summary judgment only if the pleadings,depositions,answers to interrogatories,and admissions on file,together with the affidavits,if any,show that there is no genuine issue as to any material fact and that the moving party is entitled to summary judgment as a matter of law.camfield tires,michelin tire,cir.
in camfield,we addressed the troublesome issue of whether summary judgment may be granted when one of the parties after giving a deposition later files an affidavit with directly contrary statements.id.in affirming the district court grant of summary judgment for the defendant,this court held that an affidavit filed by the plaintiff in opposition to a motion for summary judgment that directly contradicted the plaintiff previous deposition testimony was insufficient to create a genuine issue of material fact under rule.id.at.we stated 
the very purpose of summary judgment under rule is to prevent the assertion of unfounded claims or the interposition of specious denials or sham defenses wright,miller kane,federal practice and procedure.if a party who has been examined at length on deposition could raise an issue of fact simply by submitting an affidavit contradicting his own earlier testimony,this would greatly diminish the utility of summary judgment as a procedure for screening out sham issues of fact.
id.we emphasized that while summary judgment is to be reserved for those cases in which there is no genuine material issue of fact for determination,if testimony under oath can be abandoned many months later by the filing of an affidavit,probably no cases would be appropriate for summary judgment.id.no party should be allowed to create issues of credibility by contradicting his own previous testimony.id.at.
district courts,however,must use extreme care in examining such issues and only grant summary judgment where the conflicts between the deposition and affidavit raise only sham issues.id.accordingly,when the affiant states in his affidavit that he was confused in his deposition or where the affiant needs to explain portions of his deposition testimony that were unclear,the district court should not strike the affidavit from the record.id.at.in addition,when the affiant affidavit does not actually contradict his earlier testimony,the district court should not strike the affidavit from the record.bass city of sioux falls,cir.
here,the district court articulat ed with care its reasons for finding that sparks affidavit contradicted his prior deposition testimony.camfield,at.first,while sparks testified in his deposition that hansen told him that swbt might be started with the relocation by july,he stated in his affidavit that hansen told him that swbt would start work before the end of june so as to not interfere with the contractor work,which was to commence on july.the two statements are inconsistent because hansen could not say that swbt might start the relocation by july,and simultaneously commit swbt to definitively starting the relocation before june.
second,sparks claim in his affidavit that hansen told him that swbt was committed to working ahead of the city contractor conflicts with his to cocoran in which he wrote that he never could figure out how they were going to relocate before the contractor completed the cuts and fills anyway.in addition,sparks testified in his deposition that the slight predicament the city was in was a contractor wanting to start about the same time that bell is going to be there,meaning they would have to work around each other.therefore,sparks and deposition testimony reveal sparks understanding,as of may,that swbt would not be working ahead of the city contractor.
third,sparks never claimed in his affidavit that he was confused in his deposition or that he needed to clarify statements he made in his deposition.
finally,we agree with the district court that the city filing of sparks affidavit on the same day that the city suggestions in opposition to defendant motion for summary judgment were due is highly suspicious.the timing of the affidavit,combined with the aforementioned factors,indicate that the city engaged in a effort to create a genuine issue of material fact to prevent the district court entry of summary judgment in swbt favor.therefore,we hold that the district court was entitled to grant summary judgment where the city sudden and unexplained revision of testimony create d an issue of fact where none existed before.wilson westinghouse,cir.
promissory estoppel 
the city second argument on appeal is that the district court erred in granting summary judgment to swbt on the city promissory estoppel claim.promissory estoppel allows courts to enforce a promise on equitable grounds,even where parties did not enter into a contract.prenger baumhoer.the doctrine of promissory estoppel is to be applied with caution,sparingly and only in extreme cases to avoid u
