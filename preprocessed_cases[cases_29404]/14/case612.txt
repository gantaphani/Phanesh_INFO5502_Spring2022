introduction 
two insurers issued comprehensive general liability cgl policies to the same insured in different years.several years later,the insured,a general contractor,was sued for negligence allegedly committed during the second policy period,and it tendered its defense to the second insurer.the second insurer learned during discovery that the insured also had done work for the plaintiff during the first policy period,and it asked the first insurer to participate in the defense.the first insurer did so.however,after the jury returned a verdict against the insured,the first insurer refused to indemnify the insured,asserting that the jury had found negligence only during the second policy period.the second insurer indemnified the insured and then sued the first insurer for equitable contribution.it lost after a bench trial,and this appeal followed.
we conclude that the jury verdict against the insured did not clearly indicate whether the jury found negligence during the first policy period,the second policy period,or both.we thus address the following issue of first impression which insurer bears the burden of proving the existence or nonexistence of coverage in a case like the present one,where one insurer has participated in the defense indemnity of an insured and the other has not we hold that in an action for equitable contribution brought by an insurer who has defended and indemnified an insured against a coinsurer who has not defended or has not indemnified the insured,the participating insurer has met its burden of proof when it makes a prima facie showing of coverage under the nonparticipating insurer same showing necessary to trigger the recalcitrant insurer duty to defend.the burden of proof then shifts to the nonparticipating insurer to prove the absence of actual coverage.here,because the first insurer failed to meet its burden of proving the absence of coverage,we reverse and remand to allow the trial court to allocate equitably defense and indemnity costs.
factual and procedural history 
i.the insurance policies 
travelers issued a commercial general liability insurance cgl policy to krata,doing business as five star services,effective july,to july,the travelers policy.arrowood as successor in interest to royal surplus lines insurance company issued a cgl policy to five star,effective july,to july,the arrowood policy each policy had a liability limit of million per occurrence and million in the aggregate.
the arrowood and travelers policies contained identical policy language.as relevant here,the policies provided that the insurers will pay those sums that the insured becomes legally obligated to pay as damages because of bodily injury or property damage to which this insurance applies.further,w e will have the right and duty to defend the insured against any suit seeking those damages.however,we will have no duty to defend the insured against any suit seeking damages for bodily injury or property damage to which this insurance does not apply.
the policies applied to bodily injury and property damage if the bodily injury or property damage is caused by an occurrence that takes place in the coverage territory and the bodily injury or property damage occurs during the policy period.an occurrence means an accident,including continuous or repeated exposure to substantially the same general harmful conditions.property damage means a physical injury to tangible property,including all resulting loss of use of that property.all such loss of use shall be deemed to occur at the time of the physical injury that caused it or b loss of use of tangible property that is not physically injured.all such loss of use shall be deemed to occur at the time of the occurrence that caused it.
both policies had identical supplementary payment provisions,providing coverage for a ll costs taxed against the insured in any suit we the insurer defend,and for prejudgment and postjudgment interest.
ii.the underlying action 
on january,ron and maureen ashley the ashleys filed a complaint against ruth and george dunmore the dunmores in an action entitled ashley dunmore,sacramento county superior court,case the underlying action.the complaint alleged that in november,the ashleys agreed to purchase the sunflorin village apartment complex sunflorin or the property from the dunmores.immediately prior to the sale,the dunmores or their property manager,fpi management,fpi,hired five star to remediate dry rot in the property exterior wood siding,trim,and decks.while doing the repair work,the dunmores and fpi discovered substantial and pervasive dry rot damage to the property exterior building envelope,wood siding,trim,decks and balconies.the dry rot in many instances compromised the structural integrity of the balconies and guard rails,posing serious safety risks to the tenants and visitors to the property.nonetheless,because the dunmores had decided to sell the property,they elected to not correct the safety hazards replace the dry rotted wood,but instead to conceal the dry rot damage by,among other things,fastening new trim to defective wood,or covering the dry rot damage with new paint.the dunmores did not disclose the existence of the dry rot damage to the ashleys,and the ashleys did not discover it until after the close of escrow.
on march,the dunmores against fpi and five star.they alleged that i n or about november of,fpi and five star entered into an agreement evidenced by one or more writings the remediation agreement in which five star agreed to perform dry rot remediation at the property.the dunmores are informed and believe and thereon allege that,in the remediation agreement,five star agreed,among other things,to locate and replace wooden structures on the property which were affected by dry rot.however,fpi five star intentionally or negligently failed to locate and replace or otherwise remediate wooden structures on the property which were affected by dry rot,and performed their work in such a manner as to cover some dry rot conditions on the property with new wooden structures so that the dry rot conditions were no longer visible.accordingly,a n actual controversy has arisen and now exists between the dunmores and fpi and five star in that the dunmores contend,and fpi and five star deny,that,as between the dunmores and fpi and five star,responsibility,if any,for the damages claimed by the ashleys herein rests entirely or partially on fpi and five star,and that,as a result,fpi and five star are obligated to partially or fully indemnify the dunmores for any sums,including attorneys fees,expenses,and costs of suit,that the dunmores may incur in defense of the ashleys complaint,as well as for any damages,judgment,attorneys fees,expenses,costs of suit,or other awards recovered by the ashleys against the dunmores.
iii.tender of the underlying action 
five star tendered the defense of the underlying action to arrowood in june.on july,arrowood agreed to defend five star under a reservation of rights.
on may,arrowood tendered five star defense to travelers.arrowood advised travelers that its initial investigation indicated that five star had done dry rot repair at sunflorin during arrowood policy period july,to july,but f urther investigation with the named insured and the property manager determined there were for dry rot repair that dated back to your travelers policy period.
by letter of september,travelers agreed to defend five star.it stated that it had completed its review of the facts,pleadings,and the policy provisions of the travelers property casualty insurance company travelers policy issued to five star,and having done so,agreed to participate in the defense of five star under a reservation of rights.
iv.trial of the underlying action 
the underlying action went to trial before a jury.on october,the jury returned a special verdict,finding that five star was liable for negligence and the ashleys were contributorily negligent.it also found that the ashleys total damages for dry rot repairs were and five star and the ashleys were each percent responsible for the damages.
five star brought motions for new trial and for judgment notwithstanding the verdict.the trial court denied both motions.
as against five star,the trial court awarded the dunmores attorney fees of and costs of.accordingly,the total award against five star was percent of damages award attorney fees costs postjudgment interest.
travelers refused to indemnify five star for any portion of the compensatory damages award,but it paid of the attorney fee award it also paid a portion of the fees and costs incurred to defend five star in the underlying action from the may,tender.arrowood indemnified five star for the balance of the judgment,and it paid the balance of the fees and costs incurred to defend five star.
v.the present action 
on january,arrowood filed the present action for declaratory relief,indemnity,contribution,subrogation,and reimbursement against travelers.travelers answered,denying the allegations of the complaint and asserting affirmative defenses,including that arrowood claims were barred to the extent that the underlying claims asserted against five star are not actually covered or potentially covered under the travelers policy and that the alleged property damage at issue in the underlying action filed against five star did not occur during the effective policy period of the travelers policy alleged in the complaint.travelers also against arrowood for declaratory relief,equitable indemnity,equitable contribution,and equitable subrogation,asserting that based on the jury special findings in the underlying action,arrowood should be ordered to reimburse travelers for all of the sums travelers contributed to five star defense,as well as for the travelers paid to indemnify five star.
travelers and arrowood filed for summary judgment,seeking adjudication of their respective defense and indemnity obligations to five star.on january,the trial court denied both motions,explaining its ruling as follows 
the special verdict form did at least arguably resolve the controverted factual issues in the underlying case,those being liability and damages.but that jury was not asked to make any actual findings as to whether any dry rot work done by five star in the year,which would have fallen into the traveler s policy,whether that work caused or contributed to the necessity for any later work those kinds of questions,apparently,from my read,were in front of the jury.and these issues,really,concern more the coverage and contributions issues as between the two insurers,not the liability and damages that the jury was asked to assess.i do think that i can conclude,based on what i seen here,that there is no potential for coverage in terms of the traveler s policy,and i think the matter has to proceed to trial.
the case was tried to the court on june.the parties stipulated to the introduction of many facts and exhibits and there was no live testimony at the conclusion of argument,the trial court ruled that travelers had no duty to defend or indemnify with respect to the underlying action,and thus it entered judgment for travelers in the amount of,representing the costs and fees it paid to five star in connection with the underlying action.the court stated as follows 
i am finding that there was no duty to defend on behalf of travelers.the verdict form deals specifically with the year.that question one of the verdict.and the complaint that was operative in this lawsuit listed those dates as between as being the dates for which five star service s work was being questioned.the travelers policy had expired before the date here.
now,it came to be that some information was gleaned and travelers was put on notice at a later time.and they decided,i think,erroneously,and decided in an overabundance of caution maybe because of bad faith considerations.i do know.they decided that they would defend under reservations of rights.and,in so doing,they ended up paying and change as a contribution toward the ultimate decision.
i think that montrose chemical superior court cal th and buena vista mines,industrial indemnity th are the controlling cases.having decided the initial issue of a duty to defend,i do need to,thereafter,get to the duty to indemnify,and i do need to get to an allocation there.if the duty to defend does not exist,then the duty to indemnify does not exist,and there needs to be no allocation.
the remedial work that was done by five star in under the arrowood or surplus arrowood policy was found by the jury to have been negligently done.the scope of that work was expanded over whatever work they did in the year and should have included remediation work for any work in.the jury found that the negligence that occurred was in the to area.that sufficient,i think,for my determination.
i suppose we can look back at the special verdict form.that where fault has been found here.maybe it could have been crafted a little better.i think,on balance,that it worked out because the evidence of the work done was under the arrowood policy period.
so i have not taken the plaintiff arguments lightly.i read the cases,but i think this is the proper conclusion.
judgment was entered on august,and notice of entry of judgment was served on august.arrowood timely appealed.
contentions on appeal 
arrowood contends that travelers owed five star a duty to defend and a duty to indemnify.further,because arrowood and travelers had equal time on the risk each insured five star for one contends that travelers is responsible for percent of the costs of defense,percent of the supplementary payments attorney fees,costs,and interest,and percent of the damages award.
travelers contends that it did not owe five star either a duty to defend or a duty to indemnify.thus,it urges that the trial court properly ordered arrowood to reimburse it for all sums defense and indemnity it paid on five star behalf.in the alternative,travelers contends that even if it owed a duty to defend,its share of defense costs should be based on the percentage of work performed during each insurer policy period.specifically,travelers asserts that five star did approximately percent of its work during travelers policy period,and percent of its work during arrowood policy period.thus,travelers urges that it should be responsible for no more than percent of five star defense costs.

discussion 
travelers owed five star a duty to defend 
the travelers policy provided that it would have the right and duty to defend five star against any suit seeking damages for bodily injury or property damage that occurred during the policy period.travelers concedes that the underlying action sought damages for property damage,but it contends that the property damage did not occur during the policy period.thus,it urges,it had no duty to defend.arrowood disagrees it contends that the evidence it provided to travelers when it tendered the case in may was sufficient to create a potential for coverage and,thus,that travelers had a duty to defend.for the reasons that follow,we agree with arrowood and conclude that travelers owed five star a duty to defend.
a.the duty of defense generally 
the law governing an insurer duty of defense is well settled.an insurer must defend its insured against claims that create a potential for indemnity under the policy.citations.the defense duty arises upon tender of a potentially covered claim and lasts until the underlying lawsuit is concluded,or until it has been shown that there is no potential for coverage.citation.when the duty,having arisen,is extinguished by a showing that no claim can in fact be covered,it is extinguished only prospectively and not retroactively.citations.on the other hand,in an action wherein none of the claims is even potentially covered because it does not even possibly embrace any triggering harm of the specified sort within the policy period caused by an included occurrence,the insurer does not have a duty to defend.citation.from these premises,the following may be stated if any facts stated or fairly inferable in the complaint,or otherwise known or discovered by the insurer,suggest a claim potentially covered by the policy,the insurer duty to defend arises and is not extinguished until the insurer negates all facts suggesting potential coverage.on the other hand,if,as a matter of law,neither the complaint nor the known extrinsic facts indicate any basis for potential coverage,the duty to defend does not arise in the first instance.scottsdale ins.mv transportation cal th.
the supreme court broadly construed an insurer duty to defend in the seminal case of gray zurich insurance cal d gray.there,gray was the defendant in a suit alleging intentional assault.gray notified his insurer of the suit,claiming coverage under a comprehensive personal liability policy in which the insurer agreed to defend any suit against the insured alleging bodily injury or property damage unless the bodily injury or property damages were caused intentionally by or at the direction of the insured.id.at.the insurer refused to defend gray on the ground that the claims against him alleged an intentional tort that fell outside the policy coverage.ibid.gray unsuccessfully defended on a theory of,and judgment of was entered against him.ibid.
gray sued the insurer for breach of the duty to defend.the supreme court concluded that the insurer had breached its duty the insurer can not construct a formal fortress of the third party pleadings and retreat behind its walls.the pleadings are malleable,changeable and amendable thus,courts do not examine only the pleaded word but the potential liability created by the suit since modern procedural rules focus on the facts of a case rather than the theory of recovery in the complaint,the duty to defend should be fixed by the facts which the insurer learns from the complaint,the insured,or other sources.an insurer,therefore,bears a duty to defend its insured whenever it ascertains facts which give rise to the potential of liability under the policy.gray,supra,cal d at,italics added.in the present case,the insurer had a duty to defend because the complaint presented the potential for a judgment based on nonintentional conduct the underlying complaint clearly presented the possibility that plaintiff might obtain damages that were covered by the indemnity provisions of the policy.even conduct that is traditionally classified as intentional or wilful has been held to fall within indemnification coverage.fn.omitted.moreover,despite the plaintiff pleading of intentional and wilful conduct,he could have amended his complaint to allege merely negligent conduct.further,gray might have been able to show that in physically defending himself,even if he exceeded the reasonable bounds of,he did not commit wilful and intended injury,but engaged only in nonintentional tortious conduct.thus,even accepting the insurer premise that it had no obligation to defend actions seeking damages not within the indemnification coverage,we find,upon proper measurement of the third party action against the insurer liability to indemnify,it should have defended because the loss could have fallen within that liability.id.at.
the court reached a similar result in mullen glens falls ins.d mullen.there,the defendant insurer issued a comprehensive personal liability policy to the santoses.the policy provided that the insurer would defend the santoses or members of their household in any suit against them alleging bodily injury caused by an occurrence defined as an accident,but it excluded coverage for bodily injury arising out of the use of a motor vehicle.id.at.while the policy was in effect,plaintiff sued the santoses son,anthony,for assault and battery,alleging that while plaintiff was filling anthony car with gasoline,anthony intentionally assaulted him.id.at.the insurer declined to defend the suit,noting that the policy did not cover intentional acts or acts proximately caused by the operation of an automobile.id.at.judgment was entered against anthony the plaintiff as anthony assignee then commenced an action against the insurer for damages for failure to defend.id.at.
the court held that the insurer breached its duty to defend.it noted that if it were to look only to plaintiff complaint in his personal injury action against anthony,it would be tempted to agree with glens falls position that it was not obligated to provide anthony with a defense in that lawsuit the allegations of the complaint suggest that the operation and use of the chevrolet automobile was somehow connected with plaintiff injuries,and glens falls insurance policy excluded coverage for bodily injury or property damage arising out of the ownership,maintenance,operation,use,loading or unloading of any automobile.mullen,supra,d at.likewise,if it were to be guided solely by the judgment acquired by plaintiff against anthony santos in the personal injury action and by plaintiff subsequent deposition,we would have no alternative but to declare that the incident of february,was not covered by the insurance policy.according to the deposition,plaintiff was savagely assaulted by anthony santos with a tire iron,without provocation,and the term occurrence within the ambit of the coverage provided by the policy does not include bodily injuries or property damage expected or intended from the standpoint of the insured.ibid.the court noted,however,that an insurance company must defend any lawsuit brought against its insured that potentially seeks damages covered by the policy,and an insurer duty to defend is not determined merely by looking to the underlying complaint or judgment.id.at.instead,the crucial question is whether glens falls was in possession of factual information which gave rise to potential liability under its policy when the company denied anthony santos a defense in plaintiff personal injury action.id.at.the court concluded that it was the insurance company had been notified by its agent that plaintiff received a head injury in a fight with anthony santos when he was struck by santos with a tire iron and that she did not have all of the details of the incident.accordingly,despite the allegations of the complaint in plaintiff personal injury action which were even somewhat ambiguous on the point of whether the operation and use of an automobile were involved in causing plaintiff injuries,when glens falls denied anthony santos a defense it had information in its possession which showed that the operation and use of an automobile had no causal connection with plaintiff injuries citations and that the alleged injuries were the result of a fight for all the insurance company could have known at that time,plaintiff started the fight and was struck by santos in.it is now settled that injuries resulting from acts committed by an insured in are not intended or expected within the meaning of those terms as customarily used in an exclusionary clause like the one involved in the present case.ibid.
travelers owed five star a duty of defense because the allegations of the complaint and facts known to travelers created a potential for coverage 
as in gray and mullen,we begin our analysis of travelers duty to defend with the allegations of the underlying complaints.travelers correctly notes that the ashleys complaint alleges that the dunmores and fpi hired five star to repair dry rot at the sunflorin property on or about november.the is similar it alleges that i n or about november of,fpi and five star entered into an agreement evidenced by one or more writings the remediation agreement in which five star agreed to perform dry rot remediation at the property.considered alone,therefore,the underlying complaints would not give rise to a duty to defend because the alleged tortious conduct occurred in november,more than a year after the travelers policy expired.
gray and mullen are clear,however,that in considering travelers duty to defend,we must look beyond the allegations of the underlying complaints to the facts the insurer learned from the insured or other sources.gray,supra,cal d at.as relevant to that inquiry,it is undisputed that in may,arrowood advised travelers that it had determined that five star had contracted to do dry rot repair at sunflorin in august and october.further,arrowood provided travelers with copies of the relevant,dated august,august,and october.thus,at least by may,travelers was on notice that five star had performed dry rot repair work at sunflorin during its policy period.
the question,therefore,is whether travelers knowledge that five star performed dry rot repair in was sufficient to trigger a duty to defend,notwithstanding the fact that the underlying complaints did not rely on the repairs as a basis for liability.we believe that it is.as we have said,that the precise causes of action pled by the third party complaint may fall outside policy coverage does not excuse the duty to defend where,under the facts alleged,reasonably inferable,or otherwise known,the complaint could fairly be amended to state a covered liability.scottsdale ins.mv transportation,supra,cal th at.here,we believe that the underlying complaints could have been fairly amended to state a claim against five star for which coverage existed under the travelers policy.although at time of tender the complaint and alleged only that five star had intentionally or negligently failed to locate and replace or otherwise remediate wooden structures on the property which were affected by dry rot in,the ashleys easily could have amended their complaint to allege identical tortious conduct in,when five star first performed dry rot repair at sunflorin.accordingly,when arrowood submitted its tender of defense to travelers in,travelers duty to defend attached 
citing storek fid.guar.ins.underwriters,d storek,travelers claims that extrinsic evidence that five star remediated dry rot at sunflorin in did not give rise to a duty to defend because a proponent of coverage may not speculate about unpled claims that a third party might have asserted in order to manufacture insurance coverage.we do not agree.storek involved a dispute among three brothers about the management of a commonly owned building.two of the brothers,richard and craig plaintiffs,filed a lawsuit accusing the third brother,glenn,of improperly using building funds for personal gain.id.at.glenn,asserting causes of action pertaining to the building financial management.id.at.plaintiffs tendered the to their insurer,asserting that they were entitled to a defense under the terms of a policy obligating the insurer to pay those sums that the insured becomes legally obligated to pay as damages because of bodily injury,property damage,personal injury or advertising injury.the insurer declined to defend.id.at.
plaintiffs sued the insurer for breach of contract.in opposition to the insurer motion for summary judgment,plaintiffs pointed to extrinsic emails in which glenn asserted that the plaintiffs allegations of mismanagement were not truthful,and a letter from glenn accusing plaintiffs of wrongfully excluding him from the property.this extrinsic evidence,plaintiffs said,gave rise to a potential for liability based on covered but unpled claims for slander,defamation,or libel.storek,supra,d at.
the district court disagreed,holding that the did not give rise to a duty to defend as a matter of law.while it acknowledged the breadth of the duty to defend under california law,it held that the duty is not so expansive that it requires an insurer to undertake a defense as to claims that are both factually and legally untethered from the third party complaint.storek,supra,d at.in other words,the court said,there is no duty to defend when the underlying lawsuit sets forth neither the facts nor the legal claims necessary to bring the lawsuit within the terms of the policy,italics added.the insurer thus owed no duty to defend because glenn did not include any allegations about his brothers untrue statements or his exclusion from the storek building in his,and he also elected not to advance any claims for wrongful eviction,defamation,slander,or libel.id.at.as a result,h is complaint thus contains neither the legal claims that would give rise to coverage under the policy,nor any of the factual allegations that would be necessary to support such claims.ibid.
the present case differs materially from storek.unlike storek,where there was no duty to defend because the extrinsic facts on which the insureds premised their claim of duty were untethered to the legal claims made in the underlying complaint,here,the extrinsic facts on which arrowood relies are directly tethered to the legal claims made in the underlying case.specifically,the extrinsic evidence on which arrowood relies,evidence that five star did dry rot repair at sunflorin in would tend to support a claim for negligence based on a failure to detect and repair dry rot.that is precisely the claim made against five star in the underlying case.thus,even if storek were binding on us,it would not inform our analysis of the duty to defend in the present case 
travelers also relies on buena vista mines,industrial indemnity,supra,th buena vista mines for the proposition that there can be no duty to defend when the underlying complaint expressly alleges that the tortious conduct that forms the basis of the complaint occurred after the relevant policy period.the underlying action in buena vista mines alleged that the insured had violated the clean water act by improperly discharging pollutants into santa rosa creek.id.at.to avoid running afoul of the clean water act statute of limitations,the complaint expressly limited its claims to the period june,to date.ibid.notwithstanding this limitation,the insured tendered the claim to insurers who had issued cgl policies prior to.id.at.the court held that the insurers had no duty to defend as a matter of law because the underlying complaint expressly identifie d the dates of the alleged violations as occurring on or after june.id.at.further,the court said,it made no sense to read the complaint to allege unpled claims that were obviously barred by the statute of limitations.id.at.thus,n othing in the complaint in the underlying action or appellants amended complaint shows that appellants were sued for discharges occurring during respondents policy periods,thereby giving rise to a duty to defend id.at.
we do not agree with travelers that buena vista mines compels the conclusion that,as a matter of law,there was no duty to defend in the present case.in buena vista mines,the plaintiffs in the underlying case precisely defined the dates of the alleged tortious conduct to avoid the statute of limitations.thus,there existed no reasonable possibility that the underlying complaint would be amended to state a claim covered by the insurers cgl policies.the present case is very different.here,the plaintiffs in the underlying case did not precisely allege when the asserted misconduct took,they asserted that it occurred on or about november.italics added.further,there is no indication that the plaintiffs deliberately crafted the allegation to avoid an affirmative defense.thus,there is no reason to believe that the plaintiffs would not have expanded the scope of the allegation against five star if they determined during discovery that five star had done dry rot remediation prior to.
for all of these reasons,we conclude that travelers owed five star a duty to defend.
ii.travelers owed five star a duty to make supplementary payments 
the travelers policy provided for reimbursement of supplementary payments as follows we will pay with respect to any claim we investigate or settle,or any suit against an insured we defend 
all costs taxed against the insured in the suit.
prejudgment interest awarded against the insured on that part of the judgment we pay 
all interest on the full amount of any judgment that accrues after entry of the judgment and before we have paid,offered to pay,or deposited in court the part of the judgment that is within the applicable limit of insurance.
this supplementary payment provision has been interpreted to make the insurer obligation to pay an award of costs against the insured dependent on the defense duty,not on the indemnification duty.state farm general ins.mintarsih th,italics added see also prichard liberty mutual ins.th.it further has been interpreted to mean that the insurer has a duty to make supplemental payments if it had a duty to defend,regardless of whether the insurer actually provided a defense.state farm general ins.mintarsih,supra,at golden eagle ins,th.and,courts have interpreted the word costs as used in the supplementary payments provision consistent with its use in code of civil procedure section,subdivision a,which provides that attorney fees authorized by contract,statute,or law are allowable as costs to the prevailing party under code of civil procedure section.state farm general ins.mintarsih,supra,at prichard liberty mutual ins,supra,at.
travelers concedes that california courts generally recognize that an insurer obligation to fund supplementary payments is included within an insurer defense obligation,but it contends that it did not owe supplementary payments because it had no duty to defend five star.as we have already rejected this as travelers makes no alternative conclude that travelers owed five star supplementary payments.
iii.travelers owed five star a duty of indemnity 
indemnity may be defined as the obligation resting on one party to make good a loss or damage another party has incurred.sammer ball d.this obligation may be expressly provided for by contract,markley beagle cal d,it may be implied from a contract not specifically mentioning indemnity see cahill,clementina d,or it may arise from the equities of particular circumstances examiner division sweat d,see note,contribution and indemnity in california cal.where,as here,the parties have expressly contracted with respect to the duty to indemnify,the extent of that duty must be determined from the contract markley beagle,supra,at.rossmoor sanitation,pylon,cal d,mccrary construction metal deck specialists,th.
the travelers policy provided that it would pay those sums that the insured becomes legally obligated to pay as damages because of bodily injury or property damage to which this insurance applies.it further provided that covered bodily injury and property damage were limited to that occurring during the policy period.
there is no dispute that the negligent conduct for which five star was found liable caused property damage within the meaning of the travelers policy.travelers contends,however,that five star did not become legally obligated to pay damages because of property damage that occurred during travelers policy period.in other words,travelers contends that because the claim against five star was based solely on the work it did in,the damages assessed against it necessarily were based on property damage the plaintiffs suffered in and thereafter.arrowood disagrees,contending that the jury assessed damages against five star for negligence in,as well as in.to resolve this issue,we consider the jury special findings and the evidence and instructions on which they were based.
a.the jury verdict is ambiguous 
as relevant here,the special verdict form stated as follows 
did george dunmore fpi management,contract with five star services to identify and remediate all known and unknown actual and appreciable dry rot on the property as part of the work five star services engaged in late and 
did five star services remediate all of the actual and appreciable dry rot it contracted to remediate on the property as part of the work in late and 
did fpi management,george dunmore discover or ought to have discovered prior to the sale of the property to ron and maureen ashley on march,that five star services failed to repair the actual and appreciable dry rot it contracted to repair 
was five star services negligent by failing to perform dry rot repairs in a competent and reasonable manner 
was five star services negligence a substantial factor in causing harm to ron and maureen ashley 
was fpi management,negligent in failing to supervise five star services repairs at the property in a reasonable and competent manner 
what are ron and maureen ashley total damages for the reasonable costs to repair property damage caused by any of the defendants do not reduce the damages based on the fault,if any,of ron and maureen ashley or others.
were ron and maureen ashley negligent 
was ron and maureen ashley negligence a substantial factor in causing their harm 
what percentage of fault do you assign to each party 
five star services 
ron and maureen ashley 
because of the rather peculiar wording of the special verdict form,the scope of what the jury decided is not entirely clear.that is,while the first two questions directed the jury to determine whether five star had performed all that it contracted to do in and,the questions that followed concerning five star alleged negligence questions were not similarly limited by date.moreover,nothing in the phrasing of the special verdict form suggested to the jury that it was to consider the latter questions in light of the earlier ones.we therefore look at the complaint,evidence,and jury instructions to attempt to discern what the jury decided.
as we have said,the complaints in the underlying case alleged that five star performed dry rot remediation i n or about november of.these complaints were never amended to broaden the allegations against five star.nonetheless,at trial there was testimony about five star work at sunflorin in both and.this evidence included the following.
carrie briggs,an fpi property manager,testified that sometime in,she realized that dry rot repairs were needed at the property and she solicited bids for the work.five star agreed to perform the repairs described in the initial contract for.later,in october,five star advised briggs it had discovered additional dry rot,which it charged to repair.david gutierrez,five star manager,also testified about five star work in gutierrez said that he initially bid on a scope of work provided to him by fpi,but submitted change orders as he found additional dry rot around the complex.
wayne wilcox,a forest products pathologist retained by plaintiffs,testified that in northern california,it takes four to six years for a building with severe moisture problems to develop an advanced state of decay such as he saw at the sunflorin building.he told the jury that based on his observations,he believed that water intrusion and decay probably had begun with the first rains after the building construction in,reaching an advanced stage of decay at least four to six years after that.the decay would not have been visible during a of the property,but would have been visible as five star opened areas up,as conveyed in the change orders.
john donley,a damages expert retained by the ashleys,testified that the ashleys spent to correct the repairs performed by five,to correct in patio and balcony walls that five star attempted to do but failed to perform correctly.donley said that in order to eliminate dry rot,the ashleys contractor,jad,did extensive work through the sunflorin complex,ultimately repairing patio and balcony walls in units,of which had previously been worked on by five star.donley believed that the dry rot repaired by jad in large part relate d to that ha d been in existence at sunflorin for many years,probably since the complex was built.accordingly,he agreed that there was certainly an abundance of dry rot on the sunflorin complex when five star first came there to perform its work.
none of the instructions directed the jury to limit its consideration of five star alleged negligence and the ashleys resulting damages to those repairs performed by five star in.indeed,none of the instructions were limited by date in any fashion.instead,the jury was told that to establish their claim against five star,the ashleys had to prove five star services had a legal duty to conform to a standard of conduct to protect plaintiffs five star services failed to meet this standard of conduct five star services negligence was a substantial factor in causing the plaintiffs harm and t he ashleys were harmed.with respect to duty,the court told the jury that the ashleys claim that they were harmed by five star neg
