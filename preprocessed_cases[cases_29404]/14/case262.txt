volkswagen of america,volkswagen brought this diversity action against one of its car dealerships,süd of peoria,süd,for breach of contract.invoking the federal arbitration act,süd moved to stay the entire action pending arbitration.the district court denied the motion in part süd now has appealed.see id.for the reasons set forth in the following opinion,we affirm the judgment of the district court.
backgrounda.facts 
in the summer of,süd,through its three principal owners,contracted with volkswagen to open an authorized volkswagen vehicle dealership.at the time negotiations began,süd was conducting its operations in a vehicle showroom in peoria,illinois.in the agreement,in exchange for the right to sell volkswagen automobiles,süd agreed to redesign its existing facility according to volkswagen uniform design specifications.additionally,the parties arrangement contemplated that süd soon would move its operations to a new site in nearby pekin,illinois.
the parties signed three additional agreements.first,a facility construction agreement construction agreement outlined a timetable and general design specifications for the construction of the new facility.according to the terms of the construction agreement,süd had months from the date on which it acquired the new property to complete construction of the facility and have it ready for use.the agreement set intermediate deadlines for süd to complete a land survey,to prepare design plans and to furnish a warranty deed for the new property.the construction agreement also contained the following arbitration clause 
in the event of any dispute concerning any matter arising under this agreement,the parties consent to mandatory binding arbitration to be held in oakland county,michigan,under the auspices of a nationally recognized arbitration service reasonably mutually acceptable to the parties.
the parties also entered into a financing arrangement to fund construction of the new facility.under the terms of a memorandum of loan agreement the loan agreement,volkswagen agreed to extend to süd a loan at an interest rate of.in paragraph two of the loan agreement,süd,in turn,promised to service the loan with monthly interest payments and to repay the principal in five annual installments of due at the end of each year.in paragraph four of the loan agreement,süd also agreed to execute and comply fully with the terms of the construction agreement.failure to do so,the provision stated,required immediate repayment of the loan balance and accumulated interest.
lastly,the parties agreed to a performance incentive program the incentive program,which allowed süd to earn five,annual incentive payments of from volkswagen,in addition to a bonus incentive at the end of the period.the incentive payments were timed to coincide with süd loan obligations so that süd could use its yearly earned incentive to make its annual,loan payment.to earn the incentives,süd was required to comply with the minimum requirements of the volkswagen dealer operating standards,a component of the parties franchise agreement that governed the general design and operations of authorized volkswagen dealerships.additionally,the earning of incentives depended on süd execution of,and full compliance with,the construction agreement.if süd violated the construction agreement in year one,it would not earn the incentive payment for that year and also would be disqualified from earning future payments.as construction of the new facility began,volkswagen paid süd a advance to be earned later under the incentive program.
district court proceedings 
on september,volkswagen filed this diversity action for breach of contract against süd and its three principal owners,each of whom had executed guarantees on süd performance.after several failed attempts to resolve their differences amicably,volkswagen filed an amended complaint on march,reasserting its breach of contract claims.at the heart of the complaint were allegations that süd had failed to meet the time line set forth in the parties construction agreement süd allegedly did not begin construction on time,failed to acquire property for the new facility and did not tender the construction plans required by that agreement.according to count i of the complaint,this breach of the construction agreement placed süd in default of its loan obligations count i also asserted,in the alternative,that süd had defaulted on its loan obligations by failing to remit its first annual payment on time.volkswagen sought full repayment of the loan principal.
count ii of the complaint alleged breach of the incentive program and sought recovery of the advance.according to count ii,süd had violated the incentive program in two ways.first,süd allegedly had disqualified itself from earning incentives by violating the terms of the construction agreement.second,süd allegedly had not complied with the franchise agreement dealer operations standards,a precondition to receiving incentives,because it failed to order,install,or display at its current dealership premises a volkswagen facade dealer nameplate that complies with volkswagen current corporate identity standards.at.
relying upon the construction agreement arbitration provision,süd notified volkswagen of its intent to submit the matter to arbitration.it then moved,under the faa,to stay the action in the district court pending an arbitrator resolution of the dispute.the district court granted the motion in part and denied it in part.addressing count i of volkswagen of the loan court stayed the issues related to süd compliance with the construction agreement because of that contract arbitration clause.however,the court refused to stay the question of whether süd had made its loan payments on time.in the court view,the loan agreement did not provide for arbitration and did not incorporate the construction agreement arbitration clause for matters unrelated to construction.
with respect to count of the incentive court also stayed one issue but not the other.the court held that failure to install a dealer nameplate was because the motor vehicle franchise contract arbitration fairness act of fairness act,requires the parties to arbitrate disputes only if both parties assent to arbitration after a controversy arises under a dealer franchise agreement.the district court held that the nameplate issue arose under a franchise agreement within the meaning of the statute.because only süd,not volkswagen,had agreed to proceed to arbitration after the dispute had arisen,the issue could not be sent to arbitration.with respect to the alternate theory,however,the court held that volkswagen theory that süd had breached the incentive program because it failed to comply with the construction agreement was arbitrable because of the construction agreement arbitration clause.
in short,all issues related to süd performance of the construction agreement were stayed pending arbitration,but the balance of the case was set to move forward in the district court.
discussiona.
the federal arbitration act faa,provides the starting point for our analysis.the faa was enacted in against the backdrop of centuries of judicial hostility to arbitration agreements.shearson american express,mcmahon,d internal quotation marks omitted.this hostility was a vestige of the english common law,in which courts,protective of their own jurisdiction,had refused to enforce specific agreements to arbitrate this practice persisted in the united states well into the twentieth century.eventually,congress reversed the common law trend and,in enacting the faa,attempted to place arbitration agreements upon the same footing as other contracts.scherk,d quoting,at.the faa accomplishes this goal by providing that binding arbitration agreements shall be valid,irrevocable,and enforceable,save upon such grounds as exist at law or in equity for the revocation of any contract.thus,if one party to a contract containing an arbitration clause attempts to avoid arbitration and files suit in the district court,the other party may move to stay or dismiss the action on the ground that the faa requires the arbitration clause of the contract to be enforced.see id.authorizing a motion to stay id.authorizing a petition to compel arbitration.
although reflecting a liberal federal policy favoring arbitration agreements,moses cone mem l hosp.mercury constr,d,the faa purpose is not to provide special status for such agreements.rather,it makes arbitration agreements as enforceable as other contracts,but not more so.prima paint flood conklin,d.the supreme court has made clear that a rbitration under the act is a matter of consent,not coercion and the parties are generally free to structure their arbitration agreements as they see fit and may limit by contract the issues which they will arbitrate.volt info,bd.of trs.of leland stanford junior,d.t he federal policy is simply to ensure the enforceability,according to their terms,of private agreements to arbitrate.id.at.
in its brief before this court,süd submits that the district court,having determined that certain issues are arbitrable,was require d to stay proceedings in their entirety pending arbitration.see appellants br.at.in support of this theory,süd first relies upon of the faa,which provides that,
upon any issue referable to arbitration under an agreement in writing for such arbitration,the court in which such suit is pending,upon being satisfied that the issue involved in such suit or proceeding is referable to arbitration under such an agreement,shall on application of one of the parties stay the trial of the action until such arbitration has been had in accordance with the terms of the agreement 
for arbitrable issues,a stay is mandatory.see mcmahon,at.a court must stay its proceedings if it is satisfied that an issue before it is arbitrable emphasis added merit ins.leatherby ins,cir if the agreement to arbitrate is valid the court has no further power or discretion to address the issues raised in the complaint but must order arbitration.
for remaining issues,however,the faa does not give courts express guidance on how to proceed.to fill this gap in the statute,süd proposes a rule that would require the district court to stay the entire case whenever it finds at least one arbitrable issue.interestingly,although süd does not point us there,the literal language of the faa,read in isolation,might provide some support for such a theory section states that the court shall stay the trial of the action not just a part of the the suit is brought upon an arbitrable issue.emphasis added.
the courts,however,generally have not interpreted in this fashion.as we have remarked previously,the cases,perhaps concerned lest the tail wag the dog,treat the question whether to stay the entire case as discretionary in cases involving both arbitrable and nonarbitrable issues.pryner tractor supply,cir citing cases and secondary sources.the fourth circuit similarly has embraced this view in american recovery computerized thermal imaging,cir 
enforcement of agreements to arbitrate under the federal arbitration act may require piecemeal litigation,see dean witter reynolds,byrd,d,and the decision to stay the litigation of claims or issues is a matter largely within the district court discretion to control its docket,moses cone mem,at.summer rain donning publishers,cir.therefore,we leave this issue for the district court to resolve on remand.
id.at parallel citations omitted see also klay all defendants,cir when confronted with litigants advancing both arbitrable and nonarbitrable claims courts have discretion to stay nonarbitrable claims.mccarthy azure,cir holding that a party is not entitled as of right to an order staying litigation of even most of its claims,although noting that,o f course,the district court in its discretion could stay litigation of nonarbitrable claims pending the outcome of an arbitration proceeding emphasis added.
the supreme court has indicated its support for this interpretation of on at least two occasions.in dean witter reynolds,byrd,d,the court was untroubled by the prospect of piecemeal litigation resulting from the stay of some issues but not others.the preeminent concern of congress in passing the act was to enforce private agreements into which parties had entered,and that concern requires that we rigorously enforce agreements to arbitrate,even if the result is piecemeal litigation,at least absent a countervailing policy manifested in another federal statute.id.similarly,in moses cone memorial hospital,the court noted that,at the district court discretion,litigation may proceed against parties who were not subject to the arbitration agreement,even though claims against the arbitrating parties have been stayed.see at.that decision,the court held,is one left to the district court or to the state trial court under applicable state procedural rules as a matter of its discretion to control its docket.id.at.
an exception to this rule has been recognized when staying arbitrable issues,while allowing nonarbitrable issues to proceed in the district court,risks inconsistent rulings because the pending arbitration is likely to resolve issues material to the lawsuit.aggrow oils,union fire ins.of pittsburgh,cir.the factors that bear on this inquiry include the risk of inconsistent rulings,the extent to which parties will be bound by the arbitrators decision,and the prejudice that may result from delays.id.when these factors weigh in favor of staying the entire action pending arbitration,the district court may abuse its discretion in allowing the nonarbitrable issues to proceed absent a stay.in many instances,moreover,district courts actually may prefer to stay the balance of the case in the hope that the arbitration might help resolve,or at least shed some light on,the issues remaining in federal court.see,hikers indus.william stuart.
our decision in morrie mages shirlee mages foundation thrifty,cir,abrogated on other grounds,ids life ins.sunamerica,cir,provides helpful guidance on this matter.in that case,we held that a district court refusal to stay nonarbitrable issues pending the arbitration of related,arbitrable issues constituted an abuse of discretion.the buyer and seller to a corporate transaction had been ordered to arbitrate a controversy arising out of their purchase agreement,which contained an arbitration clause.the buyer guarantor also was implicated in the lawsuit but had not executed a similar arbitration provision in its agreement to guarantee the buyer performance.refusing the guarantor motion to stay its litigation with the buyer pending the result of the arbitration,the district court reasoned that the guarantor had failed to incorporate an arbitration clause into its agreement with the buyer and therefore could not benefit from a stay.reversing,we held that a stay was required because the nonarbitrable issue of the guarantor liability was completely dependent upon the arbitrable issues of the fact and extent of the buyer liability.id.at.due to this interdependence,we emphasized the potential for impairment of the issues before the arbitrator due to the collateral estoppel effect of the litigation.id.thus,we ordered the district court to enter a stay and await the result of the arbitration.
according to süd,the issues sent to arbitration are so interconnected to the ones proceeding to trial that refusing to stay the entire action was an abuse of discretion.as an example,süd first invites our attention to the question of whether it defaulted on the loan agreement by failing to make its first annual issue that the district court refused to stay.according to süd,there are two ways in which this issue is dependent upon the arbitrable question of whether it complied with the construction agreement.first,süd contends that,if the arbitrator finds that süd did not breach the construction agreement,no payments would be due under the loan.we must note that,as far as the record indicates,this first theory is incorrect.under the loan agreement default provisions,süd failure to comply with the construction agreement would trigger an obligation to repay the loan in full and immediately.however,the loan agreement also provides that,even if süd fully performs the construction agreement,it nevertheless must meet its alternate obligation of making loan payments in a timely fashion.
süd second argument concerning the interrelationship of its obligations under the loan agreement to the construction agreement deserves more attention.süd points out that its ability to repay the loan on time was dependent on receiving incentive payments from volkswagen.these payments were,in turn,dependent on süd compliance with the construction agreement,the issue proceeding to arbitration.as the district court recognized,in this context,performance under the construction agreement is interrelated.if the arbitrator were to decide in due course that süd met its obligations under the construction agreement,süd would be entitled to the incentive payments that would have allowed it to repay the loan on time in the alternative,the arbitrator may decide that it was volkswagen lack of good faith which prevented sud from meeting its obligations under the construction agreement,thus frustrating sud ability to obtain the incentive payments,and,in turn,make its payments under the loan agreement.cenco,seidman seidman,cir a breach of contract is excused if the promisee hindrance or failure to cooperate prevented the promisor from performing the contract.see restatement second of contracts.a district court certainly would act within the bounds of its discretion if it determined that proceeding on the issue of liability under the loan agreement in federal court,while the construction agreement is before the arbitrator,would waste judicial resources,would risk inconsistent verdicts and,ultimately,might prejudice one or both parties.see aggrow oils,at.
the district court understood the relationship between the süd note obligation and its performance under the construction agreement.indeed,the court intimated that,had this matter been the only issue before the court,it well might have stayed the action until the completion of the arbitration.however,the court was confronted with a more complex situation,and,therefore,we must consider these additional circumstances in determining whether the district court abused its discretion in deciding not to await the arbitrator decision on süd compliance with the construction agreement.
the district court noted that the loan agreement executed by süd contained several conditions.the fourth condition made the entire amount of the loan due immediately upon noncompliance with the construction agreement.as we have just noted,the district court acknowledged that,because compliance with the construction agreement was a matter for the arbitrator,suit for collection on the loan agreement based on this condition was related to the arbitrator decision.the court also noted,however,that the loan agreement created an independent obligation on the part of süd to pay a yearly installment of,an obligation not dependent on süd performance under the construction agreement.in this court,süd makes no argument that the court erred in its characterization of süd obligation under this clause.moreover,before the district court,süd made no argument that its obligation under the second clause is not independent of its rights and obligations under the construction agreement,nor did it invite the district court attention,with any specificity,to any potential for inconsistent rulings that might arise if litigation proceeded on the issues.see aggrow oils,at.in light of sud independent obligation to make payments on the loan agreement,we can not say that the district court abused its discretion in failing to stay litigation concerning this issue.
the district court also was faced with another issue which,in its view,was not subject to arbitration and which,if volkswagen were to prevail,could supply an avenue for relief completely independent of the construction agreement.under the incentive agreement,receiving the incentives is conditioned upon compliance with the dealer operating standards,a component of the volkswagen dealer agreement.these standards required süd to display a volkswagen facade dealer nameplate that meets volkswagen corporate identity requirements,at.volkswagen complaint asserts that,by failing to comply with this requirement,süd disqualified itself from earning incentives.as a practical matter,then,if volkswagen were to prevail on this claim,there would be an independent basis for volkswagen denial of the payments upon which süd claims it depended in order to meet its loan payments.
the district court held that arbitration of this claim was not authorized under the motor vehicle franchise contract arbitration fairness act of.the fairness act provides 
a election of arbitration

the fairness act requires that,before car manufacturers and their dealerships settle a dispute through arbitration,all parties must consent in writing after such controversy arises.id.a emphasis added.the district court determined that,because only süd desired arbitration of this issue,the parties had not executed the bilateral,written agreement necessary for the nameplate issue to be submitted to arbitration.
süd nevertheless urges that,despite the term after in the statute,we should infer the requisite consent in volkswagen act of drafting the original franchise agreement.invoking the legislative history of the fairness act,süd submits that the act is intended to protect motor vehicle dealers against automobile manufacturers and to ensure dealers the remedy of arbitration that a dealer desires.appellants br.at emphasis in original.when it is the dealership who wishes to arbitrate a dispute,süd contends,we should interpret the statute more leniently.
the legislative history cited by süd a senate committee report to the fairness an enlightening history of automotive franchise arrangements.as the report describes,for over half a century,congress has understood the imbalances in bargaining power inherent in the relationship between car dealers and manufacturers,at,as reprinted in wl.according to the senate report,unlike other types of franchisees that have a wide selection of franchisers with whom to contract,automotive dealerships may only obtain the right to merchandise and sell their product from an extremely limited group of manufacturers.id.at.leveraging this disparity in bargaining power,motor vehicle manufacturers historically have forced dealers into boilerplate franchise contracts on a take it or leave it basis.id.prominent in these contracts of adhesion,are mandatory arbitration clauses that remained enforceable under the faa,despite attempts by state legislatures to prohibit unfair arbitration.
even if we accept süd submission that the drafters of the fairness act likely intended to equalize the bargaining equation in favor of the dealer,we can not ignore that this same senate committee report insists repeatedly,consistent with the statutory text,that both parties must consent to arbitration,and only after a con
