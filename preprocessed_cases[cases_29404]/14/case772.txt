petitioners larry small,john nelson,kenneth charles,glen cardogan,theonhilius thomas,michael gittens,and maruice briscoe seek extraordinary relief from the trial court order declaring invalid a wage order promulgated by the california industrial welfare commission iwc.the wage order regulates the hours,wages,and working conditions of california employees engaged in construction,drilling,logging,and certain mining occupations.the trial court declared the wage order invalid because it was not accompanied by a sufficient statement of the basis,was not properly published,and contained an unworkable definition of given craft,which made the order unreasonable,arbitrary,capricious,and unfair.we disagree and grant the petition.
background 
in,the legislature enacted assembly bill ab stats,ch,known as the day restoration and workplace flexibility act of.lab code,et seq all statutory references are to this code unless otherwise indicated.ab restored the workday and mandated overtime pay for all nonexempt employees in all industries for work in excess of eight hours in a workday.it allowed,however,an exception for employees working an alternative work schedule,such as a four workweek instead of a traditional five workweek,subd.a.an alternative workweek schedule is deemed adopted only if it receives approval in a secret ballot election by at least of affected employees in a work unit,subd.a.
ab also required the iwc to adopt orders governing wages,hours and working conditions consistent with its terms,including regulations regarding elections to adopt and repeal alternative workweek schedules,subd.a.on january,the iwc adopted interim wage interim wage order,which applied to all nonexempt employees in california,including,for the first time,employees in the construction industry and other occupations that would later be covered by wage order.it became effective march.
wage order wage order,tit,was adopted on october and became effective january.it governs employees in construction,drilling,logging,and mining and supersedes any industry or occupational order for those employees wage order,f.among other things,it requires a new alternative workweek schedule election whenever the number of employees that are employed for at least days in the work unit that adopted an alternative workweek schedule increases by above the number who voted to ratify the employer proposed alternative workweek schedule wage order,c.
petitioners are construction workers employed by real party in interest,brinderson constructors,brinderson.in,petitioners sued brinderson for unpaid overtime wages allegedly owed for working over eight hours in a day while working an alternative workweek schedule.the basis of the claim is that,although its employees voted in december to adopt a four day alternative workweek schedule,brinderson did not conduct further alternative workweek schedule elections after january,when ab became effective.petitioners also sought an extra hour of pay for each day they were not provided with a meal or rest period as required by wage order,as well as wages for unpaid travel time.
the parties filed for determination of the following preliminary legal issue assuming a secret ballot election to adopt an alternative workweek schedule was conducted in december,was brinderson required to conduct one or more additional elections after assembly bill became effective on january,the issue was submitted to the court based on the legislative histories of ab and wage order,the parties briefs,and the following undisputed facts.on december,brinderson conducted a secret ballot election to adopt a four alternative workweek schedule.the alternative workweek schedule presented for approval at the time of the december secret ballot election was a four workweek.in january,brinderson filed with the department of industrial relations dir the results of the december secret ballot election.between january,and the date petitioners filed the lawsuit,brinderson did not conduct additional secret ballot elections.petitioners were not employed by brinderson when brinderson conducted the secret ballot election in december.petitioners were employed at various times by brinderson as construction workers.during their employment at brinderson,each of the petitioners worked an alternative workweek schedule based on a four workweek.after the secret ballot election was conducted in december,at least one work unit increased in size by more than.brinderson was not a party to any collective bargaining agreement with any labor union at any relevant time before february.
after a hearing on the,the court issued its written ruling.it concluded brinderson had properly adopted an alternative workweek schedule in december and that wage order did not invalidate the alternative workweek schedule or require another election because wage order was not accompanied by the required adequate statement of the basis wage order was not properly published and wage order is unreasonable,arbitrary,capricious,and unfair because it contains an unworkable definition of given craft.petitioners filed a motion for reconsideration in which they presented evidence of publication.the court sustained brinderson lack of foundation,failure to authenticate,and hearsay objections and denied the motion.the attorney general request to participate as amicus curiae was also denied.
petitioners now ask this court issue a writ of mandate compelling the trial court to vacate its minute order.we granted the attorney general permission to intervene on behalf of the iwc and the application of employers group to file an amicus curiae brief in support of brinderson.
discussion 
failure to provide necessary documents or citations to the record 
we first address brinderson contention that we may summarily deny the petition because petitioners failed to provide an adequate record.rule c of the california rules of court formerly rule c all rule references are to these rules provided that a writ petition that seeks review of a trial court ruling must be accompanied by an adequate record.required to be included were documents or portions of documents submitted to the trial court that are necessary for a complete understanding of the case and the ruling under review and a reporter transcript of the oral proceedings that resulted in the ruling under review.rule c c d.if the transcript is unavailable,counsel must provide a declaration explaining why and fairly summarizing the proceedings,including counsel arguments and any statement by the court supporting its ruling or s tating that the transcript has been ordered,the date it was ordered,and the date it is expected to be filed rule c a b.if the petitioner does not do so,the court may summarily deny the petition.rule c.
brinderson asserts the record does not contain a copy of the s tipulation identifying the briefs the parties would file and the dates those briefs would be filed and that t he documents comprising the administrative record of wage order are not in the order they appeared in when submitted to the trial court,and some of the pages are either missing or out of place.underscoring omitted.but brinderson fails to explain how any of this would affect our complete understanding of the case and the ruling under review.rule c c.assertions unsupported by reasoned argument are treated as waived.badie bank of america th,d.
on the other hand,brinderson correctly notes that petitioners failed to provide a copy of the reporter transcript of the hearing that resulted in the ruling under review.petitioners also failed to provide the requisite declaration explaining the reason for the transcript unavailability and summarizing the proceedings.
in their reply brief,petitioners admit they did not provide the transcript,but assert that was because no one ever requested a transcript of that hearing be prepared.to their knowledge,there is no such transcript brinderson did not attach it with its brief,nor do es it argue there was anything of value in that transcript that would or could change the outcome of what this court might decide or consider.nothing in brinderson brief is referenced to that hearing,and judge bauer decision of that hearing is fully explained in his march order.underscoring and capitalization omitted.this ignores the fact that,as the petitioners seeking relief,it was they,not the real party in interest,who had the obligation to obtain and submit the transcript,regardless of any written ruling by the court.
brinderson also correctly points out that,except for minimal citations on four pages of the memorandum of points and authorities in support of the petition,petitioners fail to support any of their factual assertions with citations to the record,as required by rule formerly rule.rules a c,a see also duarte chino community hospital th,d failure to support argument with citation to record warrants waiver of issue.
although petitioners noncompliance with appellate rules would justify a summary denial or the striking of portions of their of writ petition,we will not do either.instead,because of the importance of this decision,not only to petitioners but also to many others,we shall exercise our discretion to decide the petition on the merits.see richmond redevelopment agency western title guaranty d.
wage order 
petitioners contend the trial court erred in concluding wage order lacked the required adequate statement as to the basis,was not properly published,and was unreasonable,arbitrary,capricious,and unfair.we agree.
standard of review 
because the iwc exercise s a legislative function in promulgating its orders,t he courts exercise a limited review california hotel motel industrial welfare com.cal d,fn.omitted california hotel.but a lthough administrative actions enjoy a presumption of regularity,this presumption does not immunize agency action from effective judicial review.a reviewing court will ask three questions first,did the agency act within the scope of its delegated authority second,did the agency employ fair procedures and third,was the agency action reasonable a court will uphold the agency action unless the action is arbitrary,capricious,or lacking in evidentiary support.a court must ensure that an agency has adequately considered all relevant factors,and has demonstrated a rational connection between those factors,the choice made,and the purposes of the enabling statute.an order fixing the wages,hours,and conditions of employment therefore may not be arbitrary or capricious,the order must include an adequate statement of basis,and the order and statement must be reasonably supported by the evidence,fns.omitted.in sum,our review is limited to an examination of the proceedings to determine whether the action is arbitrary or entirely lacking in evidentiary support or whether the agency has violated the procedure required by law california labor federation,industrial welfare com.th,d california labor federation.
compliance with section,subdivision a 
before turning to the grounds the trial court relied on,we first address brinderson contention the iwc failed to comply with the legislature directives in section,subdivision a,rendering wage order invalid.the court did not specifically address this issue,although brinderson raised it.
section,subdivision a provides that the iwc shall,at a public hearing to be concluded by july,adopt wage,hours,and working conditions orders consistent with ab without convening wage boards,which orders shall be final and conclusive for all purposes.according to brinderson,wage order is invalid because its statement as to the basis reveals the iwc received a report from,and considered the recommendations of,a wage board in violation of the legislature directive and it was not adopted until october,over three months after the july deadline set forth in the statute.therefore,brinderson argues,the iwc did not act within the scope of its delegated authority.california hotel,supra,cal d at.we disagree.
the promulgation of the interim wage order satisfied section,subdivision a mandate.beginning in,the iwc held public hearings regarding the requirements of ab and promulgated the interim wage order on january.this was done well before the deadline set forth in section,subdivision a and without convening wage boards.the interim wage order declared certain wage orders null and void and reinstated others,as modified in the interim wage order,until the iwc could promulgate amended or new orders pursuant to section.but it expressly covered a ny industry or occupation not previously covered by the commission wage orders in effect in.for these,including employees in the occupations,the interim wage order applied the requirements of ab final ly and conclusive ly for all purposes as mandated by section,subdivision a.
the iwc subsequent actions were also within its delegated authority.section,subdivision e states,nothing in this section is intended to restrict the industrial welfare commission in its continuing duties pursuant to section.section imposes on the iwc a continuing duty to ascertain the wages paid to all employees in this state,to ascertain the hours and conditions of labor and employment in the various occupations,trades,and industries in which employees are employed in this state,and to investigate the health,safety,and welfare of those employees.upon investigation,if the iwc finds the wages paid inadequate or that the hours or conditions of labor may be prejudicial to the health,morals,or welfare of employees,section requires it to convene a wage board.under section,after receiving the wage board report and conducting public hearings on the proposed regulations,the iwc may,upon its own motion,amend or rescind an existing order or promulgate a new order.however,with respect to proposed regulations based on recommendations supported by at least of the members of the wage board,the commission shall adopt such proposed regulations,unless it finds there is no substantial evidence to support such recommendations,subd.a.
the interim wage order was limited to ab requirements and did not include certain regulations found in other wage orders.to determine whether a separate and more comprehensive wage order should be promulgated for construction and other industries,and at the request of both employer and employee representatives,the iwc voted on january,to convene a wage board in accordance with sections,and.after receiving the wage board report,the iwc held additional public hearings in september and october on the proposed regulations for the new wage order,which included many sections found in other existing wage orders.in october,the iwc adopted wage order,which became effective on january.as required by section,subdivision a,the new order included proposed regulations recommended by of the members of the wage board.
brinderson contends n either convening a wage board nor adopting a wage order are among the continuing duties the iwc must perform under section.true,but ascertaining the conditions of labor and investigating the health,safety,and welfare of employees are.and in convening a wage board,the iwc was determining whether the interests of employees in occupations required a separate wage order.
brinderson also claims the iwc acted outside the scope of its authority under the second paragraph of section.that paragraph states,the commission shall conduct a full review of the adequacy of the minimum wage at least once every two years.the commission may,upon its own motion or upon petition,amend or rescind any order or portion of any order or adopt an order covering any occupation,trade,or industry not covered by an existing order pursuant to this chapter.according to brinderson,the iwc did not amend or rescind any order or any portion of any order,but rather adopted a new wage order covering occupations that were already covered by the interim wage order.the contention lacks merit.
because wage order was adopted after the iwc received the wage board report and held public hearings,it was promulgated pursuant to section we offer no opinion on whether it may have been adopted under section as well.section authorizes the iwc to amend or rescind an existing order or promulgate a new order,subd.a without section requirement that the new order apply to an occupation,trade,or industry not covered by an existing order.wage order expressly states that it supersedes any industry or occupational order for those employees employed in occupations covered by this order.wage order,f.in adopting this language,the iwc both effectively rescinded the interim wage order as applied to the occupations of construction,drilling,logging and mining,and promulgated a new order covering them.
we reject brinderson contention that section was not a valid basis for the iwc action because section,subdivision a specifically directed the iwc not to use the wage board procedure as explained above,the interim wage order applied the requirements of ab final ly and conclusive ly for all purposes as required by section,subdivision a.once that was done,nothing in that section precluded the iwc from subsequently convening a wage board.
statement as to the basis 
section,subdivision b requires the iwc to prepare a statement as to the basis upon which an adopted or amended order is predicated.in compliance,the iwc prepared a statement as to the basis for wage order.petitioners and the iwc contend the court erred in finding the statement of basis inadequate.we agree.
a statement of basis need only provide an explanation of how and why the iwc did what it did.citations.california labor federation,supra,th at,d.it need not be a totally exhaustive document,and is not the equivalent of the findings of fact that a court may be required to make.citation.ibid.t he iwc is not required to make findings of fact on subsidiary,tangentially related issues or alternative suggestions ibid.
to be effective,the statement should reflect the factual,legal,and policy foundations for the action taken.the statement of basis must show that the order adopted is reasonably supported by the material gathered by or presented to the its own investigations,the wage board proceedings,and the public is reasonably related to the purposes of the enabling statute.california hotel,supra,cal d at,fn.omitted.if terms of the order turn on factual issues,the statement must demonstrate reasonable support in the administrative record for the factual determinations.if,on the other hand,the terms of the order turn on policy choices,an assessment of risks or alternatives,or predictions of economic or social consequences,the statement of basis must show how the commission resolved conflicting interests and how that resolution led to the order chosen.if an order differentiates among classes of industries,employers,or employees,the statement of basis must show that the distinctions drawn are reasonably supported by the administrative record and are reasonably related to the purposes of the enabling statute.id.at.
applying this standard,california hotel held that a statement of basis,which simply recited the iwc authority and the procedures outlined in sections through,was insufficient because it did not fulfill any of the functions of an effective statement outlined above.california hotel,supra,cal d at.but in a subsequent case,the supreme court warned against reading into section unreasonably burdensome requirements that are basically incompatible with the commission task.industrial welfare com.superior court cal d,industrial welfare com.the legislative purpose of effectively informing employers and employees of the basic reasons for the commission actions would be defeated if we were to interpret the statute to require a statement so lengthy and detailed that,in practice,such statement would have to be printed in extremely small type or in a document so extended that no one could reasonably be expected to read it.id.at.
here,the lengthy statement as to the basis for wage order deals directly with,and provides explanations for,the various provisions of the order refers to specific comments and recommendations raised in the administrative proceedings explains why the iwc decided to adopt some proposals but reject others and gives reasons for imposing a different regulation on some industries and exempting other occupations from certain requirements.see industrial welfare,supra,cal d at.such a statement leaves little doubt that the commission has made a thorough and conscientious effort to explain how and why it did what it did.citation.see also california labor federation,supra,th at,d statement of basis sufficient where it exhaustively covers the relevant facts,details the process of investigation and public hearings which led the iwc to take the action in question,and explains the iwc reasoning.
brinderson maintains the statement was deficient as to the definition of work unit,the requirement that a new election be conducted whenever the number of employees in a work unit increases by percent,and the waiting period before employees affected by the adoption of a new alternative workweek schedule may be required to work the new schedule.we address each of these in turn.
wage order defines work unit as all nonexempt employees of a single employer within a given craft who share a common work site.a work unit may consist of an individual employee as long as the criteria for an identifiable work unit in this subsection are met.wage order,u.the statement of basis for this definition provides,pursuant to a vote of the wage board,the iwc included additional definitions for work unit,which means all nonexempt employees of a single employer within a given craft who share a common work site,and may consist of an individual employee as long as the criteria for an identifiable work unit in this subsection is met 
brinderson argues this statement fails to explain the factual,legal,and policy foundations or show how the commission resolved conflicting interests and how that resolution led to the order chosen.we disagree.because the definition was included based on the recommendation of of the members of the wage board,section,subdivision a required the iwc to adopt the definition unless it found no substantial evidence in the record to support the recommendation.by adopting the definition,the iwc implicitly found substantial evidence existed.thus,the phrase p ursuant to a vote of the wage board in the statement of basis reveals how and why the iwc did what it did california hotel,supra,cal d at,fn.omitted industrial welfare,supra,cal d at,which is all the supreme court and section demand.
new election requirement 
wage order requires that,i f the number of employees who are employed for at least days in the work unit that adopted an alternative workweek schedule increases by percent above the number who voted to ratify the alternative workweek schedule,the employer must conduct a new ratification election pursuant to the rules contained in subsection c.wage order,c.brinderson argues the statement of basis for this regulation does not identify the policy foundations underlying the requirement for a new election whenever the number of employees in a work unit that adopted an alternative workweek schedule increases by percent above the number who voted to ratify the alternative workweek schedule.its reading of the statement of basis is too narrow.
brinderson cites only a portion of a paragraph as constituting the complete statement of basis.the entire paragraph,including the part brinderson omitted,states the requirements that an election to repeal an alternative workweek agreement must be held within thirty days of an employee petition and on the affected employees work site fall under the iwc labor code authority.the prerequisite of a six month lapse after the adoption of an alternative workweek schedule before an election to repeal can be held is similar to preexisting language found in wage orders though requiring a month lapse after the adoption of a n alternative workweek schedule.however,employees and employers in the construction industry testified that crews at work sites can change often and that a work unit could have a or more change in employees in a much shorter time period.in response to this information,the iwc reduced the time period and included a provision that if the number of employees that are employed for at least days in the work unit that adopted an alternative workweek schedule increases by above the numb
