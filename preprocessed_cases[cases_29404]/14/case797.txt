introduction 
the city of san diego the city appeals a judgment for inverse condemnation awarding million in damages to border business park,hereafter sometimes referred to as border 
border is a real estate development company which was developing a business park in otay mesa.otay mesa was then an unincorporated area in san diego county adjacent to the mexican border,and was later annexed by the city.border asserted two causes of action for inverse condemnation.the first arose from the city actions in connection with its announcements of a plan to create an international airport in otay mesa.border contended that these announcements substantially interfered with sales of property within the business park and diminished the value of the property.the second inverse condemnation cause of action arose from the city diversion of truck traffic,engendered by a newly opened crossing at the mexican border,in a manner which allegedly interfered substantially with access to the business park.
the city asserts numerous grounds for reversal of the inverse condemnation judgment.because we agree with the city contention that the evidence was insufficient as a matter of law to support a finding of inverse condemnation on both theories,we address only that issue.
border from an order granting the city motion for a new trial on border cause of action for breach of the development agreement it entered into with the city.it contends that the trial court erroneously found that damages which accrued before a certain date were.we affirm the order granting the city motion for new trial.
factual and procedural background 
border business park,is one of numerous business entities owned by the de la fuente family.the family business was founded by roque de la fuente,and his wife,bertha guerra de la fuente,but is now controlled by their son,roque de la fuente ii the trial court found that de la fuente and the other de la fuente family entities are the alter ego of plaintiff border business park,and of each other.
in,the de la fuentes purchased acres of land in otay mesa,an unincorporated area in san diego county adjacent to the mexican border.acres of the parcel they purchased were usable for development.the purchase was made through border business park.bertha guerra de la fuente was the sole shareholder,director,president and ceo of the corporation.de la fuente managed the company through a corporation he owned,american international enterprises.
in the early,the city became interested in annexing otay mesa.the area was then primarily raw land,but it included a small general aviation airport called brown field.in anticipation of annexation,the city created a community plan for otay mesa in.the plan stated that a study by the san diego association of governments sandag,an association of local area governments,had identified otay mesa and miramar naval air station as favored alternatives for relocating san diego international airport,lindbergh field.the report recommended otay mesa as the most likely site for the new airport.in,the city annexed otay mesa.
in,the city entered into a development agreement with border.the agreement provided that border would pay certain fees and would bear the cost of various public improvements incident to the development of the business park.in return,the city agreed not to apply rules or regulations to border if they conflicted with laws in effect on the date of the agreement.the city also agreed not to hold border responsible for revisions in certain types of fees or development standards,except under specified conditions to finance the development,the city provided border with funds from municipal bonds,requiring border to repay the bonds through periodic assessments over years.
in,sandag revisited the idea of locating an airport in otay mesa,which was still largely undeveloped.to preserve the status quo during the continued study,the city issued a moratorium on certain types of development in otay mesa.the moratorium exempted portions of otay mesa for which the city had already issued development permits,including the property owned by border.subsequent moratoria were limited to residential development.
in,sandag issued an updated report identifying miramar and otay mesa as potential sites for a new airport.the city decided that otay mesa was a more viable site than miramar.it also concluded that the otay mesa site would probably require the use of mexican airspace.in,the city passed a resolution stating that an international airport in otay mesa was the preferred option for a new airport.it designated it the twinport plan,referring to the creation of an international airport spanning the border,using the existing brown field in otay mesa and rodriguez field in tijuana.however,the city did not inquire of the appropriate officials in mexico to determine whether mexico had an interest in such a plan,or whether mexico would allow the use of its airspace for an airport built solely on the american side of the border.two years later,the city was forced to abandon the otay mesa airport idea,upon belatedly discovering that mexico was not interested in the plan and would not cooperate.
during the time that the city was pursuing the otay mesa airport plan,sales within border business park fell off precipitously.public announcements of the airport proposal,some of which showed possible configurations of the airport which would place runways directly through border business park,caused potential buyers to look elsewhere.there was a nationwide recession at the time,but border sales fell off more than would be expected as a result of the recession.as a result of the drop in sales,border was unable to repay its bond obligations to the city.in,the city brought a foreclosure action against parcels within the business park.border for breach of the development agreement.border was able to obtain financing and paid the delinquent assessments,although it remained obligated on outstanding penalties and other indebtedness.border and the city agreed to a payment schedule.however,border financial difficulties continued,resulting in a judgment of foreclosure on some of its properties in 
beginning in,border encountered further difficulties in selling properties within its business park as a result of the rerouting of truck traffic bound for the border crossing.in,the federal government had opened a border crossing in otay mesa.in,the government closed the border crossing at san ysidro to commercial truck traffic and routed all commercial truck traffic through the otay mesa border crossing instead.at the time,traffic was routed in such a way that it bypassed border business park.in,however,the city rerouted traffic in such a way that border business park,which was located very near the truck crossing,was inundated with truck traffic.further details are discussed below.again,sales within the park suffered.in,border filed the present lawsuit,alleging breach of the development agreement.in,border filed for bankruptcy protection,and the breach of contract action was stayed.in,the bankruptcy proceeding was dismissed,and proceedings resumed in the breach of contract suit.border amended its complaint to add the two causes of action for inverse condemnation.
the issue of inverse condemnation was tried to the court the court found that the city airport announcements,made without having first ascertained that the government of mexico would cooperate,were unreasonable and amounted to a taking.it also found that the diversion of truck traffic caused a compensable impairment of border access to its property.a jury awarded border million in damages resulting from the city airport planning activities,and million for the interference caused by the city rerouting of truck traffic.the jury also found that the city breached the development agreement and awarded border million in damages.the trial court awarded border million in prejudgment interest for the airport planning claim and million for the traffic routing claim.
the city filed a motion for judgment notwithstanding the verdict and a motion for new trial.the court denied the motion for judgment notwithstanding the verdict and granted the motion for new trial on the breach of contract claim only.the city filed a timely notice of appeal and border filed a timely notice of.
discussion 
the airport inverse condemnation claim 
border inverse condemnation claim was based on the theory that the city acted unreasonably during the period it was considering developing the airport in otay mesa,because it failed to ascertain that mexico either had an interest in developing the twinport airport,a jointly operated airport situated on both sides of the border,or would permit the use of its airspace if the city developed an international airport solely on the california side of the border.the source of border theory of inverse condemnation is klopping city of whittier cal d,klopping.
prior to klopping,it was established that particularly oppressive acts by a public authority,involving a physical invasion or a direct legal restraint on the use of the property,could amount to a de facto taking of the property even without formal condemnation.klopping,supra,cal d at.in klopping,the court held that conduct falling short of a de facto taking can also result in liability.the court held that when the condemner acts unreasonably in issuing precondemnation statements,either by excessively delaying eminent domain action or by other oppressive conduct,our constitutional concern over property rights requires that the owner be compensated.this requirement applies even though the activities which give rise to such damages may be significantly less than those which would constitute a de facto taking of the property id.at.in this case,the trial court found that the city announcements concerning the airport proposal were reckless and amounted to inverse condemnation pursuant to klopping.
on appeal,the city contends that the evidence is insufficient to support the inverse condemnation judgment as a matter of law,because,in the absence of an announced intention to condemn a property,conduct which falls short of an acquiring stage of the condemnation process does not support a klopping claim.the city also contends that the evidence does not support the necessary finding that border suffered distinct or unique injury and that the evidence does not support a finding that its conduct was unreasonable.border counters that substantial evidence supports the court finding that the city conduct was reckless,and contends that unreasonable conduct during the precondemnation period,as found by the trial court in this case,is a separate basis for liability under klopping.it contends that it was not required to prove that the city moved beyond the planning phase into the acquisition phase in order to prevail on that theory 
the city cites numerous cases which have held that an announced intention to acquire property or conduct which denotes an intent to acquire the property is essential to a klopping claim.see,people ex rel.pub.wks.peninsula enterprises,d.toso city of santa barbara d.taper city of long beach d.tilem city of los angeles d.guinnane city and county of san francisco d.we note,however,that the express language of klopping holding does not appear to require an announcement of an intent to condemn property,if liability is based on unreasonable conduct other than delay.in klopping,the court held that an action for inverse condemnation lies if the public agency acted improperly either by unreasonably delaying eminent domain action following an announcement of intent to condemn or by other unreasonable conduct prior to condemnation.klopping,supra,cal d at,italics added.in jones people ex rel.of transportation cal d,the court declined to decide whether an announcement of an intent to condemn is essential to a klopping claim because in that case a de facto taking occurred jones people ex rel.of transportation,at,and the court has not yet resolved this question.we need not decide the issue in this case,however,nor do we need to decide whether the city conduct was unreasonable or oppressive within the meaning of klopping,because border failed to adduce any evidence that the city announcements concerning the proposed otay mesa airport subjected it to direct and special injury 
in order to prevail on a claim of inverse condemnation,there must be an invasion or an appropriation of some valuable property right which the landowner possesses and the invasion or appropriation must directly and specially affect the landowner to his injury.selby realty city of san buenaventura cal d.the landowner property must be singled out for singular and unique treatment in contrast to other landowners who could be affected by the proposed public work.smith state of california d.t he widespread impact resulting from mere general planning is noncompensable.people ex rel.pub.wks.peninsula enterprises,supra,d at.if the plaintiff situation is no different than that of any other landowner in the area to be affected by the proposed plan,klopping does not apply.selby realty city of san buenaventura,supra,cal d at.
border produced no evidence that the airport proposal affected it in any unique manner.on the contrary,the undisputed by border that the city proposal concerning the airport affected owners of other business and industrial parks in otay mesa as well as border,and in the same ways.patrick kennedy,an economist retained by border to assess the economic impact of the city alleged breaches of the development agreement,including the proposal to build the airport in otay mesa,testified that the sandag report,issued in may,which described the proposal for the otay mesa airport,affected property values not just in border business park but in other developments as well which were within the airport footprint.there were to acres of industrial property within the footprint which would be affected.border owned only acres.based on real estate appraisal reports prepared for different properties in otay mesa during that period,kennedy opined that the sandag report placed a cloud over the entire area.
in its opening statement,border emphasized that the proposal showed a runway running right across its property.the sandag report did show that under at least one proposed configuration of the airport,some of the runways ran directly through border business park.however,it showed runways running through other properties as well.kennedy testified that the sandag report had a substantial impact on anybody who thinking about buying in border or other parks that are underneath the runways.italics added.thus,border was not subjected to any unique injury because of the proposed configuration of the runways.
border contends that because neither party requested a statement of decision,we are limited to reviewing the judgment to determine whether there is substantial evidence to support the judgment on any theory,including its original claim,as alleged in the second amended complaint,that the city entire course of conduct with respect to the breaches of the development agreement constituted inverse condemnation.under that theory,border contends,there is substantial evidence that it suffered special and unique damages.border contends that in the absence of a statement of decision,we can not rely on the trial court oral pronouncement of its ruling on the issue of liability to determine the legal theory on which the court based its decision.
our review of the record persuades us that border did not actually rely at trial on the theory of inverse condemnation as alleged in the second amended complaint.rather,in its closing argument to the trial court on the issue of liability,border asserted the klopping theory with respect to the airport announcement and the impairment of access theory with respect to the traffic diversion.it did not assert its overarching theory that the city effected a taking by means of the series of breaches of the development agreement.
however,even if we assume,for the sake of argument,that border did rely on the theory as alleged in the second amended complaint,we disagree that the absence of a statement of decision affects our review on appeal.the general rule is that in the absence of a statement of decision in a court trial,the reviewing court must conclude that the trial court made all findings necessary to support the judgment under any theory which was before the court.in re marriage of ditto d.gray gray cal.however,this rule is merely a corollary of the general rule that a judgment is presumed to be correct and must be upheld in the absence of an affirmative showing of error.this presumption applies only on a silent record.wilson sunshine meat liquor cal d,denham superior court cal d.in contrast,when the record clearly demonstrates what the trial court did,we will not presume it did something different.lafayette morehouse,chronicle publishing th,d.thus,even in the absence of a statement of decision,we are not compelled to resort to a presumption if the record adequately demonstrates the legal theory the court applied.for example,in in re marriage of powers d,the court held that because the reporter transcript adequately set forth the basis for the trial court ruling,the absence of a statement of decision was not fatal to the appeal.the court noted that in in re marriage of ditto,not only was there no statement of decision,the judgment did not explain the law the court applied or its reasoning,and there was no reporter transcript.in re marriage of ditto,supra,d at,fn.similarly,in in re marriage of seaman menjou th,d,the court held that the absence of a statement of decision was not fatal to the appeal because the judgment itself set forth the legal basis for the trial court award of attorney fees.id.at,fn,d.
here,the reporter transcript shows that the court stated that it found the city liable for inverse condemnation based upon the city unreasonable conduct in announcing the airport proposal without having first determined whether the mexican government would cooperate and upon the impairment of access resulting from the traffic diversion.the court then instructed the jury to determine border damages,if any,based solely on those two theories.the court statements plus the jury instructions foreclose any possibility that the court finding of liability for inverse condemnation was based on any other legal theory.moreover,the jury verdict awarding damages on the airport cause of action was unquestionably based solely on the klopping theory it was not instructed on any other theory.we can not uphold the damage award on an alternative theory which was not submitted to the jury.mclaughlin national union fire ins.th,d.
because there was no evidence that the airport proposal directly and specially affected border,as opposed to the entire section of otay mesa within the proposed airport site,the airport inverse condemnation claim fails as a matter of law.
the truck traffic inverse condemnation claim 
an action for inverse condemnation can be based on substantial impairment of the right of ingress and egress,also known as the easement of access.breidert southern pac.cal d.in its second cause of action for inverse condemnation,border alleged that the city substantially impaired access to border business park by diverting truck traffic in such a way that the traffic backed up on the streets adjacent to the business park,making ingress and egress to its property difficult or impossible and severely and substantially affect ing the marketability of the business park to prospective tenants.
background 
the issue arose as follows.prior to the,the sole point of entry between the united states and mexico in california was the border crossing at san ysidro.in about,the federal government opened a second border crossing in otay mesa.in the,san ysidro was closed to commercial truck traffic,and otay mesa became the sole border crossing for trucks.at that time,the main route to the border crossing was otay mesa road,a street,which turned into state highway a few miles north of the border.otay mesa road is the main thoroughfare in the area,and to avoid having long lines of traffic backed up along otay mesa road as well as the commingling of truck and automobile traffic,the city decided to reroute truck traffic.
choosing among the available alternatives,all of which presented problems,the city elected,as an interim solution,to route truck traffic from otay mesa road south onto la media,then east on siempre viva.it extended drucker road north to intersect with siempre viva and built a road to the border crossing.city traffic engineers anticipated that if the traffic backed up along drucker road and onto siempre viva,it would affect only the property on the south side of siempre viva,which was at that time largely undeveloped.border business park is on the north side of siempre viva la media is immediately west of the park 
when the city first decided to reroute the truck traffic,la media was insufficiently developed to accommodate it.during the first six to nine months after the city routed truck traffic away from the otay mesa route,it diverted the traffic through border business park while it improved la media.even after la media opened to truck traffic,some truck drivers continued to drive through the business park.others continued to approach the border crossing from otay mesa via the westbound lanes of siempre viva,turning left onto drucker road.however,in doing so,they cut into the queue of traffic which was lined up in eastbound lanes of siempre viva after having followed the designated route.confrontations between truck drivers who had waited in line and those who had jumped the line ensued,including fistfights.the city installed concrete barriers called which prevented trucks from turning left onto drucker road from the westbound side of siempre viva.the city erected signs to direct the errant trucks back to la media via the public roads which ran through border business park.the alleviated the congestion at the intersection of siempre viva and drucker road,and also eliminated most of the backup in the westbound lane of siempre viva.
traffic often backed up in the eastbound lanes of siempre viva to la media,and sometimes up la media as well.there was usually no traffic backup in the morning,but there was a backup every afternoon.it would sometimes begin as early as,but usually it would begin between and or.however,the backup usually abated after,when the border crossing closed.
the truck traffic caused noise and diesel fumes which affected the park.there was also some physical damage to the park.the congestion on the surrounding streets made it difficult for business owners and employees to enter and exit the park.sales of property in the park suffered as a result of the congestion.
the traffic problem was resolved after the trial,when,sometime in,the city completed a permanent truck route to the border which had far less effect on traffic around the business park.thus,border sought damages for the period from january,the date the trial court found to be the effective date of the rerouting of truck traffic,through the trial in december.
standard of review 
we must first determine the applicable standard of review.border takes the position that substantial impairment of access is solely a question of fact,and that we must uphold the trial court finding of substantial impairment because there was testimony that the impact of the truck traffic was both substantial and unnecessary and that at times there was total gridlock on the streets surrounding the business park.the city contends that we can determine as a matter of law that there was no compensable impairment of access.it argues that inverse condemnation may not be based on diminished convenience in the use of abutting streets,but only on proof of a substantial impairment of access beyond a change in traffic flow or increased circuity of travel.however,it contends,the evidence shows that there was a means of access to the park at all times and that the traffic backup merely required the use of more circuitous routes at times to enter or leave the property.
the standard of review of this issue is in dispute among the courts.the california supreme court has held both that whether there is a substantial impairment of the right of access is a question of fact rose state of california cal d,and that it is a question of law breidert southern pac,supra,cal d at.it has not resolved the apparent discrepancy.in san diego metropolitan transit development bd.price th,d,division one of this court concluded that because the determination whether substantial impairment exists is primarily factual,the proper standard of review is substantial evidence.it concluded that the characterization of the issue of substantial impairment as one of law in some of the cases means only that the compensability issue is a court issue and not a jury issue the jury issue is limited to the amount of damages.id.at,d accord,perrin los angeles county transportation com.th,d.however,in a case decided very shortly before san diego metropolitan transit development bd.price,supra,the second district court of appeal held that the initial question whether there has been a substantial impairment of access is in truth a mixed question of law and fact,decided predominately as a question of law.brumer los angeles county metropolitan transportation authority th,d brumer.
we agree with the brumer court.a mixed question of law and fact that is predominantly one of law is one which requires a critical consideration,in a factual context,of legal principles and their underlying values rather than merely experience with human affairs.citation.aguilar atlantic richfield cal th,d.as we discuss below,the right of access is limited by legal principles,and the threshold there has been an impairment of that primarily a legal one,in that it requires consideration of legal principles in the mix of fact and law.ghirardo antonioli cal th,d.the more inquiry,whether any impairment which has occurred is sufficiently substantial to be actionable brumer,supra,th at,d,arises only if there has been a legally cognizable impairment of the right of access.see breidert southern pac,supra,cal d at,lack of access to the next intersecting street is a factor in finding impairment of the general right of access.the issue is thus a mixed question in which legal considerations predominate,at least at the threshold.
in reviewing a mixed question of law and fact,we defer to the express or implied factual findings of the trial court and determine the applicable legal principles de novo.the standard which applies to the third step of the analysis,applying the law to the facts,depends upon whether factual or legal issues predominate.where,as in this case,the issue is predominately one of law,we review it de novo.ghirardo antonioli,supra,cal th at,d.
the evidence is insufficient as a matter of law to support the inverse condemnation claim 
as noted above,the easement of access consists of the right to get into the street upon which the landowner property abuts and from there,in a reasonable manner,to the general system of public streets.breidert southern pac,supra,cal d at.the city correctly points out that street alterations which cause significantly increased traffic or which reduce but do not eliminate access to a property do not give rise to a compensable taking.people ayon cal d,friends of h street city of sacramento th,d.here,however,border does not allege that there was merely an increase of traffic which caused some inconvenience or which reduced access to its property.rather,border contends that there was total gridlock,both around the property and within it,which rendered ingress and egress virtually nonexistent.
although we have found no cases with a similar factual situation,we will assume,for the sake of discussion,that a rerouting of traffic which caused gridlock for a period of several hours every day would constitute a substantial impairment of the right of access.however,gridlock denotes more than heavy or traffic.rather,it denotes traffic congestion on a grid of intersecting streets which prevents traffic from moving in any direction.webster new collegiate dict.here,there is no evidence which supports border contention that there was gridlock which prevented all access to the business park.
first,there is no evidence that the truck traffic often comes to a complete stop in both directions on siempre viva,as border claims.the exhibits it refers to show traffic backed up on siempre viva and la media only,and in only one direction on either street border claims that richard schaaf,a city traffic officer,testified that traffic was often blocked in both directions on siempre viva.this is not true.rather,officer schaaf testified that the backup normally affected only the eastbound lanes.occasionally,he said,a truck attempting to make an illegal turn would block all three lanes of siempre viva.when that happened,though,he would direct the truck out of the lane,make it go to a safe area,issue a citation,and send it eastbound.thus,any blockage would be transitory and would not result in gridlock.
rene romero,the second witness border cites,did not say that traffic often comes to a complete stop in both directions on siempre viva.romero testified that when the trucks are backed up,it is impossible to drive through in the eastbound lane.he testified that driving in the opposite direction is hazardous because the truck drivers get impatient and some will enter the lane for oncoming,the westbound try to pass other trucks in the queue.thus,he did not say that it was impossible to drive westbound on siempre viva because of gridlock,but rather that it was hazardous to do so because of trucks driving eastbound in the westbound lane.
there is also no evidence that traffic ever encircled the business park,as border claims.the park is bounded on the north by airway road,on the east by harvest road,on the south by the westbound lane of siempre viva and on the west by the northbound lane of la media.there is no testimony that traffic backed up on all of these streets.
nor is there evidence that there was ever gridlock on any of the streets surrounding the park,except,for a short period of time,at siempre viva and drucker road.before the city installed the,traffic attempting to turn onto drucker road from both directions on siempre viva apparently caused periods of true gridlock at that intersection.however,the business park has entrance and exit roads intersecting with city streets on all four sides of the park.there is no evidence of gridlock on any of the streets except siempre viva,and on siempre viva,the only point of gridlock was the intersection with drucker road.gridlock at a single intersection does not amount to total gridlock on all the streets surrounding the business park.
there is also no evidence to support border claim that there was solid gridlock within the park every day and that drivers would jump the curbs inside the park or otherwise proceed onto the private property of park tenants or make their own dirt roads in the park to avoid the queue on the paved streets.officer schaaf testified that trucks used the business park to make,as well as using other dirt lots in the vicinity.however,he did not identify those lots as being within the park,as border implies.there was property west of la media and south of siempre viva,not owned by border,which consisted of dirt lots.the officer also testified that he had occasionally investigated damage to private property within the park allegedly caused by trucks,but he did not describe the nature of the damage he saw,nor did he say that any such damage was ever determined to have been caused by trucks.and,he did not testify either directly or by implication that trucks made their own dirt roads within the park,as border claims,nor did he testify that he observed gridlock within the park.harry otis,a business owner with property in the park,did not testify that truck drivers drove off the paved roads to avoid gridlock,as border asserts.rather,he testified that on some occasions he used tactics to get off the roads and would go around to gain access to his property.
border cites no other evidence that truck traffic created gridlock within the park or resembled a serpentine waiting line at a disneyland ride.even de la fuente did not describe anything approaching gridlock.rather,he said that during the time la media was being improved,there was a daily line of trucks which snaked through the park.he made it clear,moreover,that the most serious problems with truck traffic within the park persisted only for a period of six to nine months while the city improved la media to accommodate truck traffic.border sought damages for six years of impaired january,the date the court found to be the effective date of the traffic rerouting,through the trial in december.
taken as a whole,and even when viewed in the light most favorable to border,the evidence fails to establish that the truck traffic ever completely prevented ingress or egress.the question thus becomes whether the evidence supports the conclusion reached by the trial court,that the traffic problems amounted to a substantial impairment of the right of access.we conclude that as a matter of law,the evidence does not support a finding of compensable interference with the right of access.
the right of access is not unlimited.not every interference with the property owner access to the street upon which his property abuts and not every impairment of access,as such,to the general system of public streets constitutes a taking which entitles him to compensation.breidert southern pac,supra,cal d at.as long as there is access to the abutting road and from there to the next intersecting street in at least one direction,there is no legally cognizable impairment of access.people ayon,supra,cal d at.
the maps border relies upon show that there was access by a number of routes from the business park six roads to the general system of streets.there is a network of roads within the park which provide access from most of the parcels to all of the roads.there is an exit which intersects the northbound lane of la media,as well as two exits which lead to airway road,which also intersects the northbound lane of la media.la media intersects otay mesa road to the north of the park.otay mesa road apparently intersects interstate,and is apparently the main thoroughfare in the area.there was no evidence that the traffic backup affected the northbound lanes of la media.the only evidence that traffic backed up in the southbound lane of la media as far north as airway road,limiting access via the la media entrance,is the testimony of harry otis,who owned property within the business park.otis testified that sometimes,rather than using the la media entrance to the park,he would instead have to come down highway to airway road and enter the park via airway road.however,he did not indicate that there was ever a time when he was unable to gain access via airway road thus,the evidence fails to show that there was ever a time when there was no access by means of at least one entrance to the park.at most,the traffic backups required tenants of the park to use an entrance which was less convenient interference with access which merely requires greater circuity of travel is not compensable.people russell cal d.
there are a few parcels within the business park which have no access to the streets within the park,such as several which front on siempre viva.their means of ingress and egress is apparently limited to driveways which lead directly into the westbound lane of siempre viva.border attempted to show that those properties completely lacked a means of ingress and egress because of the traffic problems on siempre viva.this was refuted by officer schaaf,who rejected the suggestion made by border attorney that the traffic backup on siempre viva covers the entrances and exits to the business park.the maps relied on by both parties make it clear that even when the traffic was backed up in the eastbound lanes of siempre viva,the properties in question would have access to the westbound lane.a driver leaving those properties could travel west to la media and thence north to otay mesa road.even during the relatively short period when there was gridlock at siempre viva and drucker road,before the city installed the,the gridlock would not have affected egress from those properties which lie to the west of drucker road ingress to those properties could be achieved,even when there was gridlock to the west of drucker road,by traveling through the business park from the north and exiting into the westbound lane of siempre viva either at drucker road or via the exit road to the west of drucker road.the properties along siempre viva which lie to the east of drucker road have access to other routes for both ingress and egress,either by driving through the park to airway road or by using harvest road.thus,even though access might have been circuitous and perhaps slow because of the volume of traffic,there was nevertheless a reasonable means of ingress and egress at all times.
border asserts that courts have imposed liability where,as here,there is unnecessary and substantial traffic diversion,but cites no cases which have actually held that a city can be liable for rerouting of traffic which results in less than a complete denial of access.border cites only heimann city of los angeles cal d,however,there was no allegation in that case that any damages resulted from traffic diversion.rather,the issue in that case was an alleged loss of use of property during the construction of a viaduct,resulting from the piling of earth,rock and other material in the streets and the erection of sawmills,sheds and other structures,the accumulation of waste materials on and near the plaintiffs premises and the partial obstruction and closing of streets.id.at.in contrast,the courts have held that exercise of a city power to regulate traffic is not actionable under a theory of impairment of access the property owner has no constitutional right to compensation simply because the streets upon which his property abuts are improved so as to affect the traffic flow on such streets.if loss of business or of value of the property results,that is noncompensable.it is simply a risk the property owner assumes when he lives in modern society under modern traffic conditions.people ayon,supra,cal d at.if some reasonable means of access remains,even if it is impeded by heavy traffic,there has been no compensable impairment of the right of access.friends of h street city of sacramento,supra,th at,d people ex rel.of public works wasserman d.
we next address border claim that the judgment can be affirmed on the alternate theory,which it asserted at trial,that the noise,dust and fumes generated by the idling trucks was not far removed from a direct physical intrusion or that it amounted to a nuisance this argument fails because the case was not submitted to the jury on that theory.rather,the trial court instructed the jury that it had determined that the diversion of truck traffic amounted to a partial or temporary taking of the property,and that border right of access to the property had been impaired as a result of the city actions in routing traffic to the border crossing.it instructed the jury to determine extent,if any,to which border property had been decreased in value by reason of the impairment of access.that was the sole basis upon which the court instructed the jury with respect to damages resulting from the diversion of traffic it did not instruct the jury on the nuisance theory.we can not uphold a judgment on the basis of a legal theory which was not submitted to the jury.mclaughlin national union fire ins,supra,th at,d.
because the evidence does not support the judgment of inverse condemnation based on the traffic diversion as a matter of law,we will reverse the judgment on that cause of action as well.
the city motion for new trial was properly granted 
introduction 
in its,border asserts that the trial court erred in granting the city motion for a new trial on border breach of contract claim.border contends that the court erroneously concluded that the doctrine of res judicata barred recovery for any breach which occurred before june,because the court was operating under the mistaken belief that there was a final judgment in a prior lawsuit between the parties.in the prior action,the court sustained without leave to amend the city demurrer to border,in which it asserted the same breach of contract claims it asserted in this case.however,no judgment of dismissal was filed.border asserts that the order sustaining the demurrer is not a final judgment and has no res judicata effect.therefore,border contends that we should reverse the order granting the city a new trial on the breach of contract claim.
the parties devote considerable argument to whether the court applied res judicata,as it stated in its ruling,or in reality applied collateral estoppel.the distinction between the two doctrines is significant because res judicata requires a final judgment,while an adjudication which is not a final judgment may,under some circumstances,be given preclusive effect under the doctrine of collateral estoppel.it is undisputed that there was no judgment entered in the prior lawsuit border contends that the distinction is significant as well because collateral estoppel applies only to issues which were actually litigated,while res judicata applies to matters which were raised as well as to matters which could have been raised.it points out that the trial court expressly stated that it was not applying collateral estoppel but res judicata,because the effect of its ruling was to preclude relitigation of some issues which were not actually litigated in the demurrer in the prior action.it argues that the court determination of the new trial motion can not be sustained because there is unquestionably no final judgment which satisfies the requirements of res judicata.
we need not determine whether the court correctly described the doctrine it applied to determine that relitigation of the specified issues was precluded,nor whether it applied the doctrine correctly.as border correctly posits,the order granting the new trial is subject to our independent review under that standard,we decide a legal issue without regard to the trial court analysis.ghirardo antonioli,supra,cal th at,d.we review the court ruling,not its reasoning,and we will uphold its ruling if it is correct on any theory of law applicable to the case.people zapien cal th,d.
background 
the issue arose as follows.in,the city filed an action against border to foreclose on assessment district liens.city of san diego de la fuente business park,super.san diego county.the parties refer to this case as de la fuente ii.border filed a alleging breach of the development agreement.the city obtained an order severing the from the foreclosure action.in february,the city obtained a judgment in the foreclosure action.it then filed a demurrer to the on grounds that the failed to allege compliance with the claim presentation requirements of government code section et,which the city contended was a prerequisite to the.border opposed the demurrer,but after a hearing the demurrer was granted without leave to amend based on noncompliance with government code section et.in may,the court issued a minute order stating its ruling,but no judgment of dismissal was filed.
on june,border presented a government code claim to the city,asserting breach of the development agreement.the city denied the claim,and on september,border filed the instant action,again alleging breach of the development agreement.
the city filed a motion in limine to exclude evidence of and damages for alleged breaches which occurred more than one year before june,the date border filed its government code claim,arguing that any such breaches were it also argued that because the issue was decided adversely to border in the prior case,border was estopped from denying that the government claims act applied.the city erroneously asserted that the order sustaining the demurrer had been reduced to a final judgment on the merits.
the trial court denied the motion in limine,and the breach of contract cause of action was submitted to the jury based on evidence of breaches of the development agreement which occurred both before and after june.the jury found the city liable for breach of the agreement and awarded border million in damages.the verdict did not apportion the damages with respect to any particular alleged breach or breaches.
the city filed a motion for judgment notwithstanding the verdict and a motion for new trial.the trial court rejected the city argument that the entire breach of contract claim was barred by application of res judicata.however,it held that the ruling on the demurrer in the prior action conclusively established that border had not filed a government code claim up to the time it filed its in that action.it also held that border assertions that a government code claim was not required or that compliance with the claim requirement was waived or excused under any theory were conclusively adjudicated adversely to border in the prior proceeding because border could have raised those contentions in its opposition to the demurrer,but did not do so.as a result,the court held that the prior ruling established that any breach which occurred more than one year before border filed its government code,any breach which occurred before june.the court granted a new trial on both liability and damages,excluding breaches which occurred before june.
direct or collateral estoppel precludes relitigation of issues which were finally adjudicated in a prior proceeding between the same parties 
res judicata prohibits the relitigation of claims and issues which have already been adjudicated in an earlier proceeding.the doctrine has two components.in its primary aspect the doctrine of res judicata or claim preclusion operates as a bar to the maintenance of a second suit between the same parties on the same cause of action.the secondary aspect is collateral estoppel or issue preclusion,which does not bar a second action but precludes a party to an action from relitigating in a second proceeding matters litigated and determined in a prior proceeding.citations.kelly vons companies,th,d.
when issue preclusion arises from successive suits on different claims,it is referred to as collateral estoppel.if,as in this case,the second action is on the same claim,issue preclusion based on the earlier determination is described as direct estoppel.sabek,engelhard th,d rest d judgments,com.c,rest d judgments,com.b.both collateral and direct estoppel have the dual purpose of protecting litigants from the burden of relitigating an identical issue with the same party or his privy and of promoting judicial economy by preventing needless litigation.citation.sabek,engelhard,at,d.
here,the trial court precluded only relitigation of specified issues it did not bar relitigation of border breach of contract claim in its entirety,but limited the scope of the claim to damages which accrued after a certain date.the question we address,therefore,is whether the prior lawsuit precludes relitigation of those issues.if it does,we must uphold the order granting the new trial 
the order sustaining the demurrer in the prior action is a final judgment for purposes of issue preclusion 
it is undisputed that no judgment was entered in the prior lawsuit,and border contends that the order sustaining the demurrer is insufficient to constitute a final judgment.however,for purposes of issue preclusion,as opposed to res judicata,final judgment includes any prior adjudication of an issue in another action that is determined to be sufficiently firm to be accorded conclusive effect.rest d judgments,italics added see sabek,engelhard,supra,th at,d sandoval superior court d.
the city cites two cases in which an order,rather than a judgment,was found sufficiently final for purposes of issue preclusion in rymer hagler d,the court held that a determination of coverage by a workers compensation appeals board judge was sufficiently final to preclude relitigation of the same issue in a civil proceeding based on the same industrial injury which was the subject of the workers compensation claim.the court reasoned that the order was a final order within the meaning of labor code section,subdivision a,and that deeming it a final judgment for purposes of issue preclusion served the policy underlying the doctrine of issue preclusion,protecting parties from endless litigation.rymer hagler,at.similarly,in security people,medeco security locks,d,the fede
