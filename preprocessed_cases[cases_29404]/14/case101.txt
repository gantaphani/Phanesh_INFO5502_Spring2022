sarah bunge and thomas friedberg the owners wanted to build a home in the virgin islands.they approached michael milne,an architect who at the time was and director of the virgin islands architectural firm village vernacular.while still a village employee,milne began work on the project.the owners executed a letter of intent and paid a deposit to hire village on june.milne prepared a series of sketches and preliminary drawings for the project,and the owners paid another to village on october.all the drawings and all of milne correspondence throughout bore village imprint.in april,milne submitted conceptual drawings for the project to the virgin islands department of planning and natural resources,the local permitting body these drawings were also marked with village legend.
village was,however,in the process of getting out of the active practice of architecture,so milne needed someplace else to ply his trade.at some point in or record contains no evidence of the exact formed a second corporation,barefoot architect,where he continued his architecture practice and served as owner and president.bunge and friedberg wanted to continue working with milne,and on august,they entered into a standard american institute of architects aia contract to engage barefoot architectural services.the agreement calls for a contract price of covering basic services,a category defined in the contract article.the contract also defines additional services,which were to be billed at per hour over and above the basic services price.
by june,the owners had paid more than the entire basic services price,but had yet to receive full construction drawings.barefoot nevertheless demanded that it be paid a further for contingent additional services,which it claims to have rendered on account of major changes to the project initiated by the owners.neither side was happy with this state of affairs angry correspondence ensued.the owners refused to pay for the contingent additional services,and on december,milne sent them a letter on barefoot letterhead stating that his firm was suspending its architectural services pursuant to subparagraph of the contract.the owners reacted by hiring tracy roberts of springline architects,llc to replace barefoot and to finish the project.
barefoot filed suit on july,alleging that bunge,friedberg,roberts,and springline had violated its copyright in the home design.the complaint also asserted claims for violation of the lanham act and breach of contract.in addition to an answer,the defendants filed five counterclaims breach of contract,fraud,breach of fiduciary duty,violation of the lanham act,and tortious interference with contractual relations.barefoot moved to dismiss the counterclaims,and on june,the district court granted the motion as to the fraud,lanham act,and tortious interference claims,leaving the contract and fiduciary duty counterclaims intact.
on september,the court decision on the motion to and village executed a memorandum of transfer,which purported to memorialize an october,oral transfer of the copyright to the project design from village to barefoot.milne signed this memorandum on behalf of both firms as village and director,and as barefoot president glenn speer,as village president,also signed on his firm behalf.
the defendants then moved for summary judgment,which the district court granted with respect to the copyright act and lanham act claims.the court proceeded to decline supplemental jurisdiction over barefoot claim,dismissing it without prejudice.shortly thereafter,the district court sua sponte dismissed the remaining counts of the counterclaim for breach of contract and of fiduciary duty,which were also claims over which it declined to exercise supplemental jurisdiction.

the doctrine of erie tompkins,applies to cases decided by the federal courts over what would be claims if the virgin islands were a state.edwards hovensa,llc,cir.thus we apply the rule of decision that the virgin islands supreme court would apply in adjudicating issues of territorial law.the virgin islands code provides that t he rules of the common law,as expressed in the restatements of the law approved by the american law institute,and to the extent not so expressed,as generally understood and applied in the united states,shall be the rules of decision in the courts of the virgin islands in cases to which they apply,in the absence of local laws to the contrary.
the district court granted summary judgment and dismissed barefoot copyright claim on the ground that barefoot did not own the copyright to the architectural plans at the time those rights were allegedly infringed,and that it thus lacks standing to assert a copyright infringement action.the court reasoned as follows.when milne originally created the copyrighted work,he was an employee of village.under the doctrine,village is presumed to own the copyrights to works created by its employees during the course of their employment.see b.plaintiff concedes this much to be true,but argues that village effectuated a transfer of the copyright in question to barefoot in,such that barefoot was the rightful owner at the time that the alleged infringement began.the district court disagreed,concluding that there was no evidence to support such a transfer,and that barefoot therefore had not raised a genuine question of fact as to whether it owned the copyright at the relevant point in time.
ownership of a copyright is freely transferrable by any means of conveyance or by operation of law.d.however,a transfer other than one by operation of law is not valid unless an instrument of conveyance,or a note or memorandum of the transfer,is in writing and signed by the owner of the rights conveyed or such owner duly authorized agent.a.no such writing existed in this case until the memorandum of transfer dated september,nine years after the alleged assignment took place october,and more than four years after this lawsuit was filed.so the first question we must address is whether such a memorialization can successfully validate a oral copyright transfer.
this being an issue of statutory interpretation,we begin with the text.section a frequently referred to as the copyright act statute of frauds specifically contemplates a note or memorandum of the transfer,as distinct from an instrument of conveyance,as a permissible means of satisfying the act writing requirement.the note or memorandum does not itself constitute the transfer rather,the writing renders valid and enforceable in court a change in ownership that has already taken place.see melville nimmer david nimmer,nimmer on copyright a nn.ed.under the statute plain terms it is clear that an oral transfer can be given legal effect by a subsequent signed writing.
of course,even under this construction it is possible for a writing to be simply too far removed in time from the event it purports to memorialize,so that there can be no validation of the past event.the ninth circuit so held in konigsberg int l rice,cir,a case involving novelist anne rice alleged oral agreement to sketch out a romantic melodrama involving a love triangle between a resurrected mummy,an english heiress and queen cleopatra,and to license the story to konigsberg to serve as the basis for various derivative works.id.at.the alleged oral contract granted konigsberg a period to exploit its rights,with an option to extend.the only extant signed writing memorializing the contract,however,was a letter from rice to konigsberg lawyer,sent after litigation had commenced.the letter read,as far as i am concerned,these contracts,though never signed,were honored to the letter the licensees got exactly what they paid for.id.konigsberg sought to use this letter to prove that rice had granted a license,but the court refused to credit that theory.writing for a unanimous panel,judge kozinski argued that the writing requirement is designed to prevent an author from giv ing away his copyright inadvertently,to force a party who wants to use the copyrighted work to negotiate with the creator to determine precisely what rights are being transferred and at what price,and to provide a guidepost for the parties to resolve their disputes.id.at quoting effects,cohen,cir.these goals,according to the ninth circuit,are only served if the writing is executed more or less contemporaneously with the agreement and is a product of the parties negotiations.id.
konigsberg distinguished the copyright act statute of frauds from its cousin which can be satisfied by a letter like the one rice wrote,see restatement second of contracts cmt.b on the ground that in contract law,the statute serve s a purely evidentiary prevent enforcement through fraud or perjury of fictitious agreements.at.by contrast,a copyright assignment is,under the terms of a,simply not valid unless there is a writing.id.according to the ninth circuit,an oral contract subject to the statute may be valid but unenforceable in court,but a copyright transfer can not even take place without a writing.this reading of a compelled the court to interpret the statutory requirements strictly,so as to demand substantial contemporaneity.so construed,a was not satisfied by a letter that was written three and a half years after the alleged oral agreement,a year and a half after its alleged term would have expired and months into a contentious lawsuit.id 
we consider this analysis unconvincing.to begin,while the text of the statute as we observed above clearly allows for a subsequent writing to effectuate an earlier oral transfer,it does not specify a time period during which the writing must be consummated.indeed,it does not even impose a fuzzy standard like substantially contemporaneous.the ninth circuit decision to imply such a requirement appears to rest entirely on its assessment of the copyright statute purposes,in contradistinction to those of the statute of frauds.according to the konigsberg court,the latter serves a purely evidentiary function,while the former has the additional purpose of enhanc ing predictability and certainty of ownership.id.citations omitted.however,it is not clear that this second goal is anything more than a rewording of the purpose of ordinary statutes of frauds.just as requiring a written contract prevents enforcement of a nonexistent obligation through the exclusion of fraudulent,perjured,or misremembered evidence,requiring a writing for enforcement of a copyright assignment enhances predictability and certainty of ownership by preventing litigants from enforcing fictitious agreements through perjury or the testimony of someone with a faulty memory.see victor polk,joshua dalton,equitable defenses to the invocation of the copyright act statute of frauds provision,copyright soc y.that is,the two statutes serve essentially identical purposes,even if some courts may have phrased those purposes so as to make them sound different.
furthermore,to the extent that the ninth circuit argument hinges on a distinction between an oral copyright transfer not being valid and an oral contract simply being unenforceable,it is a bit hard to discern the practical difference.as leading commentators have observed,a contract is valid only insofar as it has legal operation and invalid insofar as it has not,joseph perillo,corbin on contracts ed,meaning that a contract rendered unenforceable by the statute of frauds is not actually valid in any meaningful sense.see also id.at i t should not be said that the statute of frauds does not affect the validity of the contract,because validity can not be separated from remedy.accordingly,it is perfectly reasonable to read a as allowing enforcement of oral agreements through the same sorts of,informal writings that are universally held to satisfy the statute of frauds in the contract setting.
other courts,including a differently constituted panel of the ninth circuit in a case,have reached that have done so in circumstances more closely analogous to our own than those presented in konigsberg.in magnuson video yesteryear,cir,a divided panel of the ninth circuit held sufficient a writing dated more than fourteen years after the oral transfer.the plaintiff,magnuson,was both ceo of the transferor corporation columbus productions,and the owner of the transferee firm john magnuson associates,but he did not memorialize the change in copyright ownership at the time it took place.the defendant in magnuson copyright infringement suit argued that the assignment was invalid and that columbus therefore still owned the rights.columbus was no longer operating and had no ability to sue.the dissent took the position that konigsberg controlled,id.at fernandez,dissenting,but the majority distinguished the case before it on the ground that the problem with the writing in that case was not so much that it was not contemporaneous with the agreement but that it was not the type of writing contemplated by section because it came far too late to provide any reference point for the parties licensing disputes.id.at majority op.quoting konigsberg,at.this made a difference in magnuson there was no need for a reference point to resolve any dispute,because no dispute existed no one involved in the putative transfer contended that it had not occurred.see id.the magnuson court found particularly compelling the reasoning of eden toys,florelee undergarment,f d,cir citations omitted 
s ince the purpose of the provision is to protect copyright holders from persons mistakenly or fraudulently claiming oral licenses,the note or memorandum of the transfer need not be made at the time when the license is initiated the requirement is satisfied by the copyright owner later execution of a writing which confirms the agreement.in this case,in which the copyright holder appears to have no dispute with its licensee on this matter,it would be anomalous to invoke this provision against the licensee.
the eleventh circuit also follows the rule that an oral agreement is valid if it is later ratified in writing,see arthur rutenberg homes,drew homes,cir,and has applied it to facts quite similar to those in the case before us.in imperial residential design palms development group,cir per curiam,imperial residential design drew up a set of floor plans for regal classic homes.one of imperial principals then orally transferred to regal all of imperial rights in the design both parties believed that the plan belonged solely to regal.regal subsequently discovered a competitor,palms development group,marketing similar plans,and sued for copyright infringement.palms defended on the ground that regal did not own the copyright.after the initial lawsuit had been filed there were several iterations,regal obtained a written agreement that it claimed memorialized the original oral transfer of imperial copyright.the court decided that,at least in a case like that before it,in which the assignor and the assignee did not dispute ownership and in fact were both plaintiffs in the same infringement case,it would not demand a contemporaneous writing.id.at.in so holding,the court reasoned that the chief purpose of section a like the statute of frauds is to resolve disputes between copyright owners and transferees and to protect copyright holders from persons mistakenly or fraudulently claiming oral licenses or copyright ownership.id.because there was no dispute between the original copyright holder and the putative transferee,the court thought that it would be unusual and unwarranted to permit a infringer to invoke section a to avoid suit for copyright infringement.id.citing eden toys,at.
we agree with the reasoning of magnuson,imperial,and eden toys.at least where there is no dispute between transferor and transferee regarding the ownership of a copyright,there is little reason to demand that a validating written instrument be drafted and signed contemporaneously with the transferring event.no one in the cases just cited or in the case now before this court has giv en away his copyright inadvertently,or lost his chance to negotiate,or been left without a guidepost for resolving a dispute.see konigsberg,at.nor are concerns regarding certainty compelling none of the defendants in any of these cases thought that it owned a copyright,only to find out through litigation that its claim was invalid because of a snafu involving the written instrument.all of them knew or should have known that they were at least potentially infringing someone if they perhaps could not be precisely sure whose because none of the considerations driving konigsberg insistence on contemporaneity come into play in a case in which there is no dispute between transferor and transferee,we hold that a infringer in such a case can not evade liability by invoking a and demanding a instrument.
resolving that legal question does not,however,necessarily lead to the conclusion that barefoot prevails here and that the district court should be reversed.for a writing to validate a past transfer,the past transfer must have actually occurred.see magnuson,at observing that the district court made several factual findings that are not clearly erroneous indicating that columbus did,in fact,transfer its copyright to john magnuson associates in the seventies imperial,at both wilson and mcguffie testified that wilson then orally transferred to regal all his company rights in the regency design and that both believed that the regency plan was the sole property of regal.rutenberg,at it is uncontroverted,however,that heise and chrysalis entered into an oral agreement that heise would prepare these plans for chrysalis,and that the copyright in the verandah ii plan would be owned by chrysalis.eden toys,at holding that a later writing can validate an earlier transfer,but remanding to the district court for determination of whether paddington could orally or through conduct grant an exclusive license to eden.we agree with the district court conclusion that barefoot has failed to raise a triable issue of fact as to whether the alleged oral transfer ever occurred.
the purported transfer of village copyright interest here is in the nature of an assignment.in contract law,a n assignment of a right is a manifestation of the assignor intention to transfer it by virtue of which the assignor right to performance by the obligor is extinguished in whole or in part and the assignee acquires a right to such performance.restatement second of contracts.analogously,an assignment of a copyright is a manifestation of the assignor intention to transfer the copyright by virtue of which the assignor copy right is extinguished in whole or in part and the assignee acquires the copyright.all that is required for the completion of an assignment is that the assignor manifest an intention to transfer the right to another person the manifestation may be made to the other or to a third person on his behalf and,except as provided by statute or by contract,may be made either orally or by a writing.id.no particular formality is required,except to the extent required by statute.id.cmt.thus,anyone with authority to convey village property to could have orally assigned the copyright to barefoot by saying,through me,village hereby assigns you its copyright in the bunge project design,or other words to the same effect provided that village later backed up the oral statement with a writing.
the complication in this case is that the copyright was allegedly assigned by village,acting through milne,and assigned to barefoot,also acting through milne.barefoot nevertheless insists that the transfer of rights occurred orally,on october,as the memorandum of transfer attests.with the issue so framed,we can not conclude that the district court erred in finding no evidence of a transfer.barefoot proffers three possible sources of such evidence,but none is availing.
first,barefoot argues that the memorandum itself is the best evidence of assignment,because both milne an officer,director,and shareholder of village and speer village president,as well as a director and shareholder signed a document confirming that the assignment took place.we disagree.the idea of a memorandum validating an earlier copyright transfer depends on the original transferring event actually having transpired.in each of the cases cited above for the proposition that a later writing can confirm an earlier oral grant,there was evidence of this crucial historical fact extrinsic to the writing.none of those courts confronted a case in which it was argued that the same document both proved that an oral transfer occurred and gave legal effect to that otherwise unenforceable promise.we do not think that a note or memorandum of transfer can simultaneously serve each of these purposes.if it could,a distantly writing would be capable of rendering enforceable a possibly fictional transfer that purportedly took place years or decades earlier but for which there is no independent evidence.this would enable a perjured or misremembered writing to override actual historical events.suppose,for instance,that o gave a a written document conveying his copyright in.later,out of spite or faulty memory,o drafts a document purporting to validate a oral transfer of the same copyright to b,even though there is no evidence that this assignment actually took place.if the memorandum to b were enough to prove that the event occurred,then for practical purposes a never owned the copyright despite holding an instrument of conveyance b holds a document showing that he took ownership in and that o therefore did not have any copyright to assign in.if b document is enough on its own to prove that the oral transfer happened,a has no recourse,as there is in all likelihood no way for him to prove that such an event did not transpire.thus b would be able to sue a for infringement despite the fact that o never actually said anything to him about the copyright until after he had already given the transferring instrument to a.this is the kind of result that the writing requirement is intended to avoid.we should not construe a in a way that would permit such an outcome.if barefoot is to get past summary judgment it must present evidence,apart from the memorandum of transfer itself,that is sufficient to allow a conclusion that the october,oral assignment actually occurred.
the second proffered bit of evidence for the assignment is a pair of checks one from village to barefoot,the appears to have been scratched out,though not barefoot to village th
