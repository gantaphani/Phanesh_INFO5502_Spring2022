plaintiff,paul oravec,brought this action under the copyright act,et,against several parties associated with the trump palace and the trump royale collectively,trump buildings,twin condominiums in sunny isles beach,florida.oravec alleged that these defendants infringed his copyrighted architectural designs through the design,development,and construction of the trump buildings.the district court granted summary judgment to defendants and denied oravec motion for leave to file a third amended complaint.after thorough review of the record,we conclude that the grant of summary judgment was proper and that there was no abuse of discretion in the denial of leave to amend.accordingly,we affirm.
background 
oravec was born in czechoslovakia and was trained and licensed as an architect in that country.after immigrating to the united states in,oravec worked as a designer for architectural firms in new york,and later for a miami firm that designs and builds real estate and promotional displays.although not licensed to practice architecture in the united states,oravec has continued to pursue that interest during his spare time.
in and,oravec developed a design for a building that featured the use of alternating concave and convex segments and elevator cores protruding through the building roofline.oravec applied to register this design with the copyright office and was issued a certificate of registration on july,copyright.after making certain refinements,oravec obtained an additional copyright registration on may,copyright hoping to see his design constructed,oravec undertook efforts to market it to developers in south florida and elsewhere.between and,oravec mailed versions of his design to as many as individuals and companies and made several presentations to developers.
during the same time period,defendants michael and gil dezer initiated the process of developing the beachfront resort that would be the site of the trump buildings.michael dezer purchased a parcel of land in sunny isles beach and collaborated on its development with a company named colonial ridge development,llc colonial ridge.in the late,colonial ridge hired defendant sieger suarez architectural partnership,sieger suarez to design two buildings for the property.the original sieger suarez designs consisted of a condominium hotel and a residential condominium subsequently,the dezers acquired additional land and decided that a larger residential condominium should be constructed.sieger suarez modified its design,and the result was the design for the current trump palace.the district court found that this design was substantially complete in march of.later,after the purchase of additional property,the project was expanded to include a second residential condominium.sieger suarez designed this second building,which would become the trump royale,as essentially a mirror image of the trump palace.
on february,oravec saw a newspaper advertisement featuring a photograph of a model of the trump palace.the following day,he visited the resort sales office and viewed models and brochures depicting the trump buildings.at the time,neither building had been constructed only the foundation of the trump palace had been laid.believing that the designs resembled his own,oravec consulted with attorneys and was advised to secure copyright registrations for all of his unregistered designs in order to satisfy the jurisdictional prerequisites for an infringement action.see a n o action for infringement of the copyright in any united states work shall be instituted until preregistration or registration of the copyright claim has been made in accordance with this title.
oravec thereafter obtained two additional copyright registrations,only one of which the march copyright is relevant to this appeal.on this registration form,oravec indicated that the submitted materials were derivative of the works covered by his three prior registered copyrights,which he listed by registration number.he also provided the following statement in space,under the subheading material added to this work this material includes all previous designs and versions and depict sic them in,pages.oravec initially attempted to claim protection for these materials as architectural works,as he had done with respect to his previous designs.see a.however,after receiving his application,the copyright office informed oravec that this claim was inconsistent with his statement that the claim pertained to sculptures,artwork,and photographs.see a establishing copyright protection for pictorial,graphic,and sculptural works.the office advised oravec if you have created original sculptures,artwork,and photographs that were based on previously registered architectural work claims,but you are not now registering any new architectural work authorship and plans,then space nature of authorship must reflect the new claim as described in space emphasis omitted.the office directed oravec to amend his application by deleting the architectural work claim and checking only the boxes for sculpture,artwork,and photograph.oravec made these changes and his application.
in november,oravec filed suit under the copyright act against numerous individuals and entities associated with the trump buildings.specifically,oravec sued sieger suarez,its principals charles sieger and jose suarez,and real estate developers sunny isles luxury ventures and dezer properties llc on a theory of direct copyright infringement.in addition,oravec asserted claims of vicarious copyright infringement and contributory copyright infringement against various developer entities and their principals.
in april,the parties filed cross motions for summary judgment on a variety of issues.the district court held three summary judgment hearings in july.during the first hearing on july,the court expressed the view that oravec could not prevail on his claims pertaining to the march copyright because the construction of a building can not,as a matter of law,infringe the copyright in a pictorial,graphic,or sculptural work pgs work registered under a.in response,oravec filed a series of new copyright applications with the copyright office on july in order to register the march copyright materials as architectural works under a.the following day,oravec sought leave to file a third amended complaint based on these new registrations.at a hearing that same day,the court denied leave to amend because the registration certificates had yet to issue and because the deadline for filing amendments had passed more than a year earlier.nine days later,oravec received the requested certificates from the copyright office and moved the court to reconsider its denial of leave to amend.
on july,the court entered an order granting summary judgment to defendants on oravec infringement claims and denying oravec motion to amend the court found,inter alia,that oravec could not establish infringement of his and copyrights because no reasonable jury could find that the trump buildings are substantially similar to oravec and designs.the court found that oravec could not prevail on the basis of his march copyright for the reasons indicated at the july hearing.as to oravec motion to amend,the court reiterated its conclusion that oravec delay was unreasonable given the expiration of the deadline for filing amendments.the court further noted that trial was six weeks away and that oravec had been on notice of the challenge to his march copyright claim since april,the date the defendants filed their motion for summary judgment.oravec now challenges each of these rulings.
ii.discussion 
summary judgment standard 
we review the district court grant of summary judgment de novo,construing all evidence in the light most favorable to oravec,the party.leigh warner,cir.some courts have viewed summary judgment as inappropriate in the copyright infringement context because of the inherently subjective nature of the inquiry.see beal paramount pictures,cir citing hoehling universal city studios,cir.however,we have recognized that may be determined as a matter of law on a motion for summary judgment,either because the similarity between two works concerns only elements of the plaintiff work,or because no reasonable jury,properly instructed,could find that the two works are substantially similar.herzog castle rock entm t,cir per curiam district court opinion affirmed and annexed to eleventh circuit ruling accord beal,at.
and copyrights 
legal framework 
to establish copyright infringement,two elements must be proven ownership of a valid copyright,and copying of constituent elements of the work that are original.feist publ ns,rural.serv,d.if the plaintiff does not have direct proof of copying,the plaintiff may show copying by demonstrating that the defendants had access to the copyrighted work and that the works are substantially similar.herzog,at here,the district court found that oravec owned valid copyrights in his and designs,and that there were disputed issues of fact as to whether certain defendants had access to those designs.thus,summary judgment turned on the issue of substantial similarity.
we have defined substantial similarity as existing where an average lay observer would recognize the alleged copy as having been appropriated from the copyrighted work.original appalachian artworks,toy loft,cir internal quotation marks omitted.not all copying constitutes infringement,however,see feist,at.at,and therefore we have emphasized that the substantial similarity analysis must focus on similarity of expression,material susceptible of copyright protection.beal,at see also leigh,at stating that a copyright plaintiff must establish specifically that the allegedly infringing work is substantially similar to the plaintiff work with regard to its protected elements.thus,in an action for infringement,it must be determined both whether the similarities between the works are substantial from the point of view of the lay observer and whether those similarities involve copyrightable material.herzog,at 
in identifying the protected elements of a plaintiff work,the court must be mindful of the fundamental axiom that copyright protection does not extend to ideas but only to particular expressions of ideas.b in no case does copyright protection for an original work of authorship extend to any idea,procedure,process,system,method of operation,concept,principle,or discovery harper row publishers nation,d no author may copyright his ideas or the facts he narrates.corwin,at same.this as the be difficult to apply,as there is no bright line separating the ideas conveyed by a work from the specific expression of those ideas.as judge learned hand recognized in an influential opinion obviously,no principle can be stated as to when an imitator has gone beyond copying the idea,and has borrowed its expression.decisions must therefore inevitably be ad hoc.peter pan fabrics,martin weiner,cir.
nevertheless,in attempting to distinguish between ideas and expression,it is useful to note the policy purposes served by the distinction.see country kids n city slicks,sheen,cir.the dichotomy seeks to achieve a proper balance between competing societal interests that of encouraging the creation of original works on the one hand,and that of promoting the free flow of ideas and information on the other.see feist,at.at c opyright assures authors the right to their original expression,but encourages others to build freely upon the ideas and information conveyed by a work.accord suntrust bank,at herzog,at.therefore,in defining protectable expression,the court should neither draw the line so narrowly that authors,composers and artists will have no incentive to produce original literary,musical and artistic works,nor should the court draw it so broadly that future authors,composers and artists will find a diminished store of ideas on which to build their works.meade united states,alteration in original quoting paul goldstein,copyright principles,law,and practice,aff.
in addition to the dichotomy,certain statutory provisions specific to architectural works further define the scope of available copyright protection.the copyright act definition of architectural work excludes individual standard features from the protectible elements of the design.according to legislative history,such features include common windows,doors,and other staple building components,as reprinted in,see also,vermont timber works,cir citing legislative history.at the same time,however,the statute includes within the definition of architectural work the arrangement and composition of spaces and elements in the design.this definition reflects congress awareness that creativity in architecture frequently takes the form of a selection,coordination,or arrangement of unprotectible elements into an original,protectible whole,as reprinted in at.thus,while individual standard features and architectural elements classifiable as ideas are not themselves copyrightable,an architect original combination or arrangement of such features may be.see corwin,at a work may be protected by copyright law when its otherwise unprotectable elements are arranged in a unique way,at noting that combination of individual standard features in architectural work may be copyrightable sturdza united arab emirates,observing that artist selection,coordination,and arrangement of color may be protectible,even though color itself is not.
comparison of works 
oravec bases his infringement claims on the following elements that he contends are present in both his designs and the trump buildings alternating concave and convex sections three prominent elevator shafts that protrude above the roof of the building rounded building ends constant radius curves holes in the building a twin tower design floor plans a circular plaza a central fountain and a rooftop pool and landscape elements examining these elements individually and collectively,the district court determined that the similarities between the oravec designs and the trump buildings exist only at a conceptual level.accordingly,the court concluded that no reasonable jury,properly instructed,could find the competing works substantially similar without implicitly finding that oravec owns a copyright in an idea.for the reasons discussed below,we agree 
as the district court noted,the key distinctive features of oravec designs are their use of alternating concave and convex sections and their use of three partially exposed elevator towers extending above the buildings roof lines.while such features also are present in the trump buildings,a comparison of the works reveals numerous significant differences in the expression of these elements.as to the concept,one readily apparent difference is the fact that the alternating segments appear on both sides of oravec designs but only on one side of the trump buildings.even when viewing the trump buildings from that side,however,several other dissimilarities are evident.for example,oravec designs contain five alternating segments,while the trump buildings have only three.additionally,the segments in oravec designs extend across the entire face of the building,while those in the trump buildings appear only in the middle portion between the two outer elevator towers.in oravec designs,these segments are long and narrow,and each segment is placed on one side of the three elevator towers so as to create a void throughout the vertical center of the building.in the trump buildings,the segments appear only on the façade of the building,and there is no vertical void created.these differences are reflected in the buildings respective floor plans.oravec design measures feet long and feet wide,and the entire floor plan has a pronounced,curve to it.the trump buildings have a more rectilinear shape,measuring feet long and feet wide at their narrowest points.
the expression of the elevator towers also differs significantly.oravec elevator towers are and are located within the space created by the alternating convex and concave sections of the building.the trump buildings elevator towers are located within the solid structure of the building.in addition,in oravec designs,a viewer can see only certain sections of the elevator towers because they are partially obstructed by the alternating convex and concave sections.in the trump buildings,the viewer can see the exteriors of the outer two elevator towers through the entire length of the building only the center tower is partially obscured.the towers also differ in shape and orientation.oravec elevator towers are cylindrical,while those in the trump buildings are ovals.in oravec designs,the towers are clustered in the center of the building,and the middle tower is thicker than the two outer two.the towers in the trump buildings are spread out evenly,and all three are equal in diameter.further,the two outer towers in the trump buildings are angled inward so that the leading edge of all three towers orient toward a focal point outside the building.oravec sunny isles luxury ventures,d.given that oravec towers are cylindrical,this feature is absent in his designs.finally,the tops of the trump buildings towers are sloped so as to give the effect of smokestacks on a cruise ship.the towers in oravec designs are horizontal across the top.
the remaining elements identified by use of rounded building ends,a constant radius on individual floor plans,holes in the building,a design,units,a circular plaza,a central fountain,and a rooftop pool with landscape best characterized as either individual standard features or ideas.sturdza,at in and of themselves,domes,parapets,and arches represent ideas,not expression.we agree with the district court that the expression of these elements in the oravec designs is not substantially similar to their expression in the trump buildings.for example,in oravec designs,the twin tower concept is expressed such that it appears that one building could fit into the other the trump buildings lack this feature.the holes in the buildings also differ significantly.as noted,oravec designs contain a space from the ground through the top of the building.the trump buildings have only a small horizontal gap.as to the rounded building ends,oravec designs have full terraces,which create a visually smooth façade.the trump buildings have individual balconies,creating a more jagged appearance in the rounded ends.
with respect to the circular plazas,the district court properly found that these elements are not substantially similar because oravec plaza lacks the intricate details expressed in that of the trump buildings.the same conclusion applies to the use of a circular fountain in each design.as to the constant radius curves and floor plans,we have already noted that the floor plans in the respective designs differ dramatically.finally,oravec points to his use of a rooftop pool with landscape elements.however,the trump buildings do not have a rooftop pool,and the landscape elements in those buildings are not similar to any such features that are discernible in oravec designs.
these differences,as well as others,preclude a finding of substantial similarity.while it is true that oravec designs and the trump buildings have a number of features in common,those elements are similar only at the broadest level of generality.at the level of protected expression,the differences between the designs are so significant that no reasonable,properly instructed jury could find the works substantially similar.as the district court observed,to conclude otherwise would require a finding that oravec owns a copyright in the concept of a formula or in that of using three external elevator towers that extend above the roof of a building.such a conclusion would extend the protections of copyright law well beyond their proper scope.ale house mgmt.raleigh ale house,cir affirming grant of summary judgment on claim that defendant copied plaintiff use of an island or bar to bisect a seating area which has booths on one side and stool seating on the other,because,at this level of generality,plaintiff design is nothing more than a concept wickham knoxville int l energy exposition,cir affirming grant of summary judgment on claim that defendant infringed plaintiff architectural designs because t he idea of a tower structure certainly is not copyrightable.
for similar reasons,we also reject oravec argument that he can establish substantial similarity on the basis of his selection of design elements.in oravec view,the fact that the same combination of elements appears in both his designs and the trump buildings should have precluded summary judgment,notwithstanding the differences in the expression of those elements.however,while it is clear that an architect original selection or combination of elements can warrant copyright protection,see corwin,at,at,the selection that oravec is seeking to protect is too generalized to qualify as protected expression.the copyright claimed by oravec would encompass any building that combined a structure,three external and protruding elevator towers,and various common building features,however any of these elements might be expressed.were we to grant him such a right,we would effectively bar all other architects from incorporating these concepts into new and original designs.that result would lead to a diminished store of ideas available for future works,meade.at,and thus would be contrary to the fundamental purposes of copyright law.see feist,at.at.
accordingly,we affirm the grant of summary judgment as to oravec and copyrights.
march copyright 
t he holder of a copyright in an architectural plan has two forms of protection,one under the provision for an architectural work under a,and another under the provision for a pictorial,graphical,or sculptural work under a,at.as noted,oravec registered his march materials as pgs works rather than as architectural works.the district court held that oravec could not establish infringement of these works because,unlike an architectural work copyright,a pgs copyright does not protect against the construction of a building based on copyrighted architectural plans it only prohibits copying of the plans themselves.oravec does not challenge this legal conclusion,for which there is ample support instead,he argues that the district court erred by refusing to exercise jurisdiction over his claims under the effective registration doctrine.
the copyright act provides that no action for infringement shall be instituted until preregistration or registration of the copyright claim has been made in accordance with this title.a.this registration requirement is a jurisdictional prerequisite to an infringement action.homes,ameron homes,cir.oravec notes,however,that courts have eschewed strict application of the registration requirement in cases where a party owns both a work and a derivative work that incorporates elements of the original.in such cases,the registration of the derivative work has been deemed sufficient to permit a claim based on the underlying work,even if that work was not registered.
oravec directs our attention to several cases in which courts have exercised jurisdiction on the basis of this effective registration principle.for example,in streetwise maps,vandam,cir,the publisher of a street map of new york city brought an infringement action against a competitor.the registration certificate relied upon by the plaintiff stated that the copyrighted work was derivative of a streetwise manhattan map carrying a copyright notice date of.id.at quoting registration certificate.the later map added subway and bus notations to the original.the defendants argued the registration certificate covered only those additions,and that the action therefore could not be sustained absent a separate registration for the earlier map.the court disagreed,holding that,because the plaintiff owned the copyright in both maps,the registration certificate relating to the derivative work will suffice to permit it to maintain an action for infringement based on defendants infringement of the work.id.at.see also,murray hill publ ns,abc commc ns,cir acknowledging cases that permit infringement suits to proceed on registered derivative works even though some of the underlying foundational works were not formally registered in re indep.serv.orgs.antitrust,holding that registration of derivative service manuals and software was sufficient to allow infringement claim based on preexisting works authored by same party greenwich film prods.drg records,holding that registration for motion picture was sufficient to cover musical compositions contained therein where plaintiff owned copyrights in both nimmer nimmer,supra,b c,at w hen the same party owns the derivative or collective work plus the underlying elements incorporated therein,its registration of the former is sufficient to permit an infringement action on the underlying parts,whether they be new or preexisting.quoting xoom,imageline,cir.
oravec argues that the effective registration doctrine is applicable to the facts of this case.he contends that,because he owns the architectural works depicted in his march materials,the march copyright effectively registered those prior works.therefore,he argues,the works need not be formally registered as architectural works in order to receive protection as such.
oravec reliance on the effective registration doctrine is misplaced.as indicated,the cases applying that principle involved derivative or collective works that incorporated material from unregistered preexisting works.here,oravec march registration certificate does not identify any unregistered preexisting works.in fact,on the portion of the certificate calling for the identification of preexisting material,oravec listed only his,and,registered works.oravec obviously does not need to rely on the effective registration doctrine to assert claims based on those designs.now,however,oravec appears to be arguing that the relevant preexisting works are the models registered by the march copyright itself.according to oravec,these works are preexisting because the photographs and computer renderings that were registered at the same time depict the models,and thus are derivative works.that interpretation,however,is not apparent from the registration certificate,which makes no distinction between the models and the other registered materials.it merely indicates that the models,photographs,and renderings are derivative of oravec three previously registered designs.
at least one other court has found subject matter jurisdiction lacking where the registration certificate relied upon by the plaintiff did not properly identify the preexisting work upon which the infringement claim was based.in inquiry management systems,berkshire information systems,d,the plaintiff alleged that the defendant copied material from its website.the information provided on the plaintiff registration certificate indicated that the protected work was completed and first published after the copying was alleged to have occurred.the plaintiff contended that the infringed work was preexisting matter,and that therefore the registration of the latter work extended to the earlier material,which the plaintiff also owned.see id.at.
the court rejected this argument,finding that the portion of the registration certificate requiring the identification of preexisting material would have to refer to the preexisting matter that is the basis of this infringement action.id.at.in the court view,the plaintiff failure to provide such information distinguished the case from streetwise maps,where the preexisting work was identified on the registration certificate for the derivative work.id.in,by contrast,there was no indication that the plaintiff registration covered the work at issue in the suit,apart from the plaintiff current protestations to that effect.id.the court found such assertions insufficient to establish subject matter jurisdiction.id.
we find the court reasoning persuasive and applicable to the facts of this case.with the exception of his three prior registered designs,oravec march registration certificate does not identify any preexisting architectural works that the registered materials are based on or incorporate.see providing that application for copyright registration shall include,in the case of a compilation or derivative work,an identification of any preexisting work or works that it is based on or incorporates.in particular,the certificate gives no indication that oravec was attempting to claim separate protection for his models as preexisting architectural works.oravec current protestations that the models should be treated as such can not satisfy the registration requirement of a.see,d at 
moreover,even assuming that oravec created preexisting architectural works,he is attempting to sue on an aspect of those right to prevent construction of buildings embodying his is not included in the pgs work he did register.as discussed,courts recognizing the effective registration doctrine have held that the registration of a derivative work satisfies the registration requirement for all aspects of the registered work,even the aspects copied from an unregistered preexisting work,so long as the owner of both copyrights is the same.see,streetwise maps,at.but this theory only applies to aspects of the underlying work that are actually incorporated into the registered work.see nimmer nimmer,supra,b c,at the assumption is that the derivative work that is registered embodies all the features of the underlying work on which suit is premised.a plaintiff can not use an effective registration theory to sue on aspects of unregistered preexisting works that are not included in the work he did register.
but that is exactly what oravec is attempting to do here by seeking damages for the construction of the trump buildings.as noted,a pgs copyright can not be infringed by an structure.thus,even assuming oravec has unregistered preexisting architectural works copyrights in the architectural designs embodied in the march copyright,the right to prevent the construction of buildings mirroring those designs is an aspect of those preexisting architectural works copyrights that can not be and thus was not incorporated into his march pgs copyright.thus,oravec seeks to sue on an aspect of an unregistered underlying work that is not incorporated into the derivative work he did register.the effective registration doctrine can not be stretched that far.
accordingly,we hold that oravec march copyright does not entitle him to claim architectural work protection for his registered pgs works.we affirm the grant of summary judgment as to the march copyright.
motion to amend complaint 
finally,oravec argues that the district court erred in denying him leave to amend his complaint to correct the jurisdictional defect arising from the pgs copyright registration.he contends that the court should have granted his motion because there was no undue delay and because the exclusion of the march claims results in injustice.alternatively,oravec argues that amendment of the complaint was unnecessary because his registration of the materials as architectural works in july cured any jurisdictional defect.
we will only reverse a district court denial of a motion to amend in instances in which the district court has clearly abused its discretion.henson columbus bank trust,cir.oravec argument on appeal focuses primarily on establishing that leave to amend was warranted under.a.however,because oravec filed his motion after the scheduling order deadline for such motions,he must show good cause why leave to amend the complaint should be granted.smith sch.bd.of orange county,cir per curiam,petition for cert.filed,see also.b producers video,cir finding no abuse of discretion in district court denial of leave to amend on grounds of undue delay where movant failed to show good cause for delay sosa airprint,cir per curiam if we considered only rule a without regard to rule b,we would render scheduling orders meaningless and effectively would read rule b and its good cause requirement out of the federal rules of civil procedure.
