the law company,law,a general contractor,sought a declaratory judgment that one of its subcontractors,mohawk construction and supply company,mohawk,is barred from collecting delay damages under the parties subcontract.mohawk counterclaimed for breach of contract.on summary judgment,the district court refused to consider two affidavits and numerous documents submitted by mohawk and declined to address several of mohawk legal arguments.after excluding these submissions,the district court granted summary judgment in favor of law.
for the reasons that follow,we conclude that the district court erred by refusing to consider discovery documents produced by law in its initial disclosures that were printed on law letterhead.the court also erred by categorically refusing to consider other exhibits.we leave for the district court to determine on remand which documents should be excluded under a approach.
we further conclude that the district court committed an error of law when it discounted two affidavits submitted by mohawk without first analyzing their admissibility under the sham affidavit rule.lastly,we hold that the district court erred in relying on the pretrial order to exclude legal theories relevant to the central issue in the the subcontract barred mohawk from obtaining delay damages.
because the district court has not yet determined what evidence is properly submitted and has not yet considered all relevant arguments,we can not determine at this stage whether a disputed issue of material fact exists.exercising jurisdiction under,we reverse the grant of summary judgment and remand to the district court for further proceedings consistent with this opinion.
law served as the general contractor for construction of a cessna aircraft company citation service center in wichita,kansas the project,and in that capacity subcontracted with mohawk for installation of metal wall panels.mohawk was originally scheduled to begin its work on october,and to complete its portion of the project on february.as a result of disruptions beyond its control,mohawk could not complete work on the project until november.mohawk claims that it spent more than a year on a job,in part because of law failure to properly coordinate other subcontractors on the project.
on october,mohawk notified law that the project was well behind schedule and mohawk could not begin most of its work as anticipated.mohawk noted that a ny delays will require additional compensation.according to the affidavit of mark cybulski,mohawk project manager,law did not respond to this letter or address mohawk assertion that delays would have to be compensated.yet,law was not completely silent.cybulski testified that doug kimple,the project manager for law,told him that mohawk would definitely be paid for additional costs and expenses.law representatives informed cybulski that another subcontractor,steel service corporation,would be held accountable for all costs incurred by mohawk as a result of project delays.law acknowledged to mohawk that we initiated the idea of expediting your work and offered and will compensate for premium costs of this i agree the sic will be some additional costs and we will be fair about this.
on november,as mohawk portion of the project neared completion,mohawk notified law by letter that it sought a revised total of in damages caused by delay.law did not invoke the contractual provisions purporting to bar delay damages in response.law did not mention these provisions until the current litigation commenced.
in the united states district court for the district of kansas,law sought a declaration that mohawk was not entitled to delay damages.this claim rests on several clauses in the parties subcontract,which on their face appear to bar mohawk from recovering such damages.the subcontract provides 
subcontractor specifically acknowledges that extension of time shall be subcontractor sole remedy for delay unless the same shall have been caused by owner or contractor intentional interference with the subcontract work,and then only after subcontractor has provided timely notice to contractor and owner has approved such request for extension.
a separate clause states subcontractor agrees to make no claims against contractor or owner should the schedule not be strictly adhered to,it being understood that contractor will endeavor to expedite completion of the project as rapidly as possible.yet another clause provides that subcontractor recognizes that revisions will be made to the schedule and agrees to comply with such revisions without additional compensation.mohawk answer to law complaint raises several affirmative defenses,including waiver,and mohawk counterclaimed for breach of contract.also included in the answer is a list of damages mohawk incurred,including additional equipment and overhead costs.
after the close of discovery,law moved for summary judgment on both its declaratory judgment claim and mohawk counterclaim.relying primarily on the provisions of the parties subcontract,law also argued that mohawk could not recover because the claimed damages were actually incurred by one of mohawk subcontractors,viking erectors corporation viking to support the latter contention,law cites to the deposition of dominick desalvo,a damages expert designated by mohawk,to the effect that in reality,most of the damages are associated with viking.desalvo nevertheless acknowledged that overhead and profit were properly attributed to mohawk.
attached to mohawk summary judgment response are numerous documents mohawk obtained through disclosures and discovery,including deposition testimony and affidavits from cybulski and kowcheck.mohawk contends the no damages for delay provisions are unenforceable under kansas law and had been waived by law.mohawk also argues the extensive delay at issue fell outside the scope of the provisions.law replies that the cybulski and kowcheck affidavits partially contradicted prior deposition testimony and thus should be disregarded and that mohawk documentary submissions should be stricken because they were not authenticated.before the district court ruled,mohawk moved to file a surreply brief and affidavit from one of its attorneys indicating that all of the correspondence attached to mohawk opposition was provided by law in its rule initial disclosures.the request was denied.
in its memorandum opinion and order,the district court found that no damages for delay provisions are generally enforceable.it refused to consider mohawk argument that the delay at issue falls outside the scope of the provisions because the only defenses identified in the pretrial order were waiver and estoppel.seemingly conflating waiver and modification,the district court determined that the contractual provisions precluding oral modification barred mohawk waiver and estoppel defenses.the court further concluded that modification was invalid without consideration and there was no genuine issue of material fact regarding modification.finally,the district court found that most of mohawk alleged damages had accrued to viking rather than mohawk.based on these rulings,the court granted summary judgment to law.
in reaching its conclusions,the district court refused to consider many of the documents submitted by mohawk because the documents were not supported by an authenticating affidavit.these documents had been provided to mohawk by law under rule,and many of them were written on law letterhead.further,the district court refused to consider the cybulski and kowcheck affidavits because they advance d factual positions different from those reflected in their depositions.law mohawk const.supply,d.it neither explained how the affidavits differed from the earlier depositions,nor did it find that the affidavits created sham issues of fact.several months later,by stipulation of the parties,the district court dismissed mohawk remaining counterclaim with prejudice and entered final judgment.mohawk appeals.
we review a district court grant of summary judgment de novo,viewing the evidence in the light most favorable to the nonmoving party.howard waide,cir.summary judgment is appropriate when the pleadings,the discovery and disclosure materials on file,and any affidavits show that there is no genuine issue as to any material fact and that the movant is entitled to judgment as a matter of law.c 
at the outset,the parties dispute whether the district court erred by refusing to consider certain attachments to mohawk summary judgment opposition.mohawk asks us to conclude that the district court impermissibly excluded the cybulski and kowcheck affidavits.mohawk also contends that the district court impermissibly excluded documents produced by law as part of its rule disclosures we are further asked to consider whether the district court erroneously ignored several of mohawk arguments as falling outside the scope of the pretrial order.
a n affidavit may not be disregarded solely because it conflicts with the affiant prior sworn statements.in assessing a conflict under these circumstances,however,courts will disregard a contrary affidavit when they conclude that it constitutes an attempt to create a sham fact issue.franks nimmo,cir citation omitted.we have described cases in which an affidavit raises but a sham issue as unusual.id.in determining whether an affidavit creates a sham fact issue,we consider whether the affiant was during his earlier testimony the affiant had access to the pertinent evidence at the time of his earlier testimony or whether the affidavit was based on newly discovered evidence and the earlier testimony reflects confusion which the affidavit attempts to explain.ralston smith nephew richards,cir quotation omitted.
we review the district court decision to exclude affidavits at the summary judgment stage for abuse of discretion.mitchael intracorp,cir.a district court abuses its discretion when it commits an error of law.wyandotte nation sebelius,cir.
we explicitly require that a district court first determine whether the conflicting affidavit is simply an attempt to create a sham fact issue before excluding it from summary judgment consideration.durtsche am.colloid,cir quoting franks,at.unlike our prior cases in which we affirmed a district court exclusion of affidavits for inconsistency with prior testimony,see lantec,novell,cir ralston,at mitchael,at sports racing,sports car club of,cir rios bigler,cir,the district court excluded the subject affidavits without having first considered whether they raised a sham issue.it did not so much as identify how the affidavits conflicted with prior deposition testimony.law itself fails to identify any such contradiction exclusion on this basis was an error of law constituting an abuse of discretion.see wyandotte nation,at.because the district court has not made factual findings on this issue,we decline to address it.we will allow the district court to make such findings on remand.
with respect to the documentary evidence summarily rejected by the district court,i t is well settled in this circuit that we can consider only admissible evidence in reviewing an order granting summary judgment.while the party opposing summary judgment need not produce evidence in a form that would be admissible at trial,the content or substance of the evidence must be admissible.city of.city,cir quotation and ellipsis omitted.we review a district court refusal to consider evidence at the summary judgment stage for abuse of discretion.sports racing,at.
we do not require an affidavit to authenticate every document submitted for consideration at summary judgment.anderson cramlet,cir.rather,documents produced during discovery that are on the letterhead of the opposing,producing party are authentic per se for purposes of federal rule of evidence.chavez thomas betts,cir,overruled on other grounds as recognized in metzler fed.home loan bank of topeka,cir denison swaco geolograph,cir.accordingly,the district court abused its discretion when it refused to consider numerous letters,facsimiles,and memoranda attached to mohawk opposition that were printed on law letterhead and produced by law.
mohawk also submitted numerous documents that were not printed on law letterhead.these exhibits are not automatically authenticated under our denison rule.see denison,at charles alan wright victor james gold,federal practice and procedure evidence,at.as to these documents,rule c and the federal rules of evidence control by the text of rule,affidavits are merely one form of submission that can demonstrate a genuine issue of material fact.c the judgment sought should be rendered if the pleadings,the discovery and disclosure materials on file,and any affidavits show that there is no genuine issue as to any material fact and that the movant is entitled to judgment as a matter of law.emphasis added.because evidence must be admissible to be considered on summary judgment,the proper inquiry here is under federal rule of evidence the requirement of authentication or identification as a condition precedent to admissibility is satisfied by evidence sufficient to support a finding that the matter in question is what its proponent claims.a.
rather than considering each document to determine whether it was authenticated,the district court summarily disregarded these exhibits because no authentication by any witness wa s offered.law,d at.because no authenticating affidavit is required,anderson,at,the district court committed an error of law by categorically discarding these exhibits and therefore abused its discretion,see wyandotte nation,at.
mohawk submitted exhibits might be sufficiently authenticated taking into consideration the a ppearance,contents,substance,internal patterns,or other distinctive characteristics,taken in conjunction with circumstances,b,even if they do not appear on law letterhead.on remand,the district court should consider authentication of each document individually.
in its summary judgment ruling,the district court refused to consider three alternative arguments advanced by mohawk.mohawk asserted that even if the no damages for delay provisions were valid and had not been waived or modified,the provisions did not apply to the conduct at issue because such an extreme delay was not contemplated by the parties the delay was unreasonable and law alleged actions constituted a fundamental breach.the district court concluded that these arguments were not encompassed within the final pretrial order and thus did not consider them.
we review a district court interpretation of a pretrial order for abuse of discretion.perry winspur,cir.pretrial orders are to be liberally construed to cover any of the legal or factual theories that might be embraced by their language.we have cautioned that a pretrial order is a procedural tool to facilitate the trial of a lawsuit on its merits and not to defeat it on a technicality.trujillo uniroyal,cir quotations omitted.the primary purpose of pretrial orders is to avoid surprise.see wilson muckala,cir.
here,the final pretrial order listed the following under legal issues does the subcontract language prevent mohawk from making any delay claims against law or any other types of claims based on adjustment to the work schedule we conclude the district court abused its discretion by refusing to consider mohawk alternative arguments when ruling on the summary judgment motion because these arguments fall within the scope of the pretrial order.
law moved for summary judgment advancing the argument that the no damages for delay provisions in the parties subcontract barred any recovery by mohawk.there is no doubt that the validity of this argument was encompassed within the pretrial order it was the central issue in the case.in opposing summary judgment,mohawk was entitled to challenge whether the no damages for delay provisions applied to bar its claim for damages.this was not a case in which mohawk unfairly attempted to surprise law with new factual allegations at trial or to inject a new claim or defense at the eleventh hour.both parties and the court were fully aware that application of the no damages for delay provisions would be the subject of summary judgment briefing,and each of mohawk alternative arguments addressed that issue on remand,the district court should address mohawk three alt
