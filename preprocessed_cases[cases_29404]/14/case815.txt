in this subdivision map act map act,et case,appellant city of santa cruz city challenges the superior court issuance of a writ of mandate directing the city to allow a private open space credit against the park fees exacted from respondent branciforte heights,llc branciforte,a limited liability company,the developer of the branciforte heights subdivision.section,which is also known as the quimby act,subd.g and is part of the map act,generally authorizes local governments to require,by ordinance,park land dedication or fees as a condition to the approval of a tentative or parcel map,subd.a.section contains a provision creating eligibility for a credit for the value of private open space within the development which is usable for active recreational uses,subd.e.
the central substantive question in this case is whether subdivision e of section imposed a duty on the city to provide a private open space credit against the park and recreation fees assessed against branciforte.the city maintains that it retains discretion under subdivision e of section to decide whether to include a private open space credit in its park fee ordinance and the city may eschew private open space credits in favor of a policy and ordinance intended to advance public parkland development.the city additionally claims that the open space amenity was provided in consideration for the project pud permit,which authorized a development plan not permitted under conventional zoning and,therefore,the provision of open space was not an aspect of subdivision permit approval against which such a credit could be applied.the city also asserts that respondent petition was procedurally barred.
as we will discuss below,the city procedural claims are not established by the appellate record.as to the substantive merits,we hold that subdivision e of section does not create the direct right to receive a private open space credit that is enforceable by a traditional writ of mandate under code of civil procedure section.consequently,the trial court erred in issuing a writ compelling the city to allow a credit for private open space in the absence of a local ordinance providing for such a credit.
procedural history 
on june,branciforte filed a petition for writ of mandamus and administrative mandamus and a complaint for declaratory relief.in its prayer for relief,branciforte sought,among other things,a writ directing the city and the city director of the planning department director to issue a credit in an amount equal to the value of the land held as open space useable for recreational purposes and the improvements made,which allegedly totaled at least.
by order filed on april,the superior court issued a writ of mandate compelling the city of santa cruz to allow a credit against the park fees for the value,at the time the fee was imposed,of that portion of the private open space in the development that is suitable for active recreational use.a formal judgment with the identical language was filed on may.the city and its director appealed.
administrative record 
the owners of property located at north branciforte avenue applied for a conceptual planned development permit to demolish four existing units and construct,dwellings.by resolution adopted on september,following a public hearing to consider the permit,the santa cruz city council made certain findings and approved a conceptual planned development permit subject to attached conditions of approval and to a reduction of the subdivision to nine units to accommodate guest parking and a higher level of amenity of common open space.one condition of approval required the tentative map and design permit application to be submitted within six months.another condition specified in part the property lines for the tentative map shall be reconfigured to provide a common area in the front yards adjacent to the street.the common area shall be landscaped and maintained by the homeowners association.
the owners of the property located at north branciforte avenue applied for a tentative tract map,design permit,and demolition authorization to demolish the four existing units and construct nine,dwellings.by resolution adopted on october,following a public hearing,the city council approved permit requesting approval of a tentative map,a design permit and demolition authorization subject to numerous conditions of approval.condition included the final map of the subdivision shall be submitted showing compliance with all the provisions of title of the santa cruz municipal code,or with approved exceptions thereto.condition stated the specified common area shall be designated as a public utility easement.
by resolution adopted on july,the city council approved the final map for tract,the branciforte heights subdivision,and authorized and directed the city manager to execute the branciforte heights subdivision agreement with branciforte.the following day,the city and branciforte entered a subdivision agreement regarding the performance of the work and agreeing,among other things,that branciforte heights would pay all fees and taxes required by law.
in a letter dated september,to the city chief building official,william thurlow on behalf of branciforte asserted as per of the santa cruz municipal code,the branciforte heights subdivision is dedicating usable open space for the purpose of providing park and recreational facilities to serve the subdivision.in doing so,the subdivision is not required to pay park and recreation in lieu fees.
section of title of the santa cruz municipal code requires a subdivider to dedicate land pay fees as a condition of approval title contains no provision for a private open space credit.
in a letter dated december,to the city planning department director,thurlow thanked the director and his staff for considering his request for a private open space credit and acknowledged that the request had been denied based on planning staff reading of the park dedication ordinance of the santa cruz municipal code.thurlow asserted in his letter that the branciforte heights subdivision as a planned development is eligible to receive a park dedication fee credit for the square foot common area provided on parcel 
branciforte began to obtain building permits for various lots and pay the assessed park and recreation fees.on december,a park and recreation fee was imposed and paid in connection with issuance of a building permit for camille lane.on january,a park and recreation fee was imposed and paid in connection with issuance of a building permit for camille lane and a park and recreation fee was imposed and paid in connection with issuance of a building permit for camille lane.on january,a park and recreation fee was imposed and paid in connection with issuance of a building permit for camille lane and a park and recreation fee was imposed and paid in connection with issuance of a building permit for camille lane.
in a letter to thurlow dated january,director eugene arner responded to branciforte demand for a private open space credit.director arner stated that open space amenity was related to the approval of branciforte planned development,which permitted deviations from standard zoning.he explained that branciforte had provided square feet of common open space,within the development as well as a common landscape area along branciforte avenue in exchange for certain variations and increased density.he noted that only six or possibly seven lots would otherwise have been allowed under standard requirements rather than the nine lots authorized in the planned development process.he concluded that the open space should not be credited towards the required park land dedication fees because otherwise,the planned development designation would basically be illusory as a means of obtaining a waiver of strict zoning criteria.director arner also stated that private open space credit would have been reflected in the conditions of approval if such credit had been contemplated.
in a letter to director arner dated february,a law firm representing branciforte asserted that the city had erred in refusing to give an open space credit and the city was required to provide such credit.director arner stated in his responding letter,dated march,that it was the city position that state law does not mandate park fee credit he explained the approval of a planned development is based on a higher level of amenity than would be required under a typical subdivision.the use of open space within the branciforte heights planned development is one of the amenities that allowed the project to be approved.in exchange for the higher level of amenity,the applicant received a higher density than what could have been approved under the lot standards.he also provided a legal memorandum from the city attorney.
the law firm representing branciforte then corresponded directly with the city attorney in a letter dated april.the letter informed the city that branciforte intends to file suit if the city maintains its position on this private open space credit issue.
on april,a park and recreation fee was imposed and paid in connection with issuance of a building permit for camille lane and a park and recreation fee was imposed and paid in connection with issuance of a building permit for camille lane.the total park and recreation fee paid by branciforte to obtain issuance of building permits was.
branciforte thereafter commenced legal action.
procedural issues 
the city claims that the writ petition was procedurally barred on a number of grounds expiration of the statute of limitations,failure to comply with the claim presentation requirement of california tort claims act,and failure to exhaust administrative remedies.
statute of limitations 
the city asserts that this action can not be maintained under section of the map act and the corresponding statute of limitation prescribed by the city subdivision ordinance.section states in pertinent part any action or proceeding to attack,review,set aside,void or annul the decision of an advisory agency,appeal board or legislative body concerning a subdivision,or of any of the proceedings,acts or determinations taken,done or made prior to such decision,or to determine the reasonableness,legality or validity of any condition attached thereto,shall not be maintained by any person unless such action or proceeding is commenced and service of summons effected within days after the date of such decision.thereafter all persons are barred from any such action or proceeding or any defense of invalidity or unreasonableness of such decision or of such proceedings,acts or determinations.santa cruz municipal code,title,section contains substantially the same language any action or proceeding to attach sic,review,set aside,void or annul the decision of the zoning administrator,zoning board or city council concerning a subdivision,or of any proceedings,acts or determinations taken,done or made prior to such decision,or to determine the reasonableness,legality or validity of any condition attached thereto,shall not be maintained by any person unless the action or proceeding is commenced and service of summons effected within ninety days after the date of the decision.thereafter all persons are barred from any such action or proceeding or any defense of invalidity or unreasonableness of the decision or of the proceedings,acts or determinations.
branciforte counters that section,a provision of the mitigation fee act see,governs the time for commencing this action rather than section or the corresponding municipal ordinance.it invokes the rule of statutory construction.it is a settled rule of statutory construction that a special statute dealing expressly with a particular subject controls and takes priority over a general statute.see,brill county of los angeles cal d,lacy richmond unified sch.dist.cal d.the city maintains that the mitigation fee act does not apply.
section,subdivision a,authorizes any party to protest the imposition of any fees,dedications,reservations,or other exactions imposed on a development project,as defined in section,by a local agency development project means any project undertaken for the purpose of development.development project includes a project involving the issuance of a permit for construction or reconstruction,but not a permit to operate,subd.a.
a party protesting a fee is required to serve a written notice on the governing body of the entity that contains a statement that the required payment is tendered or will be tendered when due under protest and a statement of facts and legal theory supporting its protest,subd.a,italics added.section makes the protest procedures provided by section available to a ny party on whom a fee,tax,assessment,dedication,reservation,or other exaction has been imposed,the payment or performance of which is required to obtain governmental approval of a development,as defined by section,or development project.
a protest filed under section,subdivision a,must be filed at the time of approval or conditional approval of the development or within days after the date of the imposition of the fees,dedications,reservations,or other exactions to be imposed on a development project,subd.d.section requires each local agency to provide to the project applicant a notice in writing at the time of the approval of the project or at the time of the imposition of the fees,dedications,reservations,or other exactions,a statement of the amount of the fees or a description of the dedications,reservations,or other exactions,and notification that the approval period in which the applicant may protest has begun.ibid.the imposition of fees,dedications,reservations,or other exactions occurs,for the purposes of this section,when they are imposed or levied on a specific development,subd.h.
any party who files a protest pursuant to subdivision a may file an action to attack,review,set aside,void,or annul the imposition of the fees,dedications,reservations,or other exactions imposed on a development project by a local agency within days after the delivery of the notice,subd.d,italics added.thus,the limitations period under section does not commence running until written notice of the protest period has been delivered to a party complying with the protest provisions 
section,subdivision e,states the legislature finds and declares that oversight of local agency fees is a matter of statewide interest and concern.it is,therefore,the intent of the legislature that this chapter which includes section shall supersede all conflicting local laws and shall apply in charter cities.
the question before us is whether the statute of limitations provided by the subdivision map act or the mitigation fee act applies to this mandate action.the statute of limitations applicable to a writ of mandamus under code of civil procedure section depends upon the nature of the obligation sought to be enforced.green obledo cal d,fn,ragan city of hawthorne d.it is often difficult to decide which statute of limitations governs an action for writ of mandate.the code provisions authorizing this action are silent as to the time within which it must be filed.see code,et accordingly,the courts have developed the rule that the question is to be resolved not by the remedy prayed for but by the nature of the underlying right or obligation that the action seeks to enforce.allen humboldt county board of supervisors d.green obledo cal d,fn.
this approach is not particularly helpful here since the underlying right claimed by branciforte was the right to a credit against the park and recreation fees imposed as a condition of subdivision approval.in our view,there is argument supporting application of both statutes of limitations and,therefore,an ambiguity exists.to resolve ambiguities,courts may employ a variety of extrinsic construction aids,including legislative history,and will adopt the construction that best harmonizes the statute both internally and with related statutes.pacific gas electric county of stanislaus cal th,d,hsu abbara cal th,d,summers newman cal th,d.statutes for the same subject,although in apparent conflict,are construed to be in harmony if reasonably possible.singer,sutherland statutory construction ed see people acosta cal th,d,county of san bernardino city of san bernardino cal th,d,our duty is to harmonize statutes wherever possible.
looking at the legislative history,we note that the mitigation fee act,which includes sections and,was added in as part of a bill intended to consolidate various limitations and procedural requirements applicable to the imposition by local government agencies of fees and exactions on real property and development.legis.counsel dig.assem.bill reg.sess.summary.section,as originally enacted,provided in part if a party files a protest under both section and,section shall prevail over section to the extent of any conflict between those two sections.stats,ch.
former section concerned excessive dedication requirements and was a provision of the map act added in stats,ch,see.dedication basically referred to a transfer of an interest in real property as opposed to a monetary exaction former section provided that a dedication requirement claimed to be excessive in whole or part,which is imposed as a condition of approval of a tentative map,may be reviewed by a writ of administrative mandate pursuant to section of the code of civil procedure.stats,ch.former section specified the petition for the writ shall be filed within the time prescribed by section.stats,ch.this statutory requirement was consistent with earlier case law.see timberidge enterprises,city of santa rosa d.
section was derived from former section,which was also enacted in stats,ch.the corresponding legislative counsel digest stated existing law does not contain a procedure allowing a party to protest the imposition of any fees,taxes,assessments,dedications,reservations,or other exactions on residential housing developments by local governmental entities.this bill would permit any party to protest the imposition of those exactions in accordance with a specified procedure and would permit any party who so protests to file an action to attack,review,set aside,void or annul those impositions legis.counsel dig.bill,reg.sess.summary.
former section was repealed,operative january,by its own terms.stats,ch.in ehrlich city of culver city cal th,d,the california supreme court observed that the broadly formulated and unqualified authorization of section was consistent with the view that the legislature intended to require all protests to a development fee that challenge the sufficiency of its relationship to the effects attributable to a development of the legal underpinnings of the be channeled through the administrative procedures mandated by the mitigation fee act.id.at,d.
in,section was amended to delete references to former section.stats,ch.the legislative history of the amendment of section suggests the legislature understanding was that the mitigation fee act generally governed developer protests against fees imposed upon developments.a senate analysis stated the mitigation fee act governs the imposition of local developer fees and contains the procedures for protesting and challenging unfair fees government code section.before it passed the mitigation fee act in,the legislature had already created a procedure in the subdivision map act for challenging subdivision fees.the map act procedure sunsetted on january,former government code section sunset date set by ab,costa.legal observers note that the mitigation fee act still allows a developer to protest under both its own provisions and the map act provision government code section a.to avoid confusion,they want the legislature to delete the obsolete to the former provision in the map act this bill deletes the obsolete statutory.rules,off.of floor analyses,bill reg.sess.as amended,see rules,off.of floor analyses,bill reg.sess.as amended july,rules,off.of floor analyses,reading analysis of bill reg.sess.as amended february.
based upon our review of legislative history,we conclude that where a party properly avails itself of the fee protest procedures of section to challenge allegedly excessive fees imposed upon a development project or as a condition of obtaining governmental approval of a development or development project see,the limitations period is the one established by section.contrariwise,where a party does not comply with the fee protest procedures of section to challenge quimby act ordinance fees imposed as a condition to the approval of a tentative map or parcel map see,a traditional mandate action must be brought within the time specified by section,the statute of limitations generally applicable to subdivision decisions.this construction both harmonizes potentially conflicting statutes and effectuates the legislative intent to create a unified system for protesting fees and other exactions imposed upon developments or development projects.
as to this appeal,the city makes no argument,and provides no citations to the appellate record,showing that branciforte did not comply with the protest procedures set forth in section or that the city provided a written notice in accordance with section,subdivision d,commencing the limitation period.in fact,the city states in its brief in order to obtain the building permits from the city necessary to undertake construction,branciforte subsequently paid the city the full in park fees under protest.accordingly,we are unable to conclude on the limited record before us that the limitation period provided by section either was inapplicable or had expired before this action was filed.
california tort claims act 
the city claims that the writ petition was procedurally barred because branciforte did not comply with claim presentation requirements imposed by the california tort claims act.see.respondent branciforte maintains that the california tort claims act does not apply and this action is authorized because it followed the protest procedure provided by section.branciforte further contends that,if the tort claims act required presentation of a claim,its december,letter to the city planning department director satisfied the claim requirement as did its attorney subsequent demand letters.
the tort claims act prescribes a claim presentation requirement for all claims for money or damages against local public entities and generally bars lawsuits for money or damages against such public entities unless a written claim has been timely presented and acted upon or deemed to have been rejected.but case law suggests that,even though the payment of money may be involved,an action to compel the return of a specific sum of money belonging to a party under applicable law is not a claim for money or damages.
in minsky city of los angeles cal d,which involved the demurrer to an action by an arrestee for the return of property taken by local police officers at the time of arrest and wrongfully withheld following the disposition of criminal charges,the supreme court considered whether an action to recover allegedly taken by police was a claim for money or damages within the meaning of the tort claims act.id.at.the court recognized the general rule that the act does not apply to nonpecuniary actions,such as those seeking injunctive,specific or declaratory relief.id.at.it also noted no court has intimated or held that the claims statute applies to the arrestee directly seeking mandamus in a criminal proceeding to compel the return of property wrongfully in the possession of custodial officers.id.at.
the court in minsky reasoned t he government in effect occupies the position of a bailee when it seizes from an arrestee property that is not shown to be contraband.citation.the arrestee retains his right to eventual specific recovery,whether he seeks to regain tangible property like an automobile,ring,wallet or camera,or whether he seeks to recover a specific sum of money which,under general constructive trust principles,is traceable to property within the possession of the defendant.citations.cal d at,fn.omitted.it concluded that the purposes of the claims statutes indicate that they do not apply to cases in which an owner seeks the return of private property held as bailee by the government and wrongfully retained.id.at.the supreme court held that the action did not involve a claim for money or damages within the meaning of section.id.at,fn.omitted.
subsequently,in holt kelly cal d,the supreme court held that an arrestee who seeks in good faith to specifically recover property taken from him at the time of his arrest is exempt from the claim filing provisions of the government code,even though some or all of the property may have been dissipated and respondent may be compelled to respond in damages in lieu of property.id.at,fn.omitted.the court rejected the contention that since some or all of the property is now unavailable he is responsible only by means of a proper claim for money damages and not in mandamus.id.at,fn.the court stated this position is without merit,especially in light of the fact that any property now missing is the result of respondent own misconduct.we have heretofore held that mandamus may be brought to start the chain of action designed to compel a ministerial duty by a public officer,even if the ultimate goal may be recovery of a sum of money.citations.it is also clear that mandamus will lie where the recovery of money is merely ancillary to an underlying proceeding which seeks performance of a ministerial duty.citations.ibid.
in forde cory d,an executor of a will brought a mandate action against the state controller attempting to compel payment of a lump sum death benefit from the judges retirement fund to the survivors of a deceased superior court judge.id.at.the appellate court rejected the contention that failure to file a claim barred the action this mandamus suit would compel a state officer to perform an express statutory duty it is not a money action against the state and is outside the purview of the claims statute.citation.id.at.
in county of sacramento lackner d,a writ of mandate and declaratory relief action,plaintiff counties sought to compel the state to disburse funds in the manner provided by the statutes.id.at.defendants argued,inter alia,that failure to comply with the claim procedures of the tort claims act barred the action.id.at.the appellate court rejected the argument,stating while the action has the practical effect of awarding plaintiffs money which has routinely been referred to as damages by all parties,in law it is simply an action in mandamus to compel by ministerial act the release of funds,not one for damages from the sovereign.id.at.
the lone case cited by the city to support its contention that the claim presentation requirement of the tort claims act applies in this case is madera community hospital county of madera d.in madera,a community hospital filed a petition for a writ of mandate,a writ of certiorari and declaratory relief against madera county,the board of supervisors,and the individual board members primarily to compel county to adopt standards for the medical aid and care of the indigent and poor within madera county as required by sections and of the welfare and institutions code.id.at.the appellate court concluded that the failure to file a claim does not bar hospital from seeking the writ of mandate to compel county to comply with the duty imposed on it by welfare and institutions code sections and.id.at.but the court determined that hospital failure to file a claim was fatal as to any monetary reimbursement sought by hospital in this action id.at.the court found lackner distinguishable because the hospital had failed to show any entitlement to reimbursement because of the absence of standards adopted by county which would authorize such payment.id.at.thus,madera unsurprisingly indicates that a request for reimbursement may be a claim for money where there is no official duty to pay that is specifically enforceable.
of course,an action label is not determinative and an action seeking recovery of money may be subject to the tort claims act,regardless whether it is denominated a mandamus petition.see loehr ventura county community college dist.d.in loehr,e ach of the six causes of action were aimed at recovering monetary damages for acts and omissions allegedly committed by the individual defendants during the course and scope of their employment with the community college district.id.at.the appellate court rejected the plaintiff argument that his causes of action for mandamus and injunctive relief came within the general rule that the claims statutes do not impose any requirements for nonpecuniary actions,such as those seeking injunctive,specific or declaratory relief because plaintiff demand for extraordinary relief was merely incidental or ancillary to a prayer for damages.baiza southgate recreation park dist.d.id.at.
here,branciforte sought to enforce what it asserts is an express statutory duty to provide a private open space credit.if its claim is correct,this action comes within the ambit of those actions seeking to enforce performance of an official duty to return or pay money and it is not subject to the claim presentation requirements prescribed by the tort claims act.
exhaustion of administrative remedies 
the city invokes the general doctrine of exhaustion of administrative remedies.it asserts that branciforte should have used the administrative procedure provided by sections and of title of its municipal code to seek a private open space credit.those sections allow a subdivider to request modification to the provisions of title,the city subdivision ordinance see santa cruz,tit.
section of title of the santa cruz municipal code provides upon the recommendations of the zoning board,the city council may permit modifications to the provisions of this title when one or more of the following conditions exists,or where,in their opinion,the particular provisions do not apply.such modifications,if granted,shall conform to the spirit and purpose of the map act and of this title.the land to be subdivided is unusual in size,shape,location,topography,or soil conditions.the land to be subdivided is subject to unusual title limitations of record.the land to be subdivided is to be devoted to a special use not covered herein.such modifications are necessary to ensure compliance with any applicable specific or area plans.such modifications are approved in conjunction with a planned development or a cluster development.section of title of the santa cruz municipal code states when one or more of the foregoing conditions exists,the subdivider may submit a letter to the director of planning describing in detail the requested modifications to the provisions of this title.the director shall refer the request to the department involved,for recommendations.the zoning board shall review all such recommendations,including those of the planning department,prior to acting on any modification.
exhaustion of administrative remedies refers to the requirement that administrative remedies be pursued as a jurisdictional prerequisite to seeking judicial relief from an administrative action.california correctional peace officers state personnel bd.cal th,d.in general,a party must exhaust administrative remedies before resorting to the courts.abelleira district court of appeal cal d,see california correctional peace officers state personnel bd.cal th,d,under this rule,an administrative remedy is exhausted only upon termination of all available,nonduplicative administrative review procedures.citations.the exhaustion doctrine is principally grounded on concerns favoring administrative autonomy,courts should not interfere with an agency determination until the agency has reached a final decision and judicial efficiency,overworked courts should decline to intervene in an administrative dispute unless absolutely necessary.citations.coachella valley mosquito and vector control dist.california public employment relations bd.cal th,d.
the provisions of the municipal code cited by the city simply do not provide a procedural mechanism for obtaining administrative review of director arner rejection of branciforte request for a private open space credit in order to correct alleged error.the provisions cited by the city merely allow a subdivider to seek a modification of the requirements of the subdivision ordinance under limited circumstances.the city does not identify any one of the special conditions enumerated in section of title of the santa cruz municipal code that would have qualified branciforte to request modification and,in any event,creation of an entirely new private open space credit would be much more than a minor adjustment to the city subdivision ordinance.we reject the city claim that branciforte failure to pursue relief under sections and of title of the santa cruz municipal code constitutes a failure to exhaust administrative remedies which bars judicial relief

private open space credit 
branciforte successfully argued below that the city of santa cruz was under section,subdivision e,to provide a private open space credit against the fees imposed for park and recreational purposes.branciforte did not claim below,and is not claiming now,that any condition attached to the tentative map or final map approved by the city was invalid or unreasonable.none of the conditions attached to either subdivision map expressly precluded or denied credit for private open space within the development.as indicated above,specific park and recreation fees were imposed at the time of issuance of building permits on december,january,january,and april.the parties agree that no credit was given at any point for private open space within the development.the substantive issue before us is whether the city had a statutory duty to provide a private open space credit to branciforte pursuant to subdivision e of section.

the provision of a credit for park and recreational improvements to dedicated land,which is a credit distinct from credit for private open space at issue here,is one of those criteria.see,subd.a.the full text of subdivision a of section reads if the subdivider provides park and recreational improvements to the dedicated land,the value of the improvements together with any equipment located thereon shall be a credit against the payment of fees or dedication of land required by the ordinance.italics added.
