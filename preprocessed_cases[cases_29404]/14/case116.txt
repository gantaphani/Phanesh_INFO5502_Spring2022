opinion of the court 
denise lauderbaugh wants to install her manufactured mobile home,which complies with standards established by the department of housing and urban development hud,in the residential district in the town of hopewell.the hud standards were created by the national manufactured housing construction and safety standards act nmhcssa,an act that prohibits municipalities from imposing construction and safety standards on manufactured homes that differ from the federal standards hopewell has prohibited lauderbaugh from installing her hud home on her lot because the hopewell zoning ordinance does not allow mobile homes in the district.hopewell interprets its ordinance to exclude a mobile home from the district whether or not it complies with the nmhcssa.hopewell also interprets its ordinance to permit in the district manufactured modular homes,which comply with the codes.we must determine if hopewell treatment of hud compliant mobile homes is preempted by nmhcssa.for the reasons stated below,we conclude that it is not clear whether hopewell has excluded hud homes from the district on the basis of safety and construction standards or if the exclusion is based on aesthetics and impact on property values.we will,for that reason,reverse the district court grant of summary judgment and remand this case for further proceedings.
in may of,denise lauderbaugh prepared to purchase a home.she examined manufactured mobile homes sold by larry homes of pennsylvania,and selected a manufactured home which would be placed on a permanent foundation with wheels and axles removed.the home lauderbaugh selected was a hud home,complying with the nmhcssa.lauderbaugh also looked at property in hopewell township and discussed acquiring building permits with hopewell zoning officer,john bates.bates informed lauderbaugh that the property she was considering was zoned and that mobile homes were not permitted in the district.in a december letter,bates explained that to qualify for the district,a home must be a home that is,it must meet the following building codes the boca building code,the cabo one and two family dwelling code,the boca national plumbing code,and the boca national fire prevention code.he also explained that hud homes were considered mobile homes and could not be located in the district,but only in the district.bates claims that lauderbaugh then told him that she planned to install,not a mobile home,but a compliant manufactured modular home hopewell interprets its zoning ordinance to permit compliant modular homes in the district.
the hopewell zoning ordinance allows mobile homes in the district,but not in any other residential district.the ordinance defines mobile homes in s as 
a transportable,dwelling intended for permanent occupancy,office or place of assembly contained in one unit or in two units designed to be jointed into one integral unit capable of again being separated for repeated towing which arrives at a site complete except for minor and incidental unpacking and assembly operations,and constructed so that it may be used without a permanent foundation.
after her contact with bates,lauderbaugh arranged to purchase the hud home.she contracted to buy a parcel of land in an district in hopewell and to have the site prepared with a permanent foundation and a basement.she also applied for a building permit.the permit was issued,identifying the structure to be built as a building proposed to be used as a home.hopewell claims that lauderbaugh obtained her permit by misrepresentation because she had stated that she planned to place a modular home,not a mobile home,on the property.bates contends that lauderbaugh told him she needed the permit immediately to go to closing on the land and that she would deliver the plans for the modular home when she picked up the permit.bates was not present when lauderbaugh came in for the permit,and she did not deliver plans for a modular home.lauderbaugh,on the other hand,contends that she was told by larry homes that the chief of the pennsylvania manufactured housing division had said that the hopewell ordinance did not preclude the siting of a home in either zoning district or anywhere else in hopewell township.
on june and,the two halves of lauderbaugh home were delivered to the lot.when bates saw that she was attempting to locate a hud home in the district,he verbally revoked her building permit and forbade the placing of the home on the foundations.he formally revoked her permit in a letter,dated july,stating that the permit was revoked because the home was built to the hud code rather than in compliance with.soon thereafter,lauderbaugh hired legal counsel and began to dispute the revocation of the building permit.
lauderbaugh first filed an appeal from the formal revocation of her building permit with the hopewell township zoning hearing board on july.the zoning hearing board began a hearing on august but continued it indefinitely for reasons that are not clear.the day after the hearing began and,despite the fact that the appeal was still pending before the zoning hearing board,bates sent a letter to lauderbaugh demanding that she immediately remove her home because it posed a danger to the safety of neighborhood children and it was partially located on the public right of way several days later,lauderbaugh filed an appeal from that letter with the zoning hearing board.on august,despite the pending appeals,bates sent lauderbaugh attorney another letter demanding that lauderbaugh remove her home.this letter recognized that lauderbaugh was appealing to the zoning hearing board but nevertheless threatened to institute state court litigation to remove the home and to assess any costs against lauderbaugh.on august,the chief of the pennsylvania manufactured housing division sent a letter to the president of the hopewell board of commissioners,informing him that hopewell could not preclude lauderbaugh from siting a hud home in the district.hopewell solicitor responded that hopewell position remained unchanged.
to explain the basis for the exclusion of mobile homes from districts,during the preliminary proceedings in this case,hopewell presented affidavits from ray antonelli and michael kohlman.ray antonelli acted as a consultant in drafting hopewell zoning ordinance.antonelli stated in his affidavit that the restriction of mobile homes to the zoning district was based on three factors mobile homes have a lower purchase price than other types of housing and depreciate over time,eroding the township tax base the zoning district has different lot and area requirements,reducing the density of number of mobile homes in the township and mobile homes are not always aesthetically comparable to other types of housing including modular housing.michael kohlman was chief county assessor.kohlman stated in his affidavit that mobile homes depreciate in value each year and,unlike other types of single family dwellings,have a unique ability to reduce the tax base in a municipality.
ii.procedural history 
on august,lauderbaugh and larry homes of pennsylvania,filed a complaint in the united states district court for the western district of pennsylvania.the complaint alleged that hopewell township had violated lauderbaugh fifth amendment rights,her rights to due process and equal protection of the law,the nmhcssa,and pennsylvania state law.the plaintiffs also moved before the zoning hearing board to continue indefinitely lauderbaugh appeals pending the resolution of this lawsuit.
hopewell moved to dismiss the complaint because the action was not ripe for adjudication.the district court denied that motion.after further proceedings,the district court denied plaintiffs motions for summary judgment on their procedural and substantive due process,equal protection,fifth amendment takings clause,and state law claims.the court did not grant summary judgment on the substantive due process and equal protection claims because it found that material issues of fact existed as to whether aesthetic qualities of mobile homes and their effect on property values had led to the revocation of lauderbaugh building permit.the district court then did grant summary judgment in favor of lauderbaugh and larry homes of pennsylvania,with respect to their claims under the nmhcssa,finding that lauderbaugh manufactured home was excluded from the district based solely on the fact that it was built to nmhcssa standards and not to standards.as a result,the district court ordered hopewell to allow lauderbaugh to install her mobile home on her property.hopewell appealed.
iii.jurisdiction and standard of review 
our jurisdiction over this case is in dispute.the district court exercised subject matter jurisdiction pursuant to and because the claims arose under the constitution and laws of the united states and were part of the same case or controversy.however,as discussed below,the parties dispute whether these claims were ripe for adjudication by the district court.we have jurisdiction to review a final order of the district court under.
we exercise plenary review over both the district court ripeness determination,see presbytery of new jersey florio,cir,and its summary judgment ruling,see health maintenance org.of new jersey whitman,cir.
iv.discussion 
hopewell first challenges the district court ruling on the grounds that this case was not ripe for adjudication.the district court found that the case was ripe because hopewell has treated its zoning decision as finally resolved.we agree with the district court that hopewell can not prevent lauderbaugh from installing her home,threaten state court litigation to force its removal,and,at the same time,claim there is no controversy ripe for adjudication.
lauderbaugh first contention is that we should ignore hopewell ripeness argument.she points out that hopewell notice of appeal does not refer to the orders of the district court that addressed the ripeness issue.as a result,she argues,federal rule of appellate procedure c denies us jurisdiction to consider ripeness.her argument is clearly misplaced.in acierno mitchell,cir,we rejected an identical argument.see id.at although we generally decline to address arguments for the first time on appeal,ripeness affects the justiciability of plaintiffs claims,and we will address it here.see also felmeister office of attorney ethics,cir this court has recognized that considerations of ripeness are sufficiently important that we are required to raise the issue sua sponte even though the parties do not.
we turn,therefore,to hopewell argument.it is well established that,in cases involving decisions,a property owner does not have a ripe claim until the zoning authorities have had an opportunity to arrive at a final,definitive position regarding how they will apply the regulations at issue to the particular land in question.taylor investment,upper darby township,at quoting williamson county reg l planning comm hamilton bank of johnson city,d.we have consistently applied this finality rule to bar constitutional claims by property owners or tenants who have challenged the denial of a permit by an initial but failed to take advantage of available,subsequent procedures.see,sameric philadelphia,cir finding a substantive due process claim premature when the plaintiff failed to complete the denial of a building permit acierno mitchell,at finding unripe a constitutional challenge to the denial of a building permit because the plaintiff did not appeal the denial or seek a variance taylor,at dismissing as unripe a constitutional challenge to the revocation of a use permit where the tenant did not reapply,appeal or seek a variance midnight sessions,at holding that a plaintiff claim was not ripe where it did not appeal the denial of a certificate of occupancy to the review board.
hopewell urges us to dismiss lauderbaugh claim as premature.it argues that this case is like sameric,acierno,and taylor because the zoning hearing board decision to deny lauderbaugh building permit is reviewable de novo by the zoning hearing board,which has yet to make a final decision.see sameric,at,acierno,at taylor,at.
hopewell argument ignores,however,that lauderbaugh attempted to avail herself of the appeals process.she appealed the formal revocation of her building permit to the hopewell township zoning hearing board on july.she also appealed the august letter from hopewell that demanded that she immediately remove her home because it was a safety hazard.she filed this lawsuit only after the zoning hearing board had indefinitely continued her appeals and hopewell had informed her that,despite those pending appeals,it would institute state court litigation to remove her home and assess any costs against her.
thus,this is not a case,like sameric,acierno,and taylor,where a plaintiff failure to take advantage of available,subsequent procedures foreclosed any chance that those procedures could resolve the controversy and obviate the need to address the constitutional issues.instead,hopewell decision to ignore the appeals and enforce its zoning decision by forcing lauderbaugh to pay to move her home has created a justiciable controversy.
hopewell can not treat its zoning decision as final enough to force a significant hardship upon lauderbaugh by forcing her to pay to move her home but not final enough to be ripe for adjudication.the ripeness doctrine prevents judicial interference until an administrative decision has been formalized and its effects felt in a concrete way by the challenging parties.abbott,gardner,d.the finality rule is designed to enforce this requirement,not to require the exhaustion of administrative remedies.see williamson planning comm hamilton bank,d the question whether administrative remedies must be exhausted is conceptually distinct from the question whether an administrative action must be final before it is judicially reviewable.thus,the finality rule allows a suit whenever a decision maker has arrived at a definitive position on the issue that inflicts an actual,concrete injury.id.hopewell threat to institute state court litigation to remove lauderbaugh home and tax any costs against her is clearly a definitive position that threatens a concrete injury.this case is therefore ripe for adjudication.
hopewell agues that this analysis is incorrect,claiming that it is not treating its zoning decision as finally decided.despite its threats of litigation,hopewell contends that it ordered lauderbaugh to remove her home for safety reasons,not because it considered its zoning decisions final.but,it was hopewell own stop work order that created the danger by preventing lauderbaugh from installing her home,and that stop work order was predicated on hopewell finding that lauderbaugh home could not be installed in the district.thus,although hopewell has not denied the zoning hearing board authority to oversee all zoning decisions,it is treating its own zoning decision as final enough to inflict a concrete injury on lauderbaugh.as a result,we will affirm the district court ruling that this case is ripe for adjudication.
preemption 
the substantive issue in this case is whether the district court properly held that the nmhcssa preempted hopewell zoning ordinance.the district court granted summary judgment in favor of plaintiffs because it found,as a matter of law,that hopewell used safety and construction codes that conflict with the nmhcssa to exclude from the district some manufactured homes,hud homes which comply with the nmhcssa,but not other manufactured homes which comply with.we must determine whether hopewell is excluding hud homes from its district solely because hud homes fail to meet the safety and construction standards,as opposed to the nmhcssa safety and construction standards,or because hud homes fail to meet some other,permissible,zoning criteria.
the nmhcssa was enacted to protect consumers by reducing accidents,lowering insurance costs,and improving the quality and durability of manufactured homes.see scurlock city of lynn haven,florida,cir.the nmhcssa states its purpose as the protection of quality,durability,safety,and affordability of manufactured homes by providing for performance based construction standards and construction techniques.see b.in other words,the act aim is to set standards for how manufactured h
