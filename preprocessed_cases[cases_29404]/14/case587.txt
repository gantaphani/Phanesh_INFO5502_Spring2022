factual and procedural background 
respondents were the architects for the project.as detailed in the third amended complaint their involvement included architecture,landscape architecture,and engineering civil,mechanical,structural,soils,electrical,in addition to construction administration and construction contract management.brca alleged multiple defects in the project caused by negligent architectural and engineering design,observation,and construction work performed by respondents,including water infiltration,inadequate fire separations,structural cracks and other life safety hazards.one of the defects alleged is solar heat gain,whereby the condominium units are rendered uninhabitable,unhealthy,and unsafe during certain periods due to excessively high temperatures.the solar heat gain is purportedly due to respondents approval of the substitution of less expensive,and ultimately nonfunctional,windows,as well as a design lacking adequate ventilation within the residential units.respondents are named in three causes of action the first cause of action,for civil code title violation of statutory building standards for original construction the second cause of action,for negligence per se in violation of statute and the fifth cause of action,for negligence of design professionals and contractors.
respondents demurred to the third amended complaint,arguing that,under bily arthur young cal th,d,bily and weseloh family.partnership wessel construction,th,d weseloh,they owed no duty of care to brca or its members,and consequently could not be liable.the trial court agreed.in sustaining the demurrers,the court took the view that liability could not be premised on negligent design,and that brca was required to show that the design professionals had control in the construction process,assuming a role beyond that of providing design recommendations to the owner.the court found that t he allegations do not show that respondents went beyond the typical role of the architect,which is to make recommendations to the owner.even if respondents initiated the substitutions,changes,and other elements of design that brca alleges to be the cause of serious defects,so long as the final decision rested with the owner,there is no duty by respondents to the future condominium owners,in the court view.brca prepared and submitted an order to the court on the demurrer,and the judgments issued.a timely notice of appeal was filed on january.

standard of review 
on appeal from an order dismissing an action after the sustaining of a demurrer,we independently review the pleading to determine whether the facts alleged state a cause of action under any possible legal theory.mccall pacificare of,cal th,d,aubry,supra,cal th at,d.
design liability under common law 
brca second and fifth causes of action sought to impose liability on respondents on negligence theories the threshold element of a cause of action for negligence is the existence of a duty to use due care toward an interest of another that enjoys legal protection against unintentional invasion.citations.whether this essential prerequisite to a negligence cause of action has been satisfied in a particular case is a question of law to be resolved by the court.citation.a judicial conclusion that a duty is present or absent is merely a shorthand statement rather than an aid to analysis d uty,is not sacrosanct in itself,but only an expression of the sum total of those considerations of policy which lead the law to say that the particular plaintiff is entitled to protection.citations.courts,however,have invoked the concept of duty to limit generally the otherwise potentially infinite liability which would follow from every negligent act citations.bily,supra,cal th at,d.a duty of care may arise through statute,contract,the general character of the activity,or the relationship between the parties.gregory cal d.the determination whether in a specific case the defendant will be held liable to a third person not in privity is a matter of policy and involves the balancing of various factors,among which are the extent to which the transaction was intended to affect the plaintiff,the foreseeability of harm to him,the degree of certainty that the plaintiff suffered injury,the closeness of the connection between the defendant conduct and the injury suffered,the moral blame attached to the defendant conduct,and the policy of preventing future harm.citations.biakanja irving cal d,biakanja.
in biakanja,supra,cal d,the court held that a defendant negligent performance of a contractual obligation resulting in damage to the property or economic interests of a person not in privity could support recovery if the defendant was under a duty to protect those interests.the court articulated a test for identifying such a duty.see aas superior court cal th,d,aas,superseded in other respects by statute.the court permitted recovery in biakanja by the intended beneficiary under a will prepared for the decedent by the defendant notary public,but who then failed to have it properly attested.in concluding the notary owed a duty to an intended beneficiary not to mishandle the will drafting and solemnization,the supreme court attached particular importance to the fact that the end and aim of the notary service to the testator was to provide for the passing of the estate to the plaintiff citation,and to the high impropriety of,and need to prevent,the unlicensed practice of law citation.cal th,d,cal d.
in bily,supra,cal th,d,the supreme court considered whether an accounting professional duty of care in preparing an independent audit of a client financial statements extended to persons other than the client,in the context of the client public stock offering.a jury returned a verdict in favor of the investor plaintiffs on a claim of professional negligence.the jury was instructed that a n accountant owes a further duty of care to those third parties who reasonably and foreseeably rely on an audited financial statement prepared by the accountant.a failure to fulfill any such duty is negligence.cal th,d.the court reversed the judgment,employing the checklist of factors articulated in biakanja to assess legal duty in the absence of privity of contract between a plaintiff and a defendant.cal th,d,cal th,d.the bily court again emphasized the important role of policy factors in determining negligence,observing that mere presence of a foreseeable risk of injury to third persons is not sufficient,standing alone,to impose liability for negligent conduct and that p olicy considerations may dictate a cause of action should not be sanctioned no matter how foreseeable the risk for the sound reason that the consequences of a negligent act must be limited in order to avoid an intolerable burden on society.cal th,d.additional considerations the court found pertinent in limiting the auditor liability in bily were potential imposition of liability out of proportion to fault,rais ing the spectre of vast numbers of suits and limitless financial exposure cal th,d,fn.omitted the ability of third parties in an audit negligence case to privately order the risk of inaccurate financial reporting through alternative contractual arrangements cal th,d,and the effect on auditors of third party liability,in light of the relative sophistication of third parties who lend and invest based on audit reports,whether auditors are the most efficient absorbers of the losses from inaccuracies in financial information cal th,d,fn.omitted.in limiting general negligence liability to the direct clients of the auditor,the supreme court observed that judicial endorsement of third party negligence suits against auditors limited only by the concept of forseeability raises the spectre of professional liability that is distinctly out of proportion to the fault of the auditor which is necessarily secondary and may be based on complex differences of professional opinion and the connection between the auditor conduct and the third party injury which will often be attenuated by unrelated business factors that underlie investment and credit decisions.as other courts and commentators have noted,such disproportionate liability can not fairly be justified on moral,ethical,or economic grounds.citations.id.at,d.
the trial court also relied on weseloh,supra,th,d,in sustaining the demurrers in favor of the design professionals here.in weseloh,the defendant engineers prepared the design for a retaining wall for a commercial property on behalf of a subcontractor.they were sued by the property owner and by the general contractor when the wall failed.the trial court granted motions for summary judgment on the ground the design engineers did not owe a duty of care to the property owner or to the general contractor.th,d.considering the case to be one of first impression,the fourth district court of appeal applied the biakanja and bily factors and affirmed,finding that the plaintiffs had failed to produce evidence to satisfy their burden to prove the existence of a duty or of a triable issue of material fact relevant to the duty issue.th,d.with regard to the biakanja factors,while it was foreseeable that design defects could cause a retaining wall to fail,the plaintiffs failed to produce any evidence showing defendants design was primarily intended to affect the plaintiffs the closeness of the plaintiffs injury to defendants conduct any moral blame implicated by defendants conduct or how,by imposing expanded liability on design engineers under similar circumstances,future harm would be prevented.with regard to the bily factors,the imposition of such a duty would result in liability out of proportion to fault.with regard to private ordering,the plaintiffs could have required subcontractors to name them as intended beneficiaries of their subcontracts.the plaintiffs could also have required subcontractors to name them as additional insureds in their insurance policies.id.at,d.
it is important to note that the holding in weseloh was premised on the evidentiary record before the court and plaintiffs failure to satisfy their burden in opposing the defendants motion for summary judgment.the court limited its holding to the facts before it,stating that o ur holding should not be interpreted to create a rule that a subcontractor who provides only professional services can never be liable for general negligence to a property owner or general contractor with whom no contractual privity exists.there might be a set of circumstances that would support such a duty,but it is not presented here.weseloh,supra,th at,d.we therefore find weseloh to provide limited guidance in the duty analysis here,and to be of little application to the facts before us.no california court has yet extended weseloh to categorically eliminate negligence liability of design professionals to foreseeable purchasers of residential construction as respondents seem to urge,and,as we discuss post,we believe different policy considerations are necessarily part of the calculus in this context.
in considering liability of design professionals to third party purchasers of residential construction,we do not chart unexplored territory or view this case as truly a matter of first impression.the issue,as we view it,is not whether a design professional owes a duty of care to these purchasers,but the scope of that duty.
a n architect who plans and supervises construction work,as an independent contractor,is under a duty to exercise ordinary care in the course thereof for the protection of any person who foreseeably and with reasonable certainty may be injured by his failure to do so citations.mallow tucker,sadler bennett,architects,d.see also witkin,summary of cal.law ed.torts,same miller starr,cal.real ed,scope of architect or engineer duty to third parties not in privity of contract determined by balancing several factors d architects,architect,in his or her capacity as an independent contractor,can be held liable to third persons for negligence in the preparation of plans and specifications fn.omitted damages recoverable when a third person within the area of foreseeable risk is injured or his or her property damaged as a result of the defective design.in huber,hunt nichols,moore d,the court considered it now well settled that the architect may be sued for negligence in the preparations of plans and specifications either by his client or by third persons 
our supreme court first recognized a remedy in the law of negligence for construction defects causing property damage,as opposed to personal injury,in stewart cox cal d,liability of subcontractor to owner,relying on the principles enunciated in biakanja.biakanja,supra,cal d at,see also sabella wisler cal d,builder liable for negligent construction in house offered for sale to the public.in cooper jevne d.cooper,the trial court sustained demurrers without leave to amend to negligence claims by purchasers of condominiums in a unit residential project against defendants including the architects for the project.d.as here,the plaintiffs alleged that the architects prepared and furnished to the,architectural drawings and plans and specifications for the construction and other improvements within the project and acted as supervising architects in the construction of the buildings within the project.the plaintiffs further alleged that the architects were under a duty to exercise ordinary care as architects to avoid reasonably foreseeable injury to purchasers,that they failed to perform this duty,and that the architects knew or should have foreseen with reasonable certainty that purchasers would suffer the monetary damages alleged if they failed to perform this professional duty.d.albeit without extensive analysis of the individual policy factors enunciated,the second district court of appeal found nothing in the test enunciated in biakanja that would lead us to refrain from imposing liability for economic loss to the purchasers upon the architects for the latter alleged negligence in the rendition of their professional services.d.reversing,the court held that the architects duty of reasonable care in the performance of their professional services is logically owed to those who purchased the allegedly defectively designed and built condominiums within the project.d.
eight years after bily,our supreme court in aas considered the scope of tort remedies in negligence available for alleged deviations from the applicable building codes or industry standards.aas,supra,cal th at,d.while announcing a rule precluding damage recovery for purely economic losses,the court reiterated that builders of homes had a duty independent of contractual obligations and arising from principals of tort law supporting negligence for construction defects causing property damage.cal th,d.while not separately addressing the tort liability of design professionals,the court acknowledged cooper as a case f ocusing on the conduct of persons involved in the construction process and finding a remedy in the law of negligence for construction defects that cause property damage or personal injury.id.at fn,d.although distinguishing cooper,the supreme court did not disapprove it.aas,at,d,finding that the cooper court ruling on liability for economic loss was dictum.aas did not question or repudiate the established rule that h ome buyers in california already enjoy protection under the law of negligence and strict liability for acts and omissions that cause property damage or personal injury cal th,d.
as we discuss post,the legislature abrogated the aas economic loss rule in enacting senate bill.the question then is whether the common law policy rationale articulated in cooper for imposing third party tort liability on design professionals remains valid.we believe it does.since cooper preceded bily,and did not analyze specific application of the biakanja policy factors in assessing the scope of duty owed by design professionals to third parties,we do so now.
extent to which the transaction was intended to affect the plaintiff 
in aas,the supreme court assume d for argument sake that the conduct of a person engaged in construction is intended to affect all foreseeable purchasers of the property.citations.aas,supra,cal th at,d.a design professional providing plans and specifications for residential construction can not be unaware of the fact that his or her work will have a direct bearing on the integrity,safety and habitability of property intended for residential occupancy.
in this case,respondents attempted to limit their liability by providing in the hks contract with the developer that except as set forth in this section,or as expressly agreed in writing by architect and owner,no person other than the parties or their successors and assigns shall be a beneficiary of the obligation contained in the agreement or have the right to enforce any of its provisions.it is understood that i owner reserves the right to sell portions of the project to one or more condominium associations or purchasers during or after the conclusion of the project ii architect is solely responsible to owner and not to such condominium associations or purchasers for performance or architect obligations under this agreement and iii no such condominium association or purchaser shall be a beneficiary or obligee with respect to the architect obligations under this agreement.this intended limitation,however,only serves to emphasize the fact that respondents were more than well aware that future homeowners would necessarily be affected by the work that they performed.and,in any event,liability to foreseeable residential purchasers is determined by the scope of the duty of professional care,not whether those purchasers are,or are not,third party beneficiaries under contract.while a duty of care arising from contract may perhaps be contractually limited,a duty of care imposed by law can not simply be disclaimed.
foreseeability of harm to the plaintiff 
foreseeability as to duty is based on whether an event nature might generally give rise to a foreseeable injury.laabs southern california edison th,d.brca here alleges that respondents provided architectural and a variety of engineering services,as well as providing construction administration and construction contract management.architects and engineers are subject to licensure and registration.see bus,et,et this is because the legislature has determined that it is injurious to the public interest to allow unskilled and unqualified persons to prepare plans and specifications for the erection of buildings,owing to the dangers which might arise from defects in plans or construction.binford boyd cal.the services of experts are sought because of their special skill.gagne bertran cal d.regulated design professionals such as architects and civil engineers are required to sign and affix their stamps to building plans and specifications as evidence of their responsibility for such documents.see,bus,architectural plans,civil engineering plans,calculations and specifications.professional skill is required to prepare the design documents,and failure to exercise reasonable professional care in the design of residential construction presents readily apparent risks to the health and safety of the ultimate occupants.
degree of certainty that the plaintiff suffered injury 
brca alleges that,as a consequence of defective work performed by respondents,there are structural cracks in the project,water infiltration,and life safety hazards.it also contends that design defects render the units uninhabitable,unhealthy,and unsafe during certain periods.for the purposes of analysis here,we necessarily accept those allegations as true aubry,supra,cal th at,d.
closeness of connection between defendant conduct and the injury suffered 
the pleading allegations assert that the significant defects at issue in the project resulted directly from the departure by respondents from the professional standards of care.the fact that others are alleged to have contributed to the injury should not serve to limit the responsibility of those whose training and experience uniquely qualify them to make design decisions,and whose expertise the builder presumptively relies upon in implementing those decisions 
the moral blame attached to defendant conduct 
as the court noted in aas,the degree of blame would appear to depend upon the nature of the deviation.aas,supra,cal th at,d.less moral blame would attach to defects which do not present a risk to health or safety,or to structural integrity.for example,brca third amended complaint alleges defects in specifications for certain project mechanical components and ventilation issues in nonresidential areas.but the pleadings also identify items such as cracking in concrete structural elements of the project,water penetration,and ventilation issues affecting the safety and habitability of the residential areas.unlike the circumstances in aas,where the plaintiffs failed to show that any of the alleged defects actually posed a serious risk of harm to person or property cal th,d,brca alleges here significant failures in project components specified in the design,as well as deficiencies in design,resulting in actual property damage and health safety risks.
the policy of preventing future harm 
the policy of preventing future harm weighs heavily in favor of recognizing liability.as justice traynor observed,the usual buyer of a home is with experience or financial means to discern structural defects.citation.moreover a home is not only a major investment for the usual buyer but also the only shelter he has.hence it becomes doubly important to protect him against structural defects that could prove beyond his capacity to remedy.connor great western sav.loan cal d.
like our colleagues in cooper,we find nothing in the biakanja factors that would preclude imposition of liability upon the architects to purchasers of residential construction for alleged negligence in the rendition of professional services.cooper,supra,d at.we likewise find nothing in the policy considerations later set forth in bily that would suggest a different result.those considerations are potential imposition of liability out of proportion to fault the possibility of private ordering of the risk and the effect on the defendants of third party liability.bily,supra,cal th at,d.
liability out of proportion to fault 
construction defect litigation typically involves a multitude of defendants who participated in the development and construction process.for this reason,such litigation is at least provisionally considered to be complex litigation.cal.rules of court,rule c.here,in addition to respondents,brca third amended complaint named approximately defendants,including the developers,the general contractor,and several subcontractors,all of whom were alleged to have been responsible in some manner for the defects and damages alleged.multiple for contribution and indemnity were filed,including a by the developer entity against respondents.even after the demurrers were sustained in this matter,respondents remained in the case on the.in other words,respondents comparative fault for any tort damages that brca is able to ultimately prove,and their obligation to indemnify other responsible parties for a portion of the loss or be indemnified by those parties are issues that will necessarily be litigated whether or not there is direct liability to the purchasers.see greystone homes,midtec,th,d greystone discussing application of the doctrine of comparative equitable indemnity in a construction defect case to allow loss to be apportioned between plaintiff and defendants according to their respective responsibility for the loss.moreover,unlike the unknowable universe of potential investor plaintiffs the auditors faced in bily,any liability respondents face is limited to the of the condominium units,a defined risk potential known when respondents designed the project.
there appears little likelihood that the design professionals could be held responsible for a disproportionate share of any loss to which they contributed.and unlike the engineer in weseloh,respondents here were allegedly paid over for their work on the project,not an insignificant sum and presumably reflective of the extent their work product was incorporated into the project.
private ordering 
in bily,the court distinguished the class of third party investors,creditors,and others who read and rely on audit reports and financial statements from ordinary consumers.bily,supra,cal th at,d.the court noted that,unlike the presumptively powerless consumer in product liability cases,generally more sophisticated plaintiffs have the ability to privately order the risk of inaccurate financial reporting,either through own investigation or audit,or by contractual arrangements with the client.ibid.as a matter of economic and social policy,third parties should be encouraged to rely on their own prudence,diligence,and contracting power,as well as other informational tools.this kind of promotes sound investment and credit practices and discourages the careless use of monetary resources.if,instead,third parties are simply permitted to recover from the auditor for mistakes in the client financial statements,the auditor becomes,in effect,an insurer of not only the financial statements,but of bad loans and investments in general.ibid.fn.omitted.
a purchaser of residential housing is certainly far more fairly characterized as a consumer and residential housing as a product,and numerous cases have done so in aas,the supreme court cited with approval kriegler explanation of the relevant policy considerations,the average home buyer reliance on the builder skill and implied representations of fitness,and the public interest in assigning the cost of foreseeable injuries to the developer who created the danger.citations.aas,supra,cal th at,d.
while the individuals and entities participating in the development process may have the ability to privately order allocation of liability among themselves by contract or through structuring of insurance coverage the buyer does not.thus,in contrast to bily,it is the alleged tortfeasor s,and not the home buyers who are capable of being more effective distributor s of loss.bily,supra,cal th at,d.
effect of third party liability 
the final factor seeks to establish the policy balance between,on the one hand,efficient loss spreading,and,on the other,the potential for dislocation of resources.bily,supra,cal th at,d.in bily,the court questioned the assertion that liability would deter auditor mistakes,promote more careful audits,and result in a more efficient spreading of the risk of inaccurate financial statements.ibid.the court opined that the economic result of unlimited negligence liability for auditors could just as easily be an increase in the cost and decrease in the availability of audits and audit reports with no compensating improvement in overall audit quality.citations.id.at,d.citing a legal economist,the court observed that t he deterrent effect of liability rules is the difference between the probability of incurring liability when performance meets the required standard and the probability of incurring liability when performance is below the required standard.thus,the stronger the probability that liability will be incurred when performance is adequate,the weaker is the deterrent effect of liability rules.cal th,d,quoting fischel,the regulation of accounting some economic issues brooklyn.these concerns have little application to the liability of a design professional to an ultimate purchaser.the design professionals will be liable in negligence only if they fail to meet requisite professional standards of care,and will not incur liability when performance meets the required standard.
we do not ignore the obvious fact that any rule of liability may negatively impact the cost of housing.see aas,supra,cal th at,d.liability concerns may also limit the willingness of design professionals to undertake large residential construction projects at all.see hannah van atta,cal.common interest developments law practice,pp.
but ultimately,it is not our assessment of the policy analysis that matters.in aas,the supreme court,considering the many social policy implications,concluded that a judicially created rule of tort liability for construction defects not caus ing harm of the sort traditionally compensable in tort was not justified,and that such determinations were better left to the legislature.aas,supra,cal th at,d.the legislature has since clearly expressed its view of those policy choices in enactment of senate bill.
construction defect litigation under senate bill 
brca first cause of action alleged violation of statutory construction defect standards under senate bill.in,the legislature enacted senate bill,also known as the right to repair act,to specify the rights and requirements of a homeowner to bring an action for construction defects,including applicable standards for home construction,the statute of limitations,the burden of proof,the damages recoverable,a detailed prelitigation procedure,and the obligations of the homeowner.legis.counsel,bill reg.sess.anders superior court th,d.senate bill was enacted by the legislature,in part,as a response to the holding in aas that homeowners may not recover damages in negligence from the builder of their homes for existing construction defects that had not yet caused either property damage or personal injury.greystone,supra,th at,d.senate bill abrogates the economic loss rule,legislatively superseding aas,and permits recovery of economic loss for a violation of the statutory standards without having to show that the violation caused property damage or personal injury.greystone,at,th,d.
