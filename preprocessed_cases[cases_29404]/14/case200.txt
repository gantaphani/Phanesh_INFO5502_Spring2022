in this civil action based on diversity jurisdiction,we determine whether on the specific facts of this case,the terms of a commercial general liability insurance policy entitle the appellant,the insured,to coverage for an incident relating to faulty construction.the appellee,the insurer,denied coverage for losses asserting that the incident did not constitute an occurrence as defined in the policy.the appellant,filed suit against the insurer in mississippi which was removed to the district court.the parties filed cross summary judgment motions in the district court on the issue of contract liability.the district court granted summary judgment to the appellee.for the reasons that follow we affirm.
factual and procedural background 
in may,acs contracted with the army corps of engineers to construct munitions bunkers at the pope air force base the project in north carolina.in july,acs subcontracted with chamberlin,to install a waterproofing membrane to the roofs.chamberlin merged with southern commercial waterproofing of,collectively,who accepted all responsibility for the work required under the subcontract.subsequent to the installation of the waterproofing membrane,leaks developed in the roofs of some of the bunkers.acs unsuccessfully sought for to correct the leaks.as acs was still responsible for the project,it was forced to make the repairs thereby suffering a loss in excess of.
acs had a valid commercial general liability cgl insurance policy with cgu at all relevant times.the relevant portions of the policy at issue read 
insuring agreement 
a.we will pay those sums that the insured becomes legally obligated to pay as damages because of bodily injury or property damage to which this insurance applies 
b.the insurance applies to bodily injury or property damage only if 
i.the bodily injury or property damage is caused by an occurrence that take place in the coverage territory 
in the definitions section,the policy explains that occurrence means an accident,including continuous or repeated exposure to substantially the same harmful conditions.emphasis added.according to the contract,the insurance policy does not apply to bodily injury or property damage expected or intended from the standpoint of the insured.thus,under the plain terms of the contract,property damage must be caused by an occurrence which is defined as an accident in order to trigger coverage.
consistent with the policy,acs sought from cgu the loss incurred.cgu determined that no coverage existed under the policy because no property damage caused by an occurrence took place and therefore,denied acs claim.acs filed suit in mississippi state court.cgu removed it to federal court based on diversity jurisdiction pursuant to.the parties filed cross motions for summary judgment on the issue of contract liability.the district court granted cgu motion for summary judgment finding that there was no occurrence such that acs was entitled to recovery under the policy.
standard of review 
we review the district court order granting summary judgment de novo,applying the same standards that the district court applied.provident life and accident ins.goel,cir.summary judgment is appropriate only when the pleadings,depositions,answers to interrogatories,and admissions on file,together with the affidavits,if any,show that here is no genuine issue as to any material fact.c.as we review,f irst,we consult the applicable law to ascertain the material factual issues.firemen ins.of newark,nj,cir.we look to state law for rules governing contract interpretation.id.under mississippi law,an insurance policy is a contract subject to the general rules of contract interpretation.clark state farm mut.auto.ins,so d.
the rules of contract interpretation in mississippi are well settled.under mississippi law,the object of contract interpretation is to ascertain the common intent of the parties.clark,so d at.to do so,we must construe the policy as a whole and review the language of the policy giving operative effect to every provision in order to reach a reasonable overall result.foods state farm mutual automobile ins,so d.if after we review the policy,the policy can be interpreted to have two or more reasonable meanings,then the policy is ambiguous.id.if this court finds ambiguity in the language of the insurance policy,then we must necessarily find in favor of coverage.id.moreover,a court must refrain from altering or changing a policy where terms are unambiguous,despite resulting hardship on the insured.titan indemnity estes,so d.
ii.liability coverage under the cgl insurance policy 
definition of occurrence in the insurance policy under mississippi law 
the core of this dispute is the proper test for determining whether an occurrence took place under these set of facts.it is uncontested that the leaks developed because the installation of the waterproofing membrane was faulty.the controversy stems from whether the installation of the waterproofing membrane or whether the consequential leaks constitute an occurrence under the cgl insurance policy.the cgl policy defines occurrence as an accident but does not explicitly define accident.we must therefore determine whether,under mississippi law,an accident refers to the unintended consequences of installing the waterproofing membrane or whether an accident refers to the underlying act of the installation itself.
cgu contends that the definition of accident proffered under moulton applies whereas,acs contends that the definition proffered in southern farm bureau casualty ins.allard,so d applies.the moulton test is whether the insured intended the underlying action.the allard test appears to be whether the insured intended the consequences of his actions.in fidelity guar.omnibank,the mississippi supreme court resolved the tension between allard and moulton and reaffirmed its holding in moulton.so d.for these reasons,the moulton test is dispositive of the dispute over the interpretation of an occurrence in the cgl policy.
in moulton,the mississippi supreme court held that the term accident refers to the insured action and not whatever unintended damages flowed from that act.so d at.the issue was whether allstate had a duty to defend the insured,moulton,under the insurance policy in an action for malicious prosecution.so d at.moulton filed a complaint alleging that anthony walls had stolen her dog.walls was subsequently arrested and brought to trial but the charges were dismissed.walls then filed a malicious prosecution suit against moulton.moulton expected allstate to defend her under her comprehensive dwelling policy.the language in her insurance policy provided coverage in the event of bodily injury or property damage resulting from an occurrence.under the policy,an occurrence was defined as 
an accident,including injurious exposure to conditions,which results,during the endorsement period,in bodily injury or property damage neither expected nor intended from the standpoint of the insured.
id.acknowledging that under the terms of the policy,an occurrence is defined as an accident,the mississippi supreme court defined accident.id.at.the mississippi supreme court adopted the following meaning of an accident in an insurance policy 
the only relevant consideration is whether a chain of events leading to the injuries complained of was set in motion and followed a course consciously devised and controlled by appellant without the unexpected intervention of any third person or extrinsic force.
id.quoting winkler ohio casualty ins.the mississippi court then explicitly rejected the theory that an accident refers to the unintended consequences of the act.id.at.
applying moulton to the present case,the faulty workmanship of the waterproofing membrane resulting in the leaks does not constitute an occurrence under the policy.just as moulton intended to file a complaint against wall but may not have intended to cause him embarrassment,acs intended to hire to install the membrane but did not intend for the work to be faulty or result in a leak.although neither the policy,nor the policy language in moulton were identical to the language in the policy at issue here,moulton
