the owners of an apartment complex damaged in the northridge earthquake sued design and construction companies and individuals allegedly responsible for faulty repairs to the complex after the earthquake.the trial court erred in sustaining demurrers to the owners negligence claims and to some,but not all,fraud and negligent misrepresentation claims.it also erred in striking alter ego,conspiracy and other allegations from the complaint.
factual and procedural background 
this is a construction defect case arising from allegedly improper repairs performed at a large apartment complex in granada hills after the northridge earthquake.the owners of the complex,naum and margo shekhter as trustees of the nms family trust shekhters,sued seneca structural design,kenneth bondy and chris deetz collectively,seneca defendants and klorman construction corporation,asserting causes of action for breach of contract,negligence,strict liability and fraud.as the lawsuit proceeded,other defendants were added,including william klorman,the president of klorman construction,and sunset masonry concrete,as were other causes of action.the principal question raised in this appeal is whether the shekhters complaint properly stated claims for fraud,negligent misrepresentation and negligence.
factual background.
the shekhters apartment complex consisted of three buildings and appurtenant structures.building,the largest,contained an elevated post tension deck,situated above the parking area,upon which the apartments were built.this deck was divided into halves by a pour strip.in the northridge earthquake,the entire west half of building collapsed,while the east half remained standing.in august,the shekhters entered into a contract with construction,general contractor concerning the reconstruction and repair of the property.the general contractor in turn entered into an oral and implied contract with seneca structural design.bondy and deetz,who were officers or employees of seneca,held themselves out as experts in the design and engineering of post tension systems.seneca was to provide design and engineering services for the repair and reconstruction of the shekhter property,including recommendations and plans for an appropriate repair.seneca agreed to provide a complete turn key post tension structure,and agreed the repair recommendation for the west end of building would properly integrate the east end of the building.
the shekhters and construction advised seneca that it was required to obtain liability insurance.rather than obtaining insurance,seneca entered into an agreement with klorman construction under which klorman construction would contract with construction to furnish the necessary labor and materials to repair the building,but would rely on the plans prepared by seneca.in april,construction and klorman construction entered into a written agreement that superceded the original design contract with seneca.the agreement obligated klorman construction to construct a complete turn key post tension structure and to provide seismic upgrade at the property in accordance with design plans and specifications.the seneca defendants continued to provide design and engineering services on the project on behalf of klorman construction.the repair project was substantially completed in late.problems and defects in the construction began to manifest themselves in december,and progressed,expanded and continued thereafter.the shekhters did not discover the relationship between the defects and the defendants conduct until june,and brought this lawsuit in august.
other litigation involving the shekhters is relevant to an understanding of this action.the apartment complex,as the shekhters eventually learned,contained significant defects when first built.after the earthquake,the shekhters brought a construction defect lawsuit for damages caused by the earthquake,suing reinforcing systems rps,which had installed defective steel in the deck supporting the apartments in that litigation,bondy,an officer and director of seneca who had a preexisting personal and business relationship with individuals affiliated with rps,was retained as a consulting expert for rps.at the same time,bondy undertook to design and engineer the repair and reconstruction of the property for the shekhters general contractor.the relationship between bondy and rps was known to the seneca defendants,and to klorman construction and william klorman collectively,klorman defendants,but was not known to the shekhters.
the essence of the shekhters complaint was that the seneca and klorman defendants fraudulently,negligently and in breach of contract recommended and used an inadequate redesign plan for the repair and reconstruction of the property.instead of recommending the complete demolition and reconstruction of building,seneca recommended that only the collapsed west half be rebuilt,but that the east half that remained standing be fixed by using an external post tensioned cable system.the seneca and klorman defendants knew from the outset that this plan would be inadequate,because the east half still contained the original structural steel that was grossly underdesigned they concealed this information from the shekhters in order to generate larger fees.the complaint also alleged fraud in connection with the concealment of defects in the repairs after they were performed.
to avoid duplication,further factual allegations in the complaint will be described in connection with our discussion of the legal issues,post.
procedural background.
the shekhters amended the complaint seven times over a two year period as relevant to this appeal,the shekhters asserted causes of action as follows 
breach of contract against the seneca defendants and klorman construction first cause of action 
negligence against all defendants second cause of action 
strict liability against sunset masonry third cause of action 
fraud and negligent misrepresentation against the seneca and klorman defendants in connection with the original repair scheme fourth and fifth causes of action 
fraud and negligent misrepresentation against seneca and bondy,for conduct in late and after problems with the repairs had manifested themselves sixth and seventh causes of action.
demurrers and motions to strike were filed and ruled upon with respect to various iterations of the complaint and various defendants.of note were these 
as to the second amended complaint,the trial court judge kenneth freeman overruled demurrers by seneca,bondy and klorman construction to the second cause of action for negligence,and sustained,without leave to amend,demurrers by seneca and bondy to the sixth and seventh causes of action for fraud and negligent misrepresentation with respect to the work performed in and.
as to the third amended complaint,the court judge freeman overruled demurrers by the seneca defendants and klorman construction to the fourth cause of action for fraud,and overruled demurrers by bondy,seneca and klorman construction to the fifth cause of action for negligent misrepresentation.
william klorman,who had not previously been named and served individually,demurred to the fifth amended complaint.the trial court judge ronald sohigian overruled his demurrer to the second cause of action for negligence,and sustained,with leave to amend,his demurrer to the fourth and fifth causes of action for fraud and negligent misrepresentation.
when the shekhters filed their sixth amended complaint,the seneca defendants again filed demurrers and motions to strike,in which william klorman joined.over the shekhters pointed out the trial court had earlier overruled demurrers by the seneca trial court sustained the demurrers,with leave to amend 
finally,the shekhters filed the seventh amended complaint,to which the seneca defendants demurred the klorman defendants joined in the demurrer.this time,the trial court overruled the demurrer to various causes of action for breach of contract,sustained the demurrers,without leave to amend,to the second cause of action for negligence and the fourth and fifth causes of action for fraud and negligent misrepresentation,and granted a motion to strike portions of the complaint,including all references to alter ego conspiracy allegations.in a later january,order,the court sustained,without leave to amend,the demurrers of sunset as a doe defendant in the fifth amended the causes of action for breach of contract,negligence and strict liability 
william klorman then brought a motion for judgment on the pleadings,on the ground he was not a party to the contract klorman construction allegedly breached.that motion was granted,and judgment was entered in his favor on may.on june,the shekhters dismissed without prejudice their remaining causes of action against klorman construction,the seneca defendants and sunset masonry notices of appeal were filed from the judgment in favor of klorman,and purportedly from the other orders sustaining the demurrers of sunset masonry,the seneca defendants and klorman construction.
discussion 
appealability.
the only final,appealable order or judgment is the one in favor of william klorman.after the trial court rulings on the seventh amended complaint,the shekhters voluntarily dismissed without prejudice their remaining cause of action for breach of contract against the seneca defendants and klorman construction,apparently according to a stipulation among the parties.a dismissal without prejudice does not operate to create an appealable order.don jose restaurant,truck ins.exchange th,d parties may not create appealability by stipulating to the dismissal of remaining causes of action.
the shekhters contend extraordinary circumstances justify the exercise of this court discretionary power to treat the appeal as to the seneca defendants and klorman construction as a writ,and the other parties do not object.olson cory cal d,where records and briefs include the elements necessary to a writ proceeding,appellate court has the power to treat the purported appeal as a petition for writ of mandate,but should not exercise that power except under unusual circumstances.the court discretionary power has been exercised in circumstances where a dismissal constituted a final judgment as to some parties but not as to others.california dental california dental hygienists d.to exercise the court mandatory jurisdiction over some plaintiffs appeals,while deferring consideration of the appeals of others,would further the very fragmentation and multiplicity of appeals that the final judgment rule seeks to avoid campbell alger th,d all parties sought review of same issue,and it would not serve justice to decide an issue of first impression only as to the party as to which the judgment was final.
while presenting no unusual issues,this case requires us to decide the issues raised in the shekhters appeal from the judgment for william klorman.because these issues are virtually identical to those in the appeals relating to the seneca defendants and klorman construction,we conclude it is appropriate to treat the appeal as to those defendants as a writ,and to determine the questions presented on their merits as to all the seneca and klorman defendants,rather than only as to william klorman.considerations of judicial economy likewise suggest a determination on the merits in this case that has not yet passed the demurrer stage.
the shekhters appeal as to sunset masonry suffers from a different problem it is a premature appeal.the trial court disposed of all causes of action against sunset masonry,sustaining demurrers,without leave to amend,as to all the causes of action the shekhters asserted against sunset masonry.however,no judgment was ever requested by or entered for sunset masonry after this appeal was filed,the shekhters lodged a proposed judgment in the trial court,but the record does not reflect any subsequent trial court action.while we hesitate to save an appeal for parties who fail to adhere to normal procedures to protect their interests,we will do so because the only impediment to appealability is arguably the trial court failure to act after the shekhters filed,albeit tardily,a proposed judgment.see smith hopland band of pomo indians th,fn,d premature appeal from order sustaining demurrer and granting motion to dismiss a lthough we fail to understand why the clearly established law on this point continues to be disregarded,in the interest of judicial economy,we shall deem the order to incorporate a judgment of dismissal.the only issue raised by the shekhters as to sunset masonry is the negligence cause of action,the resolution of which raises the same legal principle as the negligence claims against the other defendants accordingly,in the interest of judicial economy,we deem the order sustaining sunset masonry demurrers to include an appealable judgment.
ii.fraud and negligent misrepresentation claims.
the seneca and klorman defendants argue,and the trial court held,that the shekhters did not state claims for fraud and negligent misrepresentation in their fourth and fifth causes of action except as to the negligent misrepresentation claim against the klorman defendants,we disagree.
a.the fourth cause of action properly stated claims for fraud against the seneca and klorman defendants.
the essential allegations of a cause of action for fraud are representation falsity knowledge of falsity intent to deceive and reliance and resulting damage causation.witkin,cal.procedure ed.pleading.active concealment or suppression of facts is the equivalent of a false representation.the shekhters have alleged,factually and specifically,each of these elements.
to summarize the complaint alleged the seneca defendants concealed the fact that the repair methodology which he bondy recommended was completely inappropriate particularly in light of the fact that the existing cord steel within the elevated decks which were the primary subjects of repair were grossly deficient.the seneca defendants knew from the outset that their plan to repair rather than demolish and rebuild building would be inadequate,because the east half still contained the original structural steel that was grossly underdesigned.bondy knew the original structural steel was underdesigned.a document written by bondy and submitted to the city of los angeles about the repairs in,which discussed the reasons for the building failure during the earthquake,failed to disclose that a major cause of the damage was the underdesigned structural steel of the deck.seneca recommended the inadequate repairs because it would earn considerably more engineering fees for the design and engineering of the system than if it recommended the simpler plan of demolishing all of building.in addition,seneca recommended the faulty repair plan to diminish the exposure of rps in the original construction defect litigation.klorman likewise knew and concealed from the shekhters numerous facts,including that the existing structural steel in the building was grossly underdesigned,the proposed post tension system was not appropriate,and bondy was consulting for rps.klorman benefited economically as a result of the scheme under which huge but ultimately unnecessary fees would be generated for repair of a structure that should have been demolished and rebuilt.the complaint also alleges that,in the course of the reconstruction,the seneca and klorman defendants concealed various defects in the repairs they designed and performed.in particular,they knew during the course of construction of the west half of the building that the elevated slab was substantially out of level with the east half of the building.they took steps to feather the junction of the two decks in order to conceal the condition other deficiencies also were concealed 
these allegations sufficiently state the active suppression of material information about the repair of the building,knowledge that the repair plan would not work,and the intent to deceive the shekhters.reliance and resulting damage also are alleged.the complaint states that the shekhters knowledge of construction and engineering was extremely limited they entrusted responsibility for design,engineering and construction issues to experienced and licensed individuals,including bondy individually and on behalf of seneca and klorman had they known the true facts,they would not have consented to the engagement of the seneca defendants and klorman construction and would not have consented to the repair of the east end of building and would have insisted it be demolished and rebuilt.instead,the structures have begun to manifest substantial failures and the cost of repair is estimated at million dollars.
we briefly address specific contentions raised by each set of defendants,including a request for judicial notice by the klorman defendants.
seneca defendants.
the seneca defendants make several arguments.first,they contend they had no duty to disclose the appropriate methodology of repair.we disagree.a duty of disclosure may exist when one party to a transaction has sole knowledge of material facts and is aware those facts are not known to the other party.limandri judkins th,d see,actual fraud includes suppression of that which is true,by one having knowledge or belief of the fact,committed by a party to a contract with intent to deceive another party.
second,the seneca defendants contend the shekhters complaint consists of contentions,deductions,or conclusions of fact or law and fails to plead facts to support those contentions.for example,seneca says no facts support the allegation that seneca recommended the repair methodology used for the east portion of building,and this contention is belied by certain other facts seneca recites.similarly,seneca says the court may not consider allegations that bondy concealed the fact that the repair methodology which he recommended was completely inappropriate,because the word concealed is a conclusion of law and the fact that the repair methodology was inappropriate is a conclusion of fact.we see no basis for these contentions.the question whether seneca recommended the repair methodology used is plainly a question of fact.although seneca claims it did not make that recommendation,that is a question for the trier of fact or upon summary judgment.on demurrer we assume the shekhters version of the facts is true.the same is true for the question whether the repair methodology was appropriate.we must assume that it was not.nor is the word concealed a conclusion of law.an allegation that an act is fraudulent is a conclusion of law.witkin,cal.procedure,supra.an allegation that a person concealed or failed to disclose a particular fact is not.seneca other arguments that no facts are pled to establish intent,scienter and damages are equally without merit.
klorman defendants.
the klorman defendants contend that several elements are missing from the shekhters fraud claim as to them,including an actionable misrepresentation they observe that the fraud claims against them are based upon the purported concealment of flaws in the design and execution of the repairs,and that none of the circumstances in which nondisclosure or concealment may constitute actionable fraud are present.those circumstances include when the defendant had exclusive knowledge of material facts not known to the plaintiff and when the defendant actively conceals a material fact from the plaintiff limandri judkins,supra,th at,d.as to the latter,the klorman defendants say there are no allegations of active concealment by them.as the klorman defendants admit,however,the shekhters alleged they concealed the unevenness of their repairs by feathering the junction between the east and west portions of building one.while they say this allegation is not sufficiently detailed to support a fraud claim,we fail to see why not.
the klorman defendants also contend the allegations do not show they had exclusive knowledge about flaws in the repair design.they contend seneca also possessed that knowledge and,in addition,naum shekhter deposition testimony shows he and the general contractor were aware that a partial rebuild of building might not be feasible,in light of reports received from other engineers.the contention that seneca knowledge renders klorman knowledge overlooks the fact that the complaint alleged the klorman and seneca defendants were agents of each other and conspired to defraud the shekhters.see discussion in part,post.moreover,consideration of naum shekhter deposition testimony would require us to take judicial notice of it,which we decline to do.the klorman defendants did not request judicial notice of shekhter testimony by the trial court reviewing their demurrer instead,they requested it for the first time on appeal we are not inclined to determine in the first instance whether shekhter deposition testimony constitutes an admission so inconsistent with the facts alleged in the the shekhters relied on klorman concealment of the design flaws in the repair we may disregard the allegations in the complaint that matter is best resolved in the trial court on summary judgment,if appropriate 
b.the fifth cause of action properly stated a claim for negligent misrepresentation against the seneca defendants,but not against the klorman defendants.
both the seneca defendants and the klorman defendants argue that the complaint did not state a claim for negligent misrepresentation because,unlike a fraud claim,a negligent misrepresentation requires an affirmative statement,and therefore can not be premised on an implied representation or on or concealment,wilson century great western realty th,d negligent misrepresentation is a species of fraud requiring a positive assertion an implied assertion or representation is not enough see witkin,summary of cal.law ed.torts,w here the defendant makes false statements,honestly believing that they are true,but without reasonable ground for such belief,he may be liable for negligent misrepresentation italics omitted.while this is no doubt the general rule,the shekhters alleged the seneca defendants were licensed professionals who affirmatively recommended the faulty repair plan,impliedly representing it would work.the supreme court has pointed out that an expression of professional opinion,when it is not merely a casual expression of belief but a deliberate affirmation of the matters stated,may be regarded as a positive assertion of fact.bily arthur young cal th,d,accountants statements in audit opinions,quoting gagne bertran cal d.we conclude the complaint stated a cause of action for negligent misrepresentation as against the seneca defendants.on the other hand,it is not alleged the klorman defendants made any affirmative statements of fact.the complaint accordingly did not state a cause of action for negligent misrepresentation against them.
c.the trial court properly sustained demurrers to the fraud and negligent misrepresentation claims in the sixth and seventh causes of action.
the shekhters alleged a separate cause of action for fraud against seneca and bondy relating to events in and early,when the shekhters noticed a manifestation of some sort of structural related failure or problem and asked seneca and bondy to evaluate the condition.bondy reported there were no problems and the manifestation was normal.in january,the shekhters learned the west portion of building was substantially compromised and bondy representations to the contrary were false,and alleged bondy made his misstatements to conceal his earlier fraudulent and negligent acts.
the trial court judge freeman sustained the demurrer to this cause of action,without leave to amend,concluding that the complaint alleged a misrepresentation,but did not allege any intent to induce reliance.in addition,the complaint alleged only that the shekhters acted reasonably in their reliance thereon.because the complaint did not allege any alteration of a legal relationship,there could be no damages arising from the alleged misrepresentation,and therefore no cause of action.in short,the shekhters alleged no facts showing they relied on the alleged misrepresentation to their detriment 
the shekhters contend on appeal that the trial court erred,and the second amended complaint adequately pled reliance and damage from the misrepresentation.we find no error in the trial court ruling.the second amended complaint was barren of any allegations showing either that the shekhters changed their position in in reliance on bondy representation that there were no problems with the repairs,or that they were damaged as a result.see witkin,cal.procedure,supra,w hatever form it takes,the injury or damage must not only be distinctly alleged but its causal connection with the reliance on the representations must be shown.the shekhters argue on appeal that bondy alleged misrepresentation caused them to delay repairing the building,and consequently to incur higher costs.however,the shekhters do not state they could truthfully amend their complaint to allege delay and increased costs instead maintaining the causes of action were properly pled in the first place.since they were not,we conclude the demurrers to the sixth and seventh causes of action were correctly sustained.
iii.the trial court erred in striking alter ego,conspiracy and double agency allegations from the seventh amended complaint.
the trial court granted a motion by the seneca defendants to strike various allegations in the seventh amended complaint,and the shekhters contend this was error.we discuss the allegations in turn.
alter ego allegations.
the complaint alleged bondy and deetz were suitable subjects of alter ego liability for the acts and omissions of seneca structural design.the shekhters asserted seneca and other corporations doing business in the same offices with the same personnel were grossly did not maintain insurance coverage for errors and omissions relating to engineering design or construction activities did not adhere to corporate formalities and were mere shells designed to insulate bondy and deetz from liability for acts done under the auspices of the corporate shells.the shekhters further alleged the exploitation and misuse of the corporate shells was part of an ongoing business practice by bondy and deetz,who earlier disbanded a corporation that had been sued on many occasions.
the seneca defendants contend the alter ego allegations were speculative and contained no supporting facts.the allegations were clear,however,and we know of,and are cited to,no principle requiring more detailed factual allegations at this stage of litigation.while the trial court has the discretion to s trike out any irrelevant,false,or improper matter code civ,subd.a,these allegations do not fall into any of those categories striking them was error.
conspiracy allegations.
the shekhters alleged the seneca and klorman defendants conspired with each other to defraud them.conspiracy to defraud is not a separate cause of action,but if proved would render each participant in the wrongdoing responsible as a joint tortfeasor for all damages ensuing from the wrong,whether or not the participant was a direct actor and regardless of the degree of the participant activity.doctors superior court cal d.the complaint also alleged the various defendants were agents,employees,partners,joint venturers of each other.the trial court granted a motion to strike the conspiracy allegations,apparently concluding the shekhters were improperly pleading inconsistent theories of agency and conspiracy in an earlier demurrer ruling,the court made a similar statement,citing applied equipment litton saudi arabia cal th,d,litton,which reaffirmed the rule that duly acting agents and employees can not be held liable for conspiring with their principals.
the trial court ruling was erroneous.under the agent immunity rule,the agents of a corporation can not conspire with their corporate principal where they act in their official capacities on behalf of the corporation,and not as individuals for their individual advantage.litton,supra,cal th at,fn,d.for example,klorman can not conspire with klorman construction when acting on behalf of the corporation.but the shekhters clearly allege the seneca and klorman defendants conspired with each other to defraud the shekhters.the further allegation that the seneca and klorman defendants were acting as agents and joint venturers of each other in no way implicates the agent immunity rule.klorman,for example,was not and could not have been acting in any official corporate capacity on behalf of seneca structural design,and therefore is capable of conspiring with seneca to defraud the shekhters.a cause of action for civil conspiracy does not arise if the alleged conspirator,though a participant in the agreement underlying the injury,was not personally bound by the duty violated by the wrongdoing and was acting only as the agent or employee of the party who did have that duty.doctors superior court,supra,cal d at.however,each of the defendants had an individual duty not to defraud the shekhters.the agent immunity rule does not preclude the subjection of agents to conspiracy liability for conduct which the agents carry out as individuals for their individual advantage and not solely on behalf of the principal citation.doctors superior court,supra,cal d at.that is precisely the case here 
double agency allegations relating to bondy and rps.
the shekhters complaint included additional causes of action for fraud and negligent misrepresentation against bondy and seneca the ninth and tenth causes of action.these causes of action concerned a claim that bondy was secretly acting as an agent for company responsible for the defective steel in the original the same time bondy was working for the shekhters.the parties refer to these as double agency causes of action and allegations.the shekhters agreed to dismiss their double agency fraud claims against bondy as a part of a settlement in the rps construction defect litigation.however,the shekhters continued to allege facts throughout the complaint pertaining to bondy personal and business relationship with rps,as these facts explained the reason bondy recommended the faulty repair plan and his motivation for allegedly defrauding the shekhters.moreover,the dismissed ninth and tenth causes of action remained in the seventh amended complaint,albeit with a heading stating that the causes of action had been dismissed with prejudice.
the trial court granted a motion to strike portions of the seventh amended complaint,including the entire ninth and tenth double agency causes of action,as well as all double agency allegations appearing elsewhere in the complaint.while it was appropriate to strike the ninth and tenth causes of action in their entirety,as all parties agree those causes of action were to be dismissed,no basis existed for striking allegations elsewhere in the complaint material to the fraud claims that remain at issue.to that extent,the order doing so was erroneous.
iv.the trial court erred in sustaining demurrers to the shekhters negligence claims.
the trial court sustained all demurrers to the shekhters second cause of action for negligence.in that cause of action,the shekhters alleged the seneca and klorman defendants failed to properly design,engineer and construct the repair,restoration and rebuilding of the apartment complex,and sunset masonry provided inadequate defective services and materials,causing or contributing to damage to the property.the shekhters sought damages of million,including,but not limited to,investigative costs,relocation costs,costs of repair,loss of market value,and loss of use.citing aas superior court cal th,d,aas and other precedent,the trial court observed that negligent performance of a construction contract,without violation of an independent duty,did not justify imposition of tort damages,and the shekhters did not allege facts showing the alleged defects caused property damage other than defects in the improvements themselves.we conclude this was error.
in aas,the supreme court held that,under settled law limiting the recovery of economic losses in tort actions,a homeowner may not recover damages in negligence from a contractor or subcontractor for construction defects that have not caused property damage.aas superior court,supra,cal th at,d.the shekhters contend aas does not apply,because the complaint clearly alleged property damage,including substantial and progressive cracking in the elevated decks of the apartment complex that were improperly repaired.the defendants effectively concede the complaint alleged property damage,but maintain the shekhters do not allege the cracking in the rebuilt and repaired concrete deck,columns or walls has harmed any other part of the complex.they contend that under aas,the property damage that permits a negligence claim must be damage to property other than the property repaired and,in the absence of damage to other property,the economic loss rule bars recovery 
we conclude that the defendants misconstrue aas.in our view,requiring damage to property other than the repaired structure would improperly apply principles applicable to defective products to a case premised upon negligent design and engineering.nothing in aas requires that result.
to explain our conclusion,we must review the case law surrounding the proper application of the economic loss doctrine.before we do,however,it may be helpful to bear in mind the several principles we must apply 
the supreme court first recognized a remedy in the law of negligence for construction defects causing property damage in.aas,supra,cal th at,d,citing stewart cox cal d,stewart upholding homeowner judgment against a subcontractor who negligently applied concrete to a swimming pool,causing the release of water that damaged the pool,lot and house see also sabella wisler cal d,sabella upholding judgment for property damage caused by negligent residential construction,where defendant negligent preparation of the lot on which it built a house,in combination with a subcontractor careless plumbing work,later caused leaks,subsidence and damage to the house.
while negligent performance of a construction contract,without more,does not justify an award of tort damages,conduct amounting to a breach of contract becomes tortious when it also violates a duty independent of the contract arising from principles of tort law.aas,supra,cal th at,d,citing erlich menezes cal th,d.
cases holding the builders of homes liable for construction defects causing property stewart and sabella,among many other negligence and strict liability cases may be understood as recognizing such an independent duty.aas,supra,cal th at,d.
the independent duty recognized in construction defects cases is limited by the rule in seely white motor cal d,aas,supra,cal th at,d.seely,discussing strict liability in tort,established the principle that e ven in actions for negligence,a manufacturer liability is limited to damages for physical injuries and there is no recovery for economic loss alone.seely white motor,supra,cal d at,barring recovery of economic damages representing the lost benefit of a bargain.
with these points in mind,we examine the aas case in greater detail,and then explain our conclusion that aas does not require damage to property other than the repaired structure.
aas superior court 
in aas superior court,the supreme court addressed the question whether plaintiffs could recover in negligence a money judgment representing the cost to repair,or the diminished value attributable to,construction defects that had not caused property damage.the defects consisted of deviations from applicable building codes or industry standards,including the failure to properly construct shear walls and connect them to other building components and the failure to properly support electrical cables.aas,supra,cal th at,fn,d.the court examined the nebulous and troublesome margin between tort and contract law id.at,d,and explained that any construction defect can diminish the value of a house.however,the difference between price paid and value received,and deviations from standards of quality that have not resulted in property damage or personal injury,are primarily the domain of contract and warranty law or the law of fraud,rather than of negligence.id.at,d.aas did not address liability for construction defects that have caused property damage id.at,d,original italics,nor did aas state that property damage caused by a construction defect must occur to property other than the property defectively constructed in order to support a negligence action aas merely held that,where a construction defect has not actually caused any property damage,a homeowner may not recover damages in negligence from a contractor or subcontractor.
the klorman defendants contend the shekhters alleged damage only to the repairs themselves.they say that,under aas,property damage compensable in tort can only exist when a defective component damages other parts of the same product.aas,supra,cal th at,d.aas says nothing of the sort.it states,in discussing construction defect liability based on strict products liability theory,that property damage can exist in those circumstances,not that those are the only circumstances under which property damage compensable in tort may exist.indeed,aas discusses and explains the two distinct theories id.at,d,of tort liability in the law of construction defects which developed following the decisions in stewart,supra,and sabella,supra.these are 
the strict products liability theory which was first applied to homes in.kriegler eichler homes,d.the aas court explained that,as strict products liability theory developed,it became that the plaintiff can not recover,either in strict liability or negligence,from a manufacturer for the cost of repairing a defective product or for loss of business income due to a defective product.damages are recoverable for physical injury,but not for the benefit of a contractual bargain such as the cost of repairing a defective product or compensation for its diminished value aas,supra,cal th at,d.for example,homeowners were not allowed to recover in negligence for the cost of replacing water pipes known to be defective,but which had not yet leaked.zamora shell oil th,d.then,o ver time,the concept of recoverable physical injury or property damage expanded to include damage to one part of a product caused by another,defective part.aas,supra,cal th at,d,see,jimenez superior court cal th,d,the manufacturer of a defective window installed in a home may be held strictly liable in tort for damage that the window defect causes to other parts of the home in which it is installed stearman centex homes th,d builder was strictly liable in tort for damages that a defective foundation caused to the interior and exterior of a home.
the second theory in the law of construction defects,aas explains,is the theory of negligence recognized in biakanja irving cal d,biakanja,further developed in gregory cal d,and applied in the stewart and sabella construction defect cases as well as in numerous other circumstances.under biakanja and,liability in negligence could be imposed for negligent performance of a contractual obligation resulting in damage to the property or economic interests of a person not in privity,if the defendant was under a duty to protect those interests.aas,supra,cal th at,d.the existence of a duty is determined on a case by case basis,and is a matter of policy involving the balancing of six factors identified in biakanja one of which is the degree of certainty that the plaintiff suffered injury aas,supra,cal th at,d,quoting biakanja,supra,cal d at.in,the court applied the biakanja factors to find that a special relationship existed permitting the recovery of economic losses,supra,cal d at,see aas,supra,cal th at,d.subsequent cases have applied to cases where privity of contract exists,as well as in a wide variety of cases where it does not.aas,supra,cal th at,d,citing cases.as aas informs us,stewart and sabella were applications of the biakanja negligence theory.in stewart,for example,the negligent concrete subcontractor work was specifically intended to affect the plaintiffs damage to their property was foreseeable if the work were negligently done and serious damage actually occurred.aas,supra,cal th at,d,describing stewart.
aas does not require damage to property other than the repaired structure.
the defendants theory that the damage must be to property other than the property defectively repaired is based on cases applying products liability theory where damage caused by the defective product to persons or other property is recoverable,but damage to the product itself is not.see ante,fn.and accompanying text.defendants in effect ask us to consider the repairs themselves a product,which must damage some other property in order to produce recoverable tort damages.however,the shekhters alleged the seneca and klorman defendants provided negligent design and engineering services,not that they manufactured a defective product or installed a defective product in a home,jimenez superior court,supra,cal th at,d.in short,this is a construction defect case that does not arise from a defective product,but instead arises from negligent engineering and design services see north american chemical superior court th,d distinguishing cases involving sale of goods or products from those relating only to the performance of services cooper jevne d.liability at issue was the malpractice liability of a professional architect for negligence in the rendition of his services and not that of a manufacturer for defects in his product.thus,the products defect cases that require damage to other property,and do not permit recovery for damage to the defective product itself,are simply not applicable.
accordingly,we see no basis for concluding that the design and engineering of a system to reinforce a structure is a product which,if it fails,must cause damage to property other than the structure itself in order to support a cause of action for negligence.on the contrary,the faulty repair plan alleged in this case is analogous to the negligence in sabella,supra,cal d,where the defendants constructed a house on an improperly compacted lot,which eventually resulted in damage to the house.negligent preparation of the lot,upon which the house was constructed,is directly analogous to the allegedly faulty plan for the execution of repairs to the structure here neither involved a product and both resulted in serious damage to the property constructed or,in this case,repaired 
in sum,the cases have long held that conduct amounting to a breach of contract becomes tortious when it also violates a duty independent of contract,and such an independent duty is recognized in cases assessing liability for construction defects causing property damage.aas,supra,cal th at,d.those cases require,inter alia,a showing of appreciable,nonspeculative,present injury as a fundamental prerequisite,and c onstruction defects that have not ripened into property damage,or at least into involuntary losses,do not comfortably fit the definition of appreciable harm.id.at,d.in this case,the defects have ripened into property damage,including substantial and progressive cracking throughout the elevated decks,observable failures at supporting walls,and in various other particulars,and water intrusion drainage problems and related conditions building is also beginning to manifest property damage the shekhters clearly can not recover for repairs that are merely cosmetically unsatisfactory or for damage that has not yet occurred.they can,however,recover damages in tort if they are able to prove,among other things,that the defective design resulted in appreciable,nonspeculative,present physical damage to the repaired structure.on demurrer,of course,we must assume the allegations of substantial and progressive cracking throughout the elevated decks and other damage in fact constitutes appreciable harm.it was therefore error to sustain the demurrers to the negligence cause of action.
disposition 
the judgment in favor of william klorman is reversed and the cause remanded to the trial court for further proceedings.the order sustaining demurrers to all causes of action against sunset masonry concrete,construed to include a judgment of dismissal,is reversed to the extent it dismisses the second cause of action for negligence,and is otherwise affirmed.let a peremptory writ of mandate issue directing the trial court to vacate its order of january,to the extent the order sustained the demurrers of seneca structural design,kenneth bondy and chris deetz to the second,fourth and fifth causes of action for negligence,fraud and negligent misrepresentation,sustained the demurrers of klorman construction,and william klorman to the second and fourth causes of action for negligence and fraud,and granted the motion to strike,and directing the trial court to make a new order overruling those demurrers and denying the motion to strike to the extent described in this opinion.the shekhters are to recover their costs on appeal.
the size of the steel in the deck had deviated from approved plans,and the method of connection between the steel pieces in the deck was inadequate and did not comply with code requirements.
the seneca and klorman defendants stress the fact that the shekhters have had seven opportunities to amend the complaint.as will appear,however,various of the defendants earlier demurrers were overruled by judge freeman and later before judge sohigian.
the trial court also denied the seneca defendants motion to strike certain allegations,including allegations that refer to piercing the corporate veil joint venture allegations allegations that the klorman contract was made because seneca was undercapitalized and did not have insurance allegations that seneca,bondy,and deetz were klorman agents,employees,and allegations that bondy was acting on behalf of seneca and klorman 
the trial court sustained the demurrer to the entire sixth amended complaint as uncertain,observing that the shekhters continued to plead inconsistent theories of agency and conspiracy.the court sustained demurrers to the second cause of action for negligence,observing that the shekhters did not allege ultimate facts showing the alleged defects had caused property damage other than defects in the improvements themselves.as to the fourth and fifth causes of action for fraud and negligent misrepresentation,the court observed that there was uncertainty whether there was any duty to determine disclose other economically viable alternatives to repair and reconstruction of the improvements.the court also observed there were insufficient allegations of ultimate facts regarding fraudulent intent.
the complaint alleged that services and materials provided by sunset masonry were inadequate defective.
the shekhters purported to dismiss causes of action for fraud and negligent misrepresentation against sunset masonry however,those causes of action were never asserted against sunset masonry.
sunset masonry states the appeal is technically premature,but it has no objection to this court consideration of the appeal as against sunset masonry,whether from the order or from the judgment subsequently entered thereon.however,the record shows no subsequent judgment.
the other claims against sunset masonry were a strict liability is not at issue as to any other a breach of contract claim.in the opening brief,shekhter makes no argument with respect to either of these claims.
these are the causes of action as to which,in the third amended complaint,judge freeman overruled demurrers by seneca defendants and klorman construction.
the fourth cause of action for fraud consists of more than pages,exclusive of allegations that are incorporated by reference.
when the defects began to manifest themselves,the seneca and klorman defendants continued to take the position there was no problem with the construction,when they knew full well that the design was inappropriate,and that construction was grossly deficient because the two as built portions of building were out of level with each other but this condition was masked and concealed and that steel in the new deck had been improperly placed.
the klorman defendants also contend the complaint lacked sufficient allegations of intent to defraud.we do not agree.intent,like knowledge is a fact.hence,the averment that the representation was made with the intent to deceive the plaintiff,or any other general allegation with similar purport,is sufficient.witkin,cal.procedure,supra.
a number of cases hold that,in reviewing a demurrer,a trial court may properly take judicial notice of inconsistent statements made by a plaintiff in his or her deposition,and disregard any inconsistent allegations in the complaint,del webb structural mater
