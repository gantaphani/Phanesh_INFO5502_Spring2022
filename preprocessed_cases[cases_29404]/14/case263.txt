jose aguirre was injured when he fell from a scaffold while working for a masonry subcontractor on the soldier field renovation project in chicago.aguirre and his wife brought negligence claims based on section of the restatement second of torts and res ipsa loquitur against the general contractors in charge of the renovation.aguirre maintains the defendants owed him a duty of reasonable care based on their extensive oversight of all project safety.the district court granted summary judgment for the defendants after concluding they had not retained sufficient control over the subcontractor work to give rise to any duty of care toward aguirre or supply a basis for liability on a res ipsa loquitur theory.because we conclude that these holdings are inconsistent with the requirements of illinois negligence law,we reverse.
background 
jose aguirre was injured when he fell from a scaffold while working as a bricklayer on the renovation of soldier field in chicago.aguirre was an employee of masonry,one of numerous subcontractors working on the renovation project.the project was overseen by the defendants,collectively known as the joint venture tbmk.aguirre maintains that his fall was the result of design construction defects in the scaffold.he and his wife brought negligence and loss of consortium claims against the defendants based on section of the restatement second of torts,which permits direct liability against a general contractor who retains sufficient control over a subcontractor,and on res ipsa loquitur,which permits circumstantial evidence of liability against a defendant in control of the instrumentality of the injury.the defendants moved for summary judgment on the ground that they,as the general contractors,owed no duty under either theory to aguirre,an employee of a subcontractor.
discovery proceeded to determine the extent of control tbmk retained over work.this discovery demonstrated that although the contract between tbmk and stated that remained solely responsible for the safety of its employees,tbmk also played an active part in overseeing the safety of the renovation project.for example,tbmk promulgated an extensive safety program that all subcontractors were required to follow,and it hired a safety coordinator and other personnel to oversee that program.tbmk also held monthly safety meetings,required subcontractors to hold regular safety meetings that tbmk could monitor,and required subcontractors to prepare their own safety programs.tbmk personnel walked the work site daily to monitor compliance with these safety requirements.the safety coordinator and his employees had and sometimes exercised the authority to halt any subcontractor work being performed in an unsafe manner.
tbmk safety program,which is part of its contract with,included rules specifically pertaining to the erection of scaffolding.those rules imposed both design requirements,such as guardrail and plank specifications,and safety precautions,such as regular inspection and fall protection.the district court found that although tbmk was not required to inspect all of the scaffolding,it did do so.the scaffold from which aguirre fell had been specifically altered from the standard design based on an irregularity in the area where the work was being performed.although no tbmk employee inspected the scaffold prior to aguirre fall,tbmk had worked with to create and approve its alternate design.
the district court granted summary judgment for the defendants on both the section and res ipsa loquitur theories of liability.first,the court stated that under illinois law res ipsa loquitur requires a defendant to be in exclusive control of the instrumentality of the injury.thus,the court concluded,this theory could not be used because employees constructed the scaffold from which aguirre fell.turning to section of the restatement,the court determined that although tbmk exercised extensive authority over work site safety,tbmk could not be liable because the contract between tbmk and provided that controlled operative work details and its workers safety.the court noted that was contractually required to comply with tbmk safety program,design its own safety program tailored to tbmk safety standards,and employ personnel to ensure compliance.thus,the court held,no duty of care could exist because tbmk did not have control of the incidental details of work or its workers safety.the plaintiffs appealed.

section liability 
the restatement second of torts,section states 
one who entrusts work to an independent contractor,but who retains the control of any part of the work,is subject to liability for physical harm to others for whose safety the employer owes a duty to exercise reasonable care,which is caused by his failure to exercise his control with reasonable care.
the retained control theory of negligence liability described in section was adopted by the illinois supreme court in larson commonwealth edison.however,some confusion has arisen recently among illinois intermediate appellate courts regarding whether section states a theory of vicarious liability or direct liability.see,cochran george sollitt const,d.although the illinois supreme court has yet to lend its guidance on this issue,we are confident it would interpret section in accordance with its plain language and accompanying commentary,which clearly state a theory of direct liability for a general contractor own negligence,not a basis for imposing vicarious liability on a general contractor for the negligence of a subcontractor.
the bulk of the existing confusion stems from comment a to section,which states 
if the employer of an independent contractor retains control over the operative detail of doing any part of the work,he is subject to liability for the negligence of the employees of the contractor engaged therein,under the rules of that part of the law of agency which deals with the relation of master and servant.the employer may,however,retain a control less than that which is necessary to subject him to liability as master.he may retain only the power to direct the order in which the work shall be done,or to forbid its being done in a manner likely to be dangerous to himself or others.such a supervisory control may not subject him to liability under the principles of agency,but he may be liable under the rule stated in this section unless he exercises his supervisory control with reasonable care so as to prevent the work which he has ordered to be done from causing injury to others.
some courts,including the district court in this case,have mistakenly read this comment as first laying out when section applies,see,cochran,at as comment a to section clarifies,the general contractor,by retaining control over the operative details of its subcontractor work,may become vicariously liable for the subcontractor negligence,then explaining that no liability can exist if the general contractor retain s only the power to direct the order in which the work shall be done,or to forbid its being done in a manner likely to be dangerous to himself or others.see aguirre turner constr,wl at.
properly read,comment a does just the opposite.the first sentence does not explain the scope of section,but rather merely refers to the principles of vicarious liability within the restatement of agency.where the level of retained control gives rise to a relationship,the master will be liable for the tor
