background and standard of review 
in july,city approved the anderson marketplace project the project after certifying the final eir for it.the project is adjacent to state highway and is about feet west of interstate it is situated in the southwest portion of the city adjoining present city development.the project encompasses and a half acres it is comprised of an approximately supercenter,three other pads totaling square feet,and a gas station.supercenters generally operate hours per day and combine a full merchandise discount store with a full supermarket.land use approvals necessary for the project included a general plan amendment and rezone to change eight of the acres from residential to highway commercial,a parcel map,and a conditional use permit.
anderson coalition petitioned for a writ of mandate,challenging city approval of the project on the environmental grounds noted above in the introduction.the trial court granted the petition to the extent that the traffic vehicle impacts of the gas station,and consequently the station air quality impacts,had not been analyzed in the eir.
pursuant to ceqa section,the trial court,in the judgment,severed the gas station from the rest of the project and ordered fhk and to suspend any gas station activity until they had complied with ceqa regarding the station traffic and air quality effects.the trial court allowed the rest of the project to proceed.
thereafter,city excluded the gas station from the project and adopted new resolutions approving the project and certifying its eir in this context.

discussion 
the trial court judgment severing the gas station 
anderson coalition contends the trial court judgment violated ceqa by severing the gas station from the project,allowing the rest of the project to proceed.the environmental impacts at issue here are the gas station traffic and air quality impacts stemming from the number of vehicle trips the station would generate.we conclude the trial court did not err.
in various documents in the eir process,the project was described as a commercial project consisting of a nearly building for,three other commercial pad sites totaling square feet,and a fourth pad for a gas station.the figure did vary in some of the documents,but only in trivial respects.the sizes of the gas station and the fourth pad were never specified.the total square footage for the project was described on several occasions as a little over square feet,a figure which did not encompass the gas station.
city attempted to explain that the eir had evaluated the gas station traffic and air quality impacts based on trip generation pursuant to a standard manual.under the manual,the gas station was considered a shopping center outparcel,a smaller,detached commercial parcel that is nevertheless part of a larger shopping center complex.however,the record showed that this manual definition of outparcel did not include gas stations,and that the outparcel definition was drafted prior to the recent phenomenon of gas stations being developed as an integral part of shopping centers themselves.
based on all of this,the trial court granted anderson coalition petition on the point that the traffic and air quality impacts of the gas station had not been analyzed in the eir.the court reasoned that,given the total square footage described for the project,it was not clear whether the gas station had been considered in the traffic and air quality analyses in the eir for the project and city claim that the gas station had been analyzed as a shopping center outparcel was not supported by substantial evidence.
pursuant to ceqa section,the trial court fashioned the following remedy in its judgment the construction and operation of all aspects of the project could proceed,except for the gas station and all activity regarding the gas station was suspended pending ceqa compliance regarding its traffic and air quality effects.
under the dictates of subdivision b of section,the trial court made the following findings in the judgment the infirmities in the eir are limited solely to the potential traffic and air quality impacts associated with the proposed gas station the construction and operation of the gas station are specific project activities that are severable from the remainder of the project severance of the gas station from the remainder of the project will not prejudice complete and full compliance with ceqa,in that the only defects in the eir relate to the operation of the proposed gas station to be located on the project site,and the remainder of the project can be developed and operated without the gas station,and thus without the potential traffic and air quality effects that might result from gas station operation and the court has found the remainder of the project to be in full compliance with ceqa.we conclude the trial court acted properly.
section states as pertinent 
a if a court finds that any determination,finding,or decision of a public agency has been made without compliance with ceqa,the court shall enter an order that includes one or more of the following 
a mandate that the determination,finding,or decision be voided by the public agency,in whole or in part.
b any order pursuant to subdivision a shall include only those mandates which are necessary to achieve compliance with ceqa and only those specific project activities in noncompliance with ceqa.the order shall be made by the issuance of a peremptory writ of mandate specifying what action by the public agency is necessary to comply with ceqa.however,the order shall be limited to that portion of a determination,finding,or decision or the specific project activity or activities found to be in noncompliance only if a court finds that the portion or specific project activity or activities are severable,severance will not prejudice complete and full compliance with ceqa,and the court has not found the remainder of the project to be in noncompliance with ceqa.
anderson coalition argues that the trial court erred in its severance remedy by allowing the project to proceed after finding two significant defects in the eir contrary to ceqa basic purpose,this approach improperly segregated project approval from environmental impact evaluation.the two significant defects,anderson coalition maintains,are the elusive and inadequate project descriptions regarding the project total size,and the inadequate traffic and air quality analyses for the entire project.
anderson coalition argument fails in light of what we have said above.the record regarding the project total size and its traffic and air quality analyses shows that these two alleged defects relate only to the eir failure to consider the proposed gas station these defects do not concern the whole project.the eir descriptions of the project total size show only that the gas station may have been omitted from the project environmental analysis.and the eir analysis of the project traffic and air quality impacts was not inadequate regarding the entire project,but only regarding the gas station,which the trial court found to have been omitted from the analysis.in this context,the trial court properly could,and did,sever the gas station from the rest of the project under section,subdivision b.
anderson coalition claims that the severance remedy under section was originally designed to address only relatively minor matters of noncompliance with ceqa,not the more significant aspects involved here.but as the court recognized in san bernardino valley audubon society metropolitan water dist.th,d,t he amendments to section expanded the trial court authority and expressly authorized the court to fashion a remedy that permits some part of the project to go forward while an agency seeks to remedy its ceqa violations.in other words,the issuance of a writ need not always halt all work on a project.th at,d,quoting remy et,guide to the cal.environmental quality act ed.
two decisions which have found the section severance remedy inapplicable stand in contrast to the situation here and support our resolution san joaquin rescue center county of stanislaus th,d san joaquin raptor and bakersfield citizens,supra,th,d.in san joaquin raptor,the court described the eir as a mass of flaws from beginning to end and in all major respects.th at fn,d the vast array of inadequacies in the eir precludes severance.bakersfield citizens aptly noted that n o discrete or severable aspects of the projects are unaffected by the omitted analyses the defects relate to the shopping centers in their entirety,not just to one specific retailer.th at,d.
anderson coalition also argues that separation of the gas station from the remainder of the project improperly curtails environmental analysis and hinders a good faith assessment of cumulative impacts.not so.the project no longer includes the gas station.and no free passes from environmental review have been issued.should the gas station ever be proposed again,it will have to be environmentally reviewed as to its own impacts and together with the project as to its cumulative impacts.see san joaquin raptor,supra,th at,d lead agency can not divide up a project and overlook its cumulative impact by separately focusing on the divided parts.
finally,city and claim the trial court erred in finding the eir deficient regarding the gas station traffic and air quality impacts.we deem the claim forfeited because city and have not on this point.see weiss brentwood sav.loan d.
urban decay 
anderson coalition next claims the eir did not properly evaluate the project potential to cause urban decay.we disagree.
the coalition raises two points.
first,the coalition claims city took the legally erroneous position that urban decay impacts are economic impacts outside ceqa scope,and that since city downtown was already partially blighted it was unnecessary to evaluate whether urban decay is likely to result from the project addition of over square feet of new retail.in other words,anderson coalition argues that city bypassed addressing the issue of urban decay impact on legal grounds.
an eir is to disclose and analyze the direct and the reasonably foreseeable indirect environmental impacts of a proposed project if they are significant.guidelines,subd.d.economic and social impacts of proposed projects,therefore,are outside ceqa purview.when there is evidence,however,that economic and social effects caused by a project,such as a shopping center,could result in a reasonably foreseeable indirect environmental impact,such as urban decay or deterioration,then the ceqa lead agency is obligated to assess this indirect environmental impact.bakersfield citizens,supra,th at,d friends of davis city of davis th,d friends of davis citizens for quality growth city of shasta d.citizens for sensible development of bishop area county of inyo d.an impact which is speculative or unlikely to occur is not reasonably foreseeable.guidelines,subd.d.
in the eir for the project,city adhered to these legal principles regarding the central business district cbd or downtown.on the economic point,city substantively considered the issue of whether economic and social changes wrought by the project could result in a significant indirect environmental impact of urban decay or deterioration on the downtown,and concluded no.on the blight point,city again considered the matter substantively,concluding there was no evidence suggesting that city cbd would suffer from additional physical blight or a significant deterioration of character as a result of the project.italics added.
as for its second point,anderson coalition claims the evidence is insufficient to sustain city conclusion in the eir that the impact of urban decay on the cbd is less than significant.we disagree.in this context,we do not review the record,as the coalition wishes us to do,to determine whether it demonstrates a possibility of environmental impact we review it in the light most favorable to city conclusion to determine whether substantial evidence supports the conclusion that the impact of urban decay is less than significant.see bakersfield citizens,supra,th at,d friends of davis,supra,th at,d.in the ceqa context,substantial evidence means enough relevant information and reasonable inferences from this information that a fair argument can be made to support a conclusion,even though other conclusions might also be reached.guidelines,subd.a.
the eir concluded that the project would not result in additional physical deterioration of city cbd,downtown,and therefore this impact was less than significant.three reasons were given for this conclusion.
first,city relied on an economic analysis which discussed the project impacts on other businesses,including the downtown area.city downtown typically contains smaller retail stores that service local residents.the project,by contrast,is designed to serve a regional market and compete against other retailers in redding and red bluff.although some competition would be expected between the project and existing businesses in the city,the project is more likely to compete directly with city existing outlying satellite shopping areas rather than its cbd.because of the city proximity to redding and red bluff retailers,the city loses significant shopping and tax dollars to these two cities from its own residents general studies show an approximate percent leakage.the project could stem this leakage by keeping the city residents shopping in the city this could create more potential customers for goods and services within the cbd.one study cited by anderson coalition shows that stores that do not compete directly with tend to show an increase in sales due to increased local traffic.
second,prior to the project application,city had created a redevelopment district to address the issue of existing blight within the cbd.the cbd and the proposed site for the project or at least the site are in this district.construction on vacant land within the redevelopment district,according to the eir,results in significant increases in property value and property taxes that city can use to make improvements throughout the district.by generating these tax increment moneys,the project will contribute funds to revitalize the cbd.according to the eir,city redevelopment agency projects that million in net present value of future redevelopment property tax increment will be used for public improvements in the central business district,and million will be used for commercial and industrial development business assistance.the business assistance programs are most likely to be primarily utilized within the central business district.in addition,a net present value of million is anticipated to be used to correct infrastructure deficiencies.again,a significant amount of these funds are likely to be allocated to infrastructure improvements within the central business district area.in fact,the first such infrastructure improvement project is budgeted for improvements within the central business district.
and third,according to the eir,the viability of the cbd area is more likely to be affected by planning efforts and marketing strategies,infrastructure improvement projects,appropriate building preservation,and incentives to business owners to locate and stay in the cbd.
anderson coalition submitted a study of the project likely potential to cause urban decay in city cbd the king report,along with similar studies from other communities shils report,stone mississippi report,rea parker,impact of walmart on downtowns,and public testimony.the king report concluded that the proposed super center would drive customers out of city downtown area creating blight.boldface omitted.that report went on to name the downtown businesses that would be severely impacted by the supercenter these comprised two pharmacies,one florist,one hardware store,two furniture stores and a craft store.the studies from other communities presented a mixed bag.as the stone report noted,for example,s ome downtown businesses in cities where walmarts have located have benefited from the greater draw of customers.others have been devastated by the overwhelming new competition for their customers dollars.the shils report has recognized that the key survival strategy for local merchants is to specialize in unique products and service.local merchants need to create niches,and draw from the increased traffic provided by the retailers.
city addressed these studies submitted by anderson coalition.city conceded that the two downtown pharmacies identified in the king report may be impacted by the,but noted that the other named downtown businesses,not directly competing with,may actually benefit from increased local retail traffic.city also pointed to the sales leakage factor noted in these studies for communities without large retail projects,and the synergy that may be created between a new and local businesses that provide goods not offered by.these studies did not persuade city that the economic effects of the project will foreseeably result in significant environmental effects.
a good argument can be made that the king report,focusing as it does on the city,along with the studies from other communities and the public comments,present substantial evidence that the project could add to the blight in city cbd.but a good argument can also be made that city has presented substantial evidence that the project will not do so.anderson coalition argues that the type and magnitude of evidence it presented on the issue of urban decay parallels the evidence introduced in bakersfield citizens.but there is a big difference in the legal posture between the present case and bakersfield citizens.the bakersfield citizens court concluded that an eir was deficient as an informational document because it failed to consider the potential of a supercenter project to cause urban decay notwithstanding a great deal of evidence of that potential.bakersfield citizens,supra,th at,d.here,as we have seen,city eir did consider the issue of the project impact on urban decay on the cbd,and concluded that the impact was less than significant.as noted,we review the record in the light most favorable to that conclusion.in doing so,we conclude that substantial evidence supports it.
relying largely on the king report,anderson coalition raises the additional issue that the project could cause new decay in satellite shopping areas outside the cbd downtown and claims the eir never addressed this concern.the king report focused on city downtown,but also opined that the project would seriously impact existing shopping centers outside the cbd,creating blight the report noted that city already has one blighted mall and two that are marginal.
contrary to anderson coalition claim,the final eir did address this concern of outlying urban decay,stating the draft eir does under impact note that some economic impact may occur in other commercial areas of the community,the shopping centers noted in the king report outside the cbd.however,while some vacancies may occur,in a growing community of anderson,these vacancies may be filled by other uses not directly in competition with.consequently,it can not be stated with any probability that any negative physical change may occur.since economic effects are not to be treated as significant effects,no mitigation is necessary notwithstanding the king report predictions of possible business closures,neither the commenter nor the king report has met the evidentiary burden necessary to require the city to attempt to predict physical impacts that hypothetically might follow from such closures.nor has the commenter provided any information suggesting that any such speculative physical impacts would rise to the level of significant environmental effects requiring analysis in an eir.such potential closures would occur in an urbanized area that,compared with currently undeveloped property,lacks any ecological values that might be compromised or harmed by the temporary or permanent vacancy of urban structures.should businesses close and not be replaced with new businesses,the purely environmental consequences might be benign reduced traffic into the affected area.should any closed businesses be replaced with new ones,it is likely that there would be little,if any,net environmental difference between the and condition.old traffic will be replaced by new traffic it is only when economic competition demonstrably leads to adverse environmental effects that ceqa takes note 
thus,city did not find evidence of economic and social effects caused by the project that could result in a reasonably foreseeable impact of urban decay regarding outlying shopping centers.bakersfield citizens,supra,th at,d friends of davis,supra,th at,d.city therefore did address this issue in the eir.and substantial evidence supports city conclusion that urban decay in this context is speculative,and therefore not reasonably foreseeable consequently,city was not obligated to further analyze this claimed indirect impact.bakersfield citizens,supra,th at,d friends of davis,supra,th at,d guidelines,subd.d.the potential for urban decay in an older,denser urban area such as a central business district is greater than that presented in a newer,outlying,more isolated satellite shopping center.furthermore,city could reason that since it found the project impact of urban decay to the cbd to be less than significant on the basis of substantial evidence,the lesser impact of urban decay to a diffuse,outlying shopping center was no greater than speculative.as a small,growing town with a population of around,city noted that its potential for urban decay is less than that of a typical,declining city.
anderson coalition contends the eir improperly sets forth speculative traffic mitigation measures,and improperly segments environmental review of a freeway interchange improvement from the project.we disagree for the most part,but find we must reverse the trial court denial of the coalition petition regarding the project cumulative traffic mitigation fee regarding the interchange.
as for the speculative traffic mitigation measures,the coalition argues the eir erroneously assumed the uncertain construction of pleasant hills drive realignment of rhonda road extension of deschutes road and improvement of the deschutes road interchange hereafter,interchange.
ceqa requires that feasible mitigation measures actually be implemented as a condition of development,and not merely be adopted and then neglected or disregarded.see federation of hillside canyon associations city of los angeles th,d federation of hillside.
the eir states that the project can not be developed without the construction of pleasant hills drive on the project northern boundary and the realignment of rhonda road on the project eastern side.these two roads will intersect at a t just west of state highway.as mitigation measures regarding this construction and realignment,the eir specifies that the project can not proceed until the or access to the roadway for pleasant hills drive and rhonda road has been secured by city or to city satisfaction,and the intersection of rhonda road and pleasant hills drive has been set at least feet west of state highway.these are not speculative mitigation measures regarding the construction of pleasant hills drive and the realignment of rhonda road the project can not take place without them.
the extension of deschutes road and the improvement of the interchange are to meet cumulative traffic conditions for the year as the area develops.in light of the assumptions that pleasant hills drive will be constructed,rhonda road realigned,deschutes road extended,and the interchange improved,the eir concludes that the cumulative impacts of the project on traffic conditions will be less than significant.
when future traffic congestion will result from the cumulative impact of several projects,cumulative traffic mitigation measures for a single project that is one of the several projects may be deemed sufficient if those measures are based on a reasonable plan of actual mitigation that the relevant agency commits itself to implementing.see napa citizens for honest government napa county bd.of supervisors th,d napa citizens save our peninsula committee monterey county bd.of supervisors th,d save our peninsula sacramento old city city council d.sacramento old city federation of hillside,supra,th at,d.as we shall explain,with respect to the deschutes extension here,city has satisfied this test regarding the project.
in an addendum to a city staff report,city consultants noted that future commercial development on the westlake property just north of the store is likely,especially over a period of time,and therefore the deschutes road extension to serve that and other future development,together with the project was included in the year conditions.in the final eir,city noted the extension of deschutes road also known as factory outlets drive is identified in the westlake commercial subdivision map adjacent to the north of the project city has identified the need for this extension and has conducted two traffic studies dependent upon it and city will require the extension as a condition of further development in the area.in the subsequent city staff report referred to ante,city additionally noted that a subdivision agreement ensuring construction of this extension has been included as condition to the conditional use permit and condition to the tentative parcel map for the westlake development.this satisfies the sufficiency test for cumulative traffic mitigation measures related to a single project the measures are based on a reasonable plan of actual mitigation that the relevant agency has committed itself to implementing.
that leaves the interchange,also identified in the eir as a year traffic impact.as a mitigation measure for the project contribution to this impact,city has imposed on the project a fair share mitigation fee to pay for improvements to the interchange.city has estimated the cost of improvements for the interchange at approximately million,with approximately million attributable to phase i of the improvement.based on the project estimated trips,the mitigation measure specifies that the project must pay percent of the phase i cost,or based on construction costs as of july.
a single project contribution to a cumulative impact is deemed less than significant if the project is required to implement or fund its fair share of a mitigation measure designed to alleviate the cumulative impact.guidelines,subd.a.mitigation programs for cumulative traffic on fair contributions by individual been found to be adequate mitigation measures under ceqa.save our peninsula,supra,th at,d.to be adequate,these mitigation fees,in line with the principle discussed above,must be part of a reasonable plan of actual mitigation that the relevant agency commits itself to implementing.id.at,d.
here,there is no serious dispute regarding the current cost estimates for the improvements to the interchange or the project percentage contribution to those improvements.however,the project percent of the estimated phase i cost of million for the improvements is,rather than the fee specified in the mitigation measure.
furthermore,the mitigation measure specifies as pertinent that the project will pay the impact fee to city to participate in the program to provide improvements at the interchange at deschutes and interstate.the mitigation measure is vague regarding the program to provide those improvements in staff reports,city states it is preparing an update to the traffic impact fee program to include the interchange improvements,and notes that condition requires payment of the impact fee.
to be sufficient under ceqa,this mitigation fee measure must specify an amount of which is currently based on july construction costs,and note the amount is for phase i only specify that the project will also pay percent of the remaining reasonable costs of the improvements and make these fees part of a reasonable,enforceable plan or program that is sufficiently tied to the actual mitigation of the traffic impacts at issue we realize city does not have total control over the improvements to the interchange caltrans has an important part to play as well.see federation of hillside,supra,th at,d,citing ceqa,subds.a,b guidelines,subd.b as relevant here,ceqa requires a lead agency to find,based on substantial evidence,that the mitigation measures are required in,or incorporated into,the project the agency shall also provide that measures to mitigate or avoid significant effects on the environment are fully enforceable through permit conditions,agreements,or other measures,and the agency must adopt a monitoring program to ensure that the mitigation measures are implemented federation of hillside,supra,th at,d.
the trial court denied the coalition petition for writ of mandate on the issue of whether the assumed improvements to the interchange encompassing here the project contribution toward those improvements were too speculative to be deemed an adequate mitigation measure for this cumulative impact.the trial court reasoned that substantial evidence supported the eir conclusion that the project cumulative impacts on traffic would be less than significant therefore,the court did not have to consider whether the project mitigation fee for the improvements was an appropriate or reasonable mitigation measure,as there was no significant cumulative impact to mitigate.
the trial court erred in this respect,and we shall reverse the judgment on this point.as noted,the eir concluded that the project cumulative impacts on traffic would be less than significant because it assumed,among other things,that the interchange would be improved the mitigation fee is the project contribution toward that improvement.therefore,we have had to consider the coalition claim that the in
