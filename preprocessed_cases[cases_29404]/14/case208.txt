plaintiff joy davis appeals the district court grant of summary judgment to venture one construction,venture one on her claim for injuries sustained when,during a remodeling of her employer premises,a door,temporarily removed and stored outside of the construction zone,fell on her because it was stored upright and where,if placed there at all,it should have been laid on its side at an angle.because the district court erred in concluding that defendant had no duty to plaintiff,we reverse and remand for further proceedings.
davis worked at a pilot travel center in monroe county,michigan.pilot had contracted with venture one to remodel certain areas within the pilot facility.the primary purpose of the contract was to relocate a subway sandwich shop within the travel center.while construction was taking place,an original door was unhinged,removed,and leaned upright against a wall in a backroom outside of the construction zone.unhinged doors should have been stored outside near the dumpster so as to be away from pilot employees and members of the general public.
james blank,proprietor of jdb design,a subcontractor of venture one which performed finishing work on the remodeling job,testified in a deposition that he and one of his employees moved the unhinged door and leaned it in the backroom.he testified that he did not move it out to the dumpster storage area because it was to be used at a later time and that brian ellis,the venture one superintendent on the remodeling project,was aware that the door was stored there.
ellis swore in an affidavit that neither he nor any venture one employee removed the door in question and stored it in the cooler area in the backroom.he further testified that he had no knowledge of the door being leaned in that way,but there is a factual dispute regarding his knowledge.ellis also testified that if he had seen a door propped vertically against an interior wall,he would have recognized it as a hazard and would have required someone to move it.greg kovach,president of venture one,testified that ellis,in his role as construction manager,was tasked with remedying hazards outside of the construction zone.sherlyn rice,the subway manager at that pilot location,testified that ellis in fact entered the backroom all the time and failed to remedy the leaned door whose method of temporary storage he could not have failed to observe.
remodeling work began on november.rice testified that the door was removed and placed in the backroom on the first day of the remodeling job.on november,davis went into the backroom to retrieve a dustpan and broom when the door fell on her back,causing her injuries.
relying on michigan law in this diversity case,and especially on fultz,the district court held venture one had no duties toward davis arising from its contract with her employer.the district court recognized,quoting fultz,at,that the threshold question is whether the defendant owed a duty to the plaintiff that is separate and distinct from the defendant contractual obligations.if no independent duty exists,no tort action based on contract will lie.the district court acknowledged davis argument that while performing its contractual duties under the construction contract,defendant created a new hazard when it allowed,for an extended period of time,the presence of an unsecured door outside the construction zone and,relatedly,when its site superintendent,brian ellis,failed to move the unsecured door to a proper storage location despite being asked to do so.
the district court ruled against davis,holding that the door was not a new hazard because the plain language of the construction contract imposed the duty to initiate,maintain,and supervise construction including precautions for safety,and davis had not shown that a duty is owed to her independent of the contract,as illustrated in bertz norfolk southern railway,wl july.the district court explained that the construction contract contemplated the hazard and this case represents a failure to carry out a contractual duty,as in fultz,which does not give rise to a separate and distinct duty.combining these two considerations,the district court emphasized that venture one failure to adequately initiate,maintain,and supervise safety measures during construction at the pilot travel work site was a failure to provide the duties required by the contract in its contemplation of hazards.
the contract,in relevant part,states 
safety precautions and programs 
the contractor shall be responsible for initiating,maintaining and supervising all safety precautions and programs in connection with the performance of the contract.
safety of persons and property 
the contractor shall take reasonable precautions for safety of,and shall provide reasonable protection to prevent damage,injury or loss to 
employees on the work and other persons who may be affected thereby 
the contractor shall designate a responsible member of the contractor organization at the site whose duty shall be the prevention of accidents.this person shall be the contractor superintendent unless otherwise designated by the contractor in writing to the owner and architect.
the district court used this language from the contract to emphasize venture one duties to pilot to supervise the safety aspects of the job.per fultz,the failure to perform a job does not create a new hazard,it merely leaves alone existing hazards or allows contemplated hazards to manifest themselves.the district court phrased its discussion of venture one actions in terms of what it did not contractual duties of prevention and supervision it did not carry out.
a premises owner and a contractor enter into a contract,and a third party is injured on the premises of the premises owner.the fundamental question at issue here is under what circumstances does a duty of care arise between the contractor and the third party the michigan supreme court believe s that the slippery distinction between misfeasance and nonfeasance of a duty undertaken obscures the proper initial inquiry whether a particular defendant owes any duty at all to a particular plaintiff.fultz,at.rather,the separate and distinct definition of misfeasance offers better guidance in determining whether a negligence action based on a contract and brought by a third party to that contract may lie because it focuses on the threshold question of duty in a negligence claim.id.t he threshold question is whether the defendant owed a duty to the plaintiff that is separate and distinct from the defendant contractual obligations.id.italics supplied.
a seminal opinion on duty by judge cardozo explains when a duty of care arises to a third party.o ne who assumes to act,even though gratuitously,may thereby become subject to the duty of acting carefully,if he acts at all.moch rensselaer water,quoting glanzer shepard.the formula of the relevant distinction as one between misfeasance and nonfeasance is incomplete,and so at times misleading.id.instead,the query to determine whether a duty arises to a third party always is whether the putative wrongdoer has advanced to such a point as to have launched a force or instrument of harm,or has stopped where inaction is at most a refusal to become an instrument for good.id.
while time and physical proximity separate these decisions,they share the same analytic tradition.the court in fultz looked at hart ludwig,which cited and borrowed heavily from,at discussing moch and borrowing the example of the surgeon who failed to sterilize his instruments quoted by the court in fultz.rinaldo construction corporation michigan bell telephone company,ferrett general motors corporation,and sherman sea ray boats,incorporated,recognized by the court in fultz as the authorities supporting the definition of a tort action stemming from misfeasance of a contractual obligation as the violation of a legal duty separate and distinct from the contractual obligation,at,all acknowledge hart as the original source of law for the separate and distinct test for duty in this context.sherman,at ferrett,at rinaldo,at.
the rule in hart,adopted and applied in fultz,is summarized simply the defendant failure to complet
