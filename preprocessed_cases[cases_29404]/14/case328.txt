dmi is a construction equipment dealer in south dakota.leeboy manufactures several models of pavers and other equipment.in november,leeboy entered a dealership agreement with dmi giving the latter exclusive rights to sell leeboy products throughout south dakota as well as seven counties in minnesota.initially effective through december,the agreement provided it would thereafter automatically renew for successive one year terms.dmi app.at.the agreement also indicated either party could terminate the agreement with advance written notice of termination at least sixty days or longer if required by the laws of the state where your principal office is located prior to the end of the then current term.id.the agreement further provided 
some states have laws that give you certain rights which may vary from,or are in addition to,those found in this agreement.if your principal place of business is located in one of those states,this agreement is amended to the fullest extent necessary to provide you those rights.
this provision resulted from dmi request to modify the initial draft of the agreement,which had provided north carolina law would govern.dmi wanted the benefit of the south dakota dealer protection act sddpa,which it understood to permit termination of the agreement only if dmi justly provoked leeboy through misconduct.see codified laws prohibiting a manufacturer or distributor from canceling a dealer franchise unfairly and without just provocation groseth int l,tenneco,holding just provocation under requires some sort of misconduct or shortcoming on the part of the dealer.
after entering the agreement,dmi took its obligation to leeboy seriously.dmi likened its relationships with the manufacturers whose lines it carried to a marriage,putting the goodwill it had built with its customers on the line when promoting products.dmi trained its sales and service employees on leeboy products and procedures.tim jenkins,leeboy manufacturer representative for the territory which included south dakota,presented sales training sessions to dmi sales people and traveled with various dmi salesmen on customer calls to promote leeboy products.leeboy literature was disseminated to dmi sales people,and dmi sales people studied the leeboy product and procedures manual.dmi also both its sioux falls and rapid city parts leeboy recommended for stocking.
dmi advertised leeboy products.leeboy provided dmi with a canvas sign or poster approximately x displaying the leeboy logo,which dmi placed in its dealership lobby.dmi advertised leeboy products on its internet website,in its dmi product support report a monthly publication indicating dmi current inventory,and in the dmi difference magazine a publication sent to about dmi customers and potential customers.dmi displayed product brochures for leeboy equipment in the lobbies of both its sioux falls and rapid city branches.dmi sales manager also prepared an advertising flyer specifically to promote the leeboy force feed loader referred to in south dakota as a snow loader,which leeboy sent to all of its customers along with leeboy own product brochure.
dmi purchased two pavers from leeboy within the first six months of the franchise period.dmi ordered the first paver in march of and purchased it in june of.dmi leased this paver for three months to bowes construction in brookings,south dakota bowes ultimately purchased the paver in september.dmi purchased a second leeboy paver in may to lease to m s construction in deadwood,south dakota dmi was in the process of stocking a third leeboy paver when leeboy terminated the franchise.
on july,eight months into the agreement,bryce davis of leeboy called dmi president,dan healy,and canceled the franchise agreement.davis initially gave no reason for the termination but leeboy had recently acquired another product line,rosco and planned to use an existing rosco dealer network to sell leeboy products on july,when leeboy confirmed dmi termination in writing,it referred to its acquisition of rosco as the sole reason for the termination,indicating t he consolidation of dealers has resulted in the cancellation of your leeboy dealer agreement effective july.
leeboy never complained about dmi performance before the termination.there were no problems regarding warranties,credit,sales performance,training,advertising,stocking requirements or quality of service.dmi had not breached the dealer agreement or violated any leeboy program,practice,policy,rule or guideline.in fact,dmi performed significantly better than leeboy previous south dakota dealer,who had no sales of leeboy pavers in the five years before dmi franchise.leeboy admitted dmi had not breached or violated the dealership agreement prior to the termination,and that the sole reason for the termination was leeboy acquisition of rosco.
as it turned out,dmi was just one of several dealer agreements across the country leeboy terminated due to its acquisition of rosco.at trial,dmi presented evidence,and argued,that leeboy dealer terminations were consistent with a corporate strategy of growth through acquisition.leeboy was acquired by an investment bank,first islamic bank,and its,in january.after the acquisition,leeboy became a portfolio company of crescent capital investments,an company owned by a first islamic subsidiary,whose function it was to evaluate potential acquisitions for first islamic and provide management and oversight services to portfolio companies.crescent capital advised first islamic on the latter acquisition of leeboy,and in turn advised leeboy on its acquisition of rosco.following crescent advice,leeboy developed a plan for growing the company both organically and through acquisitions.leeboy expected its acquisition of rosco to lead to a lot of synergies between the two companies in both the distribution channel as well as the product channel,that is,leeboy could expand to new areas covered by existing rosco dealers,and vice versa.some areas,however,already had both rosco and leeboy dealers.leeboy plan required it to terminate some leeboy dealers in those areas that overlapped with an existing rosco dealer.
dmi evidence showed leeboy put its corporate interests first during the rosco acquisition,and disregarded the contractual and statutory rights of some existing dealers.for example,ed underwood,crescent capital executive director and a leeboy board member,knew dealers were protected by various state laws,but ignored the issue when leeboy board discussed dealer terminations,indicating the issue of how to handle territories with both leeboy and rosco dealers was not on our list the discussion of dealer termination was very limited.they were being consolidated,period.indeed,with respect to dmi,underwood said south dakota was not big on my map.kelly majeski,leeboy vice president,knew dmi termination might violate the law but chose not to seek legal advice before going forward with the termination.pat labriola,leeboy president and ceo,admitted he was aware of state laws that protect dealers,but did not review those laws indicating t hat what i hire lawyers for.there was no evidence,however,labriola bothered to consult with lawyers before terminating dmi.bryce davis,who made the phone calls to cancel at least ten dealers,acknowledged several got upset and threatened litigation,with some specifically referring to state laws protecting them from cancellation.undeterred,leeboy plowed ahead with its consolidation plans.
a week after dmi termination,dmi attorney contacted leeboy by letter.the letter referred to the sddpa prohibition against canceling a dealer franchise without just provocation,claimed the termination would cause dmi significant damage,offered to settle the dispute for,and promised litigation if leeboy did not respond to the settlement offer by august.dmi attorney also referred to a previous suit dmi brought against for wrongful termination of dmi franchise,and enclosed for review by your law department a copy of an order entered in that case which resolved some preliminary issues in dmi favor.
when leeboy did not respond by august,dmi filed this suit.in relevant part,dmi complaint alleged leeboy termination was unfair and without just provocation in violation of the sddpa.the complaint prayed for damages for loss of business profits,loss of goodwill and reputation in the community,and loss of dmi investments in training,educating,and employing personnel to sell,promote and service leeboy products.in addition,dmi alleged leeboy statutory violations and other wrongful conduct justified punitive damages.
leeboy initial response to dmi lawsuit suggests it did not take the suit seriously.leeboy referred to some of dmi claims as spurious and contended dmi was seriously overstat ing its damages and prospects of success.a short exchange of letters took place between leeboy and dmi discussing settlement of the pending suit.in the last letter dated september,leeboy continued to maintain dmi claims had no legal or factual basis,and claimed for the first time dmi productivity fell far short of leeboy expectation.nevertheless,because dmi had expressed concern over the termination,leeboy said it was prepared to dmi as its exclusive dealer pursuant to a mutually acceptable dealer agreement that complies with south dakota law and offered to forward a copy of a proposed agreement.dmi refused the reinstatement offer and proceeded with its lawsuit.
prior to trial,dmi moved for partial summary judgment on liability,contending leeboy termination was without just provocation and violated the sddpa as a matter of law.the district court agreed and granted dmi motion.the case proceeded to a jury trial on the issue of damages.the jury awarded dmi lost profit damages of,and punitive damages of million.leeboy filed a motion for judgment as a matter of law jaml,or in the alternative,for a new trial or remittitur of the damages.the district court denied the motions in large part,but remitted the punitive damage award to million.diesel,d at.leeboy filed a timely appeal.
a.the franchise of any dealer 
leeboy first contends the district court erred in granting dmi partial summary judgment on liability because the agreement between leeboy and dmi was not the franchise of any dealer within the meaning of the sddpa.see codified laws it is a class misdemeanor for any manufacturer unfairly,without due regard to the equities of the dealer and without just provocation,to cancel the franchise of any dealer.leeboy contends the sddpa only protects dealers who are subject to economic coercion by a manufacturer,dealers who make a substantial financial investment as part of their agreement with a manufacturer.leeboy claims dmi investment in leeboy was not significant enough to trigger the sddpa,given the fact dmi is a relatively large dealer and sells many other product lines.
leeboy interpretation of the sddpa is based upon an unpublished district court decision.see agee agric.equip.sales superior trail king,no.civ,wl,at,aff,cir unpublished table disposition.in agee,rodney agee and ralph hefter,two salesmen who operated out of their homes in california and florida,contracted with trail king,a south dakota manufacturer of agricultural and commercial trailers,to establish trail king dealerships in their geographic areas agee in california,nevada,and arizona hefter in florida,georgia,north and south carolina.neither agee or hefter maintained a significant amount of trail king inventory.
the agee district court determined agee and hefter were really manufacturer representatives rather than dealers.id.at.the court interpreted the sddpa to apply only to dealers that maintain a stock of parts or complete or whole machines.id.at.the court relied in part upon the wisconsin supreme court interpretation of wisconsin fair dealership law in foerster,atlas metal parts,for the proposition the law was meant to protect only those small businessmen who make a substantial financial investment in inventory,physical facilities,or good will as a part of their association with the grantor of the dealership.agee,wl,at quoting foerster,at.
leeboy requests us to adopt the agee district court limited definition of dealer because we affirmed the judgment in agee.leeboy reliance upon our affirmance is misplaced.we did not issue an opinion in agee,and therefore expressed no opinion on the district court interpretation of the sddpa.when we affirm the judgment in a case without issuing an opinion,our affirmance has no precedential effect and can not be read as necessarily approving of the district court reasoning.see.state bd.of elections socialist workers party,d a summary disposition affirms only the judgment of the court below.fusari steinberg,d burger,concurring when we summarily affirm,without opinion we affirm the judgment but not necessarily the reasoning by which it was reached.we therefore review this issue on a clean slate.
to determine whether the sddpa only protects dealers who have made a substantial financial investment as part of their agreement with a manufacturer,we look first look to the language of the statute itself.paracelsus healthcare philips med,nederland,cir.if the statutory language is unambiguous,our analysis need go no further and we simply apply the plain language of the statute.id.
the sddpa prohibits a manufacturer or distributor from unfairly canceling the franchise of any dealer.codified laws.when leeboy and dmi entered the dealership agreement in november the words franchise and dealer were undefined in the statute,and thus those words are to be understood in their ordinary sense.codified laws.the ordinary meaning of franchise is the sole right granted by the owner of a trademark or tradename to engage in business or to sell a good or service in a certain area.black law dictionary ed.a dealer is one who purchases goods or property for sale to others a retailer.id.at.
construing the plain language of the statute,we reject leeboy claim dmi was not a dealer covered by the sddpa.the november agreement clearly granted dmi a franchise as that term is ordinarily understood,and dmi was clearly a dealer as that term is ordinarily understood.the sddpa applies to the franchise of any dealer,and does not limit its application to dealers who maintain a significant inventory of a manufacturer products,or to dealers who make a substantial investment as part of their agreement with a manufacturer.
our conclusion is buttressed by a amendment to the sddpa.the amendment expressly defines dealer to mean 
any person,or the person successor who,for commission or with intent to make a profit or gain,sells,exchanges,rents,leases with the option to purchase,or offers or attempts to negotiate a sale or exchange any merchandise as defined by this chapter,or who is engaged wholly or in part in the business of selling any such merchandise.
codified laws.during the legislative hearings,the bill sponsor,state representative claire konold,repeatedly emphasized the changes to the sddpa were not intended to be substantive,but to clarify the existing statute.see hearing on before the house comm.on commerce,legislative sess,this rewrite does not change our current law it is a step in clarifying existing law.hearing on before the full house,legislative sess,this bill does not change any part of current law i assure you there is no change in current law.hearing on before the senate comm.on commerce,legislative sess,the bill does not,and i repeat,it does not change our law in any,bad,or indifferent.
subsequent legislation declaring the intent of an earlier statute is entitled to great weight in statutory construction.red lion broadcasting,d.the legislative history leaves no doubt the amendment merely clarified the meaning of dealer under the version of the statute.dmi clearly satisfies the definition of dealer under the amended version of the statute.thus,we conclude the sddpa applies to the november agreement between leeboy and dmi 
just provocation 
leeboy next contends the district court erred in granting summary judgment on liability because the court should have submitted the issue of just provocation to the jury.we disagree.although the question whether a termination is done unfairly and without just provocation is ordinarily a question of fact,the court function in addressing a summary judgment motion is to determine whether a dispute about a material fact is genuine,that is,whether a reasonable jury could return a verdict for the nonmoving party based on the evidence.quick donaldson,cir.the basic inquiry is whether the evidence presents a sufficient disagreement to require submission to a jury or whether it is so that one party must prevail as a matter of law.id.at quoting anderson liberty lobby,d.
under south dakota law,just provocation requires some sort of misconduct or shortcoming on the part of the dealer.groseth,at.leeboy admitted its sole reason for terminating dmi was the acquisition of rosco.leeboy further admitted it had never complained about dmi performance before the termination occurred,and dmi had not breached the dealer agreement or violated any leeboy program,practice,policy,rule or guideline.thus,there was simply no evidence the termination decision resulted from any misconduct or shortcomings on dmi part.the district court correctly determined leeboy failed to present a genuine factual dispute about whether the termination was justly provoked.
reinstatement offer 
next,leeboy contends dmi failed to mitigate its damages by unreasonably refusing an unconditional offer of reinstatement.leeboy moved for jaml on this ground,which the district court denied.we review de novo the district court denial of a motion for jaml,using the same standard as the district court,that is,the evidence is viewed in the light most favorable to the prevailing party and the court can not weigh or evaluate the evidence or consider questions of credibility.smith chase group,cir.a grant of jaml is proper only if the evidence viewed according to this standard would not permit reasonable jurors to differ as to the conclusions that could be drawn.id.quoting dace acf,cir.
the district court denied leeboy motion for jaml in part because dmi presented credible testimony that it did not know exactly what the reinstatement offer from leeboy would involve.diesel,d at.this alone was a sufficient reason to deny jaml.leeboy had the burden of proving it made an offer of reinstatement,and that dmi rejection of it was objectively unreasonable.smith world ins,cir.in order for an offer of reinstatement to completely terminate a plaintiffs right to damages,the offer must be unconditional.ford motor equal opportunity comm n,d.dmi did not know exactly what the offer involved because it was not an unconditional offer.the offer was made in the last of an exchange of letters between leeboy and dmi discussing settlement of dmi pending suit,and thus dmi reasonably thought the offer was tied to settling the suit.dmi had no obligation to accept an offer which required it to compromise its claims against leeboy.see id.at.the claimant obligation to minimize damages in order to retain his right to compensation does not require him to settle his claim in whole or in part.
furthermore,leeboy said it was prepared to dmi as its exclusive dealer pursuant to a mutually acceptable dealer agreement that complies with south dakota law i f this is acceptable we will forward a copy of a proposed agreement.thus,leeboy offer was conditioned upon the parties ability to reach a new dealer agreement.dmi did not know what leeboy would consider mutually acceptable.if the offer was truly unconditional,leeboy would have offered to reinstate the existing contract and there would have been no need to negotiate a new mutually acceptable contract.
the district court also noted the evidence showed 
dmi officers did not believe the offer was sincere,in part because,at the same time it made the offer,leeboy said,for the first time,that dmi sales performance fell short of leeboy expectations.dmi officers thought leeboy would terminate the relationship again shortly after reinstatement resulting in loss of customer confidence in dmi pat healy also testified about problems caused by a loss of trust in the relationship between a manufacturer and a dealer.
diesel,d at.in addition,at the same time it offered to negotiate a new contract with dmi,leeboy continued to go forward with preparations to have evans act as its south dakota paver dealer.even if leeboy offer had been unconditional,this was sufficient evidence upon which to submit to the jury the question whether dmi acted reasonably in rejecting the reinstatement offer.leeboy did not object to the mitigation instructions given by the district court,and the jury determined leeboy failed to prove dmi unreasonably rejected the offer.reasonable jurors could differ as to dmi reasonableness under these circumstances.thus,we find no error in the district court denial of leeboy motion for jaml.
evidentiary rulings 
leeboy brought a motion for a new trial challenging a number of the district court evidentiary rulings,which the district court denied.we review the evidentiary rulings for an abuse of discretion,jones swanson,cir,keeping in mind a n allegedly erroneous evidentiary ruling does not warrant a new trial unless the evidence was so prejudicial that a new trial would likely produce a different result.harrison purdy.trucking,cir quoting bevan honeywell,cir.
the july demand litigation 
first,leeboy contends the district court abused its discretion by excluding the letter dated july,which referred to dmi suit against and contained an offer to settle for.leeboy contends the letter was relevant to show dmi true motivation in rejecting leeboy reinstatement offer,that dmi believed litigation would be more fruitful than reinstatement.we have concluded leeboy reinstatement offer was conditional,however,meaning its mitigation defense necessarily fails.because leeboy offered the letter in support of its failed mitigation defense,the district court exclusion of the july letter clearly does not warrant a new trial.
even if the mitigation defense was colorable and the reinstatement offer relevant,the letter does not show dmi believed litigation against leeboy would be more fruitful than reinstatement.the letter did not reveal the ultimate outcome of the litigation,nor did it indicate dmi made more money by suing than selling the latter products,or how dmi felt about suing letter merely established the district court ruled in dmi favor on some preliminary legal matters in a previous suit.
furthermore,under federal rule of evidence balancing test,the district court properly concluded the merits of the case would become an issue if the letter were introduced.dmi argued the letter was prejudicial because it made dmi look litigious,entitling it to show the suit was justified,which would have resulted in a trial within a trial that would not have been that helpful to the jury.diesel,d at.the district court was well within its discretion when it excluded the letter.
first islamic bank 
prior to trial,leeboy filed a motion in limine asking the district court not to allow the mention of first islamic name.the trial took place in november,and leeboy argued the jury might harbor bias against islamic interests following the attacks on the world trade center on september.the district court denied the motion in limine,stating 
so the name of first islamic is going to come up,but plaintiff is cautioned it is only to come up in a business like,fair manner,because obviously with some people in the middle east we have had problems,but that does mean that we do with all people.matter of fact,we need their cooperation and support,and we have it in many instances,so i do want the plaintiff to take any advantage of any ill feelings there might be,and i will be quick to sustained sic an objection and give a curative instruction on the spot if you do.so i want everybody to be aware of that.
trial tr.at.
during voir dire,the district court told the venire panel 
t here will be some evidence an entity that has some financial relationship with the defendant is a foreign corporation,and it is a foreign corporation in the middle east,and of course they are entitled to the same treatment as anybody else is i want to find out if anybody here,just because some corporation that is even a party to this lawsuit,just has some relationship to the defendant,is a foreign corporation,is that going to make a difference to you because we should talk about that and both sides are entitled to know that.would that make a difference to anybody,because if so,please raise your hand and we will talk about it.
voir dire tr.at.no veniremember indicated they would treat a foreign corporation differently.id.
our review of the trial exceeds dmi attorney referred to first islamic four times during opening statement,twice during examination of witnesses,and once during closing argument.first islamic was also referred to several times when both dmi and leeboy read into the record portions of the deposition of ed underwood,crescent capital executive director.the district court reviewed underwood deposition and ruled on objections made therein before it denied leeboy motion in limine.the district court concluded in its order t he name was used in a,fair manner and leeboy has not shown that any references to first islamic bank appealed to any claimed bias of the jury.diesel,d at.
leeboy never objected at trial to the few references to first islamic and even introduced its own evidence referring to first islamic by name,thus failing to preserve any claim of evidentiary error,except for plain error review.see peerless united states,cir w hen a motion to exclude evidence is made in limine and is overruled,if the evidence is thereafter admitted at trial without objection,the error,if any,has not been preserved for appeal.quoting huff heckendorn,cir in turn quoting starr hacker,cir doe ex rel.doe guard,cir reviewing evidentiary issue for plain error where party failed to object at trial after district court denied its motion in limine.we follow this rule because 
motions in limine are frequently made in the abstract and in anticipation of some hypothetical circumstance that may not develop at trial thus,a party whose motion in limine has been overruled must object when the error he sought to prevent with his motion is about to occur at trial.this will give the trial court an opportunity to reconsider the grounds of the motion in light of the of the at trial.
huff,at quoting collins wayne,cir citations omitted.
plain error is a stringently limited standard of review,especially in the civil context.horstmyer black decker,u,cir internal quotation and citation omitted.at a minimum,an unpreserved error in the civil context must meet the olano standard to warrant correction.wiser wayne farms,cir.leeboy alleged claim of error clearly does not satisfy olano stringent plain error standard.olano requires a party to show an obvious error affected its substantial rights and seriously affected the fairness,integrity,or public reputation of judicial proceedings.id.at.there is simply no evidence the jurors harbored a bias against first islamic bank,or that dmi attorney tried to appeal to any claimed bias against foreign interests.
leeboy also claims dmi attorney appealed to the jurors claimed bias against first islamic during closing argument by asking the jurors a rhetorical question h ow do you get a message from here all the way over to the powers that be leeboy failed to object to this statement during argument,and thus our review is limited to plain error review.crump versa products,cir.we see no plain error.leeboy only speculates this statement referred to first islamic rather than leeboy we reiterate there is no evidence the jurors harbored a bias against first islamic bank.
present value discount rate 
next,leeboy contends the district court abused its discretion when it struck from the record certain testimony offered by one of leeboy expert witnesses,bruce burton,on damages.when discussing the concept of reducing damages to their present value,burton used a present value discount rate of.he arrived at by using a analysis.as the district court explained,f irst he determined the interest rate or return that dmi could reasonably be expected to receive on an investment of the payment.next he increased that interest discount rate by an amount he determined by considering the risks and uncertainties associated with dmi cash flow.diesel,d at.in other words,burton added the second step of discount to reflect the increased risk of a lump sum award back into an ongoing business rather than into more traditional investments.
the district court initially allowed burton testimony,but subsequently struck the second step analysis,concluding it conflicted with south dakota law on present value reduction.the district court noted south dakota pattern jury instruction on reducing damages to present value requires the reduction to reflect the interest rate or return which such plaintiff could reasonably be expected to receive on an investment of the,but does not require a business to invest a lump sum obtained in a lawsuit back into the business,id.at.in addition,the district court excluded the testimony on the grounds it would be confusing to the jury.
leeboy contends burton opinion and discount rate calculations were proper under south dakota law,and the district court exclusion of the evidence was doubly damaging to striking the testimony on the discount rate and issuing a corrective instruction right in the middle of burton testimony,leeboy claims the district court essentially nullified burton testimony as a whole.dmi counters the district court correctly held burton methodology conflicted with south dakota law.
the reduction of damages to present value is not governed by statute in south dakota,but by the common law.the leading south dakota case on the issue is howard sanborn,which adopted a virtually investment rate modeled after minnesota,iowa,and federal law.howard adopted a model instruction using a investment rate that would have tables or some other helpful means for the jury to reduce present value.id.at.leeboy contends,however,howard provides two alternate methods of discounting to present using the model instruction,and the other providing an expert to reduce the damages for the jury.id.thus,leeboy contends it could properly offer burton opinion on present value for the jury consideration,including his discount to reflect reinvestment in a business.leeboy also argues howard dealt with future damages for an individual,and thus does not rule out using the methodology burton used in the case of future damages for a business.
the district court did not abuse its discretion in striking the testimony.there is a difference between discounting to present value damages awarded in a lawsuit,and discounting to present value the value of a business based on a future stream of lost profits.although burton methodology is recognized as a sound way to calculate the latter,that was not the issue here.burton attempted to use the method for a different purpose,that is,to explain to the jury how to discount to present value damages it may award in its verdict.we agree south dakota law does not require dmi to reinvest its award back into its business.it was within the district court discretion to use the model instruction approach approved in howard,rather than allow an expert to reduce the damages for the jury.because the district court chose to give the model instruction,we agree the second step of burton analysis conflicted with the instruction and would have been confusing to the jury 
lost profits testimony 
next,leeboy claims the district court abused its discretion in allowing one of dmi owners,dan healy,to present testimony on lost profits.we disagree.a business owner testimony is sufficient to support an award of lost profits.see pullman land,cir applying south dakota law see also olson aldren.
leeboy further attacks a number of specific items healy testified to,such as his estimate on dmi grow
