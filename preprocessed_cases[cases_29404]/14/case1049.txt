this insurance coverage dispute arises from separate railroad crossing accidents during a road construction project.two wrongful death actions were filed as a result.these actions were settled but a dispute over coverage under two insurance policies remains.pacific insurance company pacific,in its own right and as assignee of consolidated rail corporation conrail,appeals from the superior court grant of summary judgment in favor of liberty mutual insurance company liberty and conrail with respect to the insurers duties to defend 
pacific makes two arguments on appeal.first,it asserts that the superior court erred in holding that liberty does not owe a duty to defend conrail in the wrongful death actions as an additional insured under the liberty primary commercial general liability policies.second,it contends that the superior court erred in holding that pacific has a duty to defend conrail under its railroad force account insurance policy.we conclude that both liberty and pacific owe a duty to defend conrail under their respective policies.accordingly,we affirm in part,reverse in part,and remand for further proceedings consistent with this opinion.
in august,the delaware department of transportation deldot informed conrail that deldot would be widening and improving state route the route project.the route project included widening,reconfiguring,and resurfacing of portions of route,including a portion of route that crossed a section of railroad tracks owned and operated by conrail the delmarva secondary track,or the delmarva secondary in mount pleasant,delaware the pleasant crossing.james julian,julian was awarded the contract for the route project the contract.
deldot informed conrail that as part of the route project,the pleasant crossing would have to be improved the crossing project and instructed conrail to prepare estimates for constructing the required improvements.after deldot approved conrail estimate for the crossing project,deldot and conrail entered into a contract the contract,which,among other things,mandated that all contractors working on projects involving conrail grade crossings obtain liability insurance required under federal and state law.
the contract and the policies julian purchased from liberty 
specifically,the contract required julian to purchase three insurance policies contractor public liability insurance which covered julian operations contractor protective public liability insurance which covered julian subcontractors operations and railroad protective public liability insurance rppli which covered conrail against any liability arising out of julian construction activities at or near the pleasant crossing julian purchased two successive commercial policies from liberty the liberty policies,which covered julian liability for personal injury arising out of julian participation in the route project julian did not,however,purchase rppli as the contract required 
the liberty policies obligate liberty to pay those sums that the insured becomes legally obligated to pay as damages because of bodily injury or property damage to which this insurance applies.liberty will have the right and duty to defend any suit seeking those damages.coverage applies to bodily injury or property damage,but only if the bodily injury or property damage is caused by an occurrence that takes place in the coverage territory and during the policy period the liberty policies also contain an additional additional insured clause,which provides 
who is an insured is amended to include as an insured any person or organization for whom you have agreed in writing to provide liability insurance,but only with respect to liability arising out of your operations or premises owned by or rented to you.
this insurance does not apply to any person or organization for whom you have procured separate liability insurance while such insurance is in effect,regardless of whether the scope of coverage or limits of insurance of this policy exceed those of such other insurance or whether such insurance is valid and collectible 
the contract and the policies conrail purchased from pacific 
the contract required conrail to be covered by a railroad force account insurance policy,which would insure conrail for liability for bodily injury arising out of work performed at the pleasant crossing by conrail forces during the crossing project.conrail purchased this force account insurance from pacific the pacific force account policy.the pacific force account policy provides coverage of million per incident 
pacific will pay on behalf of the insured for ultimate net loss which the insured must legally pay as compensatory damages and defense expenses,because of bodily injury,which this insurance applies which results from an incident which commences during the applicable policy period,arising out of or resulting from the force account work conducted by the named insured 
force account work is defined as work or operations performed by employees of the named insured conrail for federal,state,municipal or other political subdivisions or governmental legal entities or for companies,wherein the named insured is reimbursed for the cost of such work or operations 
the accidents and the wrongful death actions 
during the course of construction of the route project and the crossing project,two separate accidents occurred which resulted in deaths at the pleasant crossing.on may,bruce flowers was driving eastbound on route when his car collided with a southbound conrail freight train.on july,lynn saunders and her passengers,lori white and kathryn fydenkevez,were traveling westbound on route and collided with a northbound conrail freight train at the pleasant crossing.both flowers and saunders and her passengers died from their injuries.the estates and survivors of all decedents filed separate wrongful death and survivorship actions against julian and conrail the flowers and fydenkevez complaints or the complaints.
the flowers and fydenkevez complaints were filed on january,both alleged that julian,its agents,servants,and employees were negligent in the major repairs of the route project,creating a dangerous condition which they failed to eliminate,thereby proximately causing the death of the aforementioned individuals.among other things,the complaints alleged that julian was negligent in failing to post adequate warning signs and signals,obstructing warning signs and signals designed to notify highway users of the pleasant crossing and oncoming trains,removing such signs and signals,failing to employ a flagman,and failing to warn of the dangerous condition of its work site and the pleasant crossing 
the flowers and fydenkevez complaints also alleged negligence claims against conrail.they claimed that conrail knew or should have known that it had created a dangerous condition at the pleasant crossing,failed to warn of this condition properly and adequately,and failed to remedy the condition.they also alleged that conrail was negligent in,among other things,creating a confusing and dangerous condition during the road construction at the pleasant crossing,improperly placing flashing lights,warning signs and other warning signals at the pleasant crossing,failing to post adequate warning devices at the pleasant crossing,and failing to utilize a flagman there 
liberty provided a defense for julian in the wrongful death suits.conrail sought defense and indemnity coverage for the flowers and fydenkevez complaints under the liberty policies,but liberty denied coverage.conrail then sought coverage under the pacific force account policy,which pacific denied.conrail filed a declaratory judgment action in superior court on october,claiming that both liberty and pacific had wrongly refused to defend and indemnify conrail with respect to the flowers and fydenkevez claims.the estates and survivors of the decedents eventually settled their claims against julian and conrail,leaving only conrail claims for contribution and indemnification against liberty and pacific.
the motions for summary judgment in the superior court 
pacific filed two motions for summary judgment in the declaratory judgment action,one seeking a declaration that pacific had no obligation to reimburse conrail for the costs of defending the flowers and fydenkevez actions,and the second to construe the other insurance provisions in the liberty and pacific force account policies.conrail sought summary judgment on the existence and extent of the duties of both liberty and pacific to defend conrail in the flowers and fydenkevez actions.liberty for summary judgment to determine the extent of its obligation to defend indemnify conrail 
the superior court granted partial summary judgment in favor of conrail as to pacific duty to defend conrail.that court found that the work conducted at the pleasant crossing as alleged in the complaints was part of the route project and was work or operations for the state of delaware within the meaning of the pacific force account policy the court also concluded that all of the claims raised were causally connected,in some fashion,to conrail force account work personnel and their duty to protect the public while on site.as a result,the court found it was readily apparent that a causal connection between conrail force account work and the deaths in question had been pled with sufficient particularity so as to obligate pacific to defend conrail the court granted conrail motion for summary judgment and denied pacific motion,holding that pacific had a duty to defend conrail unless and until any claims being pursued were determined to be beyond the coverage of the pacific force account policy 
the superior court also construed the liberty policies to determine whether conrail was an additional insured as defined in the additional insured clause.the superior court found that that clause was unambiguous and that its express terms provided coverage for conrail only with respect to liability arising out of julian operations in interpreting the arising out of provision and concluding that liberty was not required to defend conrail,the superior court reasoned 
if the flowers or fydenkevez complaints had contained allegations that conrail liability was based solely upon julian operations or personnel,conrail would appear to be covered under the plain language and meaning of the policy.the liberty policies would only provide coverage for conrail where conrail could be held responsible via the acts of julian thru julian employees or agents,based upon some legal relationship with julian,agency or respondeat superior.where liability is based upon the acts of conrail by and thru sic conrail agents or employees,conrail would not be an additional insured under the liberty policy.
again,while conrail participation in the route project appears to have been intertwined with julian effort,the alleged negligence of conrail was separate and distinct from the allegations made against julian.it did not arise out of or result from julian operations.each entity was alleged to be at fault in its own way,and the liability of conrail is not premised upon its relationship with julian.liberty is therefore not required to defend or insure conrail for liability which arose out of its own negligence 
in the alternative,the superior court also held that the claims were not covered under the insured contract definition,which it read to exclude injuries or losses taking place with fifty feet of the railroad crossing because the superior court concluded that coverage was not available under the liberty policies,it granted summary judgment for liberty and denied conrail for partial summary judgment.as a result of the court conclusion that pacific alone had a duty to defend,pacific remaining motion to construe the other insurance provisions of the liberty and pacific force account policies was rendered moot 
the superior court granted after additional briefing and argument,the superior court reaffirmed its decision that pacific owed a duty to defend under the pacific force account policy in november,the parties agreed to dismiss with prejudice all claims that were brought,or could have been brought,by or against julian and conrail.pacific reached an agreement providing for,among other things,the assignment to pacific of conrail claims,rights and damages against liberty,including all appellate rights.the parties then moved for,and the superior court issued,a final order,from which this appeal is taken.
ii.discussion 
we review the grant or denial of summary judgment de novo we also exercise de novo review of the conclusions of law made in interpreting insurance contracts a grant of summary judgment can not be sustained where there is a genuine issue of material fact here,the only questions raised on appeal are matters of contract interpretation.the parties agree that delaware law applies to the interpretation of the liberty policies.
in construing an insurer duty to indemnify defend a claim asserted against its insured,a court typically looks to the allegations of the complaint to decide whether the third party action against the insured states a claim covered by the policy,thereby triggering the duty to defend.the test is whether the underlying complaint,read as a whole,alleges a risk within the coverage of the policy determining whether an insurer is bound to defend an action against its insured requires adherence to the following principles where there is some doubt as to whether the complaint against the insured alleges a risk insured against,that doubt should be resolved in favor of the insured any ambiguity in the pleadings should be resolved against the carrier and if even one count or theory alleged in the complaint lies within the policy coverage,the duty to defend arises 
a.the liberty policies require liberty to defend conrail 
pacific first argument raises the question of whether conrail is covered under the additional insured clause of the liberty policies the scope of an insurance policy coverage is prescribed by the language of the policy.the additional insured of the liberty policies has two aspects.the first expands the definition of an insured to include any person or organization for whom julian has agreed in writing to provide liability insurance the second restricts the coverage of an insured to only liability arising out of julian operations.
rppli is liability insurance under the liberty policies 
liberty contends that the first aspect of the additional insured clause is not met that is,in order for pacific to qualify as an additional insured under the policy,julian must have agreed in writing to provide liability insurance to conrail.liberty argues that the contract required julian to purchase rppli,a specific insurance,but not to provide liability insurance to conrail,because the latter term refers only to general liability insurance.liberty reasons that if general liability policies were meant to cover rppli,there would be no reason to procure specific rrpli,which costs an additional premium.
we find that the term liability insurance as it appears in the additional insured clause is unambiguous.we therefore give that term its plain and ordinary meaning which would encompass railroad protective public liability insurance,the species of liability insurance required by the contract but,even if liability insurance were found to be ambiguous and could be read as liberty argues to exclude the agreement to purchase rppli,liberty argument still fails because ambiguities are construed strongly in favor of the insured,not the insurer under the plain language of the contract,julian agreed to obtain rppli in the name of conrail covering any liability arising out of julian construction activities at or near the pleasant crossing.therefore,conrail satisfies the first aspect of the additional insured clause 
arising out of is construed broadly under delaware law 
we turn next to the issue of whether conrail,as an insured under the liberty policies,falls within the second aspect or condition of the additional insured clause that is,whether the coverage conrail seeks is based on liability arising out of julian operations.we agree with the superior court that the language of the additional insured clause is unambiguous and that its plain meaning controls.by its express terms,the liberty policies provide coverage for conrail only with respect to liability arising out of julian operations.thus,our focus must be upon the scope of the term arising out of as defined in the liberty policies.
this court has previously held that,under general insurance contract principles,and consistent with new york law,the term arising out of is one that lends itself to uncomplicated common understanding.specifically,if there is some meaningful linkage between the product and the third party claim,the arising out of language unambiguously applies.cases from other jurisdictions also establish extensive support for a broad construction of that phrase we agree and hold that under delaware law,the term arising out of is broadly construed to require some meaningful linkage between the two conditions imposed in the contract.here,liberty coverage of conrail that is,whether liberty has a duty to defend conrail under the additional insured clause depends on whether there was a meaningful linkage between julian operations and conrail resulting liability in the wrongful death actions.
the complaints alleged that conrail liability arises out of julian operations 
liberty takes the position that the flowers and fydenkevez complaints allege specific acts and omissions against conrail as a result of conrail own work,and not because of julian operations.the superior court reasoned that the only way a meaningful linkage could be established would be if conrail alleged liability was based upon julian operations or personnel under an agency or vicarious liability theory,neither of which were alleged.although that might be one way a meaningful linkage could be established,it is not the only way.
the flowers and fydenkevez complaints alleged,among other things,that julian failed to employ a flagman,and removed and obstructed warning signs and signals at the pleasant crossing.a meaningful linkage between these operations and the claims of negligence brought against conrail can be found in the allegations that conrail had notice and knowledge of the dangerous condition which had been created at the pleasant crossing,yet failed to exercise reasonable care to eliminate it a reasonable inference that can be drawn from these allegations is that i conrail had notice that julian operations had negligently created a dangerous condition at the pleasant crossing,and ii aware of that dangerous condition,conrail had a duty to remedy the condition and for failing to do so,was liable.
conrail notice that a dangerous condition had been created can be inferred,apart from julian operations,from the allegation that conrail permitted trees,bushes,undergrowth and other vegetation to obstruct the view of the railroad tracks from the highway.even if the complaints can be read in two ways,any doubt must be resolved in favor of the insured.because the flowers and fydenkevez complaints can be read as alleging a meaningful linkage between julian operations and conrail resulting liability,the second condition of the additional insured clause is met.because at least one theory alleged in the complaints triggers coverage under the liberty policies,conrail is an insured under the policy,and liberty had a duty to defend conrail 
the insured contract provision does not apply 
the superior court also held,in the alternative,that the flowers and fydenkevez claims were not covered under the liberty policies because coverage for an insured contract excludes injuries or losses that occur within fifty feet of railroad property in relevant part,the liberty policies define insured contract to include t hat part of any other contract or agreement pertaining to your business including an indemnification of a municipality in connection with work performed for a municipality under which you assume the tort liability of another party to pay for bodily injury or property damage to a third person or organization further,an insured contract also does not include that part of any contract or agreement t hat indemnifies any person or organization for bodily injury or property damage arising out of construction or demolition operations,within feet of any railroad property and affecting any railroad bridge or trestle,tracks,tunnel,underpass or crossing.
this analysis is relevant only to an exclusion from coverage for bodily injury claims where the insured obligation to pay damages to a third party is based on the insured assumption of liability in an insured contract and comes into play only where the coverage sought is based on liability assumed under such a contract.here,conrail potential obligation to pay damages is not based on conrail having assumed liability under an insured contract.it is based on claims in the wrongful death actions that conrail was negligent.because the rights asserted by conrail are not based on an insured contract,the superior court denial of coverage predicated on liability arising out of an insured contract was erroneous.
the liberty policies are enforceable 
liberty also argues that a construction in favor of conrail would provide coverage for conrail own negligence in contravention to legislatively defined public policy that precludes contractual indemnification for a party own negligence pacific responds that.applies to construction contracts,not to liability insurance policies issued to insure against losses or damages due to the insured own negligence.in chrysler merrell garaguso,this court addressed a similar issue in determining whether the statutory restriction in,which precludes an owner from requiring a contracting party to indemnify against the indemnitee own negligence,also invalidate s the enforceability of liability insurance purchased for the benefit of the owner.we held while we agree that the requirement to purchase insurance may,under certain circumstances,be unenforceable,we reject the inference that such insurance,once secured,is unenforceable against the issuer of the insurance.further 
t he insurance savings provision reflected in.b is a statement of legislative purpose that can not be negated by an construction of the policy set forth in.a.the savings provision has meaning only if it can not be used as a shield by insurers to decline coverage for insurance once purchased and duly issued to any insured,however identified or designated 
the insurance at issue here was purchased from liberty by julian and is enforceable against liberty.insurance companies are sophisticated entities who can protect their own interests either in refusing to issue additional insured coverage or restricting such coverage with notice to the insured or third parties.consistent with our holding in chrysler,liberty had a duty to defend conrail.the superior court erred in granting summary judgment in favor of liberty.
b.the pacific force account policy requires pacific to defend conrail 
pacific also argues that the superior court erred in holding that pacific owes conrail a duty to defend the wrongful death actions under the pacific force account policy.the parties agree that pennsylvania law governs the interpretation of the pacific force account policy.under pennsylvania law,an insurer is obligated to defend if the factual allegations of the complaint comprehend an injury that is actually or potentially within the scope of the policy as the pennsylvania supreme court has explained,its cases consistently hold that an insurer obligation to defend arises whenever the complaint filed by the injured party may potentially come within the coverage of the policy.when deciding whether a duty to defend exists,the court must compare the allegations in the complaint with the language of the insured policy,construing them together to determine the insurer obligations to the insured the factual allegations of the complaint are taken as true and the complaint should be liberally construed with all doubts as to whether the claims may fall within the coverage of the policy to be resolved in favor of the insured.thus,an insured duty to defend and indemnify an insured in a suit brought by a third party depends upon a determination of whether the third party complaint triggers coverage.w e
