introduction 
this litigation represents a challenge to the construction of a mile,rail system the project from the western portion of oahu through the downtown area of honolulu,hawaii.honolulu has been unsuccessfully struggling to cope with traffic congestion since the.that was when congress passed the urban mass transportation act of,later amended in the federal aid highway act of,which mandated the creation of metropolitan planning boards to develop plans for efficient public transportation.see and.honolulu is now reportedly the congested metropolitan area in the nation.courtney subramanian,top cities with the worst traffic,time may.
in earlier decades,honolulu developed plans for a rail system and later for a bus system that never came to fruition.its efforts are documented in the environmental impact statement eis that was prepared for the project we deal with in this case.a survey in showed broad public support for the concept of a rail system,and in the legislature provided the funding mechanism for such a system.the construction of an elevated,rail system from the university of hawaii campus at manoa,through downtown honolulu,to an agricultural area known as kapolei is now underway.
plaintiffs are a consortium of interest groups and individuals opposing the project.they filed the action in against the federal transit administration fta,the department of transportation dot,the city and county of honolulu,and various federal and local administrators.plaintiffs raise challenges under the national environmental policy act nepa,the national historic preservation act nhpa,to,and section f of the department of transportation act.the litigation reflects the controversies that continue over the method and route of mass transit on oahu.
the district court granted summary judgment to defendants on the nepa claims,the nhpa claims,and all but three of the section f claims,thereby permitting construction to continue on the first three phases.plaintiffs appeal.in addition,the court enjoined construction of the fourth phase of the project pending a remand to the agency on the remaining section f claims.there is no appeal with respect to phase.
we first deal with defendants objection to appellate jurisdiction,and we then affirm on the merits.
ii.background 
federal law requires planning for a federally funded transportation system in order to identify local purposes and stating federal objectives.
on december,the fta published its notice of intent noi to prepare an eis and alternatives analysis aa for transit service in oahu corridor linking kapolei with waikiki and the university of hawaii campus at manoa.an aa is required for federal funding under the department of transportation new starts program.see.the aa process proceeded in three steps.
first,on october,the city prepared an alternatives screening memo identifying the project purpose and need as providing improved mobility in the highly congested transportation corridor providing faster,more reliable public transportation services in the corridor than those currently operating in traffic providing an alternative to private automobile travel improving mobility for travelers improving transportation system reliability and improving transportation equity for all travelers.it identified several alternatives to consider for meeting the city objectives,including no build,a fixed guideway alternative public transportation using a separate,transportation systems management improvements to the existing transportation system,including optimizing bus service,and a managed lanes alternative mla a new roadway for buses and other vehicles,and several others.
second,the city prepared an alternatives analysis report for the honolulu city council.that report evaluated the alternatives that had survived the city screening process,concluding that the transportation systems management alternative would not offer community or environmental benefits.it also identified several concerns with the mla,including the possibility of congestion on local roadways near entrances and exits to managed lanes,project costs and eligibility for federal funding,and integration of managed lanes with transit service.the report concluded that the fixed guideway alternative was the most effective alternative in accommodating longer corridor transit trips and increased work commutes,reducing travel time,and consuming the least energy.
third,the city council formed a transit advisory task force to review the aa and make findings and recommendations to assist the council in the selection of a locally preferred alternative.d a i requiring selection of a locally preferred alternative pursuant to nepa.the city council passed an ordinance in january selecting an elevated fixed guideway system as its preferred alternative,stating that a fixed guideway system is the best selection for the needs and demands of our growing island population.
on march,the fta published a notice of intent to prepare an eis noi.the noi requested public comment on five possible transit technologies light rail,rapid rail,guided,magnetic levitation,and monorail.experts appointed by the city council reviewed responses to that request,as well as twelve responses from transit vehicle manufacturers,and selected as the technology for the project.honolulu voters subsequently approved a city charter amendment establishing such a system.
the city and the fta then prepared a draft eis and a final eis feis.the feis evaluated a no build option and three development alternatives,including a fixed guideway option from ala moana center to kapolei via the airport,that was ultimately selected as the preferred alternative.the feis stated that other alternatives had been eliminated because fixed guideway best met the project purpose and need and because the city council had selected it as the locally preferred alternative pursuant to d a i.
the project proposed route would bring it close to several historic sites.the project thus implicated section f of the department of transportation act,which requires that the use of land of a historic site may be approved only if there is no prudent and feasible alternative to using the land and the project includes all possible planning to minimize harm to the park,recreation area,wildlife and waterfowl refuge,or historic site resulting from the use.c.use is construed broadly,applying not only to areas physically taken,but also to those significantly,adversely affected by the project.adler lewis,cir.
the draft eis for the project had been subject to a public review period that engendered many comments concerning both the chosen system and the impact on historic sites.the feis analyzed more than historic sites as potentially affected.because the mla would have had a lesser impact on historic sites than the alternative chosen for the project,numerous commenters objected to the feis rejection of the mla.
the feis final section f evaluation,relating to historic sites,concluded that most of the sites would not be used or would be subject only to de minimis use.specifically,the feis concluded that the project would use the chinatown historic district and the historic dillingham transportation building,because stations would be constructed on those properties,but would not use mother waldron park because the proximity of the project route to that site would not directly affect its design or public use.
on january,the fta issued a record of decision rod approving the project.the rod included a finding that there is no feasible and prudent alternative to the project use of the chinatown historic district and the dillingham transportation building.the rod also found that the mla failed to meet the project purpose and need because it would not support forecasted population and employment growth and would provide little transit benefit at a high cost.
plaintiffs filed this action on may,seeking to enjoin construction on the ground that the feis and the rod approving the project did not comply with the requirements of nepa,section f,and the regulations implementing those statutes.after the parties filed for summary judgment,the district court in november issued an order dismissing all of the nepa and nhpa claims.
as to the section f claims,the district court granted summary judgment for plaintiffs on three,ruling injunctive relief was appropriate.the project includes four phases,defined geographically.the three section f claims on which plaintiffs prevailed affect only phase.the court held that defendants had failed to complete reasonable efforts to identify traditional cultural properties tcps prior to issuing the rod.the court also held that defendants had failed adequately to consider the beretania street tunnel alternative prior to eliminating it as imprudent,and that defendants had failed adequately to consider whether the project will constructively use mother waldron park.
after holding a hearing on the appropriate remedy for the section f claims,the district court issued its judgment,which it described as its final judgment,which shall include partial injunctive relief,on december.the judgment incorporated the prior orders granting summary judgment to defendants on all the nepa and nhpa and most of the section f claims,and to plaintiffs on three of the section f claims.the court enjoined construction of phase pending remand of the three section f claims to the fta.the court instructed the agency to complete their identification of above ground tcps within the corridor,reconsider their determination for mother waldron park and fully consider the prudence and feasibility of the beretania tunnel alternative 
since the district court granted summary judgment to plaintiffs on three of the claims affecting phase,and granted plaintiffs request to enjoin construction of that phase pending further agency proceedings,plaintiffs do not appeal the injunction.there is no.phase is thus not involved here.
plaintiffs timely appeal the dismissal of the remainder of their claims.plaintiffs contend that the district court should not have dismissed the nepa claims,or plaintiffs other section f claims.
defendants have filed a motion to dismiss for lack of appellate jurisdiction,arguing that the judgment was not an appealable final order.
we consider the jurisdictional issue first.
iii.discussion 
jurisdiction 
defendants challenge our appellate jurisdiction,contending that the judgment is not appealable as a final judgment under authorizing appeals as of right from district court judgments.defendants argue that the statute does not apply because the judgment not only granted summary judgment for the government on the bulk of the claims that plaintiffs now appeal,but also granted summary judgment for plaintiffs on three section f claims and enjoined phase of construction pending reconsideration of the claims by the agency on remand.a remand does not finally dispose of a claim,but ordinarily does confer appellate jurisdiction for purposes of a government appeal.see alsea valley alliance dep t of commerce,cir.
here,defendants could have appealed the remand order but did not.plaintiffs are not even aggrieved by it.since no party wants us to review the remand of the section f claims,the remand should not defeat our jurisdiction to review the unquestionably final dismissal of the remainder of the claims.we have said that the final judgment rule deals in practice,not theory.sierra forest legacy sherman,cir.as a practical matter,the work of the district court as to the dismissed claims is complete,and review of those claims is appropriate under.
moreover,even if the judgment were not appealable as a matter of finality,it would be reviewable under a as an appeal from the grant or refusal of injunctive relief.indeed,this litigation has always been about injunctive relief,stopping construction of the rail system.this is apparent when we look back on the nature of the underlying dispute and the district court resolution of it.when plaintiffs initiated litigation in,their complaint in its title said it sought injunctive and declaratory relief.in the body of the complaint,plaintiffs requested injunctive relief requiring defendants to halt progress on the project,withdraw the rod,and withhold until the requirements of nepa and section f had been met and all reasonable alternatives had been considered.the district court entry of summary judgment in favor of defendants on the nepa claims thus denied plaintiffs request for injunctive relief on all of the dismissed claims.
defendants jurisdictional argument concerns the lack of technical finality of the order under.the argument does not mention a,which plaintiffs correctly point out is an alternative basis for appellate jurisdiction in this case.work on the rail system is going forward and the issues need to be resolved.since all of plaintiffs claims were for injunctive relief,we have appellate jurisdiction under a.we hold that we have jurisdiction under either a or or both.we therefore turn to the merits of plaintiffs claims.
nepa claims 
plaintiffs challenges under nepa are directed principally to the choice of the fixed guideway system.plaintiffs contend that the district court erred in granting summary judgment on their nepa claims because defendants unreasonably restricted the project purpose and need,and did not consider all reasonable alternatives as required under that act and its regulations.
an eis must state the underlying purpose and need for the proposed action.see.courts evaluate an agency statement of purpose under a reasonableness standard,and in assessing reasonableness,must consider the statutory context of the federal action at issue,see league of wilderness defenders forest,cir.agencies enjoy considerable discretion in defining the purpose and need of a project,but they may not define the project objectives in terms so unreasonably narrow,that only one alternative would accomplish the goals of the project.parks conservation ass bureau of land,cir.the eis would then become merely a foreordained formality.id.plaintiffs claim the eis objectives were too narrow.
the feis describes the project purpose as follows to provide rapid transit in the highly congested transportation corridor between kapolei and university of hawaii manoa to provide faster,more reliable public transportation service in the study corridor than can be achieved with buses operating in congested traffic to provide reliable mobility in areas of the study corridor where people of limited income and an aging population live to serve rapidly developing areas of the study corridor and to provide additional transit capacity and an alternative to private automobile travel,and to improve transit links within the study corridor.it describes the need for transit improvements as follows improve corridor mobility improve corridor travel reliability improve access to planned development to support city policy to develop a second urban center and improve transportation equity.
the purpose was defined in accordance with the statutorily mandated formulation of the transportation plan that preceded the feis.that plan was the oahu metropolitan planning organization,regional transportation plan ortp.the stated objectives comply with the intent of the relevant federal statutes.specifically,the safe accountable flexible efficient transportation equity act a legacy for users safetea lu provides that a transportation plan purposes may include achieving a transportation objective identified in an applicable metropolitan transportation plan.see f.the ortp had concluded that a,transit project connecting west oahu with downtown honolulu was necessary to implement oahu land use policies.it also identified a fixed guideway system as a central component of that plan.moreover,the statute authorizing the federal new starts transportation program states that it is in the interest of the united states to foster transportation systems that maximize safe,secure,and efficient mobility of individuals,minimize environmental impacts,and minimize fuel consumption,a,and that one of the purposes of the program is to provide financial assistance to state and local governments in order to improve mobility for elderly and economically disadvantaged individuals,f.the project stated objectives are consistent with all these purpose
