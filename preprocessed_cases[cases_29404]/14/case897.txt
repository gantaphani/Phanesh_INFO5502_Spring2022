in this case,a subcontractor on a large commercial project has suffered the consequences of its failure to complete the application process and obtain the requisite contractor license s before signing two separate contracts.the subcontractor work was terminated before the projects were completed and without the subcontractor having obtained full payment of amounts it claims are due under the contracts.when the subcontractor filed its lawsuit seeking compensation,it was met with a successful motion for summary judgment,based on its noncompliance with the licensing requirements.the subcontractor asserts the trial court erred in granting the motion,because it had substantially complied with the applicable licensing requirements by obtaining a class license before the completion of the first contract and before undertaking work pursuant to the second contract.
in reviewing the ruling on the first contract,we explore the application of business professions code section in the context where a contractor is not licensed on the day it undertakes performance of a contract,but becomes licensed before completion of the work.we also address whether,under such circumstances,the contract is illegal and void.we conclude that,in the situation described,the statutory provision permits the contractor to recover compensation for the acts performed while licensed and,that being the case,the contract is neither illegal nor void.as applied to this case,section does not bar the subcontractor from seeking compensation for all acts performed under the first contract while the subcontractor was licensed.therefore,summary judgment with respect to the first contract was improper.
with respect to the second contract,the parties agree the subcontractor held the class license during the entire period of performance.therefore,as long as the class license was the proper license with respect to the work to be performed under that contract,business professions code section presents no bar to the recovery of compensation and the contract is not void.
the defendants claim that a class license was required for the performance of the work under the second contract and that the subcontractor did not hold the requisite license at any time during the performance of that contract.this is a matter we do not decide.suffice it to say,the subcontractor raised a triable issue of material fact as to whether the class license was sufficient for the work performed under the second contract.therefore,summary judgment was improper as to that contract as well.
we reverse the summary judgment and remand the case for further proceedings consistent with this opinion.in addition,we reverse the order awarding attorney fees.
turner construction company turner,as general contractor,hired niederhauser metal works company,niederhauser to perform certain miscellaneous metals work and ornamental metals work on disney grand californian hotel.niederhauser,in turn,subcontracted to mw erectors,mw to perform certain work.niederhauser and mw entered into a contract dated october,pursuant to which mw agreed to perform structural steel work.on november,niederhauser and mw entered into a second contract,for the performance of certain ornamental metals work on the project.
mw began the structural steel work on or before december.it did not obtain its class structural steel contractor license until december.see,tit,class license explained.it never held a class ornamental metal contractor license while performing work under either contract.see,tit,class license explained.
mw filed a complaint against niederhauser,fidelity and guaranty insurance company,and united states fidelity and guaranty company mw alleged that niederhauser had terminated its work under each of the contracts,without cause,on or about august.it requested for miscellaneous metals work and for ornamental metals work,as amounts purportedly owing under the two contracts.mw included the two bonding companies in the suit in an effort to collect on the payment bonds with respect to the two contracts 
the defendants filed a motion for summary judgment.they asserted simply that mw did not have a class license when it began the structural steel work and never had a class license when performing the ornamental metals work and that mw was therefore precluded by business and professions code section from seeking compensation for work performed under those two contracts.the motion was granted and summary judgment was entered thereafter.mw appeals from the summary judgment and from the subsequently entered order awarding attorney fees.

amended complaint 
in the first amended complaint,mw asserted causes of action for breach of contract,reasonable value of services,promissory estoppel,and payment bond.each cause of action was predicated on the assertion that mw had not been paid for its work on the hotel.
motion for summary judgment 
in bringing its motion for summary judgment,niederhauser sought to establish a complete defense to each cause of action,by citation to business and professions code section subdivision a generally prohibits a contractor from maintaining an action to recover compensation for the performance of any act or contract where a license is required without alleging that he or she was a duly licensed contractor at all times during the performance of that act or contract 
niederhauser supported its motion with its separate statement of undisputed material facts showing that mw undertook work on the structural steel work contract before it obtained its class structural steel license and that it never obtained a class ornamental metals license while working on the ornamental metals work contract.based on this information,niederhauser argued in essence that mw was not licensed at all times during the performance of the structural steel work contract,and was never properly licensed during the performance of the ornamental metals work contract.therefore,it contended it had shown a complete defense,under section,subdivision a,to a suit seeking compensation for performance of the work under either contract.
opposition to motion 
in responding to niederhauser separate statement of undisputed facts,mw admitted that it began the structural steel work on or before december,but did not obtain its class license until december.it also admitted that during the time it performed work on the hotel,it never obtained a class license.
however,in its opposition to the motion,mw endeavored to raise two triable issues of fact with respect to niederhauser section defense.mw asserted that it had substantially complied with the requirements of section and no class license was required for the performance of the ornamental metals work contract.it also argued that niederhauser was barred by the doctrine of judicial estoppel from contending that mw was unlicensed.
with respect to the substantial compliance argument,mw asked the court to focus on the qualifications and activities of donald parks,the sole owner and president of mw.parks was the responsible managing officer of mw for the purpose of qualifying it for a class license and was also the responsible managing officer of specialties,of which he was president and percent owner.he had previously qualified the latter company for a class license.in his declaration in support of opposition to the summary judgment motion,parks declared that he had applied for a class license for mw in august.he further declared that he had been informed in november that he had succeeded in qualifying mw for the license and that all that was needed for issuance of the license was proof of workers compensation insurance.in addition,he stated that he had directed his insurance broker to supply the necessary proof of insurance and then believed he had done all he could to comply with the requirements of the contractors state license board board.this evidence,mw argued,showed substantial compliance with section.
with respect to the requirement of a class license,mw cited certain evidence which we will discuss in detail below.
reply to opposition 
niederhauser,in reply to mw opposition,argued that the judicial doctrine of substantial compliance had been abrogated by statute,as provided in former subdivision d of section however,niederhauser also noted that the subdivision provided one,and only one,situation in which the substantial compliance doctrine would be permitted to apply.niederhauser asserted that the particular situation was not present in this matter and that mw had not satisfied the statutory requirements for the application of the substantial compliance doctrine.in addition,niederhauser maintained that the law was clear that a class license was required for the performance of the ornamental metals work contract.
we will address the section issues and the class license issues in turn.
business professions code section 
structural steel work contract 
whether mw is entitled to compensation for the performance of any of the structural steel work is determined by a careful examination of the language of section.in construing this statute,we must ascertain the intent of the legislature so as to effectuate the purpose of the law.in determining such intent,a court must look first to the words of the statute themselves,giving to the language its usual,ordinary import and according significance,if possible,to every word,phrase and sentence in pursuance of the legislative purpose citation.warmington old town associates tustin unified school dist.th,d.
section,subdivision a provides except as provided in subdivision e,no person engaged in the business or acting in the capacity of a contractor,may bring or maintain any action,or recover in law or equity in any action,in any court of this state for the collection of compensation for the performance of any act or contract where a license is required by this chapter without alleging that he or she was a duly licensed contractor at all times during the performance of that act or contract,regardless of the merits of the cause of action brought by the person 
niederhauser claims that subdivision a answers our question on its face,contending that subdivision bars suit by any contractor who can not plead and prove it was licensed at all times during the performance of the contract,and mw has admitted that it was unlicensed when it undertook work on the structural steel work contract.we can not agree with niederhauser argument,because it overlooks certain key words in the statute.we must avoid a construction of the statute that makes some words surplusage.warmington old town associates tustin unified school,supra,th at,d.
subdivision a provides that a contractor may not maintain an action seeking compensation for the performance of any act or contract which requires a license unless he or she alleges having been duly licensed at all times during the performance of that act or contract italics added.the statute very simply does not state that compensation may be sought only for completed contracts where the contractor was licensed start to finish.rather,the statute permits contractors to seek compensation for any act if he or she alleges having been duly licensed during the performance of the act.the plain meaning of the words would indicate that the act in question,the one for which a license is required,is the same act for which compensation is sought.see slatkin white,supra,th at,d court gives effect to plain meaning of statute when words of statute are clear and unambiguous.
in other words,as long as the contractor alleges he or she was duly licensed during the entire period of time he or she performed acts for which compensation is sought,his or her suit is not necessarily barred just because the license was not in place when work on the contract was initially undertaken.no compensation is available for that initial period of time during which the contractor was not duly licensed,but as long as the contractor was thereafter licensed for the entire period of time during which acts were performed for which compensation is sought,compensation is available for those particular acts.
the validity of this construction is underscored by a reading of section,subdivision e,on which the parties focus much of their argument.subdivision e provides in pertinent part the judicial doctrine of substantial compliance shall not apply under this section where the person who engaged in the business or acted in the capacity of a contractor has never been a duly licensed contractor in this state.however,the court may determine that there has been substantial compliance with licensure requirements under this section if it is shown at an evidentiary hearing that the person who engaged in the business or acted in the capacity of a contractor had been duly licensed as a contractor in this state prior to the performance of the act or contract,acted reasonably and in good faith to maintain proper licensure,and did not know or reasonably should not have known that he or she was not duly licensed 
the first sentence of subdivision e provides that the substantial compliance doctrine shall not be applied if the contractor has never been licensed in the state.that sentence,standing alone,does not bar application of the doctrine as to contractors who have become licensed at some time during the performance of a contract.however,the second sentence of subdivision e sets forth three specific criteria that must be met in order for the doctrine to apply.the first of these three criteria is the most telling.it requires the contractor to have been duly licensed prior to the performance of the act or contract italics added.again,the language is in the disjunctive,requiring the contractor to have been duly licensed before performing either the act or the contract,for which compensation is sought.so,in order for the doctrine of substantial compliance to apply,the contractor must have been duly licensed before performing the act for which compensation is sought,and must have satisfied the remaining two criteria established in subdivision e as well.
we need not address those two criteria in this particular case,however,because they are not relevant to the matter before us.niederhauser based its motion for summary judgment on mw purported failure to comply with section,subdivision a.we need only look at one legal issue,the interpretation of subdivision a,and stop there.
in this opinion,we discuss subdivision e,pertaining to substantial compliance,simply to point out that both that subdivision and subdivision a are consistent with respect to the contractor initial licensing requirement.the contractor must have been licensed for the first time before undertaking the acts for which he or she seeks compensation.that does not mean that the contractor is unable to recover any monies due and owing under a contract if he or she had never been licensed before the date that work under the contract was initially undertaken.it just means that he or she can only recover for the acts performed while licensed,unless the substantial compliance doctrine applies to permit him or her to recover,in addition,for acts performed during any period of time when his or her license may have lapsed during the course of the project.the contractor can not recover for those acts performed under the contract but before the contractor had obtained his or her license for the first time.
we observe that this interpretation may seem at odds with certain cases decided in years gone by.for example,in owens haslett d,the trial court denied recovery to a contractor who was not licensed when he entered into the contract or when he commenced work,even though he obtained his license before the work was completed.however,the party who had hired the contractor was the only one who contractor did not.therefore,whether the contractor should have received compensation for some portion of the work was not at issue on appeal and the appellate court comments thereon are dicta.
an even earlier case of interest is holm bramwell d.there,the property owner hired a general contractor to construct certain buildings,and agreed to pay him cost plus percent.the general contractor subcontracted a portion of the work to an individual who was not licensed on signing the subcontract.the court did not permit the general contractor to recover from the property owner the money the general contractor had paid to the subcontractor,because the subcontractor was unlicensed at the time the subcontract was signed.the court based its decision in part on section of the contractors license law as then in effect.the relevant portion of that statute provided no person engaged in the business or acting in the capacity of a contractor or subcontractor shall bring or maintain any action in any court of this state for the collection of compensation for the performance of any act for which a license is required by this act,without alleging and proving that such person was a duly licensed contractor at the time the alleged cause of action arose.id.at.
as is evident,the statutory provision at issue in holm bramwell,supra,d,did not include the language of current section,upon which the case before us turns.the holm court did not address what it meant to require a contractor to allege that he or she was licensed at all times during the performance of the act or contract.therefore,the case is inapposite.moreover,under the statutory provision at issue in holm,the cause of action in question might have arisen upon signing of the contract,and if so,a license would have been required at that time.see vitek,alvarado ice palace,d,fn.the concerns are different under current section,subdivision a.
our construction of section is supported by the policy underlying that provision.as the supreme court stated in hydrotech systems,oasis waterpark cal d,the purpose of the licensing law is to protect the public from incompetence and dishonesty in those who provide building and construction services.citation.the licensing requirements provide minimal assurance that all persons offering such services in california have the requisite skill and character,understand applicable local laws and codes,and know the rudiments of administering a contracting business.citations.section advances this purpose by withholding judicial aid from those who seek compensation for unlicensed contract work.the obvious statutory intent is to discourage persons who have failed to comply with the licensing law from offering or providing their unlicensed services for pay.the court continued the protective purposes of the licensing law can not be satisfied in full measure unless the continuing competence and responsibility of those engaged in the work for which compensation is sought have been officially examined and favorably resolved.citation.id.at.
here,mw qualifications for licensure were officially examined and the issue of qualification was favorably resolved in the issuance of a class license.the licensing requirements having been met,niederhauser was assured that mw had the requisite qualifications to undertake work for which a class license was required.that being the case,there is no reason why mw should be denied compensation for the acts performed during the period of time in which it was licensed.in keeping with the statutory intent of discouraging persons who have failed to comply with the licensing law from providing unlicensed services for pay,however,mw is properly denied compensation for acts performed during the period of time before it had acquired its license.
niederhauser,as the moving defendant,did not show that section provided a complete defense to mw causes of action based on the structural steel work contract and thus did not meet its burden of showing that those causes of action had no merit.see code civ,subd.p aguilar atlantic richfield,supra,cal th at,d.therefore,the burden did not shift to mw as the plaintiff to show that a triable issue of material fact exists as to niederhauser defense and it was error to grant summary judgment with respect to the causes of action pertaining to the structural steel work contract.see code civ,subd.p aguilar atlantic richfield,supra,cal th at,d.
ornamental metals work contract 
where the ornamental metals work contract is concerned,the section issue is not the date in time when the license was obtained,but whether the correct license was ever obtained at all.in its motion,niederhauser claimed that section,subdivision a barred compensation for work under the ornamental metals work contract because mw never held a class license during the performance of the work.in response,mw asserted that it already held the appropriate license,a class license,before undertaking work on the ornamental metals work contract.as we shall show,mw succeeded in raising a triable issue of material fact as to whether it held the proper license.
class license requirement 
in the first amended complaint,mw stated that,under the second contract it signed,it agreed to supply all labor to erect certain ornamental metal materials for the project which were listed and identified in the attached exhibit b and thereafter referred to that contract as the ornamental metals contract.exhibit b to the first amended complaint was a copy of the niederhauser proposal presented to turner.the work to be performed thereunder was described under the following topic headings ornamental steel rails first level balconies exterior ornamental aluminum rails at balconies ornamental steel rails at interior atrium area aluminum top cap at owners wood rails bronze rails at exterior site locations and site fence and gates.capitalization omitted.
at first blush,it would appear a significant amount of the work was of the ornamental metals nature,due to the specific references to ornamental rails.however,in its opposition to the summary judgment motion,mw emphasized the structural and safety nature of the rails,not their ornamental aspect.it offered the parks declaration in support of its position.according to parks,the scope of work for the ornamental metals work contract was essentially steel balcony railings.he further declared that this work was of traditional class scope.
parks further explained the use of the word ornamental in context of this project is a misnomer.these balcony rails are welded steel and are functionally no different that sic any other balcony or hand rail to hospitals,schools,industrial plants,commercial buildings,walkways and landscape improvements without any ornamental value.these balcony rails are critical life safety parts of the structure,and must withstand prescribed loads and forces as required by the uniform building codes and engineering.even if a class license may in some instances be authorized to install such balcony rails that does not negate the fact that a class license is also able to fabricate and install these components.in addition,he pointed out that the specialty classifications do not specifically reference what license is required to fabricate metal stairs and landings,both of which require rails by the uniform building codes.
parks also provided other information to demonstrate that a class license could not be required for the performance of the ornamental metals work contract.he declared that the replacement contractor niederhauser hired to complete the contract,western construction specialties,only held only a class license 
not surprisingly,at the hearing on the summary judgment motion,the trial court stated repeatedly that it was concerned there might be a triable issue of material fact with respect to the issue of whether the class license was required for the ornamental metals work contract.in an effort to decide whether there was a triable issue or not,the court invited the parties to provide additional evidence.
mw provided the testimony of robert berrigan,an attorney retired from the staff of the board.he was with the board for years and reviewed license classifications for of those years.before testifying in this matter,berrigan both reviewed the specifications for the ornamental metals work contract and visited the site.he testified that a contractor with a class ornamental metals license could perform the work described in the ornamental metals work contract.however,berrigan also testified that a class license was a superior license and that,for the most part,a class license could do all the work that a class could do as long as it has taken place on the structure.
berrigan further stated that,in his judgment,the balcony rails form the structural integrity of the building,which makes it perform as a building.therefore,a class contractor is perfectly qualified to do it.he stated more specifically that a contractor with a class license could perform ornamental metal work if it was part of the structure.he also said that balcony rails such as the ones in this project could be considered structural members within the meaning of the class license classification.
niederhauser provided the deposition testimony of edward backstrom.he testified that,in his opinion,the appropriate license for the ornamental metals work contract was a class license.
the testimony of parks and berrigan was sufficient to raise a triable issue of material fact as to whether a class license was appropriate for the performance of the ornamental metals work contract.therefore,there was a triable issue of material fact as to whether mw was properly licensed at all times during the performance of the ornamental metals work contract and whether section,subdivision a precluded mw suit.the trial court erred in granting summary judgment with respect to the ornamental metals work contract.the matter must be reversed and remanded for a determination of whether the class license was sufficient.
judicial estoppel 
in its memorandum of points and authorities in opposition to the motion for summary judgment,mw also stated that niederhauser was judicially estopped to contend that mw was an unlicensed subcontractor.on appeal,mw explains that niederhauser had filed a against turner and filed a mechanic lien against the property,based on the work that mw had performed.this,mw contends,was tantamount to an implied claim on niederhauser part that mw was duly licensed.
mw fails to successfully demonstrate that the doctrine of judicial estoppel should apply.judicial estoppel precludes a party from gaining an advantage by taking one position,and then seeking a second advantage by taking an incompatible position.citations.the doctrine dual goals are to maintain the integrity of the judicial system and to protect parties from opponents unfair strategies.citation.application of the doctrine is discretionary.citation.people ex rel.sneddon torch energy services,th,d.the party invoking judicial estoppel must show that the party against whom the estoppel is asserted took an inconsistent position in a prior proceeding and that the position was adopted by the first tribunal in some manner such as by rendering a favorable judgment.citation.ibid.
in this case,even if the filing of either the or a mechanic lien could be regarded as the taking of an inconsistent position,inasmuch as niederhauser dismissed the,we do not see how the trial court adopted niederhauser inconsistent position so as to prejudice mw.therefore,the second prong of the test was not satisfied.we decline to apply the doctrine.
illegality of contract 
niederhauser argument 
in its memorandum of points and authorities in support of its motion for summary judgment,niederhauser cited the case of owens haslett,supra,d.as we have previously noted,the owens court stated,although in dictum,that the contractor who was unlicensed upon signing the contract,but obtained his license before completing the work,was properly denied recovery under section.id.at.it also addressed the issue of illegality of contract,because the party who had hired the contractor was pressing a and had appealed.the court held that both the contractor and the hiring party were parties to an illegal contract and,as a general rule,to which there are exceptions,a party to an illegal contract can neither recover damages nor,by rescinding,recover the performance that he has rendered,or its value.id.at.it affirmed the judgment denying the hiring party any relief on her,because she had failed to bring herself within the exception permitting recovery to a party to an illegal contract who is not in pari delicto.id.at.
in reaching its decision,the court in owens haslett,supra,d,cited the language from loving evans blick cal d,wherein the supreme court stated it has been repeatedly declared in this state that a contract made contrary to the terms of a law designed for the protection of the public and prescribing a penalty for the violation thereof is illegal and void,and no action may be brought to enforce such contract citing cases and that whenever the illegality appears,the disclosure is fatal to the case.citing cases.owens haslett,supra,d at.
on appeal,niederhauser again cites owens haslett,supra,d,together with loving evans blick,supra,cal d,gatti highland park builders,cal d,and other early cases.see,general ins.superior court d.holm bramwell,supra,d.it is against this backdrop of early cases that niederhauser argues both contracts were void ab initio because mw was unlicensed when it signed them.niederhauser concludes that because the contracts are void,they are unenforceable and it is unnecessary to analyze section at all.not so.as we shall show,under current law,the two contracts are not void just because mw was unlicensed on the date of signing.
supreme court cases gatti,loving evans,and lewis queen 
we begin our analysis with a discussion of gatti highland park builders,supra,cal d.that case highlighted the interplay between section and the doctrine.
in gatti highland park builders,supra,cal d,an individual who held a contractor license entered into an agreement to provide carpenter labor on certain residential projects.the contractor foreman was also individually licensed.a few months after the contract was signed,the hiring party agreed that the contractor and his foreman should perform the work on a partnership or joint venture basis.a license was subsequently issued in the names of the contractor,the foreman and a third party,but no license was issued in the names of the contractor and the foreman exclusively,either as partners or as joint venturers.the hiring party sought to avoid payment because the contractor and the foreman had failed to obtain a partnership license in their two names.
as the court in gatti highland park builders,supra,cal d,observed,s ection provide d that it was unlawful for two or more licensees holding separate licenses to act jointly in the capacity of a contractor without first having secured an additional or joint license.id.at.since the contractor and the foreman did not have an additional or joint license in their two names alone,an issue arose as to their compliance with section.the difficulty was in alleging that they were duly licensed at all times during the performance of the act or contract.
the hiring party asserted that the contract was void for illegality,because of the apparent violation of the licensing requirements.the court rejected the argument on the facts before it,having concluded that the contractor and the foreman had substantially complied with the statutory requirements.in reaching this conclusion,the court stated if defendant is allowed to defeat plaintiffs legitimate claim on this technical ground,resting on an unnecessarily strict construction of the statutory provision for the additional joint contractor license and denying any effect to the combination license in fact issued to plaintiffs and a third person as above recited,the legislative scheme in relation to the licensing of contractors,intended for the safety and protection of the public,would become an unwarranted shield for the avoidance of a just obligation.gatti highland park builders,supra,cal d at.
the case before us,as distinguished from gatti highland park builders,supra,cal d,does not rest on the doctrine of substantial compliance,as we have explained above.however,gatti is nonetheless of significance in addressing this case.the court in gatti showed that the doctrine would not necessarily be applied in every instance in which there was a technical noncompliance with the statutory licensing requirements.it cautioned against permitting a defendant to avoid a legitimate claim on a technical ground and underscored the importance of the administrative review of a contractor qualifications in fulfilling the goal of protecting the public.
in the case before us,of course,mw claims to have performed nearly million in structural steel work for which it has not been compensated.niederhauser seeks to avoid payment of percent of that amount because mw had not yet received its license when the work was initially undertaken,even though mw was licensed when it performed the bulk of the work and current section permits recovery for the work mw performed while it was licensed.in our view,denying recovery in this instance is not within the spirit of gatti.
our analysis does not end there,however.as indicated above,the supreme court in loving evans blick,supra,cal d at page,used strong language about the doctrine.in that case,a partnership was unlicensed at the time of contracting,and only one of the two partners was then licensed.neither the partnership nor the second partner obtained a license before the performance of the contract was completed.the court addressed whether the partnership operated in violation of the law.id.at.in order to answer this question,the court reviewed various business professions code licensing requirements,including those set forth in section.the court ultimately held that the partnership had violated the applicable statutes regulating the contracting business and that the contract was illegal and void.id.at.
in reaching this decision,the court discussed the case of gatti highland park builders,supra,cal d,in which it had applied the substantial compliance doctrine.the court in loving evans blick,supra,cal d,indicated that the situation in gatti was distinguishable from the one before it.in gatti,both the contractor and the foreman were individually licensed at the time the contract was signed and remained licensed after they undertook performance of the work as a partnership or joint venture.in loving evans,however,one of the partners was unlicensed during the entire period of performance of the contract.the loving evans court said thus,it is apparent that the licensing regulations enacted for the safety and protection of the public,by prohibiting inexperienced persons from engaging in contracting work,were at no time here material permitted to function in determining the qualifications of the unlicensed partner therefor.such disregard of the public policy underlying the state licensing requirements can not be correlated with the rationale governing the gatti case citation.loving evans blick,supra,cal d at.by so stating,the court emphasized the importance of the administrative review of each individual partner qualifications.had the qualifications of both partners been reviewed and approved in loving evans,the answer might have been different,as it was in gatti.
the loving evans court also stated that in the matter before it,the partnership,on reversal,would be permitted to present to the trial court any matters which they may claim will show a substantial compliance with the licensing requirements so as to avoid the charge of illegality with respect to the contract in question.loving evans blick,supra,cal d at.the court thus implied that,just as in gatti highland park builders,supra,cal d,a contract would not necessarily be held void for illegality due to an apparent violation of the applicable licensing requirements,if those requirements could be deemed satisfied through the doctrine of substantial compliance.
we consider the teachings of loving evans blick,supra,cal d,in the case before us.as a technical point,mw was not licensed on the date it signed the contracts.yet before undertaking the performance of any acts for which it may be permitted to seek compensation,based on our analysis of section,it had received that license,at least with respect to the structural steel work contract.therefore,it satisfied the requirements of section with respect to any work for which it may receive compensation.viewed in that light,there is no violation of the section statutory licensing requirements.moreover,the underlying purpose of those requirements is satisfied because the board had had the opportunity to pass upon mw qualifications,had approved them,and had issued a license to mw by the time mw commenced the performance of work for which it may be compensated.the statutory goal of protecting the public from unlicensed contractors was,to that material extent,fulfilled.therefore,we see the decision in loving evans as no bar to mw recovery of compensation to the extent permitted by section.
loving evans blick,supra,cal d,was not the last case in which the supreme court addressed the business professions code licensing requirements.it discussed them again in lewis queen ball sons cal d,a case factually similar to loving evans.there,it held that section barred an unlicensed subcontractor from recovery under a construction contract when the subcontractor was unlicensed throughout the entire period of performance.in response to the subcontractor argument that justice required the general contractor to turn over the payment it had received attributable to the subcontractor labor,the court stated one answer to this contention is that,even in the absence of a provision such as section,the courts generally will not enforce an illegal bargain id.at.
however,the court continued in some cases,on the other hand,the statute making the conduct illegal,in providing for a fine or administrative discipline excludes by implication the additional penalty involved in holding the illegal contract unenforceable or effective deterrence is best realized by enforcing the plaintiff claim rather than leaving the defendant in possession of the benefit or the forfeiture resulting from unenforceability is disproportionately harsh considering the nature of the illegality.in each such case,how the aims of policy can best be achieved depends on the kind of illegality and the particular facts involved.citations.but we are not free to weigh these considerations in the present case.section represents a legislative determination that the importance of deterring unlicensed persons from engaging in the contracting business outweighs any harshness between the parties,and that such deterrence
