historical background 
nearly years ago,the texas legislature created a statutory right to attorney fees for judgments in select claims.see act of march,ch.laws,creating a right to a reasonable amount of attorney fees,limited to twenty dollars,for persons obtaining judgment for the full amount of their claim in actions for personal services rendered or for labor done,or for material furnished,or for overcharges on freight or express,or for any claim for lost or damaged freight,or for stock killed or injured.over time,the statute has been modified to expand the types of claims eligible for an award of fees.it was amended in to allow fees for loss of or damage to express shipments.see act of march,ch.laws.in,it was amended to allow attorney fees upon a judgment for any amount recovered.see act of june,ch.laws.four years later,the legislature extended article to suits founded upon a sworn account or account.see act of april,ch.laws.as the statute evolved,so did texas jurisprudence.
in,we held that a contract for the drilling of an oil well was not an action on a sworn account and thus disallowed attorney fees under article.meaders biskamp.a court of appeals decision declared that attorney fees were generally unavailable in contract actions at that time.winters,cope,no pet.and we strictly construed those claims allowing fees.see,tenneco oil padre drilling,interpreting article labor done and personal services provisions van zandt fort worth press,construing personal services rendered under article.
the modern era began in,when the legislature added suits founded on oral or written contracts to the claims for which recovery of attorney fees was authorized.see act of april,ch.laws.this modification brought the statute in line with the legislature decision,four years earlier,to make fees recoverable by consumers who successfully pursued similar actions under texas deceptive trade practices act dtpa.see act of may,ch.laws,creating the remedy of attorney fees for the first time for consumers prevailing in an action on an express or implied warranty current version at.bus.d each consumer who prevails shall be awarded court costs and reasonable and necessary attorney fees.two years after authorizing attorney fees for suits founded on contract,the legislature instructed courts to construe the statute liberally to promote its underlying purposes.see act of june,ch.laws.
finally and most recently,the statute was recodified in a revision of the state general and permanent statute law without substantive change.see act of,ch.laws,current version at.civ.prac,and thus,section now provides 
a person may recover reasonable attorney fees from an individual or corporation,in addition to the amount of a valid claim and costs,if the claim is for 
rendered services 
performed labor 
furnished material 
freight or express overcharges 
lost or damaged freight or express 
killed or injured stock 
a sworn account or 
an oral or written contract.
breach of express warranty actions 
the uniform commercial code ucc governs medical city express warranty claim see.bus.however,the ucc sections and comments dealing with remedies for breach of warranty,adopted verbatim in texas,are silent on the issue of attorney fees.see.bus.and cmt.providing for consequential damages to a buyer in a breach of warranty action but failing to indicate in the comment whether attorney fees are considered either consequential or incidental damages.at least one court has held that attorney fees may be recovered under the ucc as consequential damages.see kelynack yamaha motor,allowing attorney fees as consequential damages.but see webco,thermatool,cir rejecting kelynack in part by concluding that the michigan supreme court would not agree with awarding attorney fees as an element of consequential damages.leading commentators conclude,however,that attorney fees are generally not recoverable as consequential damages on the theory that if the ucc intended to authorize recovery of attorney fees,it would have done so expressly.see,richard lord,williston on contracts ed.although attorney fees may not qualify as ucc consequential damages,fees may nonetheless be recoverable if authorized by another statute.thus,as one commentator has noted,if a state has a special statute that allows recovery of attorney fees in an action based upon a contract relating to the sale of goods i t would be appropriate for a court to award attorney fees to a winning warranty plaintiff under such a statute.barkley clark christopher smith,the law of product warranties e noting that an oklahoma statute providing for the recovery of attorney fees in transactions involving a sale of goods applied to ucc article transactions.
section of the civil practice and remedies code is such a statute,and because texas ucc provisions and the parties warranties are silent on the issue,section provides the only basis for an award of attorney fees he
