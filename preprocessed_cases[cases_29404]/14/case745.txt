introduction 
when a contractor sues to recover compensation for work requiring a contractor license,business and professions code section requires the contractor to allege that he or she was a duly licensed contractor at all times during the performance of that act or contract,subd.a.if the issue of licensure is controverted by the defendant,then the contractor must prove licensure by producing a verified certificate from the contractor state license board,subd.d.in this case,we hold that a defendant answer containing a general denial of the material allegations of the contractor claim code civ,subd.b is sufficient to controvert the contractor allegation of licensure,and thus invokes the requirement of section,subdivision d,that the contractor prove licensure by producing a verified certificate.
factual and procedural background 
defendant and edwin plumbing,edwin appeals from a judgment entered after the trial court granted a motion for nonsuit on edwin in favor of plaintiff and advantec group,advantec.
advantec was the developer of a apartment building.it hired edwin to furnish plumbing services and materials,pursuant to a subcontract dated december.edwin worked on the project from february until november,when advantec terminated edwin from the project,prior to its completion.
in january,advantec filed an action for breach of contract against edwin the complaint sought damages of,plus attorney fees.edwin filed an answer to the complaint in march.
in january,edwin filed a alleging,inter alia,breach of contract by advantec edwin alleged that it is a licensed plumbing contractor,performing work under the laws of the state of california.
advantec filed an answer to the,in which it denied each and every allegation of the,pursuant to code of civil procedure section.the answer did not include a specific challenge to edwin licensure status.
in march,the matter was tried by a jury.when shagen galstanyan the majority shareholder of edwin began testifying and was asked whether he is a licensed plumber,advantec objected,pursuant to section,that edwin licensure had to be proved by way of a verified certificate.the court tentatively sustained the objection,but allowed the testimony to continue,subject to revisiting the issue later.
during the subsequent discussion,the court stated it planned to preclude edwin from introducing evidence regarding its licensure other than that which is required by section verified certificate of licensure from the contractors state license board.counsel for edwin requested a continuance to permit her to acquire the verified certificate from the state licensing board.advantec counsel represented to the court that acquiring the certificate would take at least two weeks.the court declined to continue the case,but agreed to hear further argument the following day.
counsel for edwin subsequently argued that the issue of its licensure constituted new matter pursuant to code of civil procedure section and,as such,was required to be pleaded as an affirmative defense in advantec answer.because it was not raised in that manner,counsel argued,the defense was waived.after edwin rested its case,the trial court,outside of the presence of the jury,discussed the matter with counsel further,and ultimately granted advantec motion for a nonsuit on the based on the failure by edwin to produce proof of licensure.the jury returned a verdict in favor of advantec for,and this appeal from the judgment follows.
discussion 
edwin contends that the trial court erred in concluding that advantec general denial in its answer to the controverted the issue of edwin licensure,such that edwin was required to prove licensure by production of a verified certificate of licensure from the contractors state license board,subd.d.we conclude that the trial court was correct.
section,subdivision a,provides in relevant part except as provided in subdivision e which sets forth limited circumstances,not applicable here,under which substantial compliance may be established,no person engaged in the business or acting in the capacity of a contractor,may bring or maintain any action,or recover in law or equity in any action,in any court of this state for the collection of compensation for the performance of any act or contract where a license is required by this chapter without alleging that he or she was a duly licensed contractor at all times during the performance of that act or contract,regardless of the merits of the cause of action brought by the person.italics added.under subdivision d of section,i f licensure or proper licensure is controverted,then proof of licensure pursuant to this section shall be made by production of a verified certificate of licensure from the contractors state license board which establishes that the individual or entity bringing the action was duly licensed in the proper classification of contractors at all times during the performance of any act or contract covered by the action.nothing in this subdivision shall require any person or entity controverting licensure or proper licensure to produce a verified certificate.when licensure or proper licensure is controverted,the burden of proof to establish licensure or proper licensure shall be on the licensee.
read together,subdivisions a and d of section provide that the contractor must plead licensure,and,if licensure is controverted,must also prove licensure by producing a verified certificate.the issue here is whether an answer that makes a general denial is sufficient to controvert the pleading of licensure,such that,under subdivision d,the contractor must produce a certificate of licensure.we conclude that it is.
an answer may contain a general denial of the material allegations of the complaint controverted by the defendant.code civ,subd.b.the effect of a general denial is to put in issue the material allegations of the complaint.fpi development,nakashima d.code of civil procedure section,subdivision a defines a material allegation in a pleading as one essential to the claim or defense and which could not be stricken from the pleading without leaving it insufficient as to that claim or defense.because section,subdivision a,requires the pleading of licensure without it,the contractor can not recover,regardless of the merits of the claim,the allegation of licensure is a material allegation subject to being controverted by a general denial.therefore,faced with an answer that makes a general denial,the contractor is required by section,subdivision d,to prove the allegation of licensure,and can do so only by producing a verified certificate.
edwin contends that nonlicensure constitutes new matter under section,subdivision b,which provides that an answer must contain a statement of any new matter constituting a defense,in other words,an affirmative defense.thus,according to edwin,the failure to plead nonlicensure as an affirmative defense,or to raise it as an objection in abatement regarding edwin capacity to sue,precluded advantec from raising the issue at trial.however,g enerally,a party must raise an issue as an affirmative defense where the matter is not responsive to essential allegations of the complaint.bevill zoura th,d.nonlicensure is responsive to an essential allegation of the complaint,and therefore does not constitute new matter.under a general denial,the defendant may urge any defense tending to show that the plaintiff has no right to recover or no right to recover to the extent that he or she claims.fn.d pleading,citing in fn.aetna carpet penzner d.edwin argument ignores the plain language of section,subdivision b,under which the material allegations of a complaint may be controverted by a general denial,and the plain language of section,subdivision d,which provides that once the allegation of licensure is controverted,the contractor has the burden of proving licensure by producing a valid certificate.
similarly,edwin contends that a contractor licensure status involves its capacity to sue,and an objection as to a party capacity to sue constitutes new matter that must be raised as a plea in abatement,and must be specifically pleaded.edwin cites,for example,abrams th,d,in
