after a south carolina homeowners association discovered construction defects in its condominium building,it sued the general contractor in state court for negligence and breach of the implied warranty of good workmanship.the general contractor then sued the association in federal court,proceeding under the federal arbitration act faa,et,to force arbitration under clauses in the general construction contract and the master deed.the homeowners association is not a party to the general contract,nor does it seek a direct benefit from the contract in asserting its claims.the general contractor is not a beneficiary of the master deed and is not otherwise entitled to invoke its arbitration clause.we therefore affirm the district court order denying the general contractor motion to compel arbitration.
this consolidated appeal involves three related cases filed by griffin company griffin,a construction company,against a homeowners association in the district of south carolina.in each case griffin seeks to compel the homeowners association to arbitrate claims asserted against griffin in a state court action filed in horry county,south carolina.because the arbitration provisions and legal issues are identical in the three cases before us,the parties agreed to base their arguments on the record in griffin beach club ii homeowners ass n,cir.the facts are as follows.
on october,drake development corporation iv drake,as owner,entered into a general construction contract with griffin,as contractor.drake agreed to pay griffin million to construct a unit condominium known as the beach club ii at windy hill the beach club,located in north myrtle beach,south carolina.section of the general conditions in the contract requires that a ll claims,disputes and other matters in question between the contractor griffin and the owner drake arising out of,or relating to,the contract documents or the breach thereof shall be decided by arbitration.
after griffin completed construction of the beach club in,drake filed a master deed for the property in the register of deeds for horry county,south carolina.the deed imposes certain restrictions and obligations on the grantor drake,the owners of individual condominium units,and the beach club ii homeowners association,the association,an entity charged by the deed to maintain the common elements of the beach club property.article xxiv of the deed requires the arbitration of any dispute arising out of use,ownership or occupancy of the common elements and any complaint against the grantor.griffin,the contractor,is not a party to the deed,nor is it referred to anywhere in the deed provisions.
after drake conveyed title to the buyers of the individual condominium units,the building began leaking water through its exterior walls.a subsequent inspection revealed numerous construction defects.on march,the association filed a complaint in south carolina state court against griffin,drake,and two other defendants.the complaint,as amended,asserted claims against griffin for negligence and breach of the implied warranty of good workmanship.later,on september,griffin filed a complaint in federal court seeking an order,under the faa and south carolina state law,to compel the association to arbitrate its negligence and breach of warranty claims.griffin alleged that the association was subject to mandatory arbitration based on provisions in the general construction contract and the beach club master deed.griffin filed a motion to compel arbitration,but the district court dismissed griffin complaint,citing principles of abstention.we reversed and remanded,instructing the district court to rule on the merits of griffin motion to compel arbitration.griffin beach club ii homeowners ass n,fed.appx.cir unpublished.on remand the district court denied griffin motion to compel,and griffin appeals for the second time.
griffin argues that the association is compelled to arbitrate its negligence and breach of warranty claims under two separate arbitration provisions.first,griffin asserts that equitable estoppel binds the association to the general contract arbitration provision.second,griffin asserts that it is a beneficiary of the master deed,which permits it to invoke the deed arbitration provision.griffin says in the alternative that the association is equitably estopped from avoiding the master deed arbitration provision.
griffin main argument is that the arbitration clause in the general contract is enforceable against the association through the doctrine of equitable estoppel generally,arbitration is a matter of contract and a party can not be required to submit to arbitration any dispute which it has not agreed to arbitrate.int l paper schwabedissen maschinen anlagen gmbh,cir quoting united steelworkers warrior gulf navigation,d.of course,it is well established that a party can agree to submit to arbitration by means other than personally signing a contract containing an arbitration clause.id.this happens when theories arising out of common law principles of contract and agency law are used to bind nonsignatories to arbitration agreements.id.at quoting am.arbitration ass n,cir.in the present case griffin asserts that the association,though not a signatory to the general contract,is equitably estopped from avoiding the contract arbitration provision.
the doctrine of equitable estoppel precludes a party from asserting rights he otherwise would have had against another when his own conduct renders assertion of those rights contrary to equity.id.at internal quotation marks and citations omitted.in the context of arbitration,the doctrine applies when one party attempts to hold another party to the terms of an agreement while simultaneously trying to avoid the agreement arbitration clause.hughes masonry,greater clark county sch,cir.we have held more specifically that a nonsignatory is estopped from refusing to comply with an arbitration clause when it is seeking or receives a direct benefit from a contract containing an arbitration clause.schwabedissen,at quotation marks and citations omitted.our job here is to determine whether the association is seeking a direct benefit from the general construction contract between drake and griffin.
our guidance for this inquiry comes from schwabedissen,where we applied the direct benefits theory of estoppel in affirming the enforcement of an arbitration award.in that case international paper company by a predecessor agreed to buy an industrial saw from wood systems,a distributor.wood systems,in turn,engaged its manufacturer,schwabedissen maschinen anlagen gmbh,to build the saw according to specifications set forth in a contract between wood and schwabedissen.the saw was delivered to international paper in due course,but it never worked properly.wood systems went bankrupt in the meantime,and international paper sued schwabedissen in district court,alleging breach of contract and breach of warranties based on the contract.id.at.the district court granted schwabedissen motion to compel international paper to arbitrate based on an arbitration clause in the contract.after schwabedissen won in arbitration,the district court enforced the award against international paper.on appeal to us international paper repeated its argument that it was not bound to arbitrate because it was not a signatory to the contract.we disagreed because a party may be equitably estopped from asserting that the lack of his signature on a written contract precludes enforcement of the contract arbitration clause when he has consistently maintained that other provisions of the same contract should be enforced to benefit him.id.at.because international paper was seeking to gain a direct benefit from certain provisions in the contract,we held that it was estopped from avoiding the contract arbitration provision.as we explained 
the contract provides part of the factual foundation for every claim asserted by international paper against schwabedissen international paper alleges that schwabedissen failed to honor the warranties in the contract and it seeks damages,revocation,and rejection in accordance with that contract.international paper entire case
