the state obtained an easement to construct a mitigation pond on charles and marlene brownlow property to collect water that would result from a highway expansion project.the state built the pond and used most of the excavated dirt for highway construction purposes in another location.the brownlows sued the state for inverse condemnation as to the dirt it removed.the state asserted sovereign immunity from suit in a plea to the jurisdiction.the trial court granted that plea and dismissed the suit.the court of appeals reversed.we hold that the easement did not grant the state the right to use the excavated dirt for highway construction,the brownlows suit states a takings claim under the texas constitution,and the state does not have sovereign immunity from the suit.we affirm the court of appeals judgment.
background 
when the state initiated plans to widen state highway in brazoria county,it calculated that the expanded highway required construction of a floodplain mitigation pond.the state elected to build the mitigation pond on part of a tract of land owned by charles and marlene brownlow.it initiated condemnation proceedings by which it sought a fee estate in acres of the brownlows land.eventually the parties came to an agreement embodied in an agreed judgment by which the state received a permanent easement over the acres.a recital in the judgment noted that the state sought the property for highway purposes.the judgment then ordered that the easement was granted 
for the purpose of opening,constructing,and maintaining a detention facility in,over,and across the brownlows land,together with the right,at all times of ingress,egress,and regress in,over,on and across such tract of land for the purpose of making additions to,improvements on,and repairs to said detention facility or any part thereof.
the property description and a construction plan was appended to the judgment.
in accordance with the construction plan for the pond,the state excavated in excess of cubic meters of dirt from its easement.despite the brownlows protests,the state removed most of the excavated dirt and used it in the highway expansion project,so the brownlows sued for inverse condemnation.they claimed that the state unconstitutionally took the excavated dirt,entitling them to compensation.the state filed a plea to the jurisdiction.it argued that the agreed judgment gave it the right to use the dirt for highway construction purposes,it was within its rights to remove and use the dirt,and that it was immune from suit on the basis of sovereign immunity.
the trial court granted the state plea and dismissed the case.the court of appeals reversed,holding that the dirt belonged to the brownlows and they could maintain their takings suit.we granted the state petition for review.
the state argues that the agreed judgment implicitly grants it the right to use all materials located in the easement to construct,repair,or improve roadways,it is entitled to use the dirt for highway construction purposes because such use is reasonably necessary to ensure its full enjoyment of the easement,and it has compensated the brownlows in full.thus,the state asserts the brownlows do not possess a compensable interest in the excavated dirt and their takings claim is defective.the brownlows argue that the express terms of the agreed judgment allow the easement to be used for opening,constructing,and maintaining the mitigation pond and the state can not remove the dirt and use it for highway construction without paying additional compensation.
we agree with the brownlows 
ii.discussion 
constitutional taking 
the texas constitution provides that n o person property shall be taken,damaged,or destroyed for or applied to public use without adequate compensation.const.art.i,a.an inverse condemnation may occur if,instead of initiating proceedings to condemn property through its powers of eminent domain,the government intentionally physically appropriates or otherwise unreasonably interferes with the owner right to use and enjoy his or her property.westgate,state,see servs.comm.insulation.the essence of an inverse condemnation proceeding is that the government has intentionally taken or unreasonably interfered with an owner use of property and the property owner is attempting to recover compensation for the lost or impaired rights.see city of abilene burk royalty.sovereign immunity from suit does not protect the state from a claim under the takings clause.state holland.
when the state acquires fee simple title to land through a condemnation proceeding,it acquires the land as well as appurtenances to and buildings on the land.brunson state,quoting nichols on eminent domain.however,w here only an easement is acquired,the owner retains title to the land and all that is ordinarily considered part of the land.id.if only an easement is acquired,it is the state burden to assure that the document granting the easement expressly addresses any special arrangements or provisions in the easement taking.id.at.the state burden flows from the principle that a n easement express terms,interpreted according to their generally accepted meaning delineate the purposes for which the easement holder may use the property.marcus cable,krohn.an easement,unlike a possessory interest in land,is a nonpossessory interest that authorizes its holder to use the property for only particular purposes.id.at.an easement does not transfer rights by implication except what is reasonably necessary to fairly enjoy the rights expressly granted.id.at quoting coleman forister.if the rule were otherwise,easements would effectively become possessory,rather than nonpossessory,land interests.id.at.the emphasis placed on an easement express terms serves the important public policy of promoting certainty in land transactions.id.
application 
in its plea to the jurisdiction,the state argued that the brownlows failed to state a takings claim because the agreed judgment gave the state the right to use the dirt for highway construction purposes and the brownlows did not have a compensable interest in the dirt the state removed.see.dep t of transp.city of sunset valley,t o recover under the constitutional takings clause,one must first demonstrate an ownership interest in the property taken.the heart of the state argument is that the agreed judgment expressly or implicitly gives it the right to remove the dirt excavated from the brownlows land and use it in highway construction,or that,in any event,use of the dirt is reasonably necessary for the state to fully enjoy the easement rights it was expressly granted.the agreed judgment,however,sets out the purposes of the easement as opening,constructing,and maintaining a mitigation pond it does not grant the state rights to use the brownlows property for other purposes.see marcus cable,at i f a particular purpose is not provided for in the grant,a use pursuing that purpose is not allowed.using the dirt at a site remote from the brownlows property to construct a highway does not constitute a use related to either opening,constructing,or maintaining a mitigation pond on the brownlows property.the purpose of a mitigation pond is to hold water.
nor does a recital in the agreed judgment that the state first sought the brownlows property for highway purposes expressly or implicitly grant the state a right to use the dirt from the easement for highway construction.it was incumbent on the state to be sure the property rights it needed were acquired and encompassed within the language of the agreed judgment.see brunson,at i t should be the burden of the condemning authority to have its judgment speak expressly of special arrangements or provisions in the easement taking.the agreed judgment mentions highway purposes a single time,and that is in the recitals.in contrast,at five different in the granting clauses and three times in the agreed judgement announces that the state is acquiring the easement for the purpose of opening,constructing,and maintaining a detention facility.express decretal language in a judgment controls over recitals.magnolia petroleum caswell.comm app,judgm t adopted see nelson britt,no pet.w h
