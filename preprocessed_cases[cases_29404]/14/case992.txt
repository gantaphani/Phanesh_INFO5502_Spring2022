in this case,a general contractor and an owner dispute performance and final payment under a construction contract solar applications engineering,wade construction solar,the general contractor,and operating corporation travelcenters of america ta,the owner,entered a contract to build a truck stop in san antonio,texas.after solar substantially completed the project,disputes arose regarding the completion of certain remaining work and the attachment of liens on the property by subcontractors and solar.ta eventually terminated the contract and refused to make final payment to solar.solar sued ta for breach of contract to recover the contract balance,and ta counterclaimed for delay and defective work.at trial,the court jury charge focused primarily on damages.the verdict substantially favored solar,with the jury awarding actual damages of offset by in defects and omissions.
on appeal,ta argued that because solar did not provide a affidavit,which ta argues was a condition precedent to final payment under the contract,solar can not recover for breach of contract.on rehearing,the court of appeals reversed the trial court judgment,holding that the lien release provision was a condition precedent and that solar failed to prove it complied with the provision.it rendered a judgment in favor of ta 
the issue before this court is whether the provision is a condition precedent to solar recovery for breach of contract and whether failure to provide it is a bar to recovery.ta reasonably argues that an owner who has paid the contract amount to the general contractor is entitled to a building free of subcontractor liens.solar contends,also reasonably,that it is entitled to the balance remaining under the contract for completing the project offset by the cost to remedy defects and omissions.under normal circumstances,solar might have provided a conditional affidavit to allow solar to fulfill its obligation under the contract,to allow ta to be assured that it will not be for work on the project,and to allow the parties to resolve their dispute regarding the scope of the work.but the standard operating procedure broke down here,and the court of appeals ultimately ruled that ta was entitled to a windfall,even though the issue of breach or satisfaction of conditions precedent was not tried to the jury.
we hold that the provision is a covenant,not a condition precedent to solar recovery on the contract.we reverse the judgment of the court of appeals,reinstate the trial court judgment,and remand to the trial court for further proceedings consistent with this opinion.
background 
ta entered into a contract with solar to construct,for approximately million,a retail building for use as a truck stop,restaurant,and convenience store.the contract between solar and ta contemplates a specific sequence of events leading up to completion and final payment that is common in construction contracts.this procedure is consistent with a statutory scheme that provides contractors and builders with lien rights to secure payment for labor,but also gives owners the right to retain a percentage of the contract balance to satisfy any outstanding liens on the project if necessary.
the contractual sequence for the truck stop project is as follows the parties agree on a construction schedule and then solar begins work according to the schedule.on application for payment by solar,ta is required to provide monthly progress payments.when solar believes the construction project ready for its intended use,that it is substantially complete,it so notifies ta.after an inspection,if ta agrees that the project is substantially complete,ta issues a certificate of substantial completion and attaches a list of items,referred to as the punch list,to be completed or corrected before final payment next,upon written notice from solar that the punch list is done and the project is complete,ta conducts a final inspection with solar to identify any deficiencies,and solar remedies those deficiencies after solar corrects the identified deficiencies,it may submit a final application for payment that is accompanied by complete and legally effective releases or waivers of all lien rights affidavit 
in this case,the parties agree that the project was substantially complete in august.a few weeks later,ta presented solar with a punch list,but disputes arose over the remaining items that needed to be completed before final payment.solar then filed a lien against the project for,and subcontractors also filed liens against the property.ta terminated solar pursuant to the contract for cause termination provision contending that,among other things,solar had failed to keep the project and failed to complete the punch list the termination letter also notified solar that ta was asserting claims for against solar for its failure to complete the construction project on time.the day after ta terminated the contract,solar provided ta with an application and certificate for payment for,the amount solar believed to be the remaining contract balance.ta refused to make payment,contending solar had not complied with the provision by failing to submit a affidavit.ta contended it had no obligation to make final payment on a building with outstanding construction liens.solar then sued ta for breach of contract under the theory of substantial performance for the unpaid balance of the contract,and ta counterclaimed for alleged delays and defective work.
by the time of trial,subcontractors filed in liens against the project.the trial court severed the subcontractors claims and ordered that any sums recovered by solar,other than attorney fees,would be held in trust for the benefit of the subcontractors claims.the jury found in favor of solar,and the trial court entered a judgment on the verdict in favor of solar,awarding in damages,which represented the balance due under the contract less an offset to remedy all remaining punch list defects and omissions found by the jury.
ta appealed,and the court of appeals initially affirmed the trial court judgment.on rehearing,however,the court of appeals reversed and rendered judgment that solar take nothing.the court of appeals assumed that the provision was a condition precedent and held that the doctrine of substantial performance did not excuse solar failure to provide a affidavit,and thus solar forfeited final payment under the contract,antonio,pet.granted.solar petitioned this court,complaining that the court of appeals erred because the provision was not triggered the provision is not a condition precedent and even if the provision is a condition precedent and was triggered,the court of appeals decision results in a forfeiture of solar right to recover under the contract instead of delaying payment until the liens are released,which is inconsistent with the doctrine of substantial performance and the purpose of statutory lien rights.we granted solar petition.
ii.law and analysis 
whether solar is barred from receiving the contract balance depends on whether the provision is a condition precedent to solar recovery for breach of contract.a condition precedent is an event that must happen or be performed before a right can accrue to enforce an obligation.centex dalton,citations omitted see also restatement second of contracts a condition is an event,not certain to occur,which must occur,unless its is excused,before performance under a contract becomes due.id.noting the effects of the of a condition.a covenant,as distinguished from a condition precedent,is an agreement to act or refrain from acting in a certain way.reinert lawson,no writ.breach of a covenant may give rise to a cause of action for damages,but does not affect the enforceability of the remaining provisions of the contract unless the breach is a material or total breach,hernandez gulf group lloyds,restatement second of contractss cmt.a,cmt.conversely,if an express condition is not satisfied,then the party whose performance is conditioned is excused from any obligation to perform.see dalton,at restatement second of contracts.
solar claims that the court of appeals erred in concluding that the provision is a condition precedent because it lacks conditional language normally associated with express conditions.see criswell european crossroads shopping.when the provision is read in context,solar contends it constitutes a hoop or step that the general contractor must follow in order to collect final payment,not a condition precedent to sue and recover under the contract.because a different and reasonable interpretation of the contract is possible,solar argues the court should construe the provision to prevent a forfeiture.see id.further,the provision should not be applied as a condition precedent because its protect ta from the possibility of having to pay accomplished by the trial court severance of the subcontractors claims against the project and order that the sums awarded to solar be held in trust to pay outstanding liens.
ta responds that the court of appeals correctly held solar was not entitled to the contract balance because it did not show that it complied with an express condition precedent to final payment.section of the texas property code specifically authorizes an owner to require a affidavit as a condition of final payment.see.a,c consistent with section,section a of the contract requires that an application for final payment include a affidavit,and section b provides that ta obligation to pay the final amount is conditioned on its review of the final application.contending that the language of the contract is unmistakable,ta concludes that forfeiture does not excuse solar failure to comply with this express condition.see restatement second of contracts cmt.a i f the term that requires the occurrence of the event as a condition is expressed in unmistakable language,the possibility of forfeiture will not affect the interpretation of that language.being quite candid,ta offered at oral argument that the legislature may well have intended such a windfall for owners.
in order to determine whether a condition precedent exists,the intention of the parties must be ascertained and that can be done only by looking at the entire contract.criswell,at citing references omitted see also restatement second of contracts.in order to make performance specifically conditional,a term such as if,provided that,on condition that,or some similar phrase of conditional language must normally be included.criswell,at citing landscape design harold thomas excavating,writ ref.while there is no requirement that such phrases be utilized,their absence is probative of the parties intention that a promise be made,rather than a condition imposed.id.citing hohenberg.george gibbons.when no conditional language is used and another reasonable interpretation of the contract is possible,the terms will be construed as a covenant in order to prevent a forfeiture.id.
a of the contract states 
after solar has,satisfactorily completed all corrections identified during the final inspection and has delivered pertinent documents,solar may make application for final payment following the procedure for progress payments.
the final application for payment shall be accompanied except as previously delivered by i all documentation called for in the contract documents,including but not limited to the evidence of insurance ii consent of the surety,if any,to final payment and iii complete and legally effective releases or waivers satisfactory to ta of all lien rights arising out of or liens filed in connection with the work.
the operative language,that solar will provide complete and legally effective releases or waivers of all lien rights does not contain language that is traditionally associated with a condition precedent.the language preceding the provision does not make performance conditional.in the absence of any conditional language,a reasonable reading of the provision is that it is a promise or covenant by solar to provide a affidavit in exchange for receiving final payment.this interpretation avoids forfeiture and completes the contract solar is paid for the work it completed,and ta receives an unencumbered building.ta correctly noted in its motion for rehearing at the court of appeals that solar breach results in a delay in payment to solar until the liens are released.the court of appeals contrary interpretation results in a forfeiture to solar and a windfall to ta.criswell,at restatement second of contracts,cmt.d section favors an interpretation that avoids the harsh results that might otherwise result from the of a condition and still gives adequate protection to the obligor.
ta alleges that key language in section b creates the condition precedent.that section states 
if,on the basis of ta observation of the work during construction and final inspection,and ta review of the final application for payment and accompanying documentation as required by the contract documents,ta is satisfied that the work has been completed and solar other obligations under the contract documents have been fulfilled,ta will,within ten days after receipt of the final application for payment,indicate in writing ta recommendation of payment and present the application for payment for payment.at the same time ta will also given written notice to solar that the work is acceptable otherwise ta will return the application for payment to solar,indicating in writing the reasons for refusing to recommend final payment,in which case solar shall make the necessary corrections and resubmit the application for payment.
while ta is correct that section b contains the conditional language if,the section does not create a condition of payment to the affidavit.rather,the condition is if ta is satisfied with the work and the contractual documents,then it will recommend that solar be paid the retainage.if ta is not satisfied with the work,then solar shall make the necessary corrections and resubmit the application for payment.solar obligation to provide a affidavit,and ta obligation to pay,lie separate and apart from ta approval of the project.if this condition were allowed to prevent solar from suing on the contract when a building was substantially complete,then solar would be beholden to ta to be satisfied.in other words,if either solar or ta disagreed with the other party performance under the document,ta could likely sue solar,but solar could not sue to be paid,because ta was not satisfied under the contract.
while the legislature statutory scheme for contractor lien rights provides that the parties may have chosen an alternative path,the overall scheme of the property code suggests interpreting the provision to avoid a forfeiture.the process for final payment common to construction contracts is complemented by statutes that protect contractors and owners in case the contractual process breaks down.first,the texas constitution and the texas property code grant a lien in favor of contractors and builders extending to the building on which they have labored.const.art.xvi.thus,if the owner becomes insolvent or refuses to pay,the contractor has recourse to recover the sums owed by foreclosing on the liens on the property.however,the contractor lien gives contractors unequal leverage over owners and leaves owners vulnerable to insolvent contractors.for instance,if disagreements arise over the quality of the work and the owner threatens to withhold payment to the general contractor absent remedial measures,the general contractor can simply refuse to pay a subcontractor who can then place a lien on the property.owners do not have similar remedies and must resort to litigation.similarly,if the owner pays the general contractor the full contractual sum,but the general contractor does not pay a subcontractor,the subcontractor can place a lien on the property.the owner,after already paying the general contractor in full,is forced to pay the subcontractor in order to receive the property and must again resort to litigation to recover the money already paid to the general contractor,who at this point may be insolvent.
the unequal bargaining positions created by the contractor lien rights is addressed through the mechanism of retainage.the property code requires that,during the progress of work under a contract for which a contractor lien may be
