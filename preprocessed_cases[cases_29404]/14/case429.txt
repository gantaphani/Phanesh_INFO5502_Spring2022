these two consolidated cases arose out of a contractual dispute between florida mowing and landscape service,florida mowing and equity lifestyle properties,equity.after the district court dismissed equity third amended complaint for failure to comply with a court order,the case proceeded to trial before a jury on florida mowing breach of contract claim that equity owed it for work performed.the jury found for florida mowing in that amount,and after the district court entered judgment for florida mowing in both cases,equity brought this appeal.equity seeks alternative resolutions of its appeal.first,contending that the district court abused its discretion in dismissing its third amended complaint,equity asks that we vacate the district court judgment,direct the reinstatement of its third amended complaint,and remand the case for a new trial in both cases.second,assuming that we sustain the district court order dismissing that complaint,equity asks that we vacate the district court judgment and remand the case for a new trial on the grounds that the district court erred in construing the parties contract and abused its discretion in admitting florida mowing invoices into evidence under federal rule of evidence.we deny equity requests and accordingly affirm.
equity owns and operates five residential manufactured home communities in fort myers,florida.on august,after hurricane charley came through the fort myers area,equity contracted with florida mowing to remove debris from these properties.the parties agreement was drafted by florida mowing manager,julian wright,in consultation with equity district manager,barbara stanze the agreement provision read as follows 
it is also understood by both parties that the cost of this project is an unknown factor,and can not be taken lightly,because of the state of condition that surrounds it.it is impossible to estimate a true cost,so therefore both parties agree that the contractor will bill and this will be a cost plus percentage markup on the costs,for the contract.the markup or percentage after costs will be based on of the total costs,and will be paid upon completion of contract.
the agreement then specified that 
the contractor will bill on the basis of a daily charge,being a hour work day,and to be paid on a unit basis,small large.the cost of the large unit would be a day x quantity of units.the cost of the small unit would be a day x the quantity of units.
large units were defined to include five pieces of heavy equipment,three equipment operators,and two hand laborers.small units included two pieces of heavy equipment,one equipment operator,and two hand laborers.one month after reaching this agreement,the parties signed an addendum to the contract under which florida mowing would also provide final cleanup units,consisting of two pieces of heavy equipment,one equipment operator,and three hand laborers,at a cost of per day.
florida mowing commenced the cleanup work on august,and finished it on january.in total,florida mowing performed twenty weeks of work.at the close of a typical work day,the foremen in charge of the work at the manufactured home communities called wright and informed him of the number of large and small units used that day.wright noted this information on legal pads,scraps of paper,or cardboard,whatever might be handy when a foreman called.then,wright copied the information onto white boards at florida mowing home office and discarded his notes.at the end of the work week,he transferred the information on the white boards onto a handwritten invoice,which his wife typed into final form.in all,she prepared twenty weekly invoices reflecting the units employed during the week wright forwarded these invoices to equity on a basis.equity only disputed one invoice because it contained an arithmetical error.
florida mowing also provided equity with three summary invoices.florida mowing issued the first summary invoice after week.this invoice included only the markup due from weeks through.the invoice purported to break down the markup as 
mobilization demobilization of cost 
support equipment personell sic of cost 
administrative of cost 
florida mowing issued the second summary invoice at the end of week,to cover the markup for weeks through.the third summary invoice,florida mowing final invoice,issued at the end of week,and repeated the amounts due in the second summary invoice 
equity paid of the invoices florida mowing submitted.in february,several weeks after florida mowing had completed its work,equity refused to pay the invoice for week,in the amount of,and the final invoice for,which reflected the markup due for weeks through.equity stated that it would not pay those invoices until florida mowing provided it with underlying documentation showing the costs florida mowing actually incurred for labor and equipment on the job.florida mowing responded that it had not retained the underlying documents and that such documentation was unnecessary because the contractual term costs meant the amounts specified for the large,small,and final cleanup units.
on april,florida mowing brought a breach of contract action against equity in the circuit court of lee county,florida,seeking damages in the amount of the unpaid invoices.the next day,equity sued florida mowing in the united states district court for the middle district of florida equity complaint sought a declaratory judgment that florida mowing had received all the money it was entitled to receive under the parties contract and damages for breach of contract,breach of implied covenant of good faith,and unjust enrichment.equity removed florida mowing action to the district court and the two cases were consolidated.
equity thereafter amended its complaint twice,with leave of court equity second amended complaint,filed on october,once again asked the district court to declare that no funds were due and owing to florida mowing for several reasons,including that florida mowing had not provided equity with the documents underlying its invoices and that florida mowing failed to perform the contract in good faith and to provide equity with adequate billing documentation showing the costs and expenses it incurred in performing the work the second amended complaint also sought damages under florida statutory and tort law 
after the parties engaged in discovery,equity moved the district court for summary judgment on several issues,one of which lies at the heart of this appeal.equity asked the court to declare that the word costs,the basis of the cost plus provision,referred to the funds florida mowing actually paid for labor and equipment in performing the cleanup work,and the markup was multiplied by such payments.equity contended that florida mowing interpretation of costs,that costs referred to the unit costs for labor and equipment,was untenable.the district court rejected equity interpretation of costs,finding,instead,that costs clearly referred to prices the contract fixed for the large units,and for the small and final cleanup units.the court also rejected equity position that if costs referred to these unit costs,then florida mowing had the burden of proving at trial that such unit costs were reasonable.
the consolidated cases went to trial before a jury on may.on the third day of trial,in a bench conference,equity counsel raised what they considered to be a new affirmative defense to florida mowing claim for breach of contract and,at the same time,a new breach of contract is,florida mowing had engaged in price gouging,billing equity for units,labor and equipment that were never used equity counsel moved the court to grant a mistrial in both cases and for leave to file a third amended complaint the court granted the motion for a mistrial and ordered equity to file a third amended complaint.
in doing so,the court gave instructed equity counsel as follows 
the court is going to require you to file a third amended complaint setting forth,in detail,as you done here,today,the precise breaches of contracts that you articulated.when this case is retried,if you do not prove your case,the court will impose sanctions on you,personally,as well as your client,if the rule standard is not satisfied.
to further emphasize the point,the court issued a written order stating that in drafting the third amended complaint,counsel must 
include all the claims equity wishes to pursue,including the price gouging portion of count i if equity lifestyle includes a breach of contract claim,the claim shall specifically identify the breaches it alleges,consistent with those articulated to the court during trial on may.
equity counsel filed a third amended complaint but did not amend its breach of contract claim to include the price gouging argument.instead,equity asserted three new claims and realleged three of the claims of the second amended complaint.two new claims sounded in equity a claim for an accounting and a claim for rescission.the claim for rescission was based on the allegation that florida mowing had fraudulently induced equity to enter into the contract at issue.the third new claim was for fraud but did no more than reiterate equity previous claims for fraud in the inducement and violations of florida deceptive and unfair trade practices act.stat,et fdutpa.the realleged claims were for damages for fraud in the inducement,unjust enrichment,and for violations of fdutpa.
on october,the district court entered an order dismissing equity third amended complaint with prejudice,on the ground that equity had failed to comply with the written order it had entered after granting the mistrial one week later,equity filed a motion to amend clarify its third amended complaint,representing that evidence it had just uncovered enabled it to specify precisely how florida mowing breached the contract.the district court denied the motion,thereby bringing equity case against florida mowing to an end.
the court fixed february,as the trial date for florida mowing case against equity a jury would determine whether florida mowing was entitled to recover on the invoices equity had refused to pay.three days prior to the trial,equity moved the court in limine to preclude florida mowing from introducing as evidence copies of the weekly and summary invoices it had sent to equity during the course of the work.the district court denied the motion,and the case proceeded to trial.
at trial,florida mowing introduced the challenged invoices in evidence over equity objection and established through the testimony of witnesses that the units indicated in its invoices reflected the labor and equipment actually used on the job.the jury found for florida mowing,returning a verdict in the sum of,the exact amount of the unpaid invoices.equity now appeals the judgment the court entered pursuant to the jury verdict and the judgment dismissing its third amended complaint.
equity argues that the district court dismissal of its third amended complaint constituted an abuse of discretion we are not persuaded.
a district court has inherent authority to manage its own docket so as to achieve the orderly and expeditious disposition of cases.chambers nasco,d.the court may dismiss a claim if the plaintiff fails to prosecute it or comply with a court order.b.the power to invoke this sanction is necessary in order to prevent undue delays in the disposition of pending cases and to avoid congestion in the calendars of the district court.durham.east coast ry,cir 
equity failed to follow the district court explicit direction in framing its third amended complaint.the district court bent over backwards to give equity a chance to present and litigate its new claim for price gouging only to discover that all equity wanted was a mistrial and an opportunity to reconsider its strategy.the mistrial gave equity lawyers time to determine whether florida law recognized a cause of action for price gouging.because florida law does not recognize such a cause of action,they recast equity case as a suit for rescission or,if rescission was not available due to the passage of time,a suit for an accounting.if neither of those options was available,counsel would rely on the claims for damages they asserted in equity second amended complaint.
in addition to substituting claims for rescission and an accounting for the price gouging claim that gave rise to the mistrial and leave to amend,counsel failed to clarify equity breach of contract claim,so that the district court and florida mowing could fully comprehend what equity was actually contending.the contract breaches counsel had cited to the court during the bench conference at trial were not spelled out in the second amended complaint,so in granting equity leave to amend,the court instructed counsel to set forth in detail,as you done here,today,the precise breaches you articulated.the breach of contract claim shall specifically identify the breaches consistent with those articulated to the court.in drafting the third amended complaint,counsel made no attempt to do that they simply ignored the court instruction.
a district court need not tolerate defiance of reasonable orders.see desisto college,line,cir finding district court did not abuse its discretion in sanctioning counsel under.because counsel failed to follow court explicit instructions to amend the complaint in re mcdonald,cir finding no abuse of discretion in court ruling of criminal contempt where attorney refused to follow district court orders and rulings see also byrne nezhat,cir shotgun pleadings,if tolerated,harm the court by impeding its ability to administer justice.and this order was reasonable to the extreme.
equity contends that the court abused its discretion in denying its motion to amend or clarify its third amended complaint.we disagree.in deciding whether to grant a party leave to amend a pleading,a district court may consider several factors,such as undue delay,bad faith or dilatory motive on the part of the movant,repeated failure to cure deficiencies by amendments previously allowed,undue prejudice to the opposing party by virtue of allowance of the amendment,and futility of amendment.foman davis,d.all of these factors were present here,and called for the action the court took.
equity contends that the district court erred in declaring that the word costs,as used in the term cost plus,referred to the costs of the large,small,and final clean up units.in arguing its motion for summary judgment,equity took the position that the word costs referred not to the unit prices,but,instead,to the sums florida mowing paid out of pocket for the labor and equipment needed to do the cleanup work.equity takes the same position on appeal and adds an alternative argument,that the unit prices included the markup,the plus it was obligated to pay.if we accept either argument,equity would be entitled to a new trial because,as to the first argument,florida mowing failed to establish how much it paid for labor and equipment,and as to the second argument,the amount charged in the invoices was excessive because of the additional equity paid for.
in interpreting a contract under florida law,we give effect to the plain language of contracts when that language is clear and unambiguous.arriaga.pacific farms,cir hamilton constr.bd.of pub.instruction of dade county,so d,we must read the contract to give meaning to each and every word it contains,and we avoid treating a word as redundant or mere surplusage if any meaning,reasonable and consistent with other parts,can be given to it.roberts sarros,so d.
we are dealing here with a contract because the agreement states this will be a cost plus percentage markup on the costs,for the contract.a contract is one where one party is entitled to a designated percentage for profit over and above his costs.robert huggins contractor,willoughby,so d.
in a contract,typically,the percentage of profit is calculated based on the actual costs of completing the task.see constr.levy,so d,sharrard ligon,so d.in this case,however,the district court found that the percentage of profit was to be calculated based on the unit prices,regardless of the relationship between those unit prices and the actual costs accrued by florida mowing,based on the following portion of the contract 
the contractor will bill on the basis of a daily charge,being a ho
