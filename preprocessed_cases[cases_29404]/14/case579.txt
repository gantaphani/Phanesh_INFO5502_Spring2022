introduction 
appellant mouris ahdout appeals from a judgment entered following the superior court denial of his petition to vacate an arbitration award and its grant of a petition to confirm the award filed by respondents majid hekmatjah aka michael braum braum,hekmatjah family limited partnership hekmatjah,and braum investment development,bidi.ahdout and respondent hekmatjah were the sole members of alcott,llc the company,a limited liability company they formed for the purpose of developing a condominium project,with respondent braum designated as manager of the company.
disputes between the parties were submitted to binding arbitration.ahdout argued that bidi,the general contractor owned by braum that was hired to construct the project,was not licensed and thus was required to disgorge all compensation for its contracting services pursuant to business and professions code section,subdivision b the arbitrators denial of ahdout claims based on section underlies ahdout petition to vacate the award.
the trial court concluded that the arbitrator decision was not reviewable,and thus denied the petition to vacate the award.we find that ahdout claims under section fall within the public policy exception to the general prohibition of judicial review of arbitration awards,because section constitutes a and explicit legislative expression of public policy mandating the disgorgement of compensation received by an unlicensed contractor.thus,the trial court erred in deferring to the arbitrator finding that section does not apply.we remand the matter to the trial court to conduct a de novo review.
background 
the operating agreement for the company 
ahdout and hekmatjah owned adjoining parcels of real property,at and alcott avenue,respectively.in,ahdout and hekmatjah formed the company,the purpose of which was to acquire both parcels the property and to build a unit condominium project there the project.ahdout and hekmatjah were the sole members of the company.they entered an operating agreement for the company the agreement that included the following terms,among others 
for initial capital,ahdout was to contribute the property at alcott and hekmatjah was to contribute the property at alcott.a capital account for each member was credited with,based on the fair market value of each property.
profits resulting from the project were to be allocated in accordance with the profit and loss sharing percentages of each member.section provides for the profit and loss sharing percentages of each members to be determined as follows after the project has been completed the costs of construction both hard and soft costs shall be determined and hekmatjah shall be credited with an amount equal to thereof and ahdout and hekmatjah shall each be credited with an amount equal to of said construction costs.the total amount credited to both ahdout and hekmatjah shall be determined and the percentage of profits and losses of each of ahdout and hekmatjah shall be the percentage that the total amount credited to each member bears to the total amount credited to both members.the agreement provides an example,assuming that the total costs of construction were million

braum,who was the general partner of hekmatjah,was appointed the manager of the company,and as such was empowered to direct,manage and control the business and affairs of the company.he was not to receive compensation for his services as manager.
the agreement further provides in section d that t he manager shall enter into an agreement with bidi the contractor,a general contractor,to construct the project and in this regard shall have the power and authority to execute any and all contracts purchase orders with appropriate firms,persons or entities to obtain all services and materials required in order to carry out the development,construction and sale of the project.the contractor shall construct the project without payment of any consideration it being understood and agreed that contractor is owned by the general partner of hekmatjah,braum and that hekmatjah will benefit by contractor constructing the project on a no fee basis by receiving an adjustment to its profits and losses as determined by section.thus,section provides for hekmatjah to be credited with an additional percent of the construction costs for purposes of the formula to compensate for bidi contracting services.
following the execution of the agreement,titles to the parcels of property presumably were transferred to the company pursuant to the agreement,although the record does not reflect evidence of such transfer.the record also does not contain any evidence that the company entered into a written construction contract with bidi.however,the record contains evidence that bidi indeed performed certain construction tasks for the project and engaged numerous subcontractors for various aspects of the project.
dispute between ahdout and respondents 
construction on the project suffered numerous setbacks,including the death of the architect,plan revisions mandated by the city of los angeles department of building and safety,and construction delays.construction was finally completed almost six years after the company was formed,and the certificate of occupancy was received on january.although the condominiums had been intended for sale,the company,under braum management,decided to wait to sell them and instead to rent them until the real estate market rebounded.ahdout was unhappy with the construction delays and cost overruns as well as alleged mismanagement and misuse of company funds by braum.he also had expected,luxury condominiums to be built instead of what he claimed were units.under the agreement,the parties were bound to arbitrate disputes arising thereunder,and ahdout and respondents entered into two agreements to submit ahdout claims to binding arbitration before the rabbinical council of california.
arbitration proceedings 
the arbitration was conducted over days within an month period.ahdout made separate claims before the arbitrators.only the first and sixth claims concerning the application of section are at issue on this appeal invoking section disgorgement remedy,the first claim sought alteration of the formula for sharing profits and losses whereby hekmatjah was credited an additional percent of the costs of construction as a form of compensation for bidi construction work on the project.instead,ahdout sought to have ahdout and hekmatjah each be credited percent of the costs.the sixth claim sought disgorgement of the total construction costs of,to be paid to the company,half of which ahdout alleged should either be paid in cash to him or credited to his capital account,pursuant to the adjusted split for which he argued in the first claim.
little of the evidence before the arbitrators appears in the record on appeal.the record contains a powerpoint presentation that ahdout counsel attests was submitted to the arbitrators and read from by braum during his testimony before the panel.it provides,in part braum acted as a general contractor,and never claimed himself as a licensed general contractor ahdout was well aware of this.the partnership could have hired a licensed general contractor and charged the company a substantial fee.braum instead,hired licensed and inspectors who have the requisite skills and knowledge of the applicable local laws and codes and charged the company a very reasonable fee.
braum further testified that ahdout agreed that braum fees as a developer would be of the total construction hard cost and soft cost.he stated that braum understands the california state law that whoever builds a commercial building must be b licensed.city of la is not governed by that law.for the building part demolishing,excavating,footing,concrete work,finish carpentry,floor installation,they accept the manager of the company as the owner of the project and will be issued the permit.city of la accepted braum manager of alcott as the owner of the project was issued the permit and recognized as an.
documents submitted by respondents to the arbitrators further assert that bidi hired numerous contractors for various construction tasks at the project,but that bidi itself i nstalled drywall,doors,and water proofing,concrete work,footing and concrete deck.
the arbitrators issued a judgment denying ahdout first claim seeking to reverse the extra economic interest awarded to hekmatjah as compensation for bidi construction costs,and instead made minor adjustments to the percentages.they also denied the sixth claim,finding that b ased upon the evidence and the law,respondents were not required to disgorge the cost of construction.the arbitrators later issued a supplemental judgment further elaborating as follows while the llc agreement describes that bidi was to be engaged as a general contractor,the bais din finds that in fact the respondent functioned as the manager of the llc and as a consultant to the llc and neither respondent nor bidi engaged in any work typically done by general contractors.the contracting work was done by contractors that entered into direct agreement with the llc,virtually all of whom were licensed contractors.
superior court proceedings 
ahdout brought a petition in superior court to vacate the arbitration award on the ground that the arbitrators exceeded their authority by allowing respondents to keep compensation they received for contracting work on the project,despite being unlicensed.respondents petitioned to confirm the award.
ahdout submitted evidence that bidi had a c flooring and floor covering license license number during the construction period,not a class b general contractor license,and that bidi was not granted a general contractor license until september,well after the completion of construction.he submitted the powerpoint presentation that braum submitted to the arbitrators describing bidi role in the construction,described above.he also attached the bank loan application for the project in which braum declared under penalty of perjury that braum construction,with license number,was the contractor for the project,as well as a county of los angeles request for new construction information in which braum again declared under penalty of perjury that braum construction was the contractor.ahdout also submitted nine preliminary day notices of intention to place liens for unpaid subcontracting work on the project,all of which listed bidi as the contractor,as well as invoices for various materials for the project submitted to bidi and several checks paid by bidi to purported subcontractors for work on the project.
for their part,respondents argued that section was inapplicable because they had not been paid any compensation for the construction services.although the agreement specified that profits would be reallocated based on upon final construction cost figures,respondents asserted that n o amount of hekmatjah share of the profits is attributable to any contribution by bidi for its services to the company.in addition,they contended that ahdout did not have standing under section because he did not hire or not utilize the services of bidi,and only a person who utilizes the services of an unlicensed contractor may sue to recover compensation paid to the contractor.braum asserted in a declaration that a ll of the costs of construction of the project were paid by the company.finally,respondents argued the arbitrators correctly found that,despite the provision of the agreement specifying that bidi would act as the general contractor,in fact bidi did not provide any services for which a license was required under the csll.
in reply,ahdout submitted evidence that percent of the construction costs translated to,and that this amount was credited to hekmatjah,thereby increasing his share of the profits under the formula.ahdout also argued that he made direct payments to cover construction costs for the project.his attorney declared that ahdout had paid a total of either to bidi or to braum for unlicensed contractor work on the project.as an exemplar,he attached a copy of a check from his account in the amount of made out to alcott construction.
the trial court denied the motion to vacate the award and granted the petition to confirm it because it concluded it did not have the power to review the arbitrators decision for errors of fact or law.it found that the only possible exception permitting judicial review was dependent on the agreement being an illegal construction contract,but it concluded the agreement was an operating agreement for the company,not a construction contract.the court concluded that ahdout submitted the issue of the illegality of the contract to the arbitrators and they rejected his argument.this court may not second guess that decision.
ahdout filed a notice of appeal from the order denying his petition to vacate and the order confirming the award.however,neither an order denying a petition to vacate the award under code of civil procedure section nor an order confirming an award is directly appealable.code civ,mid wilshire associates th.review of an order denying a petition to vacate may only be had upon appeal from the judgment of confirmation or by writ of mandate.mid wilshire associates,supra,th at.the appellate record does not contain a judgment confirming the award.however,we have taken judicial notice of such a judgment entered in the case after the notice of appeal was filed,and we exercise our discretion to treat the notice of appeal as applying to that judgment.
discussion 
the agreement provided that the company shall enter into an agreement with bidi the contractor,a general contractor,to construct the project.because bidi was not licensed for general contractor work,and yet ahdout asserts it performed such work on the project,ahdout contends the arbitrators exceeded their powers by failing to order respondents to disgorge the construction costs pursuant to section,subdivision b,and by failing to adjust the arrangement which partially depended on the allocation of construction costs.
prohibition on unlicensed construction work under the csll 
we begin by summarizing the relevant provisions of the contractors state license law csll et,which provides the basis for ahdout claim.
to protect the public,the csll imposes strict and harsh penalties for a contractor failure to maintain proper licensure.mw erectors,niederhauser ornamental metal works,cal th,fn.omitted mw erectors.section,subdivision a shields parties who utilize the services of an unlicensed contractor from lawsuits by that contractor seeking to collect payment for unlicensed work,subd.a mw erectors,supra,cal th at.further,subdivision b of section provides that parties who hire an unlicensed contractor are entitled to reimbursement for compensation received by such a contractor even if they knew the contractor was unlicensed,subd.b alatriste cesar exterior designs,th.under this latter subdivision,contractors are required to return all compensation received without reductions or offsets for the value of material or services provided.white cridlebaugh th.the burden to prove licensure rests with the party asserting a contractor is licensed.oceguera cohen th,see,subd.d when licensure or proper licensure is controverted,the burden of proof to establish licensure or proper licensure shall be on the licensee.
c ourts may not resort to equitable considerations in defiance of section.citation.that is because the statute represents a legislative determination that the importance of deterring unlicensed persons from engaging in the contracting business outweighs any harshness between the parties citation.citation.wss industrial construction,great west contractors,th,wss.
the term contractor is defined to include any person who undertakes to or offers to undertake to,or purports to have the capacity to undertake to,or submits a bid to,or does himself or herself or by or through others,construct any building,project,development or improvement,or to do any part thereof.a licensee classified as a class c specialty contractor shall not act in the capacity of a contractor in any classification other than one in which is classified except on work incidental or supplemental to the performance of a contract in a classification in which any contractor is licensed by the board,tit,subd.c see,tit,subd.b contractors licensed in one classification shall be prohibited from contracting in the field of any other classification unless they are also licensed in that classification or are permitted to do so by section which covers incidental and supplemental work.
b oth the person who provides construction services himself and one who does so through others qualifies as a contractor.the california courts have also long held that those who enter into construction contracts must be licensed,even when they themselves do not do the actual work under the contract.citations.indeed,if this were not the rule,the requirement that general contractors be licensed would be completely superfluous.vallejo development beck development th,see id.at even if development company performed only administrative and oversight functions with respect to the actual installation of infrastructure improvements,it nevertheless acted in the capacity of a general engineering contractor the fifth day,llc bolotin th,construction management company did not function as a contractor where there was no evidence company had responsibility or authority to perform any construction work on the project,or to enter into any contract or subcontract,and instead it merely assisted property owner in coordinating the activities of construction workers to enable them to complete their assigned tasks on time and on budget,and acted as owner agent by maintaining records and keeping the owner informed on the status of the project.the reason contractors must be licensed even if they hire subcontractors to do the actual work is so that the public is protected against persons who are unqualified to perform the required work.citation.wss,supra,th at.
further,s ection applies not only to formal agreements,but governs any act or contract for which a license is required.citation.the statute applies whether or not a party is operating under an executed contract when performing tasks that require licensure.wss,supra,th at.o ne may not avoid the bar against recovery for unlicensed services simply because there is no formal contract.mw erectors,supra,cal th at.
given the protective purpose of the csll,the legislature did not intend the term compensation as used in the statute to be narrowly construed rather,it should be read in its usual and ordinary sense,which imports payment or reward in any form.johnson mattox d.thus,t he term compensation as used in the statute includes sums claimed as an agreed price,fee or percentage earned by performance,and also sums claimed as the reasonable value of work done under implied contract.citation.citation.udc universal development,hill th,see also k k services,city of irwindale th,where unlicensed contractor was to receive exclusive renewable permit for fill rights for a quarry in return for construction work,fill rights were plainly compensation within the meaning of section fact that agreement did not call for payment of money to contractor did not render section inapplicable.
ii.finality of arbitrators award 
the question before us is whether the trial court properly deferred to the arbitrators determination that respondents did not perform unlicensed contracting work on the project,such that section,subdivision b is inapplicable.
the scope of judicial review of arbitration awards is extremely narrow because of the strong public policy in favor of arbitration and according finality to arbitration awards.moncharsh heily blase cal th,moncharsh cotchett,pitre mccarthy universal paragon th,cotchett.an arbitrator decision generally is not reviewable for errors of fact or law.moncharsh,supra,cal th at city of palo alto service employees internat.union th,palo alto.however,code of civil procedure section provides limited exceptions to this general rule,including an exception where t he arbitrators exceeded their powers and the award can not be corrected without affecting the merits of the decision upon the controversy submitted.code civ,subd.a see palo alto,supra,th at.w hether the arbitrator exceeded his or her powers,and thus whether the award should have been vacated on that basis,is reviewed on appeal de novo.richey autonation,th,richey.
exception for award enforcing illegal contract 
one of the ways an arbitrator exceeds its powers is by enforcing an illegal contract.moncharsh,supra,cal th at.ahdout contends that the agreement was illegal because its core provisions concern the development of the property,with the project to be constructed by bidi,an unlicensed contractor.
ahdout chiefly relies on two cases which he maintains are controlling,loving evans blick cal d loving and lindenstadt staff builders,th lindenstadt.in loving,the supreme court considered a claim that an arbitration award violated section by allowing unlicensed contractors to recover compensation for construction work.the contractors had entered into a written building contract with the homeowner for the repair and remodeling of a home.loving,supra,cal d at.when the homeowner refused to pay the full amount due,the parties agreed to submit their dispute to arbitration.ibid.during the arbitration the homeowner relied on the defense that the contractors could not recover on the building contract because they were not licensed.id.at.however,the arbitrator found in favor of the contractors and awarded them the amount due under the contract.id.at.the trial court confirmed the award.id.at.
the california supreme court reversed the judgment.finding that the undisputed evidence demonstrated that the contractors were unlicensed,the court found that the entire transaction between them and the homeowner was illegal and void,for completion of the contract necessarily would involve the performance of illegal acts.loving,supra,cal d at.further,a claim arising out of an illegal transaction is not a proper subject matter for submission to arbitration,and an award springing out of an illegal contract,which no court can enforce,can not stand on any higher ground than the contract itself.id.at.the court held that when a party seeks to use the processes of the courts to obtain confirmation of an arbitrator award,and an issue is raised concerning the alleged illegality of the contract upon which the award is based,the trial court is the tribunal which must determine such issue of illegality upon the evidence presented to it a party seeking confirmation can not be permitted to rely upon the arbitrator conclusion of legality for the reason that paramount considerations of public policy require that this vital issue be committed to the court determination whenever judicial aid is sought.id.at.because the construction contract was illegal and void due to the contractors lack of a license for a portion of the construction period,the court found that the trial court erred in confirming the arbitration award in the contractors favor.the case was remanded to the trial court to consider any evidence that the contractors substantially complied with the licensing requirements.id.at.
lindenstadt applied the principles set forth in loving in a case challenging an arbitrator decision that the defendant owed finder fees to the plaintiff for his assistance in the defendant acquisition of certain businesses.the parties had entered into an agreement providing for the payment of such finder fees in the event of acquisition of particular businesses by the defendant.lindenstadt,supra,th at.during the arbitration,the defendant asserted that the plaintiff had functioned as an unlicensed real estate broker and thus was statutorily barred from seeking any compensation under the real estate law et.lindenstadt,supra,th at.the arbitrator found that the plaintiff had acted as an unlicensed broker with respect to two businesses acquired by the defendant,but had not acted as a broker with respect to two others.id.at.the plaintiff filed a petition in the trial court to confirm the award,which the defendant opposed,arguing that the trial court was obligated to undertake a de novo review of the evidence to determine whether the award was based on illegal contracts or transactions.id.at.the trial court concluded that it would not undertake such a review because the parties had already litigated the issue in arbitration.ibid.
the court of appeal reversed and remanded the case to the trial court so that it could independently decide whether the real estate law barred compensation to the plaintiff.lindenstadt,supra,th at.the court held that it did not matter that the arbitrator had decided that issue,because any preliminary determination of legality by the arbitrator is not binding upon the trial court citation.id.at.rather,the trial court must conduct a de novo review of the claim of illegality,considering all admissible evidence submitted to the court,whether or not that evidence had been submitted to the arbitrator.ibid.and fn.if the plaintiff acted as an unlicensed real estate broker on a transaction,the arbitrator exceeded her powers code civ,subd.d to the extent she awarded compensation for that work.id.at.
ahdout essentially contends that loving and lindenstadt mandate judicial review of the arbitration award denying his disgorgement claim under section,because they stand for the propositions that arbitrators exceed their powers when they enforce illegal contractual provisions and that arbitrators findings regarding the claimed illegality are not binding on the court that hears a petition to vacate the award.however,in moncharsh,the supreme court limited its holding in loving,and its analysis is equally applicable to confine the reach of lindenstadt.
moncharsh concerned a challenge to an arbitration award that enforced a provision in an attorney employment agreement stating that if the attorney left his law firm and clients went with him,the attorney would owe the law firm percent of any fees generated from work for these clients.moncharsh,supra,cal th at.after the attorney left and took some clients with him,the law firm invoked this provision and sought a percentage of the fees paid to the attorney.during the arbitration,the attorney argued that the provision was illegal because it violated certain rules of professional conduct of the state bar.id.at.the arbitrator found that the fee provision did not contravene these rules and ruled in the law firm favor.id.at.
the attorney petitioned the superior court to vacate the arbitration award,but the superior court found that the arbitrator findings were conclusive,and the court of appeal agreed.on review,the supreme court,after reaffirming the general rule that,with narrow exceptions,an arbitrator decision can not be reviewed for errors of fact or law moncharsh,supra,cal th at,considered the attorney argument that loving required that the arbitration award be vacated because it was based on an illegal contractual provision.id.at.
the court concluded that loving permitted judicial review of an arbitrator ruling where a party claimed the entire contract or transaction was illegal.moncharsh,supra,cal th at,italics added see id.at t he rules which give finality to the arbitrator determination of ordinary questions of fact or of law are inapplicable where the issue of illegality of the entire transaction is raised in a proceeding for the enforcement of the arbitrator award.citation.whereas the building contract in loving was rendered void in its entirety by the contractor lack of a license,the illegality alleged in moncharsh affected only one provision of an employment contract containing a number of provisions governing various aspects of the employment of an attorney by his law firm.moncharsh,supra,cal th at.the court held that when as here the alleged illegality goes to only a portion of the contract that does not include the arbitration agreement,the entire controversy,including the issue of illegality,remains arbitrable.moncharsh,supra,at see wolitarsky blue cross of california th.thus,the court affirmed the lower courts decision deferring to the arbitrator 
similarly,in lindenstadt,the agreement solely concerned the plaintiff entitlement to finder fees in the event that the defendant acquired businesses that the plaintiff had helped to find.lindenstadt,supra,th at.indeed,the court in lindenstadt noted the language in moncharsh limiting the scope of loving to cases where the entire contract or transaction was illegal.lindenstadt,supra,th at.
as in moncharsh,and in contrast to loving and lindenstadt,the alleged illegality in the instant case does not infect the entire contract.the unlicensed status of bidi is pertinent only with respect to the provision obligating the company to enter into a separate agreement with bidi to act as the general contractor in the construction of the project,and to the provision providing for an adjustment to the members respective profits and losses based on bidi contribution of construction.although ahdout is correct that the overall purpose of the company was to develop the property and construct condominiums there,the agreement was not a construction contract between the company and bidi as was the contract at issue in loving.the agreement has a broad scope,including provisions that set forth the structure of the company,the capitalizations requirements,the rules for distribution and management,members rights and interests,the procedure for the eventual dissolution and liquidation of the company,the requirement to arbitrate disputes,as well as numerous housekeeping provisions.therefore,the exception enunciated in loving and lindenstadt,as considered by moncharsh,is not applicable.
public policy exception 
our holding that loving does not mandate judicial review of the arbitration award in this case does not end the inquiry.moncharsh recognized that there may be some limited and exceptional circumstances justifying judicial review of an arbitrator decision when a party claims illegality affects only a portion of the underlying contract.such cases would include those in which granting finality to an arbitrator decision would be inconsistent with the protection of a party statutory rights.citation.without an explicit legislative expression of public policy,however,courts should be reluctant to invalidate an arbitrator award on this ground.the reason is clear the legislature has already expressed its strong support for private arbitration and the finality of arbitral awards absent a clear expression of illegality or public policy undermining this strong presumption in favor of private arbitration,an arbitral award should ordinarily stand immune from judicial scrutiny.moncharsh,supra,cal th at.
numerous courts have since construed moncharsh to stand for the proposition that an arbitrator exceeds its powers within the meaning of code of civil procedure section by issuing an award that violates a party statutory rights or an explicit legislative expression of public policy,cotchett,supra,th at see also richey,supra,th at an arbitrator exceeds his or her power within the meaning of code of civil procedure section and the award is properly vacated when it violates an explicit legislative expression of public policy jordan department of motor vehicles th,jordan applying the limited and exceptional circumstance justifying judicial review of an award that violates an explicit expression of public policy palo alto,supra,th at the normal rule of limited judicial review can not be avoided except in those rare cases where according finality to the arbitrator decision would be incompatible with the protection of a statutory right or where the award contravenes an explicit legislative expression of public policy.citations.
therefore,courts may,indeed must,vacate an arbitrator award when it violates a party statutory rights or otherwise violates a public policy.department of personnel administration california correctional peace officers th,arbitrator award properly vacated where it reformed a mou already approved by the legislature,in violation of the dills act and thus in contravention of the public policy of legislative oversight of employee contracts.applying this public policy exception,the appellate court in jordan granted the state petition to vacate an arbitration award of million against the california department of motor v
