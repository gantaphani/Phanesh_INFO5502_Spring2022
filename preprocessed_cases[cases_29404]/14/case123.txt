generally,after a debtor files a bankruptcy petition,a provides for an automatic stay of any attempts by creditors to collect on their claims against the debtor.but exceptions exist,including an exception under section b for any act to perfect,or to maintain or continue the perfection of,an interest in property to the extent that the trustee rights and powers are subject to such perfection under b.b.in essence,section b provides an exception for those with an interest in property that predates the bankruptcy petition but is not yet perfected at the time the debtor files for bankruptcy if,in the absence of the bankruptcy filing,the perfected interest would be effective against a third party acquiring rights prior to that perfection.
at the heart of this appeal is whether construction subcontractors entitled to a lien on funds under north carolina law had an interest in property when the debtor contractor filed for bankruptcy,by which time the subcontractors had not yet served notice of,and thereby perfected,their liens.a careful review leads us to conclude that the answer is yes.and because there is no dispute that the other criteria of the applicable bankruptcy stay exception have been met,we hold that the bankruptcy court and district court correctly allowed the subcontractors to serve notice of,and thereby perfect,their liens.
debtor construction supervision services css,a fullservice construction company,filed a chapter bankruptcy petition in january.css,acting as general contractor or as a first tier subcontractor,placed orders with the creditor appellee subcontractors named in the case caption the subcontractors.these first tier and second tier suppliers in turn provided css with materials such as stone,concrete,and fuel to run equipment.the subcontractors delivered the requested materials to css on an open account,later invoicing css for the amounts owed them.
after css january bankruptcy filing,the subcontractors sought to serve notice of,and thereby perfect,liens on funds others owed css.specifically,they asked the bankruptcy court to clarify the extent of the stay to determine whether their notice and perfection would fall within the stay ambit.
branch banking trust company bb t,which had lent css over one million dollars,secured by,among other things,css accounts and real property,objected to the subcontractors notice and perfection.bb t argued that the subcontractors lacked an interest in property because they had not yet served notice of,and thereby perfected,their liens by the time css filed its bankruptcy petition.the subcontractors maintained that the stay did not block them from noticing and perfecting because doing so fell under a stay exception for property interests that predate bankruptcy petitions,the perfection of which would be effective against third parties who acquired a interest.
the bankruptcy court acknowledged that there existed opinions from its own district the eastern district of north carolina in bb t favor.in re constr.supervision,rdd,wl,at.but the bankruptcy court disagreed with those decisions and ruled against bb t,holding that the subcontractors had an interest in property upon delivery of the materials and equipment,before lien notice and perfection.id.at.and because all other requirements for the pertinent stay exception were concededly met,the subcontractors were not stayed from noticing,perfecting their liens.id.
bb t appealed to the district court,which,like the bankruptcy court,held that creditor appellees notice and perfection of their statutory claim of lien on funds constituted a permitted exception to the bankruptcy code automatic stay.bb t further appealed to this court,which reviews the legal issues at stake here de novo.see,in re quigley,cir.
on appeal,bb t primarily contends that because the subcontractors failed to notice their liens on funds before css filed for bankruptcy,the subcontractors lacked an interest in property at the time css filed its petition.we disagree.
upon the filing of a chapter bankruptcy petition,creditors are automatically stayed from attempting to collect on claims against the debtor.in other words,the stay protects the bankruptcy estate from dismemberment via a creditor race to the courthouse in favor of a systematic and equitable asset distribution.see,safety kleen,pinewood wyche,cir a chief purpose of the automatic stay is to allow for a systematic,equitable liquidation proceeding by avoiding a chaotic and uncontrolled scramble for the debtor assets in a variety of uncoordinated proceedings in different courts.quotation marks omitted.bankruptcy code section describes the scope of the stay,listing what does,and does not,fall within its ambit.amongst those things the stay bars are any act s to create,perfect,or enforce any lien against property of the estate.a.
as with most things,exceptions to the stay exist.crucially for this case,section b provides an exception for any act to perfect,or to maintain or continue the perfection of,an interest in property to the extent that the trustee rights and powers are subject to such perfection under section b b.
section b,in turn,subjects the bankruptcy trustee rights and powers to generally applicable laws that permit perfection of an interest in property to be effective against an entity that acquires rights in such property before the date of perfection b.in other words,section b protect s,in spite of the surprise intervention of a bankruptcy petition,those whom state law protects by allowing them to perfect their liens or interests as of an effective date that is earlier than the date of perfection.see also in re maryland glass,f d,cir t he intervention of a petition should not cut off an interest holder opportunity to perfect where the interest holder could have perfected against an entity subsequently acquiring rights in the property if bankruptcy had not intervened.quoting collier on bankruptcy,at ed.
both section b and section b refer to an interest in property the phrase on which this appeal turns.if the subcontractors had an interest in property when css filed for bankruptcy,the parties agree that the subcontractors fulfill all of the other section b exception criteria and may thus notice and perfect their interests.
to determine whether the subcontractors had an interest in property,we must consider what interest in property means.in doing so,we look first to the plain language of the term,which congress failed to define.we may consult dictionaries to get at its plain or common meaning.blakely wards,cir en banc quoting coal.for students with disabilities educ.legal def.fund allen,f d,cir.
according to black law dictionary,an interest in property is a legal share in something all or part of a legal or equitable claim to or right in property.black law dictionary ed.the american heritage dictionary defines interest as a right,claim,or legal share.american heritage dictionary ed.and the oxford english dictionary online defines it as legal concern in a thing esp.right or title to property,or to some of the uses or benefits pertaining to property.oxford english dictionary online,available athttp result isadva nced false eid last visited april.
this court has already made plain that the broad term interest in property encompasses more than just liens.in re maryland glass,at stating that section b speaks of an interest in property and does not limit its scope to liens and holding that,under local law,government had an interest in land for tax purposes,the absence of perfected liens notwithstanding.we are not the only circuit court to have done so.see,in re main,cir we hold that interest in property,as that term is used in b,is unequivalent to,and broader than,the term lien.in re ar accessories,cir calling a wage lien a mechanism for enforcement of a preexisting right that does not create any new interest within the meaning of b.
that courts have differentiated between interests and liens makes,while they are closely related,they are logically distinct from one another.specifically,a lien secures an interest that already exists.see,in re ar accessories,at describing lien as a mechanism for enforcement of a preexisting
