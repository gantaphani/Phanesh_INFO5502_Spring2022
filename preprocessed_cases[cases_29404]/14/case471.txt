in august,the occupational safety and health administration osha cited petitioner american wrecking corporation awc for three willful violations of demolition safety regulations,after a fatal accident at a demolition site at which awc was the subcontractor.two of the citations were vacated during administrative proceedings before the occupational safety and health review commission commission,while the third made its way to this court.on awc petition for review,we upheld the commission finding of liability as to that citation,but reversed the finding that awc violation was willful.see am.wrecking sec y of labor.
awc now seeks an award of nearly in fees and expenses,pursuant to the equal access to justice act eaja,which entitles a party to recover from the united states reasonable fees and expenses incurred by that party in any civil action or judicial review of agency action in which the party prevailed.d a.prevailing parties are not entitled to such an award,however,if the government position in litigation or at the agency level was substantially justified.id.in addition,only such fees and expenses as are reasonable are available to a prevailing party.d a.in this case,we find that the secretary of labor secretary position was substantially justified in all but two phases of the proceedings against awc.moreover,we find that many of the expenses and fees awc has requested exceed the bounds of what is reasonable under the eaja.we therefore award fees and expenses to awc in the amount of,which represents the reasonable amount to which awc is entitled for the two phases of the proceedings in which the secretary position was not substantially justified.
background 
the relevant facts surrounding osha investigation of awc demolition practices are set forth in detail in our previous opinion.see am.wrecking,at.therefore,we will only briefly summarize these facts here.
awc was selected as the subcontractor on a demolition project at the steel point generating station in bridgeport,connecticut steel point.under the supervision of frank bartolotti,awc began demolition work in june.by february,work had begun on the demolition of the turbine generator building,a large structure that formerly housed the generator area of the power plant.on february,two awc employees were making preparatory cuts to the steel columns of the turbine building when the columns collapsed and several tons of bricks fell,killing one of the workers.
an osha compliance officer arrived at the scene soon after the accident and commenced a investigation into awc safety practices.in august,osha issued three citations to awc.the first citation charged that awc had not performed the requisite engineering survey of the structure prior to demolition,in violation of a engineering survey citation.the second citation charged that awc failed to remove all loose material from the steel skeleton of the building by leaving several tons of bricks suspended without support at the top of the south wall of the structure,in violation of f bricks citation.the third citation charged that awc permitted employees to work where deterioration and debris on the roof of the building created a hazard of falling material,in violation of g roof citation.all three citations were charged as willful violations,for which the secretary proposed a penalty of each.
after awc contested the citations,the secretary filed a complaint,and a hearing was held before an administrative law judge alj in april.the alj issued his first decision on may.see am.wrecking,cch.the alj vacated the engineering survey citation,finding that,in fact,awc had prepared several analyses and reports prior to demolition and that the secretary conceded that those documents satisfied the safety standard.id.at.the alj affirmed the other two citations as willful violations and imposed penalties of for each violation,the maximum penalty available under the occupational safety and health act,see a.
upon awc petition for discretionary review,the commission vacated the roof citation,finding that the secretary had not met her burden of proving that any awc employees had access or exposure to the cited condition.see am.wrecking,cas.bna,at.as to the bricks citation,the commission affirmed the alj finding of liability,based on photographic evidence and expert testimony documenting the instability of the bricks suspended at the top of the south wall of the turbine building.id.at.the commission set aside the alj determination as to willfulness,however,finding that the alj had failed to provide sufficient findings of fact and credibility determinations to support that holding.id.at.the commission remanded the case to the alj with specific instructions to reevaluate the evidence and reconsider the willfulness of the violation.id.at.on august,the alj reaffirmed the finding of willfulness and reinstated the penalty.see am.wrecking,cas.bna.the commission denial of awc petition for discretionary review made that decision a final order of the commission.
awc filed a petition for review in this court.we upheld the finding of liability as to the bricks citation,holding that expert testimony and photographic evidence constitute d substantial evidence in support of the commission finding that awc violated the loose material standard.am.wrecking,at.we reversed the finding of willfulness,however,holding that the alj had made no coherent credibility determinations to support such a finding and had ignored evidence that refute d his finding.id.at.we further held that the alj willfulness holding was flatly at odds with the controlling case law.id.thus,out of the three original citations for willful violations,for which the secretary sought a total penalty of,and for which the alj initially imposed a total penalty of,awc was ultimately found liable for only one violation,for which the maximum possible penalty is.see b,c.awc now petitions this court for an award of fees and expenses pursuant to the eaja.
ii.analysis 
under the eaja,a prevailing party in any civil action brought by or against the united states,including proceedings for judicial review of agency action,is entitled to recover reasonable fees and expenses incurred in the proceeding.d a.the prevailing party is not entitled to such fees and expenses,however,if the court finds that the position of the united states was substantially justified.id.here,the secretary does not dispute that awc qualifies as a prevailing party,insofar as awc succeeded in having two of the three citations vacated completely and removing the willful designation from the third.awc entitlement to recovery thus depends on whether the secretary position during these proceedings was substantially justified.awc also must demonstrate that its requested fees and expenses are reasonable.d a.
substantial justification 
the secretary position is substantially justified if it is justified to a degree that could satisfy a reasonable person,that it has a reasonable basis both in law and fact.pierce underwood,d.the secretary need not have won a case on the merits in order for her position to be substantially justified.see id.at.at role models,brownlee.rather,a position can be substantially,for the most part justified if a reasonable person could think it correct pierce,at.at.
because awc fee petition arises out of a proceeding for judicial review of agency action,the government must demonstrate the reasonableness not only of its litigation position,but also of the agency actions.role models,at citing halverson slater,d d.our analysis proceeds in a piecemeal fashion,examining the reasonableness of the secretary position at each successive phase of the proceeding on each separate issue,both at the agency level and before this court.see air transp.ass of can.fed.aviation,alphin transp.safety.
the secretary concedes,and we agree,that the engineering survey citation was not substantially justified.as the secretary acknowledged before the alj,awc had prepared documents that satisfied the requirements of the relevant safety standard.see am.wrecking,cch,at.awc is therefore entitled to fees and expenses incurred in defending against this citation.
turning to the bricks citation,we find that the secretary was substantially justified in charging awc with willfully violating the safety standard and pursuing that issue before the commission.however,the alj finding of willfulness in his second decision and the secretary subsequent defense of that finding were not substantially justified.awc is therefore entitled to fees and expenses incurred in seeking review of that issue before the commission and before this court.
as we held in our previous opinion,there was substantial evidence on the record supporting the claim that awc violated the loose material regulation by leaving bricks suspended in an unstable manner at the top of the south wall of the turbine building.see am.wrecking,at.in this case,the same substantial evidence that sustained the secretary position before this court also renders that position substantially justified within the meaning of the eaja.in addition,there was a sufficient basis in the record,when viewed as a whole,to support the secretary initial claim that the violation was willful.awc demolition supervisor,frank bartolotti,had personally removed all the exterior masonry from the building except the suspended bricks on the south wall.furthermore,the secretary expert witnesses testified that a person with bartolotti experience would have known that bricks left in such a position would be unstable and hazardous to employees working beneath them.standing against this evidence was bartolotti own testimony that he believed the bricks to be safe and secure.were the alj to discredit bartolotti testimony,the charge of willfulness might prevail.given this prospect,it was not unreasonable for the secretary to pursue this charge.
from the time of the alj second decision affirming the willfulness charge,however,the secretary position on the issue of willfulness became untenable.as we discussed in our previous opinion,the alj failed to make the necessary determination as to bartolotti credibility,despite the commission explicit holding that no finding of willfulness could be supported in the absence of such a determination.see am.wrecking,at.instead,the alj asserted,for the first time,that bartolotti and others at the steel point site intentionally placed expediency above safety in an effort to avoid financial penalties for missed deadlines.as we found,t his finding was unsupported by the record and totally ignore d clear evidence to the contrary.id.the alj reasoning was also patently flawed,we held,because it equated the proposition that a person with bartolotti experience should have known about the hazard posed by the suspended bricks with a finding that he in fact did have the requisite heightened awareness or plain indifference to support a finding of willfulness.id.at.in short,the alj made no coherent credibility determinations,ignored evidence that refute d his finding,and issued a holding that was flatly at odds with the controlling case law.id.at.given these flaws,and given that the alj second decision ignored the commission specific remand instructions,there was no substantial justification for the commission refusal to review that decision or for the secretary defense of it before this court.we therefore find that awc is entitled to reasonable fees and expenses incurred in defending against the willfulness element of the bricks citation though not the underlying violation itself after the time of the alj second decision.
as to the roof citation,we find that the secretary position was substantially justified throughout the administrative proceedings.although the commission ultimately held that the secretary failed to prove that awc employees had actually been exposed to the danger of debris falling through holes in the deteriorating roof,there was evidence on the record establishing the existence of the debris and awc decision not to remove it.see hearing tr.at.moreover,there were precedents available suggesting that the secretary could meet her burden of proof by demonstrating that it was reasonably predictable that employees might be in the zone of danger.see donovan adams steel erection,cir fabricated metal,cas.bna,at citing cases.the commission did not disturb the alj finding that awc had violated the standard by failing to remove debris from the roof.rather,its decision turned on the absence of proof that awc employees were working directly beneath any of the holes in the roof or that debris actually fell into the area where employees were working.see am.wrecking,cas.bna,at.on this record,a reasonable person could have been satisfied that it was reasonably predictable that awc employees would be exposed to the hazard and that the secretary position therefore could be correct.
awc argues that under d d,it is entitled to full recovery of all its fees and expenses without regard to whether the secretary position was substantially justified.that section provides that if the united states original demand in a civil action or judicial review of an agency action is substantially in excess of any judgment the united states finally obtains and is unreasonable when compared with such judgment,under the facts and circumstances of the case,the court shall award to the petitioner the reasonable fees and expenses incurred in defending against the excessive demand.d d.pointing out that the secretary initial proposed penalty of is substantially in excess of the maximum penalty that is now available against it,awc argues that it is entitled to all of its fees and expenses.
there is scant case law interpreting d d.nevertheless,we do not read that provision as permitting awc to recover the full amount of its fees and expenses,even acknowledging the large disparity between the secretary initial demand and the final judgment obtained by the government.first,the statute requires not only that such a disparity exist,but also that it be unreasonable under the facts and circumstances of the case.see united states v.one toyota land cruiser,cir.in this case,the secretary initial demand only appears unreasonable to the extent that her position in litigation and before the agency was not substantially justified.in other words,this section surely does not permit awc to recover a greater amount than it could otherwise recover under d a.to hold otherwise would permit prevailing parties to circumvent the substantial justification requirement of d a,a result we do not imagine congress to have intended.
the function of d d is merely to permit parties to recover fees and expenses where the united states obtained a judgment that was substantially and unreasonably exceeded by its initial demand.see one toyota land cruiser,at wolkow braker roofing,cas.bna.in this case,the only issue as to which awc could be characterized as a party is the willfulness of the bricks citation.but we have already held that awc is entitled to fees and expenses related to that issue under d a,because the secretary position was not substantially justified.finally,we note that d d only permits recovery of the fees and expenses incurred in defending against the excessive demand,not in litigating the entire proceeding.accordingly,this section does not permit awc to recover any more than the award to which it is entitled under d a.
to summarize,we hold that awc is entitled to recover fees and expenses associated with defending against the engineering survey citation.we further hold that awc is entitled to recover fees and expenses incurred in connection with the willfulness element of the bricks citation after the time of the alj second decision.
reasonable fees and expenses 
the eaja limits a party recovery to those fees and expenses that are reasonable.upon review of the documents submitted in support of awc petition,we find that much of the requested amount exceeds this statutory limit.
the engineering survey citation 
the engineering survey citation was vacated in the alj first decision,where it was only one of three citations at issue.accordingly,because awc documents do not indicate which fees and expenses are associated with which citations,we award of the reasonable fees and expenses incurred up through the time of the alj first d
