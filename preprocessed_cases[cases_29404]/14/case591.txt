appellant glen oaks homeowners association the hoa appeals from judgments entered against it after the trial court sustained demurrers to its first amended complaint fac.respondents are two groups of realtors loeffler and bathke properties realtors,inc,doing business as premier properties,priscilla siew lin yim,and margaret huang and dg real estate,erroneously sued as dilbeck,doing business as dilbeck realtors gmac real estate and marklin malone the trial court sustained the demurrers on standing and statute of limitations grounds.we affirm in part and reverse in part.
the hoa is a nonprofit,mutual benefit,unincorporated association responsible for the operation,maintenance,and management of the common area serving the five parcels of glen oaks estates.glen oaks estates is located in pasadena,california.the members of the hoa consist of the owners of the five parcels in glen oaks estates.
the fac alleges that the realtors acted as the sellers agents for the developers of glen oaks estates and assisted the developers in marketing and selling the parcels.the realtors were dual agents in that they also represented the hoa members as buyers agents.acted as dual agent in the sale of three parcels in glen oaks estates,and dilbeck acted as dual agent in the sale of one parcel in glen oaks estates.
on or about january,a significant slope failure occurred along parts of the glen oaks estates common slope area and common driveway.in the aftermath of this landslide,a negligence lawsuit was filed against the hoa and two of its members on december,depaul glenoaks estates homeowners association,no.depaul case.the hoa filed a in the depaul case against the developers for indemnity and contribution.on september,the developers served verified responses to requests for production of documents in the depaul case.the hoa received a compact disc containing the developers responsive documents on february.
among the documents produced by the developers was a letter dated december,from to the developers,which the hoa attached to the fac.the hoa alleges the letter falsely advised the developers that the department of real estate dre did not require a homeowners association for glen oaks estates.the letter further advised the developers to lower the amount of the homeowners association monthly dues so that buyers would not back out from escrow.the hoa alleges that and the developers collaborated to create a false and misleading budget and provided that false budget to the hoa members.
the documents produced by the developers also included a dre file abandonment notice executed by one of the developers,which declined to file an application for a final public report on glen oak estates.the hoa also attached this to the fac.the hoa alleges that until it discovered the abandonment notice in the developers document production,it did not know that the developers and the realtors were required to provide a final public report to each buyer,which would have included a budget worksheet and other material transactional disclosures and documents.
the hoa also alleges the realtors received multiple soil reports by pioneer soils engineering,pioneer,which included analyses of the common areas in glen oaks estates.the analyses were used as the basis for the construction of the common roadway and common area slopes.the realtors allegedly received material information that pioneer may not have been validly licensed and that the soil reports were illegal or unreliable.first,pioneer allegedly admitted that it did not have errors and omissions insurance.second,certain soil reports lacked a signature by an engineer or geologist an official marking of an engineer or geologist.third,the body of one or more soil reports referenced testing,investigation,and grading of property in fullerton rather than at glen oaks estates.and fourth,the body of one or more soil reports referenced a nonexistent pioneer report.the hoa alleges that the realtors either did not provide these soils reports to the hoa members,or gave them these soil reports without any warning as to their potential defects.
the gravamen of the claims against the realtors is that,had they acted fairly,honestly,and consistent with their fiduciary duties,the hoa members would have received an accurate budget and the transactional documents required by law and dre regulations such as the public report,and they would have known the soil reports were illegitimate.if the hoa members had this information,they allegedly would not have purchased their homes,would not be embroiled in third party litigation arising from the landslide,and would not be responsible for certain expenses to repair the common areas of glen oaks estates.
procedural background 
the hoa filed its original complaint on february.after the court sustained the realtors demurrers to the complaint,the hoa filed the fac on june.the fac alleges four causes of action against the realtors collectively and two causes of action against only 
first,the fac alleges the realtors engaged in unfair business practices bus,by violating the subdivided lands act bus,which requires that the owner,subdivider,or real estate agent give buyers a public report regarding the property and other transactional documents prior to execution of the sale contract.second,it alleges the realtors engaged in unfair business practices through false advertising bus,because they failed to disclose in flyers and other publications that glen oaks estates was a common interest development subject to the requirements of the subdivided lands act and the regulations of the dre.third,the fac alleges the realtors breached their fiduciary duties to the members of the hoa by failing to provide a final public report,a budget,and other required disclosures and transactional documents pursuant to the subdivided lands act.it further alleges that these breaches unfair practices were a substantial factor in the members purchase of the glen oaks estates parcels because they would not have purchased had they received the required documents the documents would have revealed the defective condition of the common area roads and slopes.
fourth,the fac alleges that intentionally misrepresented or concealed material facts from the members of the hoa by advising the developers to lower the monthly hoa dues so that the parcels would not fall out of escrow,and then intentionally provided a false budget and deceptively low monthly dues statement to members.had the members known the budget was inaccurate and misleading,they allegedly would not have purchased their parcels.fifth,the fac alleges engaged in unfair business practices when it the budget and advised the developers to lower monthly dues.sixth,and finally,the fac alleges that the realtors breached their fiduciary duties to the members by failing to investigate whether the pioneer soil reports were legitimate or failing to warn the members that the reports might not be legitimate,despite undeniable bases for questioning the reliability or validity of the reports.
the realtors demurred to the causes of action in the fac.the court sustained the demurrers without leave to amend,ruling as follows the action against demurring defendants and dilbeck is barred by the statute of limitations based on the allegations,it appears that all purchases occurred prior to february and the slope failure occurred in.the complaint was filed on february,after the expiration of the statute of limitations set forth in ccp and cc.finally,plaintiff lacks standing to assert a claim against moving defendants based on concealment misrepresentation.the complaint alleges that individual members were induced into purchasing lots based on defendants misrepresentations and concealments,failure to provide a final public report,dre approved budget and required disclosures.such claims belong to the individual homeowners,not plaintiff hoa.
the court entered judgment in favor of the realtors on october.this timely appeal followed.

discussion 
the hoa argues that the trial court erred in sustaining the demurrers because it has standing to pursue the claims of its members,and furthermore,its claims are timely under the discovery rule the doctrine of fraudulent concealment.we address standing and the statute of limitations seriatim.
the hoa contends that it has standing under civil code section or alternatively,under code of civil procedure section.we agree that section confers standing.
the hoa maintains that it has standing to bring this action pursuant to section,part of the davis stirling common interest development act cida.in pertinent part,section states that a n association established to manage a common interest development has standing to institute,defend,settle,and intervene in litigation in its own name as the real party in interest and without joining with it the individual owners of the common interest development but such associations have standing only in particular matters,specifically matters pertaining to d amage to the common area,and d amage to a separate interest that arises out of,or is integrally related to,damage to the common area,subds.b,d.the hoa argues that while the right violated was personal to the members in that the realtors owed the hoa members a fiduciary duty,their damages consist of a million repair obligation for the common area driveway and slopes.thus,they contend,the matter pertain s to damage to the common area.even if this was not the case,they allege their personal interests have been damaged,and such damage is integrally related to damage to the common area.
the cida defines a separate interest as a separately owned lot,parcel,area,or space,subd.l.it defines a common area as the entire common interest development except the separate interests therein,subd.b.the fac does not allege damage to the hoa members separately owned lots or parcels.therefore,the subdivision conferring standing when matters pertain to damage to a separate interest that is integrally related to damage to the common area does not apply.
the allegations of the fac are sufficient,however,to show the matter pertains to damage to the common areas.the theory alleged in the fac is that the hoa members would not have purchased their homes in glen oaks estates had the realtors acted as proper fiduciaries,not concealed information relating to the budget,warned them about the alleged invalid soil reports,complied with the laws requiring them to provide a final report and other transactional documents.but because they did purchase their homes,the fac alleges the hoa is now embroiled in third party actions arising from the failure of the common area slopes and roadway,and it is responsible for certain expenses to repair the common areas.the causes of action against the realtors allege damages in an amount over million or in the case of the unfair business practices claims,injury in fact and lost money or property that includes,among other things 
investigative costs associated with the repair and replacement of the damaged common area improvements,pursuant to stearman centex homes th 
the amount to properly landscape the manufactured slopes of common areas that were not landscaped were not properly landscaped with an adequate quantity or correct type of planting materials,irrigation,and drainage systems 
the amount omitted from the budgetary analysis that is required to stabilize and perform the repair,restoration,and construction of the common areas,common area slopes,and common roadway.
these allegations are sufficient to show the matter pertains to damage to the common area.section therefore confers standing.
dilbeck argues that section does not apply because the statute may confer standing to sue a developer for damages to the common area,but not a realtor like dilbeck.but the statute does not,by its plain terms,contain a limitation on who the hoa may sue,nor does dilbeck provide any other authority for this assertion.both dilbeck and also argue that the hoa does not have standing because realtors owe no duties to third parties who were not parties to the contract of sale,and the hoa was not a party to the contracts between the realtors and the hoa members.in support,they cite coldwell banker residential brokerage superior court th coldwell banker.in coldwell banker,a home buyer minor son sued the seller real estate broker for breaching various duties of care,including failing to disclose microbial contamination in the home.id.at.the court held that the broker owed a statutory duty of care to the minor parent,the buyer,but not to the minor,who was not a party to the transaction.the court therefore held that the broker demurrer to the complaint should have been sustained.id.at.
the realtors reliance on coldwell banker is misplaced.the hoa does not allege that the realtors owed the hoa any duties,and we are not creating a rule that extends realtors duty of care beyond parties to the transaction.we are dealing here with a specific legislative grant of standing that permits an association to bring the claims of its members.the stranger to the transaction in coldwell banker had no such basis for standing.windham at carmel mountain ranch superior court th windham is instructive.the homeowners association in windham sued the developer of the association members condominiums for breach of implied warranty.id.at.the developer demurred,arguing that the association did not have the requisite privity of contract to maintain a cause of action for breach of implied warranty.id.at.the court disagreed,holding that the predecessor statute to section supplied the requisite privity the statute gave associations the standing to sue as real parties in interest in all types of actions for damage to common areas,including breach of implied warranty causes of action,and it thus necessarily granted associations privity of contract to state those causes of action.windham,at.similarly,here,the legislative grant of standing confers with it the privity necessary to bring the hoa members claims.
having determined that civil code section supplies standing,we need not address the hoa alternative argument that it has standing under code of civil procedure section.
statute of limitations 
the hoa argues that this action is not barred by the statute of limitations because the discovery rule and the doctrine of fraudulent concealment apply.the realtors argue that the statute of limitations in section bars this action.alternatively,they argue that the statute of limitations for fraud bars this action,even if the discovery rule applies.we hold that the hoa has sufficiently alleged the timeliness of some but not all claims through the discovery rule and fraudulent concealment.
sections and 
the realtors argument that sections and apply is unavailing.as we discuss below,the wrongs alleged in the fac are not breaches of section,and thus the statute of limitations for breaches of section does not apply.
section,subdivision a,states that a real estate broker or salesperson owes a duty to a prospective purchaser of residential real property to conduct a reasonably competent and diligent visual inspection of the property offered for sale and to disclose to that prospective purchaser all facts materially affecting the value or desirability of the property that an investigation would reveal,if that broker has a written contract with the seller to find or obtain a buyer or is a broker who acts in cooperation with that broker to find and obtain a buyer.section provides for a statute of limitations,beginning from the date of possession,for breach of the broker duty to inspect and disclose under section.loken century award properties th.the discovery rule does not toll this statute of limitations.providing that i n no event shall the statute of limitations exceed two years.
by its plain terms,the duty imposed by section is a limited one.section codifies a negligence standard of care for one particular task that the law imposes on brokers the obligation by a seller agent to visually inspect the property and disclose the results of that inspection to the buyer.michel moore associates,th.moreover,the statutory duty is owed by the seller agent a broker who has a written contract with the seller to find or obtain a buyer,or a broker who acts in cooperation with that broker to find and obtain a buyer.courts have consistently characterized the duty stated in section as a nonfiduciary one owed by a seller agent to a buyer,not a duty owed by the buyer own agent to the buyer.michel moore associates,supra,at assilzadeh california federal bank th,assilzadeh field century klowden forness realty th,field salahutdin valley of california,th,fn.salahutdin.
in this case,the fac does not allege a breach of the statutory duty of the seller agent to visually inspect the property.rather,the fac alleges the realtors breached their fiduciary duties as buyer agents by failing to disclose certain transactional documents,concealing facts relating to the hoa budget,and failing to advise regarding the purportedly invalid soil reports.it moreover alleges that this conduct constituted unfair business practices and,as to,fraud.this conduct is plainly outside the limited scope of section,and therefore the statute of limitations for claims under section does not apply.field,supra,th at,fn.the statute of limitations in section should only apply in negligence or negligent misrepresentation actions brought against a nonfiduciary broker for failure to visually inspect or disclose.it should not apply to actions brought against a fiduciary broker.
it is established that the fiduciary duty owed by the buyer agent to the buyer is separate and substantially more extensive than the nonfiduciary duty codified in section.field,supra,th at see also michel moore associates,supra,th at assilzadeh,supra,th at salahutdin,supra,th at,fn.at issue here is not the inspection and disclosure duties of a seller broker to the buyer rather it is the broker fiduciary duty to his own client.in field,supra,th at pages,the court examined the history and legislative intent of section at length,noting the difference between the fiduciary duties owed by agents to their clients,and the separate duty codified in section.the court explained that the statutory scheme expressly declared it was not the intent of the legislature to modify or restrict existing duties owed by real estate licensees in enacting section,subd.b see also field,supra,th at.the court ultimately determined that applying the statute of limitations of section to claims of breach of fiduciary duty by a buyer broker would be contrary to the legislature expressed intent,and it would restrict the ability of buyers to obtain redress for fiduciary duties owed by their own brokers that existed before the enactment of section.field,supra,at.
the realtors argue that sections and should apply because they were dual agents,representing both the sellers and the hoa members as buyers.the fact that they were dual agents does not change our conclusion.assilzadeh,supra,th at page,provides instruction.assilzadeh dealt with dual agents.the court noted the limited duties set forth in section and nonetheless explained that dual agents owe further fiduciary obligations to both the buyer and seller.ibid.the court proceeded to describe the scope of those fiduciary obligations,relying on the field court description of the extensive fiduciary obligations that agents owe their buyer clients.id.at.
in sum,section does not replace dual agents fiduciary obligations to their buyer clients.section is the statute of limitations only for breaches of that section.the fac does not allege a breach of section.the statute of limitations in section thus does not apply.
b.the applicable statute of limitations and the discovery concealment 
the earliest statute of limitations to apply to the hoa claims is the statute for its fraud misrepresentation or concealment claim against.code civ,subd.d.the claims for unfair business practices bus,are governed by a statute of limitations.id.the breach of fiduciary duty claims are governed by the catchall statute of limitations in code of civil procedure section.stalberg western title ins.d.
the statute of limitations generally commences running when a cause of action accrues,and generally a cause of action accrues on the date of injury.bernson browning ferris industries cal th.an exception to this general rule is the discovery rule,which holds that the statute begins to run when plaintiffs discover,or through the exercise of reasonable diligence could have discovered,the facts constituting their cause of action.code civ,subd.d norgart upjohn cal th,field,supra,th at.a close cousin of the discovery rule is the principle of fraudulent concealment.bernson browning ferris industries,supra,at.this principle holds that a defendant fraudulent concealment of a cause of action tolls the statute of limitations,but only for that period of time when the claim is undiscovered by the plaintiff,or until such time as the plaintiff,through the exercise of reasonable diligence,should have discovered it.ibid.in order to establish fraudulent concealment,the complaint must show when the fraud was discovered the circumstances under which it was discovered and that the plaintiff was not at fault for failing to discover it or had no actual or presumptive knowledge of facts sufficient to put him on inquiry.baker beech aircraft d.
in the case of either delayed discovery or fraudulent concealment,a plaintiff may not disregard reasonably available avenues of inquiry which,if vigorously pursued,might yield the desired information.bernson browning ferris industries,supra,cal th at.the limitations period begins when the plaintiffs have notice of or information regarding circumstances sufficient to put a reasonable person on inquiry.jolly eli lilly cal d,jolly.the plaintiffs need not be aware of the specific facts necessary to establish their claims.ibid.the parties may learn those through pretrial discovery.ibid.as our supreme court explained in jolly,o nce the plaintiff has a suspicion of wrongdoing,and therefore an incentive to sue,she must decide whether to file suit or sit on her rights.so long as a suspicion exists,it is clear that the plaintiff must go find the facts she can not wait for the facts to find her.id.at.
it is the plaintiff burden to establish facts showing that the discovery rule or the doctrine of fraudulent concealment applies,including facts which allow a legitimate inference that the delay was reasonable.april enterprises,kttv d,saliter pierce brothers mortuaries d.when there has been a belated discovery of the cause of action,whether the plaintiffs exercised reasonable diligence or had constructive notice is a question for the trier of fact,if the facts alleged are susceptible to opposing inferences.e fab,accountants.services th,saliter pierce brothers mortuaries,supra,at.when,however,the allegations bearing on the issue would support only one legitimate inference,the question becomes one of law.saliter pierce brothers mortuaries,supra,at.
breach of fiduciary duty and fraud claims are subject to the discovery rule,but the discovery rule does not apply to unfair business practices claims.code civ,subd.d salenga mitsubishi motors credit of america,th,snapp associates ins.services,robertson th,snapp field,supra
