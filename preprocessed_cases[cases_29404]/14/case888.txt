plaintiff pietro denevi brought this action against defendants barry swenson,green valley corporation green valley,and los gatos country club,llc country club alleging in part that defendants fraudulently induced plaintiff to join them in a venture to develop certain property and to give up,in reliance on their representations,plaintiff right to purchase that property,after which defendants failed to develop the property but instead caused the loss of plaintiff former interest.the trial court granted defendants motion for summary judgment because it concluded that plaintiff,who was a percent owner of country club,had made a binding election of remedies by prosecuting to judgment a derivative action on its behalf against green valley and swenson for the same loss.on appeal plaintiff contends that the judgment in the derivative action does not preclude him from pursuing his personal claims against defendants in this action.we initially held that although plaintiff successful prosecution of the derivative suit did not amount to an election of remedies,it did effectively preclude plaintiff from asserting that defendants had breached any duty owed to him personally.we thereupon granted reconsideration as a matter of right under government code section.we now hold that while our prior analysis was correct as to two of plaintiff causes of action,nothing in this record establishes a bar to his remaining claims.accordingly,we reverse the judgment with directions to summarily adjudicate the two defective causes of action and permit the remaining claims to proceed.
background 
it is undisputed that at the commencement of the events in question,plaintiff held a contractual right to purchase certain property for a total price of million.the contract called for a down payment of.plaintiff entered into an agreement with green valley,of which swenson was the principal,and three other investors,to form a venture to purchase and develop the property.pursuant to this agreement the parties formed county club,to which each of the investors other than plaintiff contributed,and plaintiff transferred his purchase rights,which included a commission or consulting fee payable,under his purchase agreement with the seller,upon close of escrow.
country club,acting largely through green valley,attempted to complete the purchase of the property for a cash down payment of cash,while asserting a right to cover the balance with a credit for the consulting fee the seller refused,demanding among other things that country club pay the entire balance on the down payment in cash.country club failed to do so,but instead sued the seller.the seller prevailed in that litigation and sold the property to another.
in september,plaintiff filed a complaint,no,naming country club,green valley,and swenson as defendants.the original complaint explicitly alleged that it was brought on behalf of country club,and stated a single cause action to the effect that swenson and green valley had breached a fiduciary duty to country club by failing to fund escrow,resulting in loss of the property.plaintiff eventually amended the complaint to plead causes of action,of which nine were personal to plaintiff,one was a restatement of the original derivative claim on behalf of country club,and one arguably stated both personal and derivative claims.the trial court sustained a demurrer to all nine personal claims and dismissed country club as a defendant from the hybrid cause of action,based on its conclusion that there was a defect or misjoinder of parties in that the individual claims name country club,as a defendant,yet country club,is the real party in interest in the derivative claims asserted in the third and eleventh causes of action.as a result of this ruling,the correctness of which is not before us,the complaint in no.asserted only derivative claims,claims vested in country club but prosecuted on its behalf by plaintiff.we will sometimes refer to that matter as the derivative action 
at some point plaintiff brought the present action,no,also against swenson,green valley,and country club.although the original complaint has not been included in either party appendix,this action eventually became the vehicle for plaintiff personal claims and will therefore sometimes be referred to as the personal or individual action.as ultimately amended,the complaint essentially duplicated the one in the derivative action except that it omitted the cause of action for derivative liability.the first and second causes of action alleged that swenson induced plaintiff to transfer his purchase rights to country club by fraudulently or negligently promising to obtain adequate funds to purchase and develop the property.the third cause of action alleged that defendants negligently caused the loss of the property in escrow,and the sixth cause of action alleged that they breached fiduciary duties in the same respect.the remaining causes of action alleged breach of a contractual undertaking to obtain and provide adequate funding,breach of covenant in connection with the contract,interference with plaintiff contractual rights and business prospects the owner of the property,violation of business and professions code sections et,a common count,and quantum meruit.the prayer sought compensatory damages in excess of fifty million dollars,punitive damages,and other relief.
the court denied a motion by plaintiff to consolidate the two actions,finding that there are sufficiently different issues of law and fact and differences relating to the parties such that consolidation may lead to judicial diseconomies.specifically,plaintiff would be suing on behalf of country club,while at the same time bringing suit against country club.
the derivative action came on for trial,ultimately yielding a judgment that plaintiff pietro denevi,on behalf of country club real party in interest,shall have judgment for tort damages against defendants green valley corporation,a corporation,and barry swenson,individually,in the sum of ten million dollars defendants appeal from that judgment,no,is pending in this court.
after entry of the foregoing judgment,defendants moved for summary judgment in this action on numerous grounds,including that plaintiff lacked standing to sue in his personal capacity,that he was attempting impermissibly to r escind the agreement forming the venture in order to sue a second time in his purported personal capacity,and that the action was precluded by the policy against double recovery.the court granted the motion.plaintiff filed this timely appeal from the ensuing judgment.
principles of review 
a moving defendant establishes an entitlement to summary judgment by showing that the action is barred by a complete defense aguilar atlantic richfield cal th,d,quoting code civ,subd.o,or that one or more elements of the cause of action can not be established by the plaintiff.citation.aguilar,supra,cal th at,d.
because a summary judgment motion raises only questions of law,we review the supporting and opposing papers independently to determine whether there is a triable issue as to any material fact.citations.in doing so,we apply the same analysis required of the trial court.first,we identify the issues framed by the pleadings secondly,we determine whether the moving party showing has established facts which negate the opponent claim and justify a judgment in movant favor t he third and final step is to determine whether the opposition demonstrates the existence of a triable,material factual issue.citations.citation.where there is sufficient legal ground to support the granting of the motion,the order will be upheld regardless of the grounds relied upon by the trial court.citation.benavidez san jose police th,d.
we are thus called upon to determine whether,in our independent judgment,defendants negated an element of,or established a complete defense to,each cause of action.we note that defendants moved in the alternative for summary adjudication of each individual cause of action accordingly it was open to the trial court,and is open to this court,to grant the motion as to some but not all causes of action.see code civ,subd.f.
ii.election of remedies 
we first consider whether summary judgment was properly granted on the ground apparently invoked by the trial court,that plaintiff successful prosecution of the derivative action constituted a binding election of remedies,precluding any further pursuit of his individual claims.the trial court wrote,by proceeding to judgment on the derivative claims,plaintiff elected to affirm the operating agreement by which he assigned the option to purchase the property the court noted that plaintiff had failed to raise any issue concerning this election,and cited authorities concerning the doctrine of election of remedies,witkin,california procedure,ed.actions,section,page explaining basis of doctrine,and evans rancho royale hotel d,applying doctrine the plaintiff could not recover damages for fraud after rescinding fraudulently procured contract by mutual agreement.
in our previous opinion,we concluded that the doctrine of election of remedies did not bar the action.we stand by that conclusion.in its conventional form,the doctrine of election of remedies is stated as follows where a person has two concurrent remedies to obtain relief on the same state of facts,and these remedies are inconsistent,he must choose or elect between them and if he has clearly elected to proceed on one,he is bound by this election and can not thereafter pursue the other.election of remedies has been defined to be the right to choose or the act of choosing between different actions or remedies where plaintiff has suffered one species of wrong from the act complained of.broadly speaking,an election of remedies is the choice by a plaintiff to an action of one of two or more coexisting remedial rights,where several such rights arise out of the same facts,but the term has been generally limited to a choice by a party between inconsistent remedial rights,the assertion of one being necessarily repugnant to or a repudiation of the other.citation.witkin,cal.procedure,supra,italics added.
we question whether plaintiff personal claims asserted in this action are properly said to arise from the same state of facts as the derivative claims asserted in the related action.the trial court rationale and defendants arguments assume that this condition is met here,and we originally joined them in that assumption.on reconsideration,however,we are convinced that this is true only as to the third cause of action negligent loss of property in escrow and the sixth cause of action breach of fiduciary duty in allowing loss of property in escrow.as to those claims,summary judgment was properly entered,not because plaintiff had elected a remedy in the derivative action,but because any duty arising in connection with the management of the property in escrow was owed not to plaintiff as an individual,but to the entity,country club,on whose behalf plaintiff has already pursued those claims to judgment.admittedly the judgment in that case is not yet final,and arguably the correct remedy was to abate further proceedings on these causes of action pending such a final judgment,but we can think of no reason to permit them to persist in this action and we will therefore sustain the court ruling insofar as those claims are concerned.
as to plaintiff remaining claims,however,no such conclusion can be justified.the gist of the derivative action was country club loss of the purchase rights due to defendants mismanagement or malfeasance after that entity was particular,the failure to deposit the entire down payment into escrow in cash.plaintiff personal claims all arose prior to that time.most obviously,his claim for fraud rested on the legal injury that he suffered at the moment defendants induced him to part with his purchase rights by,as he alleges,misrepresenting their intentions.the elements of fraud were present at that instant it remained only for plaintiff to discover them.had he done so immediately,he could have sued immediately,and would have been entitled at least to rescind the transaction and recover the rights thus conveyed.the subsequent loss of the rights by county club may well be relevant to plaintiff personal claims,as we discuss below in connection with the issue of duplicative recovery.see,post,at.however,the loss of the property after it was conveyed to country club is neither a necessary nor sufficient part of plaintiff personal claims.given this fact,which defendants do not coherently contest,it is doubtful that plaintiff personal claims can properly be characterized as arising from the same state of facts as the derivative claims he pursued to judgment.
more tellingly,however,even if we were satisfied that the claims all arose from the same state of facts we do not believe that the remedial rights asserted here in connection with plaintiff original transfer of the purchase rights to country club are inherently inconsistent with,let alone necessarily repugnant to or a repudiation of those asserted in the derivative action on country club behalf.the claims are brought on behalf and for the benefit of two distinct juridical personally,and country club.in the absence of a cogent demonstration to the contrary,we must presume that each claimant was entitled to pursue his or its own remedies,even if the underlying rights to relief arose from a single act or course of conduct on the part of defendants.
there is no rule of law of logic that says a single course of conduct can give rise to only one remedy even when it injures more than one person.counterexamples are easy to posit.if corporate executive d fraudulently induces p to convey an asset to the corporation,and then through mismanagement causes the corporation to forfeit the asset to a stranger,d is unquestionably liable to p and to the corporation.and if p happens to be a shareholder perhaps because he conveyed the asset in exchange for stock,there is no reason to require him to choose between his personal right of action for fraud and his derivative right to sue on behalf of the corporation for breach of fiduciary duty.that is essentially the present case,and the doctrine of election of remedies has no application to it because there is no inconsistency,let alone repugnancy,between the personal and derivative claims.
the trial court implicit finding of an inconsistency seems to rest on two suppositions.the first is that the derivative claims amounted to such an affirmation of the agreement to form country club that plaintiff could not thereafter take a position implying,however remotely,a basis to disaffirm that transaction.the second is that the fraud claim inherently dis affirmed the agreement to form country club,and was therefore repugnant to,or amounted to a repudiation of,a transaction plaintiff had already affirmed.
these propositions are themselves repugnant to the well settled rule that one who is induced by fraud to enter into a contract is entitled both to affirm the contract and to sue for damages in tort.to be sure,the law requires one who has been defrauded into entering a contract to choose either to affirm or rescind the contract.witkin,summary of cal.law ed.torts.rescission consists of restoration by the plaintiff of any benefits received under the contract,coupled with restitution to the plaintiff of the consideration which he gave.ibid.in other words,the victim of the fraud may elect to undo the transaction in its entirety,restoring both parties to the status quo ante.however,the victim can not be required to adopt this course he has the right to retain the benefits of the contract,and make up in damages the loss suffered by the fraud.hence,he may affirm the contract,and simply sue for damages for the fraud,italics added.
here there has never been any suggestion that plaintiff elected to rescind the contract making him a member of country club.although the present record does not reflect the complete pleading history of both cases,we are aware of no suggestion that plaintiff ever invoked any of the procedures generally reflecting a rescission.see witkin,cal.procedure,supra,the usual procedure is to give notice of rescission,together with an offer to restore the consideration received doing equity,requir
