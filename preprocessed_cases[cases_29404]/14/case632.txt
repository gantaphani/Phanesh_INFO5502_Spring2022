the city of los angeles city obtained millions of dollars worth of construction work that it does not want to pay for.it believes it is absolved of any obligation to pay by public contracts code section and amelco electric city of thousand oaks cal th,d,amelco on the theory that they dictate a method of proving contract damages,a method that the contractor,dillingham ray wilson drw,says is impossible under the circumstances.below,drw asserted its own claims and claims of subcontractors against the city for breach of a public works contract and obtained an award in excess of million for delays,unpaid contract retention,prompt pay penalties,prejudgment interest and attorney fees.but prior to that,the trial court granted in limine motions and excluded million of drw claims on the theory that it could not document its actual costs as required by contract,it was not permitted to prove damages with engineering estimates,and it was not entitled to prove damages using a modified total cost theory.in the published portion of this opinion,we conclude that the trial court erred because section and amelco impact the measure of damages,not the method of proving them,and also because a modified total cost theory is permissible.further,drw is entitled to litigate whether it was required to document its actual costs as a condition of payment.
by,the city requests reversal of the judgment on the theory that the trial court committed evidentiary and jury instruction error.also,the city argues that the trial court erred when it granted prompt pay penalties and attorney fees pursuant to section,subdivision f,and attorney fees pursuant to the california false claims act.in the unpublished portion of this opinion,we conclude that these arguments lack merit.however,we also conclude that the city raises at least one valid point,which is that the trial court lacked statutory authority to grant continuing prompt pay penalties after judgment was entered 
because prompt pay penalties can not continue after judgment is entered,we modify the award in favor of drw to reflect that interest on the prompt pay penalties shall accrue at percent legal interest postjudgment.as modified,the award in favor of drw is affirmed.the judgment,however,is reversed and remanded for a trial on drw excluded claims 
after competitive bidding,drw was awarded a public works contract c contract by the city to expand the digester capacity at the hyperion wastewater treatment plant.the city was permitted to retain up to percent of each progress payment retention and hold those funds in an escrow account.additionally,it could deduct liquidated damages for delays from any payments made.during construction,the city issued over change orders containing more than changes to the plans and specifications.on rare occasions,the city directed drw to perform changes on a time and materials basis.in general,the city requested an estimate of the cost of work,told drw to commence work and agreed the parties would negotiate a lump sum payment at a later date.though the parties agreed on the compensation payable for some of the time and materials change orders and lump sum change orders,not all the change orders were settled.when drw completed the project,it asked for an equitable adjustment to compensate it for work performed without a price,and for the expenses and losses incurred due to the city interference and delays.the city refused.in addition,the city assessed liquidated damages against drw for delays and did not release the retention funds from escrow.
drw sued the city for breach of contract.the city.the city claim for breach of contract alleged,inter alia,that drw was liable for liquidated damages.other claims were asserted against drw and a subcontractor,cbi services,cbi,for fraud and violation of the california false claims act in connection with their requests for payment.
based on amelco and section,subdivision d the city filed motions in limine to preclude drw from presenting a total cost claim to the jury,and from proving its damages with engineering estimates.the trial court precluded a total cost theory of damages on the grounds that drw evidence in support of the theory was insufficient,and ruled that a modified total cost theory was not recognized in california.next,the trial court ruled that general conditions section gc section of the c contract required drw to proceed on a time and materials basis and document actual costs any time the parties did not agree on a lump sum.drw was precluded from introducing evidence or presenting argument to the jury that it was entitled to recover damages resulting from changes or extra work calculated by any method other than as provided in the c contract.the trial court held a hearing and found that the in limine rulings barred three of drw damages claims claim for the difference between the city estimates and drw estimates on lump sum change orders when the parties did not agree on a price claim for additional payments due from the city because of breaches of the implied warranty of correctness of the plans and for other breaches of contract and claim for the cost of inefficient labor caused by breach of the implied warranty of correctness of the plans.
the case proceeded to trial on drw claims for delay damages,wrongfully withheld retention and prompt pay penalties,and on the city.following the presentation of evidence,the trial court instructed the jury and tasked it with interpreting the c contract.
the jury rendered a general verdict with special interrogatories.the jury found that the city breached the c contract and caused drw damages.under section,the jury concluded that the city assessment of liquidated damages was unreasonable.next,the jury found that the city was not entitled to an offset for liquidated damages,and that it was not entitled to recover on its false claims act claims and fraud allegations.the judgment for drw awarded in contract damages prejudgment interest on the contract damages in prompt payment penalties pursuant to section,subdivision f and postjudgment prompt pay penalties until the retention funds were paid to drw.in posttrial motions under the california false claims act,drw was awarded in attorney fees and cbi was awarded in attorney fees.based on section,subdivision f,the trial court awarded drw in attorney fees expended to recover the withheld retention funds

drw contends that it is entitled to a reversal of the in limine rulings because the trial court should have submitted the interpretation of gc section c to the jury it is entitled to prove its damages with the best evidence available which,in this case,is often engineering estimates and it is entitled to pursue a modified total cost theory of damages.we agree.

gc section c.
gc section c authorized the city engineer to request a quotation on a proposed change.drw was required to submit a quotation on a form entitled change order cost quotation form estimate summary for prime contractor total costs.the form,which was only one page,appeared as attachment a to the general conditions of the c contract.a quotation request was not considered authorization to proceed with the changed work prior to the issuance of a formal change order,unless directed otherwise in writing by the e ngineer.with respect to gc section c change orders for which the city directed drw to commence work and negotiate a price at a later date,and for which the city never agreed on a price or paid,drw proposed to prove at least some of its damages at trial with engineering estimates.
the city,however,argued that when the parties did not mutually determine a lump sum at a later date,drw could only be paid under gc section c.that subdivision provided i f the method or amount of payment can not be agreed upon prior to the beginning of the work,and the e ngineer directs in writing that the work be done on a time and materials basis,drw shall provide labor,equipment,and material necessary to complete the work in a satisfactory manner and within a reasonable period of time.for work performed,payment shall be made for the documented actual cost.the city maintained that this subdivision barred the use of engineering estimates,and that drw was left holding the bag even if documenting actual costs was impossible.
confusion arises because gc section c stated generally that the cost of changed work was supposed to be formulated in accordance with the provisions of gc section c through.this could mean,as drw posited below,that gc section c and c stand alone as provisions.or,assuming without deciding for purposes of this appeal,it could mean that c applied to every cost formulation whether the city directed work to be done on a time and materials basis or not,drw could not get paid under c unless it documented its actual costs as required by c.other provisions of the c contract do not eliminate the obfuscation.gc section b required the city to agree to an equitable adjustment if a change under gc section caused an increase in drw work,but the terms of gc section b did not obligate drw to document its actual costs.under gc section c,drw was obligated to keep records of the cost of changes and the cost of the base scope of the work.it does not indicate the detail with which those costs were to be tracked.thus,we conclude that gc section was reasonably susceptible to more than one meaning and required additional interpretive inquiry.pacific gas thomas drayage rigging cal d.
if a contract is ambiguous,parol evidence is admissible to aid interpretation.employers reinsurance superior court th,d.we may look at,among other things,course of dealings as a practical construction of the terms.and it is permissible to consider the meaning ascribed to language as a matter of custom and practice.franklin marie antoinette condominium owners th,d.
drw presented or adverted to evidence that the parties proceeded under gc section c.the city never directed drw to keep track of the cost of the work as it was being performed.this was because the resolution of the changes was dependent on engineering estimates.for some of the work performed under gc section c,the parties negotiated lump sum payments after the changed work was completed.as for other work,the city did not reject drw estimates based on a lack of actual documentation of costs.rather,the city adopted its own engineering estimates and rejected drw estimates as inaccurate.when the city requested an estimate under gc section c and the parties could not agree on a price before the work commenced,drw often asked to proceed on a time and materials basis.with rare exception,the city refused.
as for custom and practice in the public works industry,drw submitted evidence that time and materials change orders are usually limited to emergency situations or to changes small in cost and scope.for large or complex work,owners prefer using lump sum change orders because time and materials change orders require them to pay for the additional engineering cost of keeping track of the work in the field.lump sum change orders are often negotiated after the work proceeds so the parties can avoid delays or suspension of the work.
this evidence supports drw because its interpretation is consistent with the parties course of dealing as well as custom and practice.
given the patent ambiguity of gc section and the extrinsic evidence offered or referenced by drw in its papers,it was entitled to a trial on contract interpretation.on remand,the trial court must require the jury to make special findings on the disputed issues and then base interpretation of the contract on those findings medical operations management,national health laboratories,d,fn,medical operations,or submit interpretation of ambiguous terms to the jury.horsemen benevolent protective valley racing th,d the trial court did not err in submitting interpretation of an ambiguous term to the jury city of hope national medical center genentech,cal th,d,city of hope.
according to drw,gc section is not a limitation on the method of calculating breach of contract damages,and the law permits it to prove its damages on claim,and with the best evidence available even if that evidence takes the form of engineering estimates.we agree.
because the c contract is a public contract that was awarded pursuant to competitive bidding,drw may not sue for abandonment and recover the reasonable value of its services.amelco,supra,cal th at,d.based on section,subdivision d,the compensation payable to drw for amendments and modifications has to be determined as provided in the c contract amelco and section combine to prevent drw from seeking to recover anything more for changes than it was entitled to receive by contract.this means that the benefit drw would have received for change orders if the city performed is the measure of damages,the measure of contract damages is the amount which will compensate the aggrieved party for all the detriment proximately caused by a breach brandon tibbs george kevorkian accountancy d.breach of contract damages may not exceed the benefit which the plaintiff would have received had the promisor performed.
if,after remands,the trial court or jury interprets the c contract and concludes that gc section did not require drw to document actual costs on the change orders issued by the city,and if engineering estimates are the best evidence of damages available,then drw can offer those estimates to prove its claims.our holding is in line with the common law of contract damages.record.pageman hold.d,record machine while the actual amount of damages from the breach of a contract may not be susceptible of exact proof,the law does not permit one whose act has resulted in loss to another to escape liability on that account the law requires only that the best evidence be adduced of which the nature of the case is capable.when it is clear that a party suffered damages,the fact that the amount of damage may not be susceptible of exact proof or may be uncertain,contingent or difficult of ascertainment does not bar recovery.citations.cal.lettuce growers union sugar cal d,california lettuce growers.of course,a trier of fact will still have to decide if the burden of proof has been met,no damages can be recovered for a breach of contract which are not clearly ascertainable in both their nature and origin.
if,on the other hand,the trial court or jury concludes that drw was obligated to document its actual costs on change orders issued by the city,then there is an issue as to whether documenting actual costs was a covenant to perform rather than a condition to payment and if it was a condition,there is a
