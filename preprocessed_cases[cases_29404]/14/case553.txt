factual and procedural background 
the bid and contract 
in,the city bid out a public works project for the renovation of a city park known as rivera park the project.the renovation included landscaping,irrigation,and the construction of baseball fields,bleachers,a backstop,a children playground,and electrical and concession buildings.the notice inviting bids for the project specified that each bidder shall possess at the time this contact is awarded a class a license general engineering,pursuant to public contract code section.land forms submitted a bid,stating that it had a class a license and a class c license general landscaping.
land forms was awarded the contract for the project.the city eventually paid land forms over the course of the project.
on december,land forms filed a first amended complaint fac against the city alleging a single cause of action for breach of contract.land forms alleged that the city improperly withheld in liquidated damages.land forms sought general damages in excess of.
the city filed an answer,including a general denial.
the cross complaint 
on april,about a month before an estimated day jury trial was scheduled,the city filed a motion for leave to file a seeking disgorgement of all the money it had paid to land forms pursuant to business and professions code section,subdivision b on the ground that recent information revealed land forms had used a sham responsible managing employee rme,james nale,to obtain a class a license for the park project that the city contracted with land forms to complete,and that this sham rme,who was never a bona fide employee of land forms,failed to supervise the project and to be actively involved in land forms business such that land forms class a license was void and invalid.
the trial court granted the motion five days before trial.land forms declined to continue the trial and filed an answer to the.
bench trial phase one 
in its trial brief,the city urged the trial court to proceed by holding a bench trial on the issue of the validity of land forms class a license,since resolution of the issue would be dispositive on both land forms fac and the city.land forms objected,insisting it had a right to a jury trial.pursuant to code of civil procedure section,the trial court held a bench trial on may and,on the issue of whether land forms held a valid class a license during the project.
the city presented documentary evidence and witness testimony.the city evidence showed that land forms obtained a class a license from the contractors state license board based on the representations in both its initial application and renewal application for the license that james nale,who held a class a license,was acting as the rme for land forms.the applications were signed under penalty of perjury by nale and jeff tracy chief executive officer of land forms.
nale,however,testified that he was never an employee of land forms.he was supposed to have been designated instead as a responsible managing officer rmo.he received stock worth percent of land forms,but this stock had to be returned upon demand.he was paid by check per month,which was eventually reduced to per month.he could not recall if the checks were on land forms bank account.no taxes were withheld from the money he received,he was not aware of any payroll records regarding his pay,and he never received or w forms from land forms.land forms never provided him with an office,computer,address or business cards.he never saw the project plans.he visited the project site three times.he could not name a single subcontractor on the project.he did not know if the project had a superintendent.and he could not recall giving any direction or advice to land forms as to what needed to be done on the project.
at the close of evidence,the trial court ruled in favor of the city.in its statement of decision,the court set forth numerous reasons for its conclusions that james nale was neither a responsible managing officer,nor a responsible managing employee of land forms during its work on the project,and that land forms had failed to carry its burden of proving that it was duly licensed with a valid class a license.the court also concluded that land forms had not demonstrated substantial compliance with the licensing requirements under section,subdivision e.accordingly,land forms was barred from bringing its breach of contract claim against the city and was required to disgorge all compensation the city paid land forms for work on the project.
bench trial phase two 
after phase one,the trial court noted that an issue remained regarding the amount of disgorgement,which had not been put into evidence.although land forms had not previously contested the amount paid by the city,it refused to stipulate to any amount.it also argued for the first time that the trial court should make an apportionment of or reduction in the disgorgement amount for any portion of the work on the project that land forms could have properly performed using only its c landscaping license.land forms demanded a jury trial on these issues,which the court refused.the court asked for further briefing and set a briefing schedule.
the city filed a motion to determine amount of disgorgement,which established that land forms had already admitted in verified discovery responses that the city had paid land forms for work on the project.the city also argued that there could be no apportionment as a matter of law.land forms filed an opposition,but presented no evidence to dispute the amount it had already acknowledged receiving from the city.
before phase two of the evidentiary hearing could proceed,land forms filed a petition for writ of mandate to grant it a jury trial on the licensing issues that had already been decided and requested a stay of all proceedings in the trial court.on june,we stayed proceedings in the trial court until further order.on july,we denied land forms petition for a writ of mandate and dissolved the stay.the next day,land forms filed a petition for review with the california supreme court and requested another stay.the california supreme court denied the petition and the stay request.phase two of the evidentiary trial was reset for august.
on august,the city introduced further documentation establishing the amount of compensation it had paid to land forms for its work on the project,and also introduced contract documents showing that the city required the contractor for the project to have a class a license.this evidence was uncontested.
after hearing the evidence and argument from the parties,the trial court entered a judgment in the city favor against land forms.the judgment stated that land forms would take nothing on the fac,which was dismissed in its entirety and with prejudice,and awarded the city the amount of as disgorgement.land forms filed this appeal.
