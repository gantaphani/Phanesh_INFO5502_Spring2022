introduction 
this appeal arises out of a dispute over the meaning of certain provisions of the prevailing wage law and shelley maloney apprentice labor standards act of shelley malony act relating to the employment of apprentices on public works projects.floyd henson,gabriel maestretti,and leonard minor appellants assert that overaa company respondent violated the statutes by hiring construction craft laborer laborer apprentices instead of pipefitter apprentices to work on the construction of certain water treatment plants appellants are pipefitter apprentices,and they seek to represent a class of similarly situated individuals who lost wages and training as a result of respondent alleged violations.the trial court granted summary judgment in favor of respondent on the ground the journeymen on the relevant projects were classified as laborers,and the prevailing wage law merely required employers to hire apprentices who are in the same occupation as the journeymen on their projects.appellants assert the trial court erred because the statutes require a contractor to select apprentices based not on their job title or union affiliation but the work processes on which they have been expressly approved to train.we find the argument unpersuasive and affirm 
background 
legal background 
the prevailing wage law requires that contractors on public works projects pay their employees union wages.among other things,the goals of the statute are to protect employees from substandard wages that might be paid if contractors could recruit labor from distant areas and to permit union contractors to compete with nonunion contractors.lusardi construction aubry cal th.prevailing wage rates are set by the department of industrial relations dir and are predicated on applicable wage rates established by collective bargaining agreements within the locality and in the nearest labor market,among other factors.where the rates are not prevailing in a locality,dir must obtain and consider additional data from the labor organizations and employers or employer associations concerned.ibid.prevailing wage rate determinations generally list the scope of work and craft classifications to which the rates apply.
if the prevailing wage law required contractors to pay all employees union wages,it would present a significant obstacle to the hiring and training of apprentices.see electrical joint apprenticeship com.macdonald cir.the basic idea of an apprenticeship program is to allow training for apprentices who work under the supervision of journeymen and thus to encourage and assist persons to enter into the skilled work force in order for such an apprenticeship program to work,it is essential that the employer be able to pay lesser wages to apprentices while they are in training.ibid.
the drafters of the prevailing wage law took these considerations into account.the statute allows contractors to pay an apprentice a lower apprentice wage if that apprentice is enrolled in a apprenticeship program,subds.b c.thus,while the sponsor of an apprenticeship program need not obtain state approval,there are significant financial incentives to do so.southern cal.ch.of associated builders.com.california apprenticeship council cal th.further,the statute requires employers who hire workers in an any apprenticeable craft or trade to also hire a certain number of apprentices,subd.d.specifically,contractors must hire at least one apprentice for every five journeymen employed on the public works however,an approved apprenticeship program may grant an exemption under certain circumstances,subds.g k.to facilitate training opportunities,the prevailing wage law requires contractors to endeavor to employ apprentices during the same time period that journeymen in the same craft or trade are employed at the jobsite,subd.h.
apprenticeship standards and training are governed by the shelley maloney act,which provides that the director of dir is ex officio the administrator of apprenticeship.apprenticeship standards are also administered by two entities under the auspices of dir the division of apprenticeship standards das and the california apprenticeship council cac.the chief of das administers the apprenticeship law,acts as secretary to cac,and is empowered to investigate standards for apprenticeship programs.those wishing to establish a apprenticeship program must submit written apprenticeship standards to das for approval.reg.among other things,the written standards must include a statement of the occupation s and an outline of the work processes in which the apprentice will receive supervised work experience and training on the job.reg,subd.a.
cac meets at the direction of dir and aids dir in the formulation of polices for the effective administration of apprenticeship laws.cac is also empowered to issue rules and regulations which establish standards for apprenticeship programs and criteria for the selection procedure of apprentices,among other things.ibid.under the prevailing wage law,contractors who employ workers in any apprenticeable craft or trade must make contributions to cac,but may take as a credit for payment any amounts paid to an approved apprenticeship program that can supply apprentices to the site of their public works project,subd.m.
facts and procedural history 
respondent is a general contractor and a signatory to a collective bargaining agreement cba with the northern california district council of laborers laborers union.the cba requires respondent to employ construction craft laborers represented by the laborers union.the cba also obligates respondent to hire apprentices enrolled in the apprenticeship program sponsored by the laborers union.whenever possible,respondent must rotate laborer apprentices through different types of work so that they may become trained in a variety of work operations and work skills.
this case arises out of respondent construction work on dozens of water and sewage treatment systems in northern california,including those owned by the east bay municipal utility district and the alameda county water district.a significant portion of the work on many of these projects involved the installation of sophisticated,three dimensional pipe systems,sometimes referred to as process piping.pursuant to the cba,respondent hired journeymen and apprentice laborers to perform this work.
appellants contend the laborer apprentices hired by respondent were not qualified to work on process piping,though they do not contest respondent decision to hire laborer journeymen for the projects.the apprenticeship standards for the laborers union apprenticeship program indicate that apprentices receive instruction and training on p ipelaying work traditionally performed by construction craft laborers,as well as p ipeline and utility construction.appellants expert opined that pipelaying,as traditionally performed by laborers,bears little resemblance to process piping since pipelaying is work with a minimum number of engineering and physical constraints and is performed in a two dimensional environment.
appellants assert that respondent should have instead hired apprentices from an approved pipefitting apprenticeship program,such as the one in which appellants are enrolled.appellants program is sponsored by the united association of journeymen and apprentices of the plumbing and pipefitting industry pipefitters union,a union with which respondent does not have a collective bargaining agreement.the pipefitters union program provides classroom instruction and training on process piping,which involves,inter alia,cutting,threading,bending,beveling,welding,and assembling various types of pipe.according to the pipefitters union,there are no other programs that offer training and instruction on these process piping skills 
appellants filed this putative class action against respondent in december,claiming that they lost wages and training hours as a result of respondent refusal to hire pipefitter apprentices.they seek to represent all apprentice pipefitters registered on lists in the geographic areas where,and in the time period during which,respondent employed laborers on the projects at issue.appellants allege that respondent is liable under the unfair competition law because it violated section and other relevant provisions of the prevailing wage law.according to appellants,section requires contractors to hire apprentices who are enrolled in programs approved to train and instruct on the specific tasks that the apprentices will need to perform on the project.
the trial court granted summary judgment in favor of respondent.the court held the prevailing wage law requires contractors which employ journeymen in any apprenticeable craft or trade to also employ apprentices from the same craft or trade.it further held that the term craft or trade refers to the journeymen trade or occupation,not the work processes in which they engage on any given day.the court concluded that respondent had no obligation to hire pipefitter apprentices because it did not hire pipefitter journeymen or other workers represented by the pipefitters union.
this appeal followed.various organizations have filed amicus briefs in support of respondent,specifically northern california laborers joint apprenticeship training committee,united contractors,construction employers association,and associated general contractors of california.among other things,the amici assert this case arises out of a jurisdictional dispute between the pipefitters union and the laborers union over whether the members of the pipefitters union should have the exclusive right to perform process piping work on municipal water plant projects.they also assert a ruling in favor of appellants would force respondent and other contractors to breach their cbas with various unions.

plain language of the statute 
this dispute primarily turns on labor code section,a provision of the prevailing wage law pertaining to the employment of registered apprentices.in interpreting the statutory provisions at issue,our primary task is to determine the lawmakers intent.delaney superior court cal d.to determine intent,we first look to the plain language of the statute.ibid.where the statutory language is clear and unambiguous,that language controls and there is no need for judicial construction.ibid.however,that does not mean that we view the language of the statute in isolation.macisaac waste management collection recycling,th.rather,we construe the words of the statute in context,keeping in mind the statutory purpose,and w e will not follow the plain meaning of the statute when to do so would frustrate the manifest purposes of the legislation as a whole or lead to absurd results.ibid.
turning to the statutory text,subdivision b of section states every apprentice employed upon public works shall be employed only at the work of the craft or trade to which he or she is registered.subdivision c states only apprentices training under apprenticeship standards approved by das are eligible to be employed at the apprentice wage rate on public works,and that employment and training of each apprentice shall be in accordance with either the apprenticeship standards and agreements under which he or she is training,or the rules and regulations of cac.under subdivision d,when a contractor on public works employs workers in any apprenticeable craft or trade,the contractor shall employ apprentices in at least the ratio set forth in this section and may apply to any apprenticeship program in the craft or trade that can provide apprentices to the site.subdivision g clarifies that t he ratio of work performed by apprentices to journeymen employed in a particular craft or trade on the public work shall in no case be less than one to five.subdivision h requires the contractor to endeavor,to the greatest extent possible,to employ apprentices during the same time period that the journeymen in the same craft or trade are employed at the jobsite.
the trial court held the statute requires contractors to hire apprentices in the same craft or trade as the journeyman on a public works project,and the craft or trade of a journeyman should be understood to refer to the journeyman occupation,not the work processes in which the journeyman is engaged on any given day.under the trial court reading,if an apprentice is called a laborer and training in an apprenticeship program sponsored by the laborers union,that apprentice is authorized to perform the type of work in which laborer journeymen and other members of the laborers union engage.appellants contend the trial court erred because,under section,it is the written apprenticeship standards that control how a public works contractor must employ and train apprentices,and which apprentices the contractor must hire.citing to subdivision c of the statute,appellants argue e mploying apprentices in accordance with their apprenticeship standards means giving them jobs and only those jobs that teach the skills of their apprenticeship programs.according to appellants,only pipefitter apprentices are eligible to work on the relevant projects because das has authorized only the pipefitters union apprenticeship program to offer instruction and training on process piping.
we agree with the trial court.the prevailing wage law requires that apprentices on public works projects be employed only at the work of the craft or trade to which he or she is registered,subd.b,and the plain language of the statute indicates an apprentice craft or trade is defined by the type of work carried out by the journeymen and other members of the union sponsoring the apprentice training program.specifically,section repeatedly refers to craft or trade in terms of the type of work performed by journeymen.section subdivision d provides that when a contractor employs workers in an apprenticeable craft or trade,the contractor must also hire apprentices from an apprenticeship program in that craft or trade.subdivision g refers to the ratio of work performed by apprentices to journeymen employed in a particular craft or trade.likewise,subdivision h states contractors should endeavor to employ apprentices during the same time period the journeymen in the same craft or trade are employed at the jobsite.this interpretation is also consistent with regulations promulgated under the shelley maloney act,which state that w ork of the craft or trade consists of job duties normally assigned to journeymen in the apprenticeable occupation.reg,subd.c.
under this interpretation,respondent did not violate section.the apprentices hired by respondent are enrolled in the laborers union apprenticeship program,which has been approved by das,and are training to become laborers.the journeymen on the jobsites identify as laborers and are members of the laborers union.moreover,appellants do not dispute that the members of the laborers union hired by respondent are qualified to const
