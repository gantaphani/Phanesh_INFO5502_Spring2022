thomas mahon mahon appeals from a summary judgment entered against him,denying his request for a judicial declaration that his development permit applications were deemed approved under the permit streamlining act act,et he contends the trial court erred in finding that the notice given by respondent county of san mateo county was not the public notice required by law necessary for deemed approval under the statute.we will affirm the judgment.
facts and procedural history 
in february,mahon applied to the county for design review permits to construct a home on each of two adjacent lots,located at and second street in montara,california.the design applications were assigned reference numbers for second street and for second street.
in march and april,the county determined that each project was exempt from environmental review under the california environmental quality act ceqa.see pub.resources code,et this started the period for the county to approve or disapprove the projects.see,subd.a.within this period,county planning staff conditionally approved the permits 
while final approval of the design review permits was pending in july,mahon applied to the county for two building permits,which were assigned reference numbers for second street and for second street.
in october,however,county staff concluded that mahon neighboring property owners had not been given proper notice of the two design permit applications although the county had caused notices to be posted on the project sites,no notice had been mailed to the neighboring property owners.state law,as well as county policy and practice at the time,required such notice.see,subd.a,subd.b.county staff voided the prior conditional staff approvals,pending mailed notice of the project to neighboring property owners.
on october,the county mailed a notice of each design review application to property owners within feet of the project sites.the notices identified the location and description of the projects,including the assessor parcel numbers of the lots and the proposed size of the homes.
two days later,the county caused public notices to be posted on the project sites.the notices for each project identified both the design review permit application and the building permit application.they also described the location of the projects,the proposed square footage,height,and exterior surface of each project,and the date by which comments had to be submitted to the design review officer.
neither the mailed notices nor the posted notices advised that the permits would be deemed approved if the county failed to act within a specified time period.see,subd.b permit not approved or disapproved within statutory time period will be deemed approved if public notice given as required by law.nor did they specify a deadline for taking an appeal.
beginning no later than early november,the county received numerous objections to the projects from neighbors and the community council,complaining that the proposed houses were too large for the lots and neighborhood and did not meet county design review standards.
county planning staff nevertheless issued a conditional approval of the second street project pln on or about october.two weeks later,neighbors appealed the decision to the planning commission.the planning commission granted the appeal on january,reversing the planning staff conditional approval on the ground that the project did not comply with design review standards.mahon appealed this decision to the board,who remanded the matter to the planning commission on august,for consideration of a redesign of the project.
over two years passed.attempting a new tact,mahon hired an attorney who,on february,sent a letter to the county contending that the permit applications had already been deemed approved under the act.see.specifically,it was claimed,the applications became approved as a matter of law when the county failed to approve or disapprove them within the period set forth in section on october,days after the board remanded the permit application back to the planning commission or september,days after mahon submitted the last set of revised plans.the county responded that the projects were not deemed approved,because mahon had not provided the required notice to the county or to the public for deemed approval,subd.b.
on or about april,the planning commission again denied the design permit for second street pln,and mahon appealed the decision to the board.the record indicates that this appeal was scheduled to be heard in february.we have not been advised of any ruling.
the fate of the design review for second street pln was ultimately the same.the county again provided notice of this project by mail to neighboring property owners.in april,county staff conditionally approved the project,mahon neighbors appealed to the planning commission,and on november,the planning commission overturned the staff decision and denied the design permit.mahon appealed the planning commission decision to the board.we have not been informed of any action by the board on this project either.
in june,meanwhile,mahon sued the county and the board in san mateo county superior court.mahon asserted a single cause of action for declaratory relief,seeking a judicial declaration that his design review permit applications were deemed approved by operation of law under the act.
respondents brought a motion for summary judgment,contending that mahon was not entitled to relief as a matter of law because the public notice required by the act had not been provided.the trial court granted the motion and entered judgment against mahon.
this appeal followed.
ii.discussion 
mahon argues that the court erred in granting summary judgment against him,because the county public notice of the projects did,in fact,constitute the public notice required by law necessary for deemed approval.the parties agree that the material facts are undisputed for purposes of this other words,there is no triable issue of material we must determine whether the county was entitled to judgment as a matter of law.code civ,subd.c.
we begin with an overview of the act.we then ascertain the meaning of public notice required by law,based on the statutory language.
background of the permit streamlining act 
the act was enacted in,when the california legislature added chapter,entitled review and approval of development projects,to the government code,commencing with section.stats,ch,see selinger city council d.selinger.the act purpose is to ensure clear understanding of the specific requirements which must be met in connection with the approval of development projects and to expedite decisions on such projects.the term development is defined broadly,and the parties in this matter do not dispute that mahon projects fall within the statutory definition.
the act sets forth time limitations for the approval or disapproval of a project.as relevant here,an agency generally must approve or disapprove a project within days after its determination that the project is exempt from ceqa,subd.a.it is undisputed that the county did not meet this deadline.
to encourage prompt resolution of permit applications,the act provides that an application will be deemed approved if not acted upon within the statutory time period.as originally enacted,section,subdivision b,declared in the event that a lead agency or a responsible agency fails to act to approve or to disapprove a project within the time limits required by this article,such failure to act shall be deemed approval of the development project.stats,ch,italics added.in its original form,therefore,the act did not expressly provide that deemed approval was contingent on the occurrence of public notice required by law.
this changed after due process concerns over the deemed approval process were raised in palmer city of ojai d.palmer.there,the applicable agency had failed to act on a developer applications for a subdivision permit,conditional use permit,and building permit.id.at.the trial court denied the developer petition for a writ compelling the agency to issue the permits,agreeing with the agency that the deemed approv ed provisions of section,subdivision b,were unconstitutional because they did not provide for notice and hearing for neighbors.id.at.the appeals court reversed,concluding that the agency could not use its own failure to provide notice to landowners to invalidate the statute.id.at.the decision in palmer,therefore,turned not on whether the deemed approval of a permit would violate the neighboring landowners property interests or due process rights,but on whether a city could insulate itself from the deemed approval provisions on the grounds of a constitutional violation it purportedly created.
in express response to palmer,the legislature in added the public notice requirements now found in section,such that a permit is deemed approved only if the public notice required by law has occurred,subd.b see stats,ch,rules,off.of floor analyses,reading analysis of assem.bill reg.sess.as amended,selinger,supra,d at,fn.amendment to section was made in tacit recognition of the due process problems inherent in the deemed approval provisions.
thus,subdivision b of section now begins in the event that a lead agency or a responsible agency fails to act to approve or to disapprove a development project within the time limits required by this article,the failure to act shall be deemed approval of the permit application for the development project.however,the permit shall be deemed approved only if the public notice required by law has occurred.italics added.
because other statutes or practice may require the agency to give certain notice to neighboring landowners of a permit application anyway,it is possible the agency would also include the public notice required by law for deemed approval in that same notice.but if the agency fails to do so,the statute permits the applicant to ensure the potential for deemed approval by sending out the public notice required by law itself.the next part of subdivision b reads if the applicant has provided seven days advance notice to the permitting agency of the intent to provide public notice,then no earlier than days from the expiration of the time limits established by sections and,an applicant may provide the required public notice using the distribution information provided pursuant to section.italics added.
the remaining sentences of subdivision b,section,describe what the applicant must include when it undertakes to provide the public notice required by law for deemed approval,including a statement that the project shall be deemed approved if the permitting agency has not acted within days,subd.b.the balance of section,subdivision b states if the applicant chooses to provide public notice,that notice shall include a description of the proposed development substantially similar to the descriptions which are commonly used in public notices by the permitting agency,the location of the proposed development,the permit application number,the name and address of the permitting agency,and a statement that the project shall be deemed approved if the permitting agency has not acted within days.if the applicant has provided the public notice required by this section,the time limit for action by the permitting agency shall be extended to days after the public notice is provided.if the applicant provides notice pursuant to this section,the permitting agency shall refund to the applicant any fees which were collected for providing notice and which were not used for that purpose.italics added.
in the matter before us,the question is whether a statement that the project shall be deemed approved if the permitting agency has not acted within days must also be included in public notice provided by the agency that is,whether this statement is a necessary part of the public notice required by law for deemed approval.
no published decision has resolved this precise issue,although the parties discuss at length two cases that addressed related issues under the act.in selinger,supra,d,the trial court had required a city council to acknowledge that selinger tentative tract map was deemed approved,since the council had failed to act on his application to develop a parcel as a residential subdivision.id.at.the act as it read when selinger filed his the not require notice to neighboring landowners,and the city argued akin to the city in palmer that landowners have a constitutional right to due process relating to adjudicatory decisions of the city.id.at.noting that our supreme court required landowners to be given reasonable notice and an opportunity to be heard before they were deprived of a significant property interest see horn county of ventura cal d,horn,the court in selinger concluded that the permit streamlining act was unconstitutional insofar as it led to approval of applications for development without provision for notice and a hearing to affected landowners.selinger,supra,at.the selinger court observed,however,that the recent amendments to the permit streamlining act resolve the constitutional issue for all current applications for development.id.at,fn.this observation does little to resolve the matter before us now the fact that the phrase public notice as required by law reflects the due process concerns in horn does not identify what specific wording or type of notice the phrase requires.
ciani san diego trust savings bank d.ciani involved the postamendment act,but not the issue we now address.there,a trust wanting to demolish buildings on its land applied to the city for a demolition permit and coastal development permit.the city did not act on either application,and the trust claimed the permits were deemed approved.in describing the terms of the act,the court in ciani stated a condition to this deemed approval is that a the applicant must give the agency days notice of its intent to give public notice,and b the applicant must then give public notice if the agency declines or omits to do so,not earlier than days from the expiration of the time period in question,that the project is to be approved at the expiration of the period if the agency has not acted.ciani,supra,at,italics added.this language implies that a warning of the possibility of deemed approval must be included whether the applicant or the agency provides the public notice.this was not,however,the issue before the court,since the trust applicant was the one who had sent out the public notice,and the notice had included an admonishment about deemed approval.thus,while other issues tackled by the court in ciani have greater relevance to the matter before us see post,ciani did not decide what notice an agency must provide before a permit may be deemed approved under the act.
in sum,we are confronted with the following a project can not be deemed approved without public notice required by law,but section does not define what public notice required by law means the statute specifies an applicant notice must advise that the application will be deemed approved unless acted upon within the statutory time period,but the statute does not specify what is to be included when the agency gives notice.
statutory meaning of public notice required by law 
questions of statutory interpretation are matters of law on which we exercise our independent judgment to discern the intent of the legislature.selinger,supra,d at.we begin with the statutory language,according each word a common sense meaning based on the language used and the evident purpose of the statute.hughes board of architectural examiners cal th,d,hughes.if the language is unambiguous,there is no need for judicial construction.ibid.if the language is susceptible to more than one reasonable meaning,we turn to standard rules of statutory construction and consider other indicia of legislative intent,including the statutory scheme,legislative history and purpose,and public policy.see id.at,d.we also remain mindful that a statute is presumed to be constitutional.selinger,supra,at.thus,if subject to more than one reasonable interpretation,the statute will be construed in a manner upholding its constitutionality.see methodist hosp.of sacramento saylor cal d.
