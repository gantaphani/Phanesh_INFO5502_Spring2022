appellee carlos osorio osorio filed a diversity suit against appellants one world technologies,and ryobi technologies,collectively,ryobi in the united states district court for the district of massachusetts.the complaint alleged claims arising from a hand injury suffered in a construction site accident involving one of ryobi table saws.after an jury trial,the jury found for osorio and awarded damages of million.ryobi then filed a motion for judgment as a matter of law and for a new trial,which the district court denied.ryobi now appeals these decisions.after careful consideration,we affirm the district court decisions on both matters.
background 
on april,osorio suffered a hand injury while he operated a ryobi model benchtop table saw hereinafter,the bts.at the time,osorio worked on a construction site for his employer,a contractor who repairs and installs hardwood floors.earlier that year,his employer had purchased the bts at a home depot store for as osorio used the bts to make a cut along the length of a piece of wood,his left hand slipped and slid into the saw blade,causing severe injury.
osorio sued ryobi,the manufacturer of the saw,claiming negligence and breach of the implied warranty of merchantability at trial,osorio argued that the bts was unacceptably dangerous due to a defective design.osorio largely relied on the testimony of his witness,stephen gass,inventor of sawstop,a mechanism that allows a table saw to sense when the blade comes into contact with flesh,immediately stops the blade from spinning,and causes it to retract into the body of the saw.gass testified that since he developed sawstop in,he has presented the technology to several major manufacturers of table saws,including ryobi in.to date,none of the major power tool manufacturers has adopted sawstop.osorio alleged that the manufacturers failure to incorporate sawstop into their designs is due to a collective understanding that if any of them adopts the technology,then the others will face heightened liability exposure for not doing so as well.
the trial had an element of comparative negligence,which is not being appealed,but which had an effect on the evidence introduced at trial.after an trial,the jury returned a verdict in favor of osorio and awarded damages of million.the jury also found that osorio was negligent and percent at fault for the accident.however,this finding of comparative negligence did not affect the award of damages,as the jury also found ryobi liable for breach of the implied warranty of merchantability.
following the trial,ryobi moved for judgment as a matter of law,alleging that osorio did not meet an obligation to present a feasible alternative design.in the alternative,ryobi moved for a new trial based on plaintiff counsel alleged prejudicial misconduct.the district court denied the motion.osorio v.one world,d.ryobi now appeals.
ii.discussion 
although the parties frame the issues differently,ryobi essentially presents three arguments on appeal.first,ryobi contends that osorio failed to present sufficient evidence to support the jury verdict in his favor on design defect grounds.second,ryobi argues that osorio counsel committed misconduct at trial that prejudiced ryobi defense.third,ryobi claims the district court should not have permitted osorio expert to discredit the bts design in ways ryobi alleges were irrelevant to the case and contests the district court refusal to allow it to show excerpts from a video deposition of osorio.we address each argument in turn.
sufficiency of the evidence claim and categorical liability 
we review the district court denial of a defendant motion for judgment as a matter of law de novo.morales vallellanes potter,cir.in doing so,we consider the evidence presented to the jury,and all reasonable inferences that may be drawn from such evidence,in the light most favorable to the jury verdict.granfield csx,cir quoting cigna ins.oy saunatec,cir.we will only reverse the district court denial of ryobi motion if the facts and inferences point so strongly and overwhelmingly in favor of the movant that a reasonable jury could not have reached a verdict against that party.santos sunrise,cir quoting star fin,aastar mortg,cir internal quotation marks omitted.
sufficiency of the evidence to prove a design defect 
under applicable massachusetts law,warranty liability is a remedy intended to be fully as comprehensive as the strict liability theory of recovery of many other jurisdictions.back wickes.accordingly,manufacturers must design products so that they are fit for the ordinary purposes for which such goods are used.laws ch,c.a product is reasonably fit for its purposes if the design prevents the reasonably forseeable sic risks attending the product use in that setting.marchant dayton tire rubber,cir quoting back,at.thus,massachusetts law is congruent in nearly all respects with the principles expressed in the restatement second of torts.back,at.
a reasonably fit product need not be a product,however.even where the product design creates a risk of foreseeable harm,the question is whether this risk was unreasonable.marchant,at quoting raney honeywell,cir internal quotation marks omitted see also restatement second of torts.guiding our judgment in the instant case,the supreme judicial court of massachusetts has explained that relevant factors to assess the suitableness of a product design include 
the gravity of the danger posed by the challenged design,the likelihood that such danger would occur,the mechanical feasibility of a safer alternative design,the financial cost of an improved design,and the adverse consequences to the product and to the consumer that would result from an alternative design.
back,at quoting barker lull eng g,cal d,cal internal quotation marks omitted.the jury is free to balance all competing factors,including the perceived feasibility of a proposed alternative design.see marchant,at.as a result,plaintiff case is not automatically defeated merely because the alternative design was not being used at the material time.id.at.
ryobi argues that osorio failed to meet a prima facie obligation to present a reasonable alternative design for the product at issue that accounted for the weight,cost,and other features particular to the bts.this amounts to two arguments that the record evidence was insufficient to permit the jury to make a reasoned determination and that massachusetts law requires a prima facie showing on all of these factors.both are incorrect.
because the evidence at trial showed that a benchtop saw that incorporated sawstop into its design would likely be larger,heavier,and more expensive than the bts at issue,ryobi insists that osorio proffered design falls short of being a viable alternative.accordingly,ryobi would like us to conclude that osorio did not meet his burden and hold that ryobi is entitled to judgment as a matter of law.
operating as we must under the applicable massachusetts principles,we do not conclude that the added cost or increased weight of osorio proposed alternative design is fatal to his case as a matter of law.it is the province of the jury to determine whether the relevant factors,properly balanced,suggest that a product design is unreasonable.see back,at.the increase in expense of a proposed alternative is but one of those factors and the jury was free to determine that the costs of such an alternative exceeded its benefits.marchant,at rejecting proposition that plaintiff must prove that the alternative design was efficient on a basis.evidence relating to the mechanical feasibility or increased weight of an alternative design may be similarly balanced.where,as here,the trial judge adequately instructed the jury as to the applicable design defect test under massachusetts law,we have not found reason to question the jury findings.see id.such an instruction to the jury is all that back wickes requires.
the viability of adding sawstop to a small,portable saw was a major issue during the litigation,amounting to what the district court described as hours of testimony on the cost and feasibility of incorporating the technology into the bts osorio,d at.at trial,osorio expert offered testimony that a benchtop saw like the bts that incorporated sawstop technology could still be carried between jobsites.the jury also heard testimony suggesting that ryobi was in the process of developing technology through a joint venture with competing manufacturers.with regards to cost,the record reveals that over the course of an trial the jury had ample opportunity to hear the parties competing propositions on the issue.on osorio behalf,gass testified that sawstop technology would add less than to the price of a table saw and osorio other expert witness,robert holt,seems to have accepted this figure.on,ryobi probed and challenged osorio proposed alternative design.pressed by ryobi counsel,gass testified that the sawstop system can trigger without having actually been touched by a person,particularly when cutting wet or wood.because portable saws used by contractors are sometimes exposed to the elements and rough treatment,the jury heard testimony that these conditions could increase the chances of a malfunction of the sawstop system.finally,the parties also disputed whether a small benchtop saw like the bts could properly absorb the force necessary to stop a rapidly spinning saw blade.
secondly,as a matter of law,we do not find support for ryobi suggestion that a plaintiff asserting a design defect claim must present an alternative design that meets all the back factors prima facie.quite the opposite,all massachusetts law requires is that competing factors should be balanced when deciding reasonableness of design.marchant,at internal quotation marks omitted.
in marchant,we addressed an argument similar to the one ryobi advances,where the district court had granted defendants motion for judgment as a matter of law on the grounds that a plaintiff asserting a design defect claim did not prove to the jury the efficiency of the alternative design.id.at.reinstating the jury verdict in favor of the plaintiff,we rejected the defendants claim that the plaintiff must prove that the alternative design was efficient on a basis.id.at.pertinent to the instant case,we also noted that where the defendant manufacturer felt its product design was reasonable,it was its responsibility to produce evidence in support of such a theory.id.
ryobi claim that osorio needed to make a prima facie showing of a feasible alternative design meeting the back factors is also undermined by the massachusetts supreme judicial court decision in smith ariens,which guided our analysis in marchant.in marchant,we explained 
in smith the sjc upheld a verdict that a snowmobile was designed such that an unreasonable risk of harm was created,where the only evidence relied upon by the jury was the snowmobile itself.not only did the plaintiff in smith fail to address the costs and efficiencies of alternative designs,but no alternatives were even suggested.
at internal quotation marks omitted.contrary to ryobi claim,smith,then,suggests that massachusetts product liability law may tolerate a finding of design defect even in the absence of evidence supporting the existence of a feasible alternative design.see smith,at i n cases in which a jury can find of their own lay knowledge that there exists a design defect which exposes users of a product to unreasonable risks of injury,expert testimony that a product is negligently designed is not required.
categorical liability 
as a corollary to its sufficiency argument,ryobi claims that osorio suit is essentially an attempt to hold a manufacturer liable for injuries caused by its product in the absence of a conventional defect and despite the fact that a feasible safer alternative is not available,a categorical liability theory that courts have traditionally rejected.see,kotler am.tobacco,cir the pivotal question is whether,in the absence of a defect,breach of warranty can be found based solely on a analysis.we think this question must be answered in the negative,vacated,d,aff on remand,cir.however,before we examine the merits of ryobi claim,we must resolve a threshold matter whether,as osorio contends,ryobi failed to preserve its categorical liability argument by not including it in its motion for judgment as a matter of law at the close of the evidence.
a challenge to the sufficiency of the evidence such as the one ryobi presses on appeal must first be raised at the close of all the evidence at trial.see.a sánchez oil,cir.if,as in the instant case,the district court denies the litigant motion for judgment as a matter of law and the case is submitted to the jury,the movant must renew the motion once again in order to preserve the issue for appeal.zachar lee,cir citing.b.under rule b,a renewed motion must limit itself to the issues raised in a movant prior rule a motion.parker garrish,cir correa hosp.san francisco,cir.
ryobi conceded in its rule a motion that osorio had presented evidence critical of the bts,but argued that osorio had failed to offer sufficient evidence for the jury to conclude that the subject saw was not designed with reasonable care or that the saw was both defective and unreasonably dangerous.the district court denied this motion.ryobi rule b motion for judgment as a matter of law renewed this sufficiency attack,but also accused osorio expert witnesses of advancing the position that the bts and all portable benchtop table saws like it are inherently unsafe and should not be sold.osorio,ryobi asserted,could not invoke massachusetts product liability law to impose categorical liability on a class of products.as before,the district court denied this motion.on appeal,ryobi revives the arguments it set forth in its rule b motion.
we do not find that ryobi waived the categorical liability argument it now asks us to consider.the crux of ryobi argument is that osorio did not show that a feasible alternative design for an inexpensive,lightweight benchtop table saw like the bts existed.the alternative design osorio proposed at trial,ryobi argument continues,would drastically alter a saw like the bts,resulting in a heavier,less portable,and more expensive product.ryobi maintains that its categorical liability argument simply seeks to flesh out the question of whether osorio satisfied his burden of presenting an alternative design for the bts an issue contested at each stage of the litigation.reviewing the record,we agree.
throughout the litigation,ryobi has argued that sawstop could not be incorporated into the bts design without radically altering the nature of the product and its cost.accordingly,we believe that ryobi failure to explicitly invoke categorical liability in its rule a motion did not constitute a waiver of its argument.see lynch city of boston,cir rule a does not require technical precision in stating the grounds of the motion.it does require that they be stated with sufficient certainty to apprise the court and opposing counsel of the movant position with respect to the motion.citing wright miller,federal practice and procedure,at.
osorio suit as impermissible categorical liability 
ryobi claims that instead of presenting a viable alternative design,osorio set out to prove that the entire category of lightweight,inexpensive,benchtop table saws to which the bts belongs was defective,in part because the saws manufacturers have not incorporated braking systems into their designs.taken to its logical conclusion,ryobi contends,osorio theory would hold manufacturers of portable and economical benchtop saws liable for all injuries suffered by victims of accidents involving their products.
to support its argument,ryobi cites several cases,namely the fourth circuit decision in dreisonstok volkswagenwerk,cir.in that case,the district court,sitting without a jury,found that the product at issue,a volkswagen microbus,was defective because it was not as crashworthy as a standard passenger car.the fourth circuit reversed,concluding that the volkswagen microbus had specific features such as maneuverability,low cost,and its utility to transport people or cargo that made it attractive to many consumers.id.at.the dreisonstok court explained that these features involved safety tradeoffs discernible to consumers and rejected what it saw as the plaintiff call to impose a on design by requiring that all vehicles conform to the standards of another class of vehicle.id.at.
ryobi concedes that its cited examples of the categorical liability theory are often clear about plaintiffs intentions,for example,by attempting to impose liability for injuries caused by an entire class of products.accordingly,in kotler,cited by some commentators as a classic categorical liability case we were unwilling to hold a manufacturer liable for alleged design defect based on a theory that its cigarettes were inherently defective.see at appellant design initiative rested not on the contention that appellees cigarettes could have been made safer,but solely on the considerably different contention that the cigarettes were defective because the risks inherent in their consumption outweighed their social utility.however,ryobi posits that the categorical liability concept extends beyond those cases into others where the claim is more subtle.as examples,ryobi points us to two cases.
in the first,wasylow glock,the district court rejected the plaintiff challenge at the summary judgment stage,finding that a proposed alternative design for a handgun appeared both feasible and safer,but would alter the product functional purpose.at.in the second,linegar armour of america,cir,the eighth circuit rejected a design defect challenge to a certain kind of vest that offered less coverage than other models but allowed the user greater mobility and heat dissipation,among other features.at.doing so,the linegar court noted the likely effect on product availability of holding in the plaintiffs favor,noting that manufacturer s are not obliged to market only one version of a product,that being the very safest design possible.if that were so,automobile manufacturers could not offer consumers sports cars,convertibles,jeeps,or compact cars.id.at.ryobi contends that,like osorio suit,these cases form part of the categorical liability catalogue because accepting the plaintiffs claim required a fundamental disregard of the defining characteristics of the product at issue.
we are not convinced that osorio suit reaches into impermissible categorical liability.the absence of an alternative design is a defining characteristic of categorical liability theory.see restatement third of torts products liability cmt.d see also harvey grossman,categorical liability why the gates should be kept closed,noting the doctrine imposes liability even though there is no reasonable design alternative that could be used to avoid injuries.here,an alternative design was not only offered,but also discussed,examined,and debated.at the district court the parties explained and probed the merits of an alternative design incorporating the sawstop system.ryobi repeatedly challenged osorio proposed design raising many of the arguments against sawstop it now raises on appeal,particularly on the issue of added weight.see osorio,d at.just as we conclude that the evidence presented was sufficient to allow the case to reach the jury,it seems similarly plain that considering the evidence before it,the jury simply agreed with osorio case and found in his favor.
counsel alleged misconduct at trial 
ryobi motion to the district court also contained a request for a new trial under.on appeal,ryobi again points to several allegedly impermissible statements and other improper conduct on the part of osorio counsel that ryobi says prejudiced its case to the extent that a new trial is necessary.ryobi claims that osorio counsel sought to inflame the jury by repeatedly referencing ryobi size,earnings,and foreign ownership cited irrelevant and unsupported statistics of numbers of table saw accidents including those attributed to ryobi attempted to connect ryobi with a power tool manufacturer conspiracy to keep technology off the market and improperly urged the jury to send a message to ryobi management by finding for explicitly,during opening statement and again,as an implicit theme,at closing arguments after the judge advised against introducing purely emotional elements to the jury deliberations.
we review the denial of a motion for a new trial for abuse of discretion,mindful of the deference due to the district court judgment.happ,cir.in assessing the effect of improper conduct by counsel,the court must examine the totality of the circumstances,including the nature of the comments,their frequency,their possible relevancy to the real issues before the jury,the manner in which the parties and the court treated the comments,the strength of the case,and the verdict itself.aqueduct sewer auth.constructora lluch,cir.we do not reverse in the absence of prejudice to the appellant case.santos,at.
while ryobi does point us to some conduct that could be considered problematic,we are unconvinced that the district court abused its discretion in refusing to grant a new trial.we are most concerned by counsel suggestion during opening statements that the jury send a message to ryobi management by imposing liability since,as ryobi notes,we have deemed similar arguments improper in the past.see smith kmart,cir noting plaintiff call to send a message was improper request for punitive damages.here,however,the district judge acted competently to prevent ryobi case from being prejudiced.at trial,ryobi objected to the use of the phrase send a message and osorio counsel asserted that he would refrain from using it during closing argument.in light of counsel assertion,the court then stated that it would not further restrict any statements,but warned both parties against introducing purely emotional elements into jury deliberations.although ryobi claims that osorio counsel nevertheless then implicitly asked the jury to send a message during closing argument,we agree with the district court that plaintiff counsel later statements to the jury were within the bounds of propriety.osorio,d at.
evidentiary issues 
ryobi also raises two evidentiary claims on appeal.we review the district court evidentiary rulings for abuse of discretion.monteagudo asociación de empleados del estado libre asociado de,cir.even if erroneous,we disregard any defect below which does not affect the substantial rights of the parties.kelley airborne freight,cir quoting.
first,ryobi argues that the district court erred by allowing osorio witness,holt,to disparage the design of the bts in ways that ryobi claims were irrelevant to the case at issue and prejudicial to its case.specifically,holt suggested that the design of the bts guiding rip fence and safety blade guard were defective and commented on the saw dimensions,motor,and warnings.ryobi contends that these comments were irrelevant because osorio conceded that he did not use the blade guard at the time of the accident and,thus,no alternative guard design would have helped to avoid osorio accident.
here,the district court did not abuse its discretion.viewed in the context of the parties dispute,it is clear that holt comments went to a major and controverted issue at trial whether osorio was partly at fault for the accident that caused his injury.ryobi counsel tried to convince the jury that osorio was largely to blame,in part because he did not use the blade guard and removed the guiding rip fence before using the bts.conversely,osorio sought to prove that it was common for consumers to remove this equipment and that ryobi should have accounted for this probability in its design.holt testimony bore on this controversy and was patently relevant to the proceedings.see bielunas misty dawn,cir.
second,ryobi claims that the district court erred by not allowing the jury to watch an excerpt from a video deposition of osorio which,ryobi alleges,was inconsistent with osorio statements at trial describing the cut he made when he injured himself.osorio responds that ryobi did not adequately preserve this issue and has thus waived it on appeal.even if ryobi preserved the claim,osorio argues that the district court did not abuse its discretion when it refused to allow ryobi to use the proposed video deposition and avers any error was harmless.
we do not find any evidence
