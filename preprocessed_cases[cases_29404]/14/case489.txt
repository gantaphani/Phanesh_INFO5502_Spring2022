background 
renda is a marine dredging contractor.under the contract,it was required to increase the depth of the navigation channel to feet mean low tide mlt.merits decision at.this means that the channel had to be dredged to a depth feet below its level at mlt.
during the period between january and october of,renda submitted various claims to the co,including seven differing site condition claims.reconsideration decision at.after its claims were denied,on april,renda filed suit in the court of federal claims.id.in its suit,renda challenged the co denial of its seven differing site condition claims,as well as the co denial of an additional claim that was based upon the corps alleged constructive modification of the contract.see merits decision at.based upon its claims,renda sought additional compensation under the contract in the total amount of.id.
during the period between february,and april,the court of federal claims conducted a trial on renda eight claims.id.at.thereafter,on july,the court issued a decision in favor of the government,holding that renda was not entitled to recover on any of its claims.id.at.
on november,while renda suit was pending in the court of federal claims,the co issued a final decision under the contract asserting six separate government claims against renda,in the total amount of.reconsideration decision at.in his final decision,the co informed renda that it had the right to appeal the decision to the armed services board of contract appeals asbca within days of receipt of the decision,see,or to initiate an action in the court of federal claims within twelve months of receipt of the decision,see id.a.reconsideration decision at.
renda received the co final decision on or about november.id.at.thus,it had until february,to challenge the decision in the board of contract appeals and until november,to do so in the court of federal claims.renda,however,did not pursue either course.instead,on july,roughly nineteen months after the approximate date on which it received the final decision,it sought leave to amend its complaint in the ongoing court of federal claims litigation in order to challenge the validity of the decision there.id.at.the court of federal claims denied renda motion on july,on the ground that renda challenge to the co decision was untimely.id.subsequently,on april,the court denied a second motion by renda to amend its complaint to challenge the co decision,again on the ground that renda challenge to the decision was untimely.id.
on june,following the completion of trial,but prior to the issuance of the merits decision,renda sought reconsideration of the court of federal claims decision denying its motion for leave to amend its complaint.id.at.in its motion,renda asserted that the government claims in the co november,decision were related to the claims in renda suit in the court of federal claims.starting from this premise and relying upon our decision in sharman united states,overruled on other grounds by reflectone,dalton,en banc,renda argued that its suit divested the co of authority to render a final decision on the government claims,thereby rendering the co november,decision a nullity inasmuch as it issued after the initiation of litigation by renda.reconsideration decision at.on june,the court denied renda motion,holding that,because renda had failed to appeal the co final decision within the period set forth in the cda,a,renda was precluded from challenging the validity of the decision.reconsideration decision at.

discussion 
on appeal,renda challenges both the merits decision and the reconsideration decision.as far as the former is concerned,renda argues that the court of federal claims erred insofar as it denied renda compensation for one of its seven differing site condition claims.that claim involved a section of the navigation channel known as the flare area.turning to the reconsideration decision,renda argues that the court of federal claims erred in denying it leave to amend its complaint in order to challenge the co november,final decision.we address these contentions in turn.
we consider first renda differing site condition claim.the flare area was a portion of the navigation channel where the width of the channel flare d out from to feet to permit safe passage of ships.merits decision at.while performing dredging work in the flare area,renda encountered stiff clays in locations where it claimed it expected to encounter soft clays.id.at.the presence of stiff clays allegedly increased renda cost of performing under the contract,leading renda to seek some million in additional compensation and approximately additional days in contract performance time.id.ultimately,the corps awarded renda an additional million and extended the time for contract performance by days.id.at.after the co denied renda claim for the million difference between renda original claim and what the corps had awarded it,renda included the flare area claim in its suit in the court of federal claims,where it sought to recover additional compensation for the claim.id.
in the court of federal claims,renda presented the flare area claim as based upon an alleged type i differing site condition.a type i differing site condition arises when the conditions encountered differ from what was indicated in the contract documents.see far,a b.it is distinguished from a type ii differing site condition,which arises when the conditions encountered are of an unusual nature and differ materially from those normally encountered in the kind of work contemplated by the contract.see id.in order to be eligible to recover for a type i differing site condition,a contractor must first prove,as a threshold matter,that the contract contained some identification of the conditions to be encountered at the site.mac,united states,maffei.wrecking united states.the contractor must then prove by a preponderance of the evidence that the conditions encountered during the contract performance differed materially from the conditions indicated in the contract.to carry this burden,the contractor must demonstrate that the conditions encountered were not reasonably foreseeable in light of all information available to the contractor when bidding,that the contractor reasonably relied upon its original interpretation of the contract,and that the contractor suffered damages as a result of the material variation between the conditions expected and those encountered.mac,at stuyvesant dredging united states.
