defendant,and appellant alhambra unified school district the district appeals a judgment following a jury verdict in favor of plaintiff,and respondent voskanian construction,voskanian,and and respondents fidelity deposit company of maryland fidelity and old republic general insurance corporation old republic.
the essential issues presented relate to the right of voskanian,a general contractor,to recover for extra work it performed on two public works contracts.
as to the first contract,the relocation contract,voskanian is entitled to recover for its extra work because the district eventually issued written change orders authorizing the extra work.
as for the second contract,the fire alarm contract,notwithstanding the lack of a written change order,voskanian is entitled to recover for the extra work that was required because its bid was based on misleading plans and specifications issued by the district.souza mccue const.superior court cal d,souza.
therefore,the judgment is affirmed.
factual and procedural background 
in june,following competitive bidding,voskanian and the district entered into a written contract the first contract or the relocation contract,under which voskanian was to serve as general contractor for the district and provide certain improvements as part of a project known as the moor field program relocation,for compensation of.pursuant to the agreement,voskanian was to move numerous portable buildings to the site of the moor field campus.
the first contract,as well as a subsequent contract the second contract provided at section that this agreement and the other project documents can be modified only by an amendment in writing,signed by both parties and pursuant to action of the district governing board.further,section of the contracts,captioned change orders,stated that change orders submitted by the contractor may be approved by the district assistant superintendent of business services,or her designee.italics added.the district assistant superintendent of business services assistant superintendent was cynthia martin.the first and second contracts did not specify how a designee is appointed.
during the course of the project,martin directed voskanian to deal with mark edwards and james courteau of brj associates brj,the construction manager,to finalize changes orders with them,and then she would approve whatever they agreed to.the project was under time constraints and had to be completed before schoolchildren returned to school in early september.the relocation project had to be completed within days,and the fire alarm project had to be completed within days.the projects could not be halted for months until the district board formally approved each change order.the district required the extra work to be completed immediately and then the change orders would be bunched together to be processed by the district.
during the course of the relocation contract,the district and its representatives asked voskanian to make changes to remedy errors made by the district architect when preparing the plans,to resolve problems that arose because the site conditions did not match what was contained in the plans,and because the district wanted work outside the scope of the plans.
during the course of the relocation contract it also became clear the architect neglected to include a fire alarm system for the relocated buildings.therefore,the district prepared new plans and solicited bids for the new fire alarm project.voskanian bid was the lowest.voskanian and the district then entered into the second contract,the fire alarm contract,wherein voskanian was to serve as the general contractor for the fire alarm project.
in accordance with the two contracts,voskanian also obtained performance bonds from fidelity.
in soliciting bids for the fire alarm system for the portable buildings that were part of the fire alarm project,the district required bidders to submit their bids based on the plans and specifications provided at the time of bidding.during the bidding process,voskanian participated in a job walk arranged by the district,to ascertain the interior configurations of the buildings for the fire alarm project.however,because the walkthrough occurred while classes were in session,participants were allowed to view only two of the buildings,and from the doorways only.voskanian was given a set of the plans only after the job walk,and therefore did not have the benefit of the plans while conducting the job walk.
after voskanian was awarded the fire alarm contract,it discovered that many of the portable buildings had more rooms than shown on the plans,thus requiring more alarm devices,conduit and wiring.for example,one of the buildings was shown on the plans as a single room with no interior walls however,as built,that structure had six interior rooms.due to the error in the plans,voskanian requested that the district approve a change order for the extra devices that would be needed for the rooms not shown on the plans.
the district originally agreed to pay voskanian for the work performed on the relocation contract,not including the change orders.the district also agreed,before the error in the plans was discovered,to pay voskanian for the work performed on the fire alarm contract,not including the change orders.
upon completion of the work,the district refused to pay voskanian the full amount due.
in accordance with the contracts,voskanian submitted a claim to the district pursuant to government code section et voskanian asserted that on the relocation contract,it was owed,including in unpaid retention and for extra work that was unpaid.voskanian also sought on the fire alarm contract,consisting of the entire contract amount of plus for extra work on that contract.

the district filed a against voskanian for breach of contract.the district also named fidelity and old republic,seeking to enforce the terms of two performance bonds issued by fidelity and a contractor license bond issued by old republic.
on july,through august,the matter was tried to a jury.the jury returned a special verdict awarding voskanian,including penalties and interest,the precise amount voskanian had requested at trial.the special verdict included the following findings a portion of the relocation contract between the district and voskanian was modified by an oral agreement the oral modification was the designation of brj and james courteau as designee of the district the district breached the relocation contract by failing to pay voskanian for work done and by failing to pay retention amounts due voskanian was entitled to recover against the district on the relocation contract the district also breached the fire alarm contract project its breach consisted of nonpayment for work done by voskanian and failing to respond to requests for information within a reasonable time and voskanian was entitled to recover from the district on the fire alarm contract

contentions

discussion 
general principles contractual requirement that change order to public works contract be in.earlier cases.
it is frequently provided that change orders for extra work must be in writing.in the absence of a waiver or modification,no recovery can be had for alterations or extra work performed without compliance with such a provision.cal.jur d public works and contracts,italics added,fns.omitted accord cal.constr.manual ed.waiver by conduct,
an example of a contractor recovering for extra work in the absence of a written extra work order is found in healy brewster d.healy was the general contractor and brewster was the excavation subcontractor on a county airport job.the county engineer submitted a log of borings that represented the job site to be sand and sandy loam.however,the county did not use core drills,but rotary earth drills,which gave inaccurate results.it turned out that instead of the expected sandy loam,most of the material was unsatisfactory hardpan.id.at.
subcontractor brewster called attention to the unexpected hardpan conditions and was told by healy to go ahead with the job and that brewster would be compensated for the extra expense.healy,supra,d at.this was done orally,despite the provision in the subcontract calling for a written change order.id.at.healy,the general contractor,submitted a claim to the county for extra work the county refused to pay.id.at.thereafter,healy refused to pay brewster,who sued healy and recovered judgment for.id.at.
the reviewing court affirmed.it held,inter alia,the parties by their conduct,waived the subcontract requirement for a change order to be in writing.healy,supra,d at,italics added.when healy promised to pay brewster the reasonable value of the extra hardpan work,and brewster relied upon such promise in performing the hardpan work,that conduct resulted in a waiver of the requirement that extra work be approved in writing.ibid.
a subsequent case,weeshoff constr.los angeles county flood control dist.d weeshoff,held the conduct of the parties may constitute a waiver of a written change order provision even without an express promise to pay for the extra work.cal.constr.manual,supra,waiver by conduct.in weeshoff,a contractor sued a flood control district to recover for extra work in laying temporary pavement in the course of its performance of a construction contract.the district did not issue a written change order in accordance with the contract change in work provision.id.at.however,the evidence showed the district representative had ordered the contractor superintendent to use temporary pavement.id.at.the trial court awarded the contractor for extra work performed.id.at.
the reviewing court affirmed.it observed,california courts generally have upheld the necessity of compliance with contractual provisions regarding written change orders.citations.however,california decisions have also established that particular circumstances may provide waivers of written change order requirements.if the parties,by their conduct,clearly assent to a change or addition to the contractor required performance,a written change order requirement may be waived.bolster boespflug,d,frank hickey,council,d.weeshoff,supra,d at,italics added.
b.more recent cases.
in katsura city of san buenaventura th katsura,an engineer and a city entered into a contract for consultant services for a maximum price of.id.at.the contract required that any modifications were only to be made by mutual written consent of the parties.ibid.the city paid the engineer first two invoices,which totaled.id.at.after completion of the project,the engineer submitted a final invoice for an additional,which the city refused to pay because it was beyond the maximum contract price and included work that was not authorized by the contract.id.at.the engineer sued the city for breach of contract and common counts.he admitted he did not follow the contract written modification requirement,but argued the contract was orally modified to include extra work based on requests by the city associate engineer and an outside consultant that he perform the work.id.at.
katsura held the concept of oral modification was inapplicable,explaining persons dealing with a public agency are presumed to know the law with respect to any agency authority to contract.citation.one who deals with the public officer stands presumptively charged with a full knowledge of that officer powers,and is bound at his peril to ascertain the extent of his powers to bind the government for which he is an officer,and any act of an officer to be valid must find express authority in the law or be necessarily incidental to a power expressly granted.katsura,supra,th at.
katsura further explained,there is no provision in the city charter for execution of oral contracts by employees of the city who do not have requisite authority.the alleged oral statements by the associate city engineer and project manager are insufficient to bind the city.no government,whether state or local,is bound to any extent by an officer acts in excess of his authority.katsura,supra,th at.katsura added,we are not unsympathetic to the seeming unfairness of denying payment for work done in good faith by one who has no actual knowledge of the restrictions applicable to municipal contracts.id.at.katsura noted,however,the engineer was not the victim of an innocent mistake,as he was aware of the public contracting procedure and that the extra work was outside the scope of the contract.ibid.
katsura also rejected the engineer reliance on weeshoff,supra,d,explaining,the continuing viability of weeshoff is questionable.in pronouncing that california decisions have also established that particular circumstances may provide waivers of written change order requirements,and i f the parties,by their conduct,clearly assent to a change or addition to the contractor required performance,a written change order requirement may be waived,the weeshoff court cited cases involving private parties,not public agencies.weeshoff constr.los angeles county flood control,supra,d.since its publication years ago,no case has cited weeshoff for this point.this is understandable as it is contrary to the great weight of authority,cited above,to the contrary.katsura,supra,th at.
p d consultants,city of carlsbad th p d is in accord with katsura.p d,a breach of contract action,arose from a written agreement between a contractor and a city for services pertaining to a redesign of a municipal golf course.on appeal,the city contended that as a matter of law,the jury award of to the contractor for extra work could not stand because there was no written change order,in violation of provisions of the contract and public contract law,the city argued the trial court erred in instructing the jury that the contract could be modified orally or through the parties conduct.th at.
p d reversed the judgment based on the contract requirement of a written change order.unlike private contracts,public contracts requiring written change orders can not be modified orally or through the parties conduct.thus,even if the contractor evidence pertaining to the oral authorizations of a city employee for extra work is fully credited,the contractor can not prevail.the trial court erred by submitting the matter to the jury it should have granted the city motion for nonsuit.p d,supra,th at,italics added.
p d also reiterated katsura criticism of weeshoff as contrary to the great weight of authority p d,supra,th at.
guided by katsura and p d,we conclude the instant contractual requirement that change orders be in writing could not be waived or orally modified.
under the facts of this case,voskanian was entitled to recover for extra work on both contracts.
with respect to the relocation contract,the change orders were put in writing and ultimately were approved by the district governing board after the work was completed therefore,voskanian was entitled to be paid for said extra work.
with respect to the relocation contract,the change orders were put in writing and were approved by the district governing board after the work was completed.therefore,with respect to the change orders related to the relocation contract,the issues of oral modification of the written requirement,or of waiver of the written requirement,are an irrelevancy.
the evidence established the change orders which voskanian negotiated with brj in relation to the relocation contract were later approved by the district governing board.because the district ultimately issued change orders for the relocation contract,as to said contract voskanian claim for payment for extra work does not turn on the validity of any oral change orders.
specifically,voskanian completed work on the relocation project in september,at the beginning of the school year.the change orders were processed thereafter.with respect to the relocation contract,the record is as follows change order number,consisting of items,was issued by the district on january.change order number,consisting of items,was issued by the district on january.change order number,consisting of items,was issued by the district on january.change order number,consisting of item,was issued by the district on january.change order number,consisting of items,was issued by the district on june.change order number,consisting of item,was issued by the district on september.
in sum,irrespective of the timing of the change orders,the district in fact issued written change orders for the relocation contract.therefore,voskanian was entitled to recover for the extra work performed in conjunction with the relocation contract.upon the district approval of the change orders for the relocation contract,the extra work on the relocation contract was supported by written authorization from the district.because the district eventually issued written change orders for the relocation contract,we reject the district contention said extra work by voskanian was unauthorized.
thus,the real issue is not whether the extra work by voskanian was authorized,but rather,how much the district owed voskanian for the extra work the district had requested.because voskanian and the district were unable to agree on the amount of the additional compensation,voskanian performed the extra work,as required by section of the contracts,and then pursued the claims procedure set forth in section of the contracts.see fn,ante.as indicated,voskanian duly submitted a claim to the district,et,the district rejected the claim and this litigation followed.ultimately,the amount of voskanian additional compensation was resolved by the trier of fact.
with respect to the fire alarm contract,voskanian was entitled to recover for extra work because its bid was based on the district supplying it with incorrect plans and specification.
unlike the relocation contract,the district did not issue written change orders for the fire alarm contract.nonetheless,voskanian also is entitled to recover for the extra work performed in connection with the second contract,because the extra work on the fire alarm contract was necessitated by incorrect plans and specifications issued by the district.
it is settled law that a contractor of public works who,acting reasonably,is misled by incorrect plans and specifications issued by the public authorities as the basis for bids and who,as a result,submits a bid which is lower than he would have otherwise made may recover in a contract action for extra work or expenses necessitated by the conditions being other than as represented.citations.this rule is mainly based on the theory that the furnishing of misleading plans and specifications by the public body constitutes a breach of an implied warranty of their correctness.souza,supra,cal d at,italics added accord los angeles unified school dist.great american ins.cal th.in souza,for example,the contractor properly stated a cause of action for breach of contract based on allegations it was induced to make a low bid by the public entity failure to advise the contractor of unstable soil conditions at the site.souza,supra,cal d at.
this fact situation comes squarely within the souza rationale.
in soliciting bids for the fire alarm system for the portable buildings at the school campus,the district required bidders to submit their bids based on the plans and specifications prepared by the district architect.after voskanian was awarded the fire alarm contract,it discovered that many of the portable buildings had more rooms than shown on the plans,thus requiring more alarm devices,conduit and wiring.for example,one of the buildings was shown on the plans as a single room with no interior walls however,as built,that structure had six interior rooms.due to the error in the plans,voskanian requested an additional for extra work on the fire alarm contract,over and above the original contract price.
thus,voskanian entitlement to recover for extra work performed in connection with the fire alarm contract does not turn upon the issuance of written change orders.because the extra work on the fire alarm contract was necessitated by incorrect plans and specifications furnished by the district,under settled law voskanian was entitled to recover for said work.
the district contentions relating to voskanian recovery for its extra work.
as set forth above,the evidence established the change orders which voskanian negotiated with brj in relation to the relocation contract were later approved by the district governing board,and its extra work on the fire alarm contract was necessitated by the district supplying voskanian with inaccurate plans and specifications which understated the scope of the job.under the law and the facts,voskanian was entitled to recover for the extra work it performed on both the relocation contract and the fire alarm contract.these circumstances also dispose in large part of the district contentions on appeal.
we briefly address the district various contentions below.
denial of motion to bifurcate.
the district contends the trial court committed reversible error in denying the district request to bifurcate and try the legal issues first,in order to establish the following all modifications to the contracts had to be in writing and approved by the district governing board to be valid and enforceable the district field representatives lacked the authority to modify the contracts voskanian is deemed a sophisticated contractor and charged with knowledge of a public entity limited power to contract and that subordinate employees of the district lacked the power to modify the contracts voskanian could not rely on the district plans as its sole source of information and the mere fact that work on the contract may have been more difficult than voskanian anticipated did not entitle voskanian to additional compensation.
however,voskanian entitlement to recover for extra work on the relocation contract is based on the eventual approval by the district governing board of those change orders,and voskanian recovery for its extra work on the fire alarm contract is supported by the misleading plans and specifications supplied by the district.therefore,the district legal arguments that there can be no oral modification of a public works contract,and that the district representatives lacked the authority to modify the contract,are an irrelevancy.
denial of district motion to exclude evidence and argument of oral modifications to the public works contracts.
the district contends the trial court committed reversible error in denying the district request at an evidence code section hearing to exclude evidence of oral modifications,and in denying the district motion in limine to exclude evidence and argument of any oral modifications to the public works contracts.
again,because voskanian entitlement to recover for the extra w
