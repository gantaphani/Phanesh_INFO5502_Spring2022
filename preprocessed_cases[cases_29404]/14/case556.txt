background 
from the pleadings we discern the following facts 
emwd hired sjb as general contractor on specification,nuevo water transmission pipeline project,perris california the project.on april,sjb entered into a subcontract agreement with gsb to perform the tunneling portion of the project.for these services,sjb originally agreed to pay gsb.after gsb agreed to provide additional services,sjb agreed to pay an additional,for a total project price of on april,safeco executed a payment bond for the project.gsb completed its portion of the work on the project in september.
prior to completion of the project,there were three cessations of labor which exceeded days the first occurred between november,and december,the second occurred between april,and may,and the third occurred between may,and october.the overall project was completed in.gsb alleged that it filed a stop notice with emwd on january,in the amount of on march,sjb informed safeco by letter that it could not meet its obligations.safeco sent a letter to emwd on march,regarding sjb default.
in july,gsb filed suit against sjb for nonpayment under the contract,as well as in common counts.the fourth cause of action included emwd as a defendant for enforcement of stop notice,and the fifth cause of action named safeco in a claim on the stop notice release bond and payment bond.in october,emwd recorded a notice of acceptance signifying completion of the project.
on august,emwd answered the complaint and filed a in interpleader.emwd tendered the amount of,which it had withheld from sjb pursuant to the stop notice.emwd was subsequently dismissed from the action.sjb default was entered june,
on december,safeco filed a motion for summary judgment as to the fifth cause of action relating to the payment bond.in support of its motion,safeco submitted a declaration of one of its counsel,brian lang,as well as a declaration regarding the summary of voluminous documents received during discovery from emwd.those documents related to the daily performance and of work on the project,including certified payroll reports,inspector reports,emwd safety inspection reports,and statement of.the motion was also based on gsb responses to interrogatories propounded by safeco,and emwd response to safeco request for production of documents.
in response to the motion,gsb generally objected to both declarations,citing hearsay,lack of personal knowledge,opinion,speculation,and that the declarant was not an expert.however,gsb did not dispute that there were cessations of labor,arguing instead that the issue of cessation of labor is not relevant unless there has been no notice of completion.nor did gsb object to emwd responses to the request for production of documents,by which safeco obtained the documents summarized by lang.
the trial court overruled gsb objections and granted safeco motion for summary judgment.notice of entry of the order and judgment on the fifth cause of action was filed on august.gsb filed notice of appeal from that order on september.
the matter proceeded to court trial on the remaining causes of action based on various stipulated facts and evidence.on the first three causes of action against sjb,the court awarded gsb under the contract,plus penalties pursuant to business and professions code section in the amount of,plus interest on progress payments in the amount of,plus penalties pursuant to business and professions code section in the amount of,plus interest on that sum in the amount of,for a grand total of.on the fourth cause of action for the right to the funds submitted by way of the interpleader,the court ruled that safeco was entitled to the interpleaded funds.
gsb appealed from the judgment in favor of safeco on the fourth cause of action on january.
discussion 
although gsb filed notices of appeal from both the ruling on the summary judgment motion and from the judgment on the fourth cause of action in favor of safeco,the focus of its brief relates solely to the order granting summary judgment on the fifth cause of action.because gsb has not provided any assignment of error or authority to support a claim of error respecting the fourth cause of action,we deem such claims to have been abandoned.wall street network,new york times th,appellants forfeit or abandon contentions of error by failing to raise or address the contentions in their briefs on appeal.
the court did not abuse its discretion in overruling gsb evidentiary objections in connection with the summary judgment motion.
gsb argues that the trial court erred in overruling its objections to the declarations of bryan lang,one of safeco counsel,and the exhibits attached thereto.gsb argues that the declarations and exhibits were inadmissible hearsay and unauthenticated,requiring reversal of the summary judgment.we disagree.
during summary judgment proceedings,gsb objected to the declarations of safeco counsel,bryan lang on the grounds of hearsay section,lack of personal knowledge section,opinion section,speculation section,irrelevant sections,not an expert section.the declarations,however,were provided to summarize the exhibits and the document summary attached thereto.

code of civil procedure,section,subdivision b,expressly provides that a motion for summary judgment shall be supported by affidavits,declarations,admissions,answers to interrogatories,depositions,and matters of which judicial notice shall or may be taken.it further provides that the supporting papers shall include a separate statement setting forth plainly and concisely all material facts which the moving party contends are undisputed and that each of the material facts shall be followed by a reference to the supporting evidence.
code of civil procedure,section,subdivision b,provides for an opposition to the motion,which,where appropriate,shall consist of affidavits,declarations,admission,answers to interrogatories,depositions,and matters of which judicial notice shall or may be taken.supporting and opposing affidavits or declarations shall be made by any person on personal knowledge,shall set forth admissible evidence,and shall show affirmatively that the affiant is competent to testify to the matters stated in the affidavits or declarations.code civ,subd.d.

evidence code section expressly permits the admission of secondary evidence to prove the content of a writing except when a genuine dispute exists concerning material terms of the writing.section,subdivision d,of the evidence code expressly permits oral testimony of the content of a writing if the writing consists of numerous accounts for other writings that can not be examined in court without great loss of time,and the evidence sought from them is only the general result of the whole.see heaps heaps th.the declaration of counsel was properly considered by the court where the summary motion procedure authorizes the trial court to rely upon declarations.code civ.proc,subd.b.
the statutory provisions adequately address the hearsay objections to lang declarations.the objection based on lang personal knowledge was properly overruled because the declaration states that lang had personal knowledge of the matters that had been produced in response to safeco discovery requests.gsb contention that lang was not present when emwd turned over the documents is not well taken,where lang declaration did not represent he was present,and where gsb own counsel indicated that he was present at the time of the document production.none of the objections claim the exhibits were not the same exhibits turned over during the production of documents,or that they were not properly authenticated.
as to the documentary evidence attached to lang declaration,safeco included a copy of its request for production of documents,which was propounded to emwd,and emwd responses to demand for documents.emwd responses established the foundation for the documents,including the contract,subcontract,payment bond,certified payroll records,documents relating to cessations of labor,and the notice of acceptance.
although it objected to lang declarations,gsb did not object to the emwd responses,the exhibits themselves,and it did not dispute the material terms of the writings attached as exhibits.they were properly considered by the court in ruling on the motion in fact,in its opposing papers,and at the hearing on the motion,gsb did not even dispute that there had been cessations of labor.it did not present declarations,affidavits,depositions,or other evidence to contradict the assertion that there had been three separate cessations of labor.nor did gsb provide evidentiary support for its assertion at the hearing on the motion that the cessations related to normal project planning and execution.gsb hearsay objections were thus properly overruled.
even if we were to find that the court improperly overruled gsb objections,gsb has failed to establish prejudice.the party challenging the ruling must establish prejudice.truong glasser th.in this case,gsb failed to produce any evidence to support its position on the existence of a material issue of fact for which a trial was required.code of civil procedure,section,subdivision b,provides,the opposition papers shall include a separate statement that responds to each of the material facts contended by the moving party to be undisputed,indicating whether the opposing party agrees or disagrees that those facts are undisputed.the statement also shall set forth plainly and concisely any other material facts that the opposing party contends are disputed.each material fact contended by the opposing party to be disputed shall be followed by a reference to the supporting evidence.failure to comply with this requirement of a separate statement may constitute a sufficient ground,in the court discretion,for granting the motion.italics added.
gsb provided no reference to supporting evidence as to each material fact it contended was disputed.nor did it submit evidence to contradict the showing of safeco,or to support the existence of a factual dispute as to whether there were three separate cessations of labor.thus,a favorable ruling on the evidentiary objections would not have changed the outcome gsb did not show by specific facts that the requisite triable issue of material fact was present.tibor superior court th.instead,it merely provided a different legal interpretation of what triggered the duty to file its stop notice,an issue of law.see twaite allstate ins.d,where plaintiff concluded were unnecessary,the issue was a matter of law.
notwithstanding gsb objections,there was no dispute as to whether there had been cessations of labor,so there was no triable issue as to that material fact there was only a question of law as to whether gsb stop notice was timely.the purpose of the law of summary judgment is to provide courts with a mechanism to cut through the parties pleadings in order to determine whether,despite their allegations,trial is in fact necessary to resolve their dispute.aguilar atlantic richfield cal th.

the court correctly determined that gsb action on the payment bond was untimely.
gsb argues its action on the payment bond was timely because the limitations period began to run from the date the notice of acceptance was record pursuant to former civil code sections and,subdivision a.we disagree.
former civil code section now civil code section,provided that a suit against a surety on a payment bond may be brought at any time after the claimant has furnished the last of the labor or materials,or both,but must be commenced before the expiration of six months after the period in which stop notices may be filed as provided in section.former civil code section in turn,provided that,to be effective,any stop notice must be filed before the expiration of a thirty days after the recording of a notice of completion sometimes referred to in public works as a notice of acceptance or notice of cessation,if such notice is recorded.b if no notice of completion or notice of cessation is recorded,days after completion or cessation.italics added.
we have italicized the word after in quoting the statutory provision because in an unbroken,albeit older line of cases dealing with similar claims,it has been held that a claim of lien filed before the notice of completion or acceptance has been recorded is premature and ineffectual.davis macdonough cal,claim of lien filed before completion of building provided no right of recovery gross hazeltine,mccreary toronto midway oil,premature claim of lien conferred no rights.
these cases are instructive because the language of the statutes at issue used the same language as the statutory scheme governing stop notices,requiring the claims of lien to be filed after the completion of the improvement.the only case we have found involving a premature stop notice did not address these authorities,and ignored the plain language of the statute.see central industrial engineering,strauss construction,d.this authority has never been cited in subsequent decisions,and was not cited by gsb,which made no argument addressing premature notices.according to the plain language of the statute,the stop notice in this case was premature,so we must determine when the work of improvement was completed.
completion,as that term is used for works of improvement,was defined by former civil code section with respect to works of improvement subject to acceptance by any public entity,former civil code section provided that the completion of such work of improvement shall be deemed to be the date of such acceptance provided,however,that,except as to contracts awarded under the state contract act,chapter commencing with section,part,division,title of the government code,a cessation of labor on any public work for a continuous period of days shall be a completion thereof.
completion of work on the contract is not the cessation of labor referred to in section.hayward transamerica ins.th,hayward,citing krueger brothers builders,san francisco housing authority d.a cessation is a complete work stoppage in which work by all trades has ceased on the project.hayward,at.where no notice of completion is filed,the cessation of labor for more than days triggers the duty to file a stop notice.former,subd.b.a notice of completion or acceptance,tardily filed,is not the equivalent of completion within the meaning of the statute.lumber thompson cal.
gsb observes that in a public works context,completion occurs upon acceptance of the project by the awarding body.former,of indus.relations fid.roof th.if so,gsb failed to file a timely stop notice within days after the notice of acceptance.however,if there was a day cessation of labor within the meaning of former sections,then that work stoppage was a completion pursuant to sections and,and commenced the running of the stop notice period.hayward,supra,th at.this construction of the statutory language is of longstanding.see robison mitchel cal,where there was cessation from labor upon an unfinished contract,even though labor on the building continued,there was a constructive completion which required the filing of lien claims after days.
gsb also argues that subdivision a of former civil code section provides that the recordation of the notice of acceptance triggers the time limit,and that emwd recorded a notice of acceptance respecting the project after gsb had filed its lawsuit.the dissent agrees with this reasoning.however,this argument fails to take into account the plain language of section requiring that the stop notice be filed after the notice of acceptance has been recorded.as we have pointed out,the stop notice in the present case was premature and thus ineffectual.if the notice of acceptance triggered the commencement of the time limit for filing the stop notice,no stop notice was filed after that event.
finally,gsb argues that to find that the cessation of labor constituted a completion would require subcontractors and suppliers to monitor work almost daily and that it ignores the realities of phased construction work,which are frequently halted while plans are changed,easements are perfected,or permits are obtained.unfortunately,gsb failed to present any competent evidence declarations,exhibits,supporting an assertion that the cessations of labor were excused in this manner.further,gsb responses to interrogatories acknowledged that its last day of work on the project sometime in late september of believed to be the beginning of the week of the.
in order to defeat the summary judgment motion,it was incumbent upon gsb to establish either that the recording of the notice of acceptance was the sole triggering event,or that there had been no cessation of labor.otherwise,the cessations of labor constituted completion pursuant to the definition in former civil code section and commenced the period for filing stop notices regarding public works hayward,supra,th at,and the tardily recorded notice of acceptance did not it.
additionally,we doubt that former civil code section is susceptible to an interpretation that a notice of acceptance recorded after gsb filed its stop notice and its lawsuit extends the limitation period.the terms of former civil code section require a stop notice to be filed days after the recording of a notice of completion or acceptance,unless no such notice is recorded.by its own argument,no notice of acceptance had been filed before gsb filed its stop notice or the lawsuit,so gsb did not comply with former civil code section by filing the stop notice within days after the notice of acceptance.additionally,gsb never established it had actually filed a stop notice,so any argument relating to its compliance with former civil code section is purely academic,and does not create a triable issue of material fact 
the exhibits submitted in support of the summary judgment motion established three separate and distinct periods in which all work stopped on the project.these periods occurred between after gsb completed its portion of the work and.gsb did not provide any to show that work had not stopped,so there was no triable issue of material fact as to whether a cessation of labor had occurred.for this reason,the trial court concluded it had to accept the timeline presented in safeco papers,and found the action was time barred.
notwithstanding gsb objections,it was undisputed that three separate cessations of labor,for more than days each,occurred after gsb had completed its portion of the work,and more than a year before the notice of acceptance was accepted.in this respect,the present case is governed by the holding of hayward,supra,th,on which the trial court relied.the cessations constituted completion under the statute triggering gsb time limit within which to file a stop notice or bring its lawsuit.the fact that emwd tardily filed a notice of acceptance did not extend the limitations period.
disposition 
the judgment is affirmed.safeco is entitled to costs on appeal.
i disagree with the majority on two accounts.first,i believe the action was filed in a timely manner under civil code section,subdivision a second,even if i was to conclude that the relevant inquiry as to the beginning of the limitations period was the cessation of work for or more days,i would find that defendant,eastern municipal water district emwd,on this issue failed to submit admissible evidence so as to meet its initial burden of production.
a.the action was timely filed 
a simple reading of the relevant statutes shows that the present matter was timely filed and that the beginning of the limitations period was the date of the recordation of the notice of completion,which was october.the pertinent statutes provide 
suit against the surety or sureties on the payment bond may be brought by any claimant,or his assigns,at any time after the claimant has furnished the last of the labor or materials,or both,but must be commenced before the expiration of six months after the period in which stop notices may be filed as provided in section.
to be effective,any stop notice pursuant to this chapter must be served before the expiration of 
a thirty days after the recording of a notice of completion sometimes referred to in public works as a notice of acceptance or notice of cessation,if such notice is recorded.
b if no notice of completion or notice of cessation is recorded,days after completion or cessation.
completion means,in the case of any work of improvement other than a public work,actual completion of the work of improvement.any of the following shall be deemed equivalent to a completion 
a the occupation or use of a work of improvement by the owner,or his agent,accompanied by cessation of labor thereon.
b the acceptance by the owner,or his agent,of the work of improvement.
c after the commencement of a work of improvement,a cessation of labor thereon for a continuous period of days,or a cessation of labor thereon for a continuous period of days or more if the owner files for record a notice of cessation.
if the work of improvement is subject to acceptance by any public entity,the completion of such work of improvement shall be deemed to be the date of such acceptance provided,however,that,except as to contracts awarded under the state contract act a cessation of labor on any public work for a continuous period of days shall be a completion thereof.
in viewing the statutes together,a suit against a surety must be filed within six months of the time for the filing of a stop notice.under section,the stop notice must be filed within days of the recordation of the notice of completion or notice of cessation.in a case in which neither a notice of completion or notice of cessation is recorded,the stop notice must be filed within days of the actual cessation or completion of the work.in the absence of a recording of either of these notices,a public work of improvement is deemed completed when there has been a cessation of labor for a continuous period of days.
here,the notice of completion was recorded on october.plaintiff,golden state boring pipe jacking,gsb,had until may,in which to file its action.the action was filed on july,more than months before the running of the limitations period.thus,it was timely filed under section,subdivision a.as such,we never get to the issue of whether there was a cessation of labor for a period of days or more 
both emwd and the majority rely almost exclusively on hayward transamerica ins.th for the proposition that gsb did not timely file its action after there had been a cessation of work longer than days.both emwd and the majority ignore,however,the facts and the basic premise upon which the decision was based.
in hayward transamerica ins,supra,th,cates construction,cates contracted with the county of los angeles the county to construct the lost hills sheriff station.the plaintiff contracted with cates to provide certain labor and materials for the job.a dispute arose between cates and the county the county notified cates that it was suspended from the job.thereafter cates and the county entered into an agreement titled termination for convenience agreement and mutual release,wherein cates was relieved from performing the job and the county released cates from any liability.pursuant to the agreement,all of the contracts entered into between cates and its subcontractors were assigned to the county.thereafter,the plaintiff contacted the county seeking to enter into a new contract to perform work.the county refused,indicating that it had been assigned the original contract.the job was eventually finished using the original subcontractors,including the plaintiff.four months later,the plaintiff sued the county,cates,and cates surety,transamerica insurance.the county moved for summary judgment based on the fact that cates was suspended from the job on june and that there was a cessation of work from that date to august a period of almost days.id.at.based on the termination of the contract with cates and the cessation of work,the county argued that the last day in which the plaintiff could file its lawsuit was april,thus making the july,filing untimely.id.at.the appellate court agreed,finding that there was a cessation of work for a continuous day period and,as such,it constituted completion under section.id.at.
of importance to that case,however,was that there was no notice of completion recorded.as pointed out by the court at the beginning of its discussion,the issue here is whether the complaint was filed within six months after the period in which appellant could file stop notices.the parties dispute centers on what constitutes the period for filing stop notices.section,referenced in section,provides that any stop notice must be served before the expiration of a thirty days after the recording of a notice of completion sometimes referred to in public works as a notice of acceptance or notice of cessation,if such notice is recorded.b if no notice of completion or notice of cessation is recorded,days after completion or cessation.with regard to cates work on the project,the parties do not dispute that neither a notice of completion nor a notice of cessation was filed or recorded.subdivision b is therefore the applicable portion of section.application of this provision presents the question when was there a completion or cessation.because it provides a definition of completion,section comes into play.hayward transamerica ins,supra,th at,fns.omitted,italics added.
as is evident from this discussion in hayward,section and the cessation of work concept comes into play only when there has been no recordation of a notice of completion or notice of cessation.here,a notice of completion was recorded we need go no further.gsb action was timely filed based on the recordation of the notice of completion.
emwd failed to submit admissible evidence relative to there being a continuous day cessation of labor 
emwd entitlement to summary judgment was premised on the notion that gsb filing of its complaint was untimely.emwd argument is based on the fact that there were three cessations of work for days or more,each of which it contends,commenced the limitations period.to this end,emwd submitted the following undisputed facts and supporting evidence 
there was a continuous day cessation of labor on the project between the dates of november,and december.summary of voluminous emwd records at,supporting documents attached as exhibits and.
there was a continuous day cessation of labor on the project between the dates of april,and may.summary of voluminous emwd records at,supporting documents attached as exhibits and.
there was a continuous day cessation of labor on the project between the dates of may,and october.summary of voluminous emwd records at,supporting documents attached as exhibits and.
the summary of voluminous emwd records was prepared by bryan lang,an attorney representing the moving party.in his one and page declaration,he avers that he has personal knowledge of the foregoing,except as to those matters stated on information and belief he indicates that he reviewed the documents produced by emwd to defendant,safeco insurance company safeco,request to produce documents and,based on that review,compiled an excel spreadsheet which tracked the dates of work on the project gsb objected to this declaration and summary of records on the grounds of hearsay,lack of personal knowledge,improper opinion evidence,and speculation.
gsb objections were meritorious and should have been sustained if the objections had been properly sustained,emwd would have had no evidence as to undisputed facts,and.as such,emwd would not have met its initial burden of production as to the three cessations of work its motion therefore would have been denied.

here,both emwd and the majority rely on evidence code section,subdivision d,for the proposition that the trial court could consider lang summary of emwd records,along with its attachments,as substantive evidence of cessations of work during the project 
as provided by evidence code section,subdivision d oral testimony of the content of a writing is not made inadmissible by subdivision a if the writing consists of numerous accounts or other writings that can not be examined in court without great loss of time,and the evidence sought from them is only the general result of the whole.evidence code section is a best evidence rule allowing secondary evidence to prove the content of a writing.secondary evidence,of course,must comply wi
