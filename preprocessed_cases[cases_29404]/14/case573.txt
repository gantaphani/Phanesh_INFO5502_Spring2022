introduction 
plaintiffs and respondents hm dg,and hassan majd doing business as majd design group hmdg sued defendants and appellants farzad etemad amini and pouneh beizai defendants in the superior court to recover allegedly unpaid progress payments under a construction contract for a remodel of defendants home.after hmdg refused defendants demand to submit the dispute to arbitration,defendants filed a petition to compel arbitration pursuant to an arbitration clause in the parties contract.the trial court denied the petition,holding that defendants failed to establish the existence of a valid arbitration agreement on the ground that the arbitration clause at issue is uncertain in that it does not specify before what agency o r person the matter will be arbitrated,or how the arbitrator will be selected,but merely sets for th alternative options for these terms.the trial court also awarded hmdg its attorneys fees incurred in opposing the petition to compel arbitration.we reverse.
code of civil procedure section specifically contemplates the existence of an enforceable arbitration agreement even where the arbitration agreement does not provide a method for appointing an arbitrator the statute further provides that i n the absence of an agreed method,or if the agreed method fails,the court,on petition of a party to the arbitration agreement,shall appoint the arbitrator.ibid.as we shall explain,because the court has the power to appoint an arbitrator under section when the parties fail to agree upon a method for appointment,we conclude that neither the absence of a definite method,nor the presence of alternative options,for appointing an arbitrator renders an otherwise valid arbitration agreement unenforceable.
as we find the agreement to arbitrate is valid,and that defendants demanded arbitration in accordance with the subject arbitration clause,we will reverse the trial court order.however,because the trial court did not reach the question of whether any other ground for denying the petition under section applies,we will remand the matter for the trial court to consider this issue.

after reviewing the agreement,which was prepared by hmdg,defendants executed the agreement without requesting any changes to the arbitration clause.majd executed the agreement on behalf of hmdg.
in mid,a dispute arose between hmdg and defendants regarding the quality of the remodeling work,defendants requests to make substantial changes to the project scope,and defendants alleged failure to make prompt progress payments as required by the agreement.on july,hmdg made a proposal to resolve the dispute by having defendants place funds sufficient to complete the remaining project items into an escrow account.although hmdg proposal contained numerous references to arbitration,no formal demand for arbitration was made.when defendants refused the proposal,hmdg served a day stop work order and recorded a mechanic lien on the property.
on december,hmdg filed a complaint against defendants in the superior court,asserting claims for breach of contract,a common count for money due under the contract,foreclosure of mechanics lien,unjust enrichment,and violation of the prompt payment statute civil code section.
on february,defendants counsel,leo schwarz,sent a letter to counsel for hmdg,james hevener.schwarz letter reads,in pertinent part 
please accept this letter as defendants demand that all of the claims raised by plaintiffs in their complaint in the action,as well as the claims to be made by defendants,be arbitrated per the arbitration clause found on page of the june,project proposal and agreement.as usa m,one of the designated potential arbitration providers,does not have a presence in los angeles county or the state of california,we propose that the parties avail themselves to option of the arbitration clause,where a method of selecting the arbitrator is provided.defendants propose that the matter be heard by a retired judge with substantial construction and home improvement contract experience each party select two neutral such judges,with each party allowed to strike one of the other party selections the arbitrator is then randomly selected from the remaining two judges the california arbitration rules et be adopted as the rules of arbitration the terms set forth in the second paragraph of the arbitration clause remain in effect and the action will be stayed pending the arbitrator award,however,defendants right to seek expungement of the mechanic lien prior to the arbitration hearing shall not be stayed.underscoring omitted.
the next day,february,hevener wrote back to schwarz that hmdg found the proposal unreasonable and not required by the project proposal and agreement.hevener letter continued please proceed with filing your responsive pleading today.my client remains open to discussing settlement of this dispute including a reasonable process for alternative dispute resolution.
on february,defendants filed a petition to compel arbitration pursuant to the agreement arbitration clause.the petition was supported by defendants declarations and a declaration by their attorney,attaching the agreement,schwarz letter demanding arbitration,and hevener response.
on june,after a hearing on defendants petition,the trial court issued an order denying the petition and awarding hmdg attorney fees in the amount of.in pertinent part,the court order states d efendants have failed to meet their burden of proving the existence of a valid arbitration agreement.specifically,the arbitration clause at issue is uncertain in that it does not specify before what agency o r person the matter will be arbitrated,or how the arbitrator will be selected,but merely sets for th alternative options for these terms.at most the agreement provides that these questions are to be resolved in the future which gives rise to no legal obligation until such future agreement.moreover,defendants demand for arbitration itself reflects that there was a lack of mutual consent insofar as it proposes terms nowhere set forth in the putative arbitration agreement.the trial court order states no other ground for denying defendants petition.
issues presented 
in this appeal,we must decide whether the subject arbitration clause constitutes a valid arbitration agreement,notwithstanding the presence of multiple alternative methods for selecting an arbitrator in the clause.we also will address hmdgs contention that the presence of these alternatives in the arbitration clause establishes that there was no mutual consent to arbitrate.finally,we will address hmdgs contention that defendants demand for arbitration was defective because it included proposals that did not strictly conform to the terms of the arbitration clause.
based on a plain reading of section,we conclude that the arbitration clause is both valid and establishes the parties mutual consent to arbitrate,notwithstanding the clauses various options for selecting an arbitrator.we also conclude that defendants demand for arbitration was consistent with the terms of the arbitration clause.accordingly,we will reverse the order denying defendants petition.however,because the trial court did not reach other potential grounds for denying the petition under section,we will remand the matter for the court to consider these issues.
discussion 
section makes clear that the parties need not agree upon a specific method for appointing an arbitrator to form a binding arbitration agreement 
in denying defendants petition to compel arbitration,the trial court determined that the arbitration clause was not a valid arbitration agreement because the clause does not specify before what agency o r person the matter will be arbitrated,or how the arbitrator will be selected,but merely sets for th alternative options for these terms.the court conclusion assumes the premise that an arbitration agreement must identify a specific arbitrator or specify a single method for selecting an arbitrator in order to be valid.that premise,as we shall explain,is contrary to a plain reading of section and,thus,can not support the trial court denial of defendants petition to compel arbitration.
as our resolution of this issue rests on the interpretation of a statute and the application of that statute to undisputed facts in this case,section and the terms of the written arbitration clause the issue is subject to this court independent or de novo review.people ex rel.lockyer shamrock foods cal th,international engine parts,feddersen cal th,city of saratoga hinz th.

section states if the arbitration agreement provides a method of appointing an arbitrator,that method shall be followed.if the arbitration agreement does not provide a method for appointing an arbitrator,the parties to the agreement who seek arbitration and against whom arbitration is sought may agree on a method of appointing an arbitrator and that method shall be followed.in the absence of an agreed method,or if the agreed method fails or for any reason can not be followed,or when an arbitrator appointed fails to act and his or her successor has not been appointed,the court,on petition of a party to the arbitration agreement,shall appoint the arbitrator.italics added.
a plain reading of section yields only one reasonable interpretation that the validity of an arbitration agreement is not contingent upon the agreement identifying a specific arbitrator or specifying a particular method for appointing an arbitrator.moreover,if an arbitration agreement that does not provide a method for appointing an arbitrator is valid,then it follows that an agreement which provides multiple alternative methods for appointing an arbitrator also is valid,even though it does not specify a particular method for appointment.indeed,even where the parties are unable to agree upon a specific method for appointing an arbitrator,section provides a solution to ensure a party contractual right to arbitrate is enforced.in such instances,section provides that the court,on petition of a party to the arbitration agreement,shall appoint the arbitrator.
consistent with our plain reading of section,we hold that the presence of multiple alternative methods for selecting an arbitrator in the arbitration clause does not render the clause invalid or unenforceable the trial court erred in finding that defendants failed to meet their burden of establishing the existence of a valid arbitration agreement.
b.the arbitration clause establishes the parties mutual consent to arbitrate 
hmdg contends that the presence of options for key terms such as selection of the specific office of usa m that would administer the arbitration and provide the associated arbitration rules,how the arbitrator would be selected,and the location for the arbitration hearing demonstrates that there was no meeting of the minds or mutual consent to arbitrate.we disagree.contrary to hmdg contention,the plain language of the arbitration clause,combined with the parties signatures directly under the clause,establishes the parties mutual consent to submit their disputes to arbitration in accordance with the applicable united states arbitration and mediation rules of arbitration and to be bound by the arbitrator decision.ct the presence of options regarding the method for selecting an arbitrator or the location of the arbitration hearing do not negate that clear intention.
contract formation requires mutual consent,which can not exist unless the parties agree upon the same thing in the same sense.bustamante intuit,th,bustamante,quoting,see also.mutual assent is determined under an objective standard applied to the outward manifestations or expressions of the parties,the reasonable meaning of their words and acts,and not their unexpressed intentions or understandings.citations.bustamante,at.where the existence of a contract is at issue and the evidence is conflicting or admits of more than one inference,it is for the trier of fact to determine whether the contract actually existed.but if the material facts are certain or undisputed,the existence of a contract is a question for the court to decide.robinson wilson,stone d,the question whether the contract is sufficiently definite and certain in its essential terms to give rise to a legal obligation is a question of law.because hmdg contention rests on the language of the arbitration clause,and the presence of options for key terms in the clause,we review the issue as a question of law,without deference to purported factual determinations made by the trial court 
hmdg contention regarding the purported lack of mutual consent is largely disposed of by our earlier analysis of section.as explained,section makes clear that the absence of a specified method for appointing an arbitrator neither invalidates an arbitration agreement nor negates the parties clearly expressed intent to submit their disputes to arbitration.accordingly,hmdg argument that mutual consent is lacking because the arbitration clause did not specify the specific office of usa m that would administer the arbitration or how the arbitrator would be selected is without merit.
for much the same reason,we are not persuaded by hmdg contentions regarding the purported options related to the associated arbitration rules and the location of the arbitration hearing.we view these matters as part and parcel with the appointment of an arbitrator that is,for example,if the parties were to elect to appoint an american arbitration association aaa arbitrator,that appointment would entail arbitration in a aaa forum under aaa rules.thus,under section,the absence of a specified forum or set of rules in an arbitration clause does not invalidate the agreement to arbitrate.rather,in the absence of such provisions,the parties to the agreement who seek arbitration and against whom arbitration is sought may agree on a method of appointing an arbitrator including the forum and rules that will govern the arbitration or,if the parties can not agree,the court,on petition of a party to the arbitration agreement,shall appoint the arbitrator.
hmdg contends that arbitration rules and forum are material terms of an agreement to arbitrate and,thus,must be specified in the agreement to establish mutual consent.this contention goes too far and is not supported by the authorities cited by hmdg.on the contrary,the authori
