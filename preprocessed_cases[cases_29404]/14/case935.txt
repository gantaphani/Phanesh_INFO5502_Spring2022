claimant alan morton was injured on the morning of april,while working for his employer,new york water service corporation the water company,a private company that furnishes water to portions of nassau county.on that date,he was a member of a work crew,including a foreman,dispatched with a backhoe to fix a break reported in a water main installed in beneath carman mill road,massapequa,new york,a part of the state of new york highway system see highway law.
upon arrival at the job site,the work crew notified affected customers and shut off water service,excavated test holes to pinpoint the leak origin,and placed traffic cones to alert motorists to the presence of the backhoe,which occupied a portion of the northbound travel lane.using the backhoe and shovels,the crew dug up blacktop in the roadbed and created a hole or trench,exposing the water main buried several feet underground.when claimant climbed down into this trench to clean around the main and apply a repair clamp,a side wall caved in,burying his right leg and foot.
in june,claimant,with his wife suing derivatively,brought this action against the state.he asserted negligence and violations of labor law,and,and sought million in damages.in,claimant moved for partial summary judgment as to liability on his labor law and negligence claims.he premised liability in the former on violation of industrial code rule nycrr subpart,which requires banked or sloped sides nycrr a or sheeting,shoring and bracing nycrr a of excavations that are five feet or more deep.the state opposed the motion and for summary judgment dismissing the complaint.
the state argued that it was not liable under labor law because the water company failed to obtain a work permit from the new york state department of transportation dot,as mandated by highway law,prior to repairing the water main,which was situated within the state highway.section provides that 
e xcept in connection with the construction,reconstruction,maintenance or improvement of a state highway,no person,firm,corporation,municipality,or state department or agency shall lay or maintain within the state highway underground wires or conduits or drainage,sewer or water pipes,except in accordance with the terms and conditions of a work permit issued by the commissioner of transportation see also vehicle and traffic law e xcept in connection with the construction,reconstruction,maintenance,or improvement of a state highway,no person shall work on a state highway without a work permit issued by the state commissioner of transportation nycrr a,b a work permit must be secured to temporarily obstruct or to install,construct,maintain or operate any facilities within the bounds of a state highway,including excavating or work of a like nature under,or over or along the highway.
by decision and order dated october,the court of claims dismissed claimant negligence claims because the state lacked actual or constructive notice of any dangerous condition and did not exercise supervision or control over the worksite.the court also denied claimant motion and the state cross motion for summary judgment on the labor law claim.the judge concluded that highway law did not insulate the state from liability under labor law because this provision imposed a nondelegable duty upon owners to provide reasonable and adequate protection and safety to persons employed in excavation work regardless of the absence of control,supervision or direction of the work.he did find,however,that material questions of fact existed as to soil composition and the excavation depth,which implicated the applicability of the industrial code sections relied upon by claimant.
after the ensuing nonjury trial,the court of claims on april,found that the excavation was not protected by sloped or banked sides or by sheeting,shoring or bracing,and that it was more than five feet deep.the judge decided that claimant had therefore proven violations of sections of the industrial code specific enough to support labor law liability and that these violations proximately caused the accident,and thus contravened the state nondelegable duty to claimant under labor law.the judge also found that the state had not proven claimant comparative negligence by a preponderance of the credible evidence.accordingly,on may,an interlocutory judgment determining the state to be negligent and liable for claimant injuries was entered in the court of claims.the state appealed from both the order denying its cross motion for summary judgment on the section claim,and the interlocutory judgment.
in december,the appellate division dismissed the state appeal from the interlocutory judgment as academic reversed,on the law,the portion of the court of claims order that denied the state cross motion for summary judgment dismissing the section claim granted the state summary judgment on and dismissed that claim and vacated the interlocutory judgment dept.citing abbatiello lancaster studio,the court reasoned that the 
state is not liable under labor law because the claimant was not within the class of persons afforded protection under the statute.since the water company failed to obtain a highway work permit in violation of state law the water company and the claimant trespassed on the state property in performing excavation and repairs on the state highway since the claimant was performing work without the state permission or knowledge,he was not a person employed at a work site within the meaning of the labor law,which defines such an individual as one permitted or suffered to work labor law at citations omitted.
we granted claimant permission to appeal and now affirm.
labor law provides that 
a ll contractors and owners and their agents,when constructing or demolishing buildings or doing any excavating in connection therewith,shall comply with the following requirements 
all areas in which construction,excavation or demolition work is being performed shall be so constructed,shored,equipped,guarded,arranged,operated and conducted as to provide reasonable and adequate protection and safety to the persons employed therein or lawfully frequenting such places.the new york state commissioner of labor may make rules to carry into effect the provisions of this subdivision,and the owners and contractors and their agents for such work shall comply therewith.
thus,labor law imposes a nondelegable on owners and contractors to comply with the commissioner of labor regulations see ross.and to the extent that a plaintiff assert s a viable claim under labor law,he need not show that defendants exercised supervision or control over his worksite in order to establish his right of recovery id.
but we have consistently held that ownership of the premises where the accident not enough to impose liability under labor law where the property owner did not contract for the work resulting in the plaintiff injuries that is,ownership is a necessary condition,but not a sufficient one.rather,we have insisted on some nexus between the owner and the worker,whether by a lease agreement or grant of an easement,or other property interest abbatiello,at see also scaparo village of ilion,in cases imposing liability on a property owner who did not contract for the work performed on the property,this court has required some nexus between the owner and the worker,whether by a lease agreement or grant of an easement,or other property interest,quoting abbatiello,at.
we found no nexus in abbatiello where the plaintiff,a cable television repair man,was injured at a building owned by the defendant while responding to the complaint of a tenant who was a cable television subscriber.the plaintiff employer had sent the plaintiff to the defendant building to respond to the complaint.we emphasized that the injured plaintiff was on the owner premises not by reason of any action of the owner but by reason of provisions of the public service law,which precludes landlords from interfering with the installation of cable television facilities on their property abbatiello,at.moreover,the owner was powerless to determine which cable company was entitled to operate,repair or maintain the cable facilities on its property,since pursuant to public service law such decision lies with the franchisor id.at.as we elaborated,
but for public service law,plaintiff would be a trespasser upon the defendant property and the defendant would neither owe a duty to plaintiff nor incur liability.any permission to work on the premises was granted upon compulsion and no relationship existed between the defendant and the plaintiff employer or the plaintiff id.
we contrasted abbatiello with three earlier cases in which there was a nexus between the owner and the injured worker celestine city of new york,dept,affd in action under labor law,owner granted an easement to entity contracting for work leading to plaintiff accident gordon eastern ry.supply,in action under labor law owner leased property to contractor who performed work leading to plaintiff accident and coleman city of new york,in action under labor law,owner leased property to injured employee employer.
we next applied the nexus test in sanatass consolidated inv,where a mechanic was injured while installing an air conditioning unit for a tenant of a commercial building owned by the defendant landlord.the tenant had agreed by lease not to make any changes to the premises without the owner written consent,but nevertheless hired the plaintiff employer without notifying the landlord.there,a nexus arose from the owner lease of the premises to the tenant who,in turn,hired the plaintiff firm to install the air conditioning unit.further,the tenant breach of the lease agreement requiring the owner written consent for alterations did not sever the nexus id.at.we distinguished abbatiello,pointing out that although the owner in that case was unaware of and did not consent to the plaintiff presence on the property,these facts alone were not determinative of our affirmance of the dismissal of the complaint,abbatiello did not announce a new notice requirement for section cases id.at.rather,the difference between abbatiello and sanatass was the absence of a nexus in the former and its presence in the latter id.and we again explained that in celestine and its progeny a nexus existed between the owner and the plaintiff,be it by lease,easement or some other property interest id.finally,we observed that u nlike the cable technician in abbatiello,the plaintiff in sanatass can not conceivably be viewed as a trespasser id.at.
scaparo is our most recent decision discussing the nexus prerequisite.there,the injured plaintiffs,employees of the village of frankfort,were connecting a sewer lateral from a newly constructed cemetery chapel owned by a church to the sewer main at a street intersection in the village see,dept.the herkimer county industrial development agency hcida owned the property where the sewer lateral was installed that property was within the village utility see id.affirming the appellate division,we determined that hcida was not liable under labor law because there was no nexus between hcida and the injured plaintiffs.as we explained,
although the accident occurred on hcida property,hcida did not contract with the village of frankfort to have the sewer lateral installed,it had no choice but to allow the village to enter its property pursuant to a,and it did not grant the village an easement or other property interest creating the scaparo,at.
here,there was no lease agreement or grant of an easement or other property interest creating a nexus between claimant and the state.claimant was performing excavation work on the state premises not by reason of any action of the state but by reason of the water company obligation to repair a break in its water line abbatiello,at.and although claimant protests that the water company repairs took care of the damage caused to the roadway by the leak and removed a traffic hazard in an emergency situation we long ago concluded that whether a property owner benefits in any sense from the work is legally irrelevant to determining whether the labor law imposes a nondelegable duty see gordon,at.
claimant also urges that he did not simply trespass on another property,and tags the statutory requirement for a highway work permit as a mere formality.but we have recognized that the terms and conditions of these permits are not meaningless or optional the permitee agrees to abide by them in order to obtain dot permission to work in the highway brothers,at.the permit requirement allows dot to inspect the worksite to insure the safety of motorists,pedestrians and others in the work zone,and to safeguard the roadway integrity.and as we indicated in brothers,dot may revoke a highway work permit at any time if necessary to protect the public see id.at see also nycrr b the dot commissioner reserves the right to revoke or annul the state highway permit at any time and at his discretion without a hearing or the necessity of showing cause nycrr c dot reserves the right to modify and to revoke or annul a highway work permit issued for utility facilities occupying a state upon a determination within its sole discretion,and without a hearing,that continued operation under the permit will cause or continue a threat to the public or to the operation of the highway.in addition,the permit requirement allows the state to verify that the permittee has liability insurance in place to protect the state interests see nycrr f nycrr part 
finally,claimant suggests that a highway work permit may not have been necessary here because of the emergency situation.dot regulations,however,make clear that the water company was required to have in hand either a or an annual permit before undertaking excavation of the roadway,notwithstanding any exigency see nycrr.there are simply different requirements for notifying dot,depending on whether or not an emergency exists compare nycrr a with nycrr a see also nycrr specifying instructions to obtain highway work permits that apply to,among other things,emergency repairs and public utilities.additionally,even if it were true that the water company was entitled to enter the state highway without a work permit in order to make emergency repairs,the state still would not be liable.in that circumstance,a ny permission to work on the premises would have been granted upon compulsion and no relationship would have existed between the state and the water company or claimant abbatiello,at.
the outcome of this case would be the state the water company had secured a highway work permit before excavating in the state highway.in that event,the work permit would have created the nexus between the claimant,the injured worker,and the state,the property owner.without the permit,though,claimant was a trespasser to whom the state owed no duty under labor law.
although acknowledging that we have always required as a condition of owner liability under labor law no more than some connection,or nexus,between the owner and the plaintiff,the dissent never suggests how this minimal standard was,what the nexus might have this case dissenting op at n,supra.all we are told is that t here is no issue as to whether this unspecified nexus was attenuated by status as was purportedly the question in sanatass dissenting op at.of course,in sanatass there was a clear the issue,as we articulated it,was not whether this nexus was attenuated by the landlord status,but whether it had been sever ed by the tenant breach of a clause in the lease prohibiting the hiring of a contractor to make alterations in the premises without the landlord written prior consent see sanatass,at.we decided,of course,that this clause did not sever the nexus created by the lease.
under the dissent apparent analysis of our prior cases,a property owner who did not contract for the work is liable under labor law unless the plaintiff employer entry onto the premises results from,permission unrelated to a lease,easement or some other property interest granted by the owner.this is certainly contrary to the way in which we have consistently explained and reconciled our precedents,and effectively eliminates the nexus requirement.more to the point,there is no reason to believe that this is what the legislature intended.indeed,such a liability
