appellant tri county metropolitan transportation district of oregon trimet provides bus,light rail,and commuter rail service in the portland metropolitan area.trimet contracted with colorado railcar manufacturing,llc colorado railcar for the manufacture of light railcars.the contract railcar contract required colorado railcar to secure a million standby letter of credit,which colorado railcar arranged through crm collateral ii,collateral ii,a bankruptcy remote entity trimet certified collateral ii default and drew on the letter of credit when colorado railcar defaulted.we consider whether collateral ii was a surety to colorado railcar,entitled to the defense of discharge.we hold that it was not.
because the standby letter of credit issued by keybank national association keybank required trimet to certify collateral ii default,trimet sought clarification that should colorado railcar default,trimet authority to certify collateral ii default would be triggered.in response to trimet concern,collateral ii agreed to become a part of the railcar contract via modification,but it undertook no new obligation nor did it subject itself to any additional liability beyond what it previously undertook by securing the letter of credit at colorado railcar direction.thus,no suretyship was created.because collateral ii is not entitled to the protections of a surety,it was error for the district court to grant summary judgment in its favor.we reverse and remand.
in november,trimet entered into the railcar contract with colorado railcar to build and deliver three light railcars and one trailer for trimet use in connection with its new westside express service between beaverton and wilsonville,oregon.the final price for the railcars and trailer was.the contract required colorado railcar to maintain an irrevocable standby letter of credit in the amount of million from the time colorado railcar issued notification that manufacture would begin to the final delivery of the railcars and trailer to trimet.the parties had considered other methods of securing the contract,such as a performance bond.but,due to colorado railcar credit history and financial health,trimet agreed that a letter of credit would be an attainable and less expensive form of security.
collateral ii was formed,in part,for the purpose of fulfilling colorado railcar letter of credit obligation under the contract.thomas rader,ceo of colorado railcar,was named one of collateral ii corporate directors along with scott state,who was also collateral ii sole corporate officer,serving as both president and treasurer.john thompson,colorado railcar cfo,was collateral ii registered agent at the time of incorporation.
colorado railcar,collateral ii,and certain investors entered into an investment agreement whereby colorado railcar provided quarterly interest payments to the investors for pledging collateral as security for the purchase of a letter of credit in satisfaction of colorado railcar obligation to provide the standby letter of credit.as a result,collateral ii purchased irrevocable standby letter of credit letter of credit from keybank for the benefit of trimet.the letter of credit provided that million was available to trimet upon its presentation of a sight draft accompanied by a signed and dated document stating the amount requested and containing a statement that reads as follows the undersigned officer or director of trimet hereby certifies that the applicant is in default under contract the letter of credit was initially set to expire on november.
trimet first learned that collateral ii,and not colorado railcar,was the applicant on the letter of credit several months after arrangements were finalized with keybank.trimet initially requested that collateral ii and colorado railcar obtain a new corrected letter of credit,but they refused to do so.as an alternative solution,trimet,colorado railcar,and collateral ii agreed to a written modification of the railcar contract modification,under which collateral ii became a party to the railcar contract for the sole purpose of equating a default by colorado railcar under the railcar contract to a default by collateral ii for purposes of drawing on the letter of credit.the modification was clear that collateral ii had no rights under the railcar contract,nor did it undertake any new obligations.
in january,trimet and colorado railcar entered into a separate project monitoring agreement pma,which modified their rights and obligations under the railcar contract in an effort to address colorado railcar continuing financial problems.trimet feared that colorado railcar financial woes would jeopardize its ability to complete the light railcars.after evaluating the feasibility of engaging substitute contractors,trimet determined that it would be less costly and would reduce delay to financially support colorado railcar to the extent needed to ensure completion of the railcars.thus,under the pma,trimet was to make special contract payments to or on behalf of colorado railcar,including payments not previously provided for under the railcar contract.under the pma,trimet was authorized to draw on the letter of credit to fund these payments or to compensate itself for any special payments that colorado railcar failed to repay.additionally,the pma appointed a financial monitor to oversee colorado railcar operations and trimet was given authority to approve or disapprove colorado railcar budgets and expenditures.lastly,colorado railcar acknowledged in the pma that it had defaulted under the railcar contract and expressly agreed that it would further be in default if it was unable to repay the special contract payments.
colorado railcar and trimet did not inform collateral ii of these negotiations nor obtain its consent to the pma.the pma was amended in february,primarily to add alaska railroad corporation as an additional party collateral ii was not a party to this amendment,nor was the amended pma disclosed directly to collateral ii.
without knowledge of the pma or amended pma,state on behalf of collateral ii agreed to an extension of the letter of credit to november.state reviewed the amended pma in june.he did not contact trimet to discuss the pma or collateral ii obligations at that time,but later contacted keybank to urge it not to honor any draw as he believed any certification by trimet to draw on the letter of credit would be fraudulent.
between the date of the amended pma and the completed manufacture of the railcars and trailer in october,trimet advanced more than million in special contract payments to colorado railcar.on october,trimet attempted to draw on the letter of credit to reimburse itself for million of those special contract payments.in response,collateral ii filed an action against trimet and keybank in the district of oregon the lead action.collateral ii alleged trimet had fraudulently secured collateral ii consent to the extension of the letter of credit,sought to enjoin keybank from honoring the draw,asked for a declaration that the letter of credit was unenforceable,and requested rescission of the amendments to the letter of credit.subsequently,collateral ii voluntarily dismissed keybank from the action.trimet filed a counterclaim in the lead action,requesting a declaration that the letter of credit was valid and enforceable,that trimet draw request was enforceable,that collateral ii was in default on the underlying contract,and that trimet was entitled to draw million on the letter of credit.
contemporaneously,a group of collateral ii investors filed a motion to enjoin keybank from honoring the letter of credit in the state court for clayton county,iowa the member action keybank did not oppose the motion and a temporary injunction was granted on november,enjoining keybank from honoring any draw request by trimet.keybank removed the member action to the united states district court for the northern district of iowa on the basis of diversity.trimet intervened and filed a motion to dissolve the injunction.collateral ii also intervened.the member action was transferred to the district of oregon and consolidated with the lead action presided over by united states magistrate judge paul papak.
that court granted trimet renewed motion to dissolve the temporary injunction enjoining keybank from honoring trimet draw requests.trimet then successfully drew on the letter of credit in the amount of million on december.
in the proceedings that followed,the district court held that modification created a suretyship between the parties whereby collateral ii became secondarily liable for colorado railcar obligations under the railcar contract.given collateral ii status as a surety,the court concluded as a matter of law that the surety defense of discharge was available because the pma had materially increased the risk collateral ii faced as a surety without collateral ii consent.on these grounds the court granted summary judgment in collateral ii favor on trimet counterclaim for a declaration that collateral ii was in default on the railcar contract.
meanwhile,keybank had filed a counterclaim against collateral ii in the member action,seeking reimbursement for the funds it paid to trimet.the plaintiffs in the member action settled with keybank,agreeing that collateral ii was liable for the payment on the letter of credit.
in a later order,the district court granted summary judgment in favor of collateral ii on the narrow question of trimet liability for breach of statutory warranty for certifying collateral ii default in the member action,leaving open the question of damages in connection with that claim.subsequently,the court entered a consent judgment against collateral ii on keybank counterclaim against it in the member action.collateral ii paid to keybank in satisfaction of the judgment and then amended its pleading in the member action to its against trimet for unjust enrichment,money had and received,and breach of contract.
in its final order in this matter,the district court determined there was no question of fact as to collateral ii damages or as to whether the damages were a consequence of trimet breach of its statutory warranty because trimet did not offer evidence to dispute that collateral ii incurred damages when it tendered payment to keybank for reimbursement of the draw on the letter of credit.the court awarded collateral ii plus prejudgment interest and denied the remainder of both collateral ii and trimet for summary judgment as moot.
trimet appeals,asserting that its draw did not violate the statutory warranty of oregon revised statute b the district court erred in concluding that collateral ii was a surety to the railcar contract and alternatively,even assuming that collateral ii was a surety,genuine issues of material fact exist that preclude summary judgment in collateral ii favor.

trimet contends that collateral ii should not have been characterized as a surety,and thus was not entitled to the surety defense of discharge.review of the law of letters of credit and the structure of letter of credit transactions is necessary for proper evaluation of the parties relationships.
oregon revised statute defines letter of credit as a definite undertaking by an issuer to a beneficiary at the request or for the account of an applicant or,in the case of a financial institution,to itself or for its own account,to honor a documentary presentation by payment or delivery of an item of value.an applicant is the person at whose request or for whose account the letter of credit is issued,sometimes also referred to as the customer.id.the issuer is the bank or other party that issues the letter of credit.id.the beneficiary is the party entitled to payment on the letter of credit upon proper presentation of documents.id.in our case,collateral ii is the applicant,keybank the issuer,and trimet the beneficiary.
at issue here is a standby letter of credit.unlike a traditional commercial letter of credit,which is commonly used in commercial sales to reduce the risk of nonpayment for goods,standby letters of credit are used in the setting and serve to reduce the risk of nonperformance under a performance contract.john dolan,the law of letters of credit ed.to draw on the letter,the beneficiary is typically required to produce documents certifying the applicant has defaulted on its underlying obligation to the beneficiary.ochoco lumber fibrex shipping.the letter of credit transaction typically involves two contracts and the letter of credit.first,there is the underlying contract for services or goods between the applicant and beneficiary.second,there is a reimbursement contract between the applicant and issuer,requiring the applicant to reimburse the issuer for any payments made on the letter of credit.lastly,there is the issuer obligation under the letter of credit itself.
unlike the typical letter of credit transaction,in this transaction there was no underlying contract for goods or services between collateral ii and trimet.instead the performance contract was between colorado railcar and trimet.because colorado railcar fulfilled its obligation to secure a letter of credit by employing collateral ii as applicant,collateral ii and trimet did not initially contract with each other.instead,each separately contracted with a colorado railcar.this fourth relationship is the basis for collateral ii claim that it should be characterized as a surety.
we first note that a standby letter of credit itself does not create a suretyship.a standby letter of credit functions somewhat like a guaranty,given that it is the applicant default that triggers the beneficiary ability to draw on the letter of credit.james white robert summers,uniform commercial code ed.but a true letter of credit arrangement is not a guaranty.id.at.first and foremost,the issuer obligation to pay upon presentation of conforming documents is a primary obligation,not a secondary one.although default may trigger a draw,it is only upon proper certification of the applicant default that the issuer is obligated to pay.see ronald caroline olson,bank,i ssuer liability on a letter of credit is controlled solely by the terms of that letter.citation and internal quotation marks omitted.
furthermore,the independence principle controls the relationship between the issuer and beneficiary.under this principle,the issuer must pay upon proper certification with limited exceptions for fraud even if the beneficiary has breached the underlying contract with the applicant.id.a beneficiary with the underlying contract does not affect the issuer liability unless a reference to the underlying contract explicitly creates a condition for honoring a draft.citation and internal quotation marks omitted.given these distinct features of the letter of credit,it is widely recognized that the issuer is not a guarantor.see in re hamada,cir collecting cases.
here,however,it is not the issuer that is claiming surety status.it is the applicant collateral ii.oregon courts look to the restatement third of suretyship guaranty as authoritative on suretyship law.see marion sch.dist.acstar ins,or applying rest.third sur.guar.marc nelson oil,grim logging,noting rest.third sur.guar.superseded restatement security.the restatement states 
a secondary obligor has suretyship status whenever 
a pursuant to contract the secondary obligation,an obligee has recourse against a person the secondary obligor or that person property with respect to the obligation the underlying obligation of another person the principal obligor to that obligee and 
b to the extent that the underlying obligation or the secondary obligation is performed the obligee is not entitled to performance of the other obl
