under the california occupational safety and health act of or the act,et all further unlabeled statutory references are to this code,employers are required to furnish employment and a place of employment that is safe and healthful for their employees,subd.a.for purposes of the act,employment is defined as the carrying on of any trade,enterprise,project,industry,business,occupation,or work,including all excavation,demolition,and construction work,or any process or operation in any way related thereto,in which any person is engaged or permitted to work for hire,except household domestic service,subd.b,italics added.
the narrow question before us is this does work rendered on a residential remodeling project in which significant portions of a house are demolished and rebuilt,and new rooms are added,fall within the statutory household domestic service provision for employment excluded under the act based on the plain meaning of the statutory language,we conclude the answer is no.
factual and procedural background 
octoviano cortez plaintiff was seriously injured while working on a job at a house purchased and owned by lourdes abich,for her son,omar abich collectively,defendants,to use as a residence.plaintiff brought this action against defendants and the unlicensed contractor who hired him,miguel quezada ortiz alleging causes of action for negligence failure to warn and failure to make work area safe and premises liability negligence in ownership,maintenance,management,and operation of premises.
defendants moved for summary judgment after the following facts were developed through discovery.omar abich personally obtained construction permits from the city of pasadena for a remodeling project that would add over square feet to the house.although omar abich was not a general contractor and did not have a contractor license,he designated himself as the for the project and hired an architectural firm to draw up the necessary plans for approval by the pasadena building department.the project entailed demolition of existing walls and a deck,addition of a new master bedroom and a new master bathroom,construction of a garage to replace a carport,an upgrade of the kitchen,removal of the existing roof and construction of a new roof,installation of new flooring,new toilets and sinks,and new paint.
defendants contracted with a number of individuals and companies to work on the project,one of whom was ortiz defendants were unaware that ortiz did not have a contractor license,which they concede was required for the work.defendants moved out of the house once the project was under way,and they did not supervise the work.
ortiz hired plaintiff to work on the project,but the scope of that work is in dispute.for present purposes we accept plaintiff contention he was hired to help demolish the roof.when plaintiff arrived at the property,only the front part of the house remained as for the back part of the house,the roof had been removed and t he only thing that was left were the walls that were made out of brick.plaintiff proceeded to collect debris from the demolition,then climbed onto the remaining part of the roof to help with its removal.plaintiff took two steps and fell when a portion of it collapsed.he suffered a fractured spine.
in their motion for summary judgment,defendants contended they had no duty to warn plaintiff of the roof condition because he went onto the roof on his own accord and any danger was open and obvious.they also argued the work safety requirements of did not apply to the residential remodeling project.
the trial court granted defendants motion.as relevant here,the court determined as a matter of law that defendants were not plaintiff employers,and that even if they were,defendants were homeowners,who were not required to comply with.
the court of appeal affirmed summary judgment for defendants.the court first concluded that,pursuant to section,defendants must be regarded as plaintiff employers with respect to potential tort liability.nonetheless,it held as a matter of law that defendants home improvement project fell within household domestic service provision for employment excluded under the act,subd.b,because the project was undertaken for the noncommercial purpose of enhancing defendants personal enjoyment of their residence.
we granted plaintiff petition for review of the issue.
discussion 
in certain circumstances,a worker who sustains an injury is not subject to the exclusive remedy provisions of the workers compensation law et,but may bring an action against his or her employer for damages,subd.c,see zaragoza ibarra th.here,plaintiff does not seek recovery of workers compensation benefits but has sued defendants in tort for alleged violations of the safety standards that imposes on employers.
notably,defendants were not plaintiff employers in the usual sense because they did not directly hire plaintiff to work on their home.rather,defendants hired ortiz,who in turn hired plaintiff.notwithstanding this circumstance,the court of appeal determined that section rendered defendants the employers of plaintiff with respect to potential tort liability,because ortiz was not licensed as a contractor.see rosas dishong th.whether unlicensed contractors or their workers may or must be deemed the homeowners employees under section,either for purposes of tort liability generally or with regard to specifically,are difficult and unsettled questions in this court.see ramirez nelson cal th,fernandez lawson cal th,fernandez conc.opn.of brown,in re jesse ramirez drywall,ca osha.lexis in re commercial diving,ca osha.lexis.defendants,however,neglected to seek review of these issues,so we do not resolve them here.
assuming the court of appeal was correct in finding the requisite employment relationship under,we proceed to the question at hand,whether work on an extensive home remodeling project falls within the act household domestic service exclusion,subd.b.we start with a brief overview of the statutory scheme.

codified in division of the labor code,was enacted to assure safe and healthful working conditions for all california workers within its purview.to further this purpose,authorizes the enforcement of effective standards,assisting and encouraging employers to maintain safe and healthful working conditions.
under,the employment and place of employment provided to employees must be safe and healthful,subd.a.among other things,the employer must furnish and use safety devices and safeguards,adopt methods and practices that are reasonably adequate to render such employment and place of employment safe and healthful,and do every other thing reasonably necessary to protect the life,safety,and health of employees.the employer must also establish,implement,and maintain an effective injury prevention program pursuant to the act terms,subd.a.moreover,e very employer and every employee shall comply with occupational safety and health standards,including all rules,regulations,and orders pursuant to the act which are applicable to his or her own actions and conduct.
additionally,imposes specific responsibilities upon employers to provide information to employees and comply with recordkeeping requirements.for instance,employers must post information in their workplaces regarding employee protections and obligations under the act,subd.a.they must also file with the department of industrial relations,division of labor statistics and research,the report of every statutorily designated physician regarding every occupational injury or occupational illness,and immediately report cases of serious injury,illness,or death.
not only are violations punishable by civil criminal penalties et,but the act specifies that s ections and of the evidence code shall apply to this division and to occupational safety and health standards adopted under this division in the same manner as any other statute,ordinance,or regulation.this means that provisions are to be treated like any other statute or regulation and may be admitted to establish a standard or duty of care in all negligence and wrongful death actions,including third party actions.elsner uveges cal th.
employment under 
does definition of employment exempt work on a home remodeling project this is a matter of legislative intent,and the rules governing our analysis are settled.we must ascertain the legislature intent so as to effectuate the purpose of the regulatory scheme.elsner uveges,supra,cal th at.in determining such intent,we look first to the words of the statute,giving to the language its usual,ordinary import and according significance,if possible,to every word,phrase and sentence in pursuance of the legislative purpose.state farm mutual automobile ins.garamendi cal th.although we give effect to a statute according to the usual,ordinary import of its language merrill department of motor vehicles cal d,language that permits more than one reasonable interpretation allows us to consider other aids,such as the statute purpose,legislative history,and public policy.coalition of concerned communities,city of los angeles cal th.
as relevant to plaintiff action,requires employers to furnish employment and a place of employment that is safe and healthful for the employees therein,subd.a.section,subdivision b,defines employment as the carrying on of any trade,enterprise,project,industry,business,occupation,or work,including all excavation,demolition,and construction work,or any process or operation in any way related thereto,in which any person is engaged or permitted to work for hire,except household domestic service.italics added.
whether work on a home remodeling project constitutes employment excluded from application hinges on the language italicized above.plaintiff contends the first italicized phrase makes clear that defendants project fell within the regulatory reach of.conversely,defendants rely on the second italicized phrase to argue their project utilized household domestic service excepted from application.
because the labor for defendants home remodeling project entailed the carrying on of a project or work that involved demolition and construction work in which plaintiff was engaged or permitted to work for hire,it qualified as employment under section,subdivision b,unless the legislature intended the term household domestic service to include residential remodeling projects involving demolition and construction work.
as we observed in fernandez,supra,cal th,provides no definition of household domestic service,and the relevant legislative history offers no guidance on its meaning.fernandez,at.fernandez traced the term to its appearance in the original predecessor to the current act,and noted that,even then,employment excluded persons who are employed solely in household domestic services.fernandez,at discussing stats,ch.
upon reviewing the legislative history,fernandez concluded that household domestic service refers to a broad category of workers and implies duties that are personal to the homeowner,not those which relate to a commercial or business activity on the homeowner part.fernandez,supra,cal th at.noting the term is generally understood to include work both within and outside a residence,fernandez relied on decisional law and california wages and hours regulations to find that the term logically refers to all services related to the maintenance of a private household or its premises,including gardening and tree trimming.id.at citing regulatory recognition that gardeners engage in a household occupation.accordingly,fernandez concluded that noncommercial tree trimming falls within the scope of the household domestic service exception and that a homeowner who hires a person to perform such service is not subject to the act tree trimming regulations.fernandez,at.fernandez further reasoned that overwhelming public policy and practical considerations make it unlikely the legislature intended complex regulatory scheme to apply to a homeowner hiring a tree trimmer for a personal,noncommercial purpose.fernandez,at.
relying on fernandez,defendants contend that a homeowner is exempt from whenever an employee performs services on the property for the homeowner personal benefit and not for a commercial purpose.for the reasons below,we disagree.
first of all,fernandez expressly and deliberately declined to address whether a homeowner is subject to for noncommercial projects other than tree trimming.fernandez,supra,cal th at.hence,fernandez does not compel defendants interpretation of the act.
more to the point,the statutory language fails to support defendants construction.section definition of employment does not purport to categorically exempt all work performed for homeowners regardless whether excavation,demolition,or construction is involved.rather,the statute defines employment broadly as including the carrying on of any project or work,including all excavation,demolition,and construction work,or any process or operation in any way related thereto,in which any person is engaged or permitted to work for hire,and exempts only a specific type of activity household domestic service,subd.b,italics added.
as an activity,household domestic service is commonly associated with services relating to the maintenance of a household or its premises see fernandez,supra,cal th at and does not connote work contracted for in connection with an extensive home remodeling project for which a building permit must be issued,significant portions of the house are demolished and rebuilt,and entirely new rooms are framed and constructed.indeed,unlike tree trimming,the types of labor typically entailed in an extensive remodeling project appear to fall outside state regulatory categories for household occupations or services of a household nature,tit,subd.i,tit,subd.b.that is hardly surprising,inasmuch as the labor and skills characteristically necessary for such a project are not functionally equivalent to those generally regarded as sufficient for the ordinary operation or maintenance of a private household or its premises.see fernandez,supra,cal th at.moreover,the worksite conditions associated with residential demolition,construction,and improvements can be ongoing for months,and are often vastly more hazardous than the conditions typically associated with regular household maintenance 
our conclusion is consistent with crockett industrial acc.com.cal.crockett,which addressed household domestic service in the related context of workers compensation.in crockett,an employer sought to annul an award of compensation benefits for an injury a worker sustained while sweeping cobwebs in the employer residence.the industrial accident commission had based its award on the following findings of fact.crockett hired smith as a carpenter to assist him in converting a barn structure into a residence.crockett and his family lived in the structure during the conversion,although it was not then entirely habitable.while employed by crockett,smith worked primarily as a carpenter,but he performed other incidental jobs when requested,such as transporting lumber,cleaning debris as portions of the old barn were torn down,unloading furniture,and cleaning out cobwebs.one day,crockett specifically instructed smith as to the carpentry work desired,and then directed smith to do whatever crockett wife might demand of him.smith was engaged in his carpentry work when the wife asked him to clean away the cobwebs and dirt that covered the floor joists above an area where she wished to set a stove.as smith did so,dirt fell into his right eye and severely injured it.id.at.
in seeking to annul the benefits award,crockett contended that when smith stopped his carpentry work and began sweeping off the floor joists he departed from his regular duties and engaged in household domestic service,which fell within the rule of excluded employment as provided under the former workers compensation law.crockett,supra,cal.at see stats,ch,a,defining employee in part as excluding any person engaged in household domestic service.crockett rejected that contention,first observing that when crockett hired smith,he had in contemplation the remodeling and reconstruction of the old barn and that his real intention was that smith should do whatever was necessary and incidental to the work at hand.crockett
