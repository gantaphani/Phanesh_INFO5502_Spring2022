background 
a.the contractor and subcontractors 
advent was hired by global premier development,and aspen construction management,to be the general contractor for the aspen family village project in milpitas,california.advent subcontracted with pacific.in turn,pacific subcontracted with johnson to furnish and install shotcrete for the perimeter walls of the project.
b.the subcontracts 
i.the subcontract 
advent subcontracted with pacific on january,subcontract.the subcontract set forth certain definitions.contractor referred to advent.subcontractor referred to pacific.was defined as any subcontractor,architect,engineer,surveyor,laborer,or material man hired or employed by the subcontractor pacific.the term subcontract or contract referred to this subcontract meaning the subcontract,including all plans,specifications,general conditions,supplemental general conditions,special conditions,amendments and all other documents issued by the contractor prepared by the architect for the project.pacific was to be paid for its work under the subcontract.
the subcontract contained a provision regarding insurance.the provision stated,minimum insurance requirements are general liability of workers compensation.general liability must have endorsements showing the owner,contractor advent and lender as additional insured,primary as to any and all claims,and any insurance maintained by contractor shall be excess and noncontributory.
ii.the subcontract 
pacific entered into a subcontract with johnson on february,subcontract.the subcontract referred to johnson as the subcontractor.it also provided that johnson would be working on structural shotcrete for the aspen family village project and would be paid.further,it referenced the subcontract as the original contract or just the contract.
exhibit d of the referenced insurance.in a paragraph,it stated insurance requirements all subcontractors must provide insurance certificates as designated in the subcontract,naming parties listed on the attached sheet as additional insured.original signatures are required on all insurance certificates.insurance certificates must be submitted to advent prior to commencement of work under this subcontract.the attached sheet required johnson to submit certificates of liability insurance to advent and required that advent be listed as an additional insured.despite the language of exhibit d and its attached sheet,the subcontract between pacific and johnson did not actually designate anything about insurance.
c.the various insurance policies 
i.the landmark policy 
advent was insured by landmark under a million general commercial liability policy,which was in effect at the time of the accident.
ii.the topa policy 
advent was also insured by topa under a million excess commercial general liability policy,which was in effect at the time of the accident.
the topa excess policy provides that its excess liability indemnity extends to indemnify the insured for the amount of loss which is in excess of the applicable limits of liability,whether collectible or not,of the underlying insurance inserted in item of the declarations item of the declarations lists,as the general liability policy,the landmark policy.loss is defined as the sum paid in settlement of losses for which the insured is liable after making deduction for all recoveries,salvages or other insurance other than recoveries under the policy of the underlying insurance whether recoverable or not,and shall include all expenses and costs.
iii.the national union policies 
johnson was insured by national union under a million primary general liability policy,which was in effect at the time of the accident.the policy was amended to include,as additional insureds,those where required by written contract.
johnson was also insured by national union under a million excess liability policy that was in effect at the time of the accident.the excess liability policy stated that insured meant any person or organization,other than johnson,included as an additional insured under the national union primary policy,but not for broader coverage than would be afforded by the primary policy.
the national union excess policy expressly states that national union will not make any payment under the excess policy unless and until.the total applicable limits of scheduled underlying insurance have been exhausted by the payment of loss to which this policy applies and any applicable,other insurance have been exhausted by the payment of loss other insurance is defined as a valid and collectible policy of insurance providing coverage for damages covered in whole or in part by this policy.
d.the accident 
the undisputed facts of the accident giving rise to this insurance coverage action are as follows at around on august,jerry kielty,who was employed by johnson,was working as a cement pump operator.at around noon,the johnson foreman directed kielty to retrieve a piece of plywood that had been left outside between buildings and.the path to retrieve the plywood was completely outside.later,a driver of a cement truck reported that he had seen kielty enter building.the driver did not see kielty leave the building.between noon and,the johnson supervisor sent the foreman to find kielty.the foreman searched the areas between buildings and.he did not find kielty.at approximately,two helix electric employees said that they heard something fall in the garage area.at around,while searching for a ladder inside building,a pacific employee found that kielty had fallen in the stairwell area of the building.at the time,johnson was not performing any work in the interior of the building.kielty suffered severe injuries as the result of the fall and could not remember how he fell.
e.the kielty action 
on march,kielty filed an action in santa clara county superior court kielty et advent,et,sup.kielty action seeking damages for the injuries he had sustained in the accident.kielty named,among others,advent as a defendant.kielty alleged that he fell down the unguarded stairwell as a result of the negligence of the named defendants,including advent.kielty did not name johnson as a defendant 
advent tendered its defense to its insurers and included national union.advent contended that it was an additional insured under the policies issued by national union to johnson.national union initially refused the tender but later agreed to share the cost of defending advent under a reservation of its rights.
advent answer alleged that kielty was negligent and that other parties or third parties not a part of the action were responsible for the damages incurred by kielty.
advent and global against johnson for express indemnity under the contract between pacific and johnson,breach of contract,equitable indemnity,contribution,declaratory relief,and negligence.in part,advent alleged that kielty injuries were sustained as a result of johnson negligence,carelessness,tortious acts,or other acts or omissions by johnson and its employees,which included kielty.
advent and johnson moved for summary judgment on the.the trial court denied advent motion for summary judgment,finding that johnson did not have a duty to indemnify advent.the advent subcontract had an indemnity provision.however,the trial court concluded that the subcontract had no indemnification language and could not be reasonably interpreted as incorporating the indemnity provisions in the subcontract.additionally,the trial court noted that kielty did not allege that johnson was liable for his injuries.kielty complaint did not allege that johnson was responsible for the stairwell shaft where he fell or that anyone employed by johnson had directed him to enter the building.
furthermore,with respect to advent cause of action for breach of contract,the court found that johnson had met its initial burden by supplying an insurance certificate showing that johnson had complied with the requirement to provide insurance to advent.
the trial court granted johnson motion for summary judgment,and advent dismissed johnson from the kielty action with prejudice.
kielty settlement 
kielty entered into a partial settlement in the kielty action for million.under the settlement,landmark paid million,topa paid million,national union paid million,and the remainder was paid by other insurers.during the settlement process,national union continued to reserve its rights under both its primary and excess policies.the settlement agreement stated that its payment was made on behalf of its insured johnson and alleged insureds advent,global and pacific.
as part of the settlement,kielty agreed to stay the action pending a determination of whether advent was an additional insured under national union policies.if it was determined that advent was not an additional insured under national union policies,kielty agreed to dismiss all claims against advent with prejudice.if,however,it was determined that advent was an additional insured under national union policies,the stay would be lifted and trial would proceed against advent only.
h.the present action 
after the partial settlement,advent initiated this present action by suing national union for declaratory relief.advent sought a declaration that it was an additional insured under national union million excess policy.
advent moved for summary judgment,which was denied.the trial court cited to some procedural defects with advent motion,but also noted that it was not persuaded that advent interpretation of the relevant documents establishes that it is entitled to the declaration it is seeking.afterwards,advent dismissed its complaint against national union with prejudice.kielty thereafter dismissed his action against advent,making the partial settlement the full and final settlement of the kielty action.
before the denial of advent motion for summary judgment and the dismissal of advent complaint,topa intervened in the action,seeking equitable contribution for its million contribution to the settlement.topa asserted claims against national union for equitable contribution,equitable subrogation,and declaratory relief.
thereafter,topa and national union filed for summary judgment.
topa alleged that advent is an additional insured under both of johnson national union policies under the insurance requirements in the subcontract between pacific and johnson.in support of this proposition,topa pointed to the language of the national union policies,the subcontract,and the subcontract.topa argued that based on the wording of the subcontract,johnson was required to add advent as an additional insured under its primary policy with national union.as a result,national union excess policy provided coverage to advent.topa also alleged that there was coverage under national union policies,because the undisputed facts demonstrated a potential that johnson or kielty himself contributed to kielty injuries.
in its opposition to topa motion for summary judgment,national union argued that johnson never agreed to provide advent with additional insurance coverage based on the language of the subcontract,national union excess policy was in excess of topa policy and therefore did not apply,and,regardless,topa failed to demonstrate that there was actual coverage rather than potential coverage,as the issue here was one of indemnity and not defense.
national union,in its motion for summary judgment,echoed many of the same arguments that were contained in its opposition to topa motion for summary judgment.national union claimed that it was entitled to judgment in its favor because the subcontract between johnson and pacific did not require johnson to purchase additional insured coverage for advent.further,national union argued that even if johnson was required to purchase additional insured coverage for advent,coverage would apply only if johnson acts or omissions caused kielty injuries,which also had to be incurred during the performance of johnson ongoing operations for advent.national union maintained that these conditions were not present.
finally,national union asserted that the excess additional insured coverage could not be broader than the coverage available under the primary policy,and the primary policy here applied only where required by written contract.national union insisted that the primary policy had a limit of million.therefore,total additional insured coverage if any existed could not exceed million.and advent had its own excess insurance through topa,which properly paid kielty claim.
after considering the parties arguments,the trial court granted national union motion and denied topa motion.as to topa first cause of action seeking a declaration that advent was an additional insured under national union excess policy,the trial court concluded that the language of the policies did not support topa interpretation that advent was an additional insured.namely,the subcontract between pacific and johnson could not be reasonably interpreted as incorporating by reference the insurance requirements in the subcontract.further,the subcontract did not include an express insurance requirement of any kind.the only reference in the subcontract to insurance was the generic reference in exhibit d that required subcontractors to provide insurance certificates as designated in the subcontract.the trial court concluded that p oor drafting of contract language by advent pacific can not be construed against johnson.therefore,the trial court determined that topa failed to show that there was a written contract that required johnson to name advent as an additional insured on any specific policy type.the trial court also concluded that kielty never alleged that johnson was at fault for his accident.
as to topa claims of equitable contribution and equitable subrogation,the trial court determined that the same evidence supporting its conclusion that topa declaration that advent was an additional insured under the national union excess policy also supported the conclusion that the equitable claims failed.
judgment was entered in favor of national union.topa appealed.
discussion 
topa argues that the trial court erred when it granted summary judgment in favor of national union.we conclude the court did not err.

overview of topa claims 
topa alleged three causes of action a cause of action for declaratory relief seeking a declaration that advent was an additional insured under national union excess policy,advent was entitled to coverage under the excess policy,and topa is entitled to reimbursement for a portion of the settlement that topa paid a cause of action for equitable contribution,and a cause of action for equitable subrogation 
equitable contribution apportions costs among insurers sharing the same level of liability on the same risk as to the same insured,and is available when several insurers are obligated to indemnify or defend the same loss or claim,and one insurer has paid more than its share of the loss or defended the action without participation by the others.the purpose of this rule of equity is to accomplish substantial justice by equalizing the common burden shared by coinsurers,and to prevent one insurer from profiting at the expense of others.safeco ins.of america superior court th,safeco.
coverage for injuries caused by johnson or those acting on johnson behalf 
first,topa argues that the trial court erred in rejecting its argument that exhibit d in the subcontract statement that johnson was to provide insurance certificates as designated in the subcontract referred to the subcontract.national union,however,maintains that even if we were to find that the trial court erred in concluding that the subcontract is not reasonably susceptible to topa interpretation,summary judgment was still properly granted in its favor because topa failed to show that kielty injuries were caused by johnson.absent causation by johnson,national union excess policy would not afford advent with coverage.as we explain below,we agree with national union argument on this point and find that this issue is dispositive.
burdens of proof in equitable contribution claims 
before we address the merits of national union and topa appellate arguments regarding coverage,we first review the applicable burdens of proof that must be met by parties moving for summary judgment in an equitable contribution action.on appeal,the parties dispute a critical issue whether topa bore the burden to prove that kielty accident was actually covered by national union policies,or whether national union bore the burden to prove that kielty accident was not actually covered.
an insurer duty to indemnify runs to claims that are actually covered,in lights of the facts proved by definition,it entails the payment of money in order to resolve liability it arises only after liability is established.safeco,supra,th at.by settling,however,the parties forgo their right to have liability established by a trier of fact,and the settlement becomes presumptive evidence of the insured liability and the amount thereof,which presumption is subject to being overcome by proof a contrary rule would make the right to settle meaningless.ibid.
topa argues that under safeco,supra,th,it only needed to demonstrate a potential for coverage under national union excess policy.thereafter,the burden shifted to national union to show,as an affirmative defense,that coverage did not exist.
in safeco,the plaintiff the settling coinsurer sued the nonparticipating coinsurer for equitable contribution and declaratory relief,alleging that the nonparticipating coinsurer had breached its duty to defend and was thus obligated to reimburse the settling coinsurer for its share of the defense and settlements.safeco,supra,th at.the settling coinsurer moved for summary judgment,or summary adjudication,on its claims.the nonparticipating coinsurer responded by arguing that the settling coinsurer had to prove both that the nonparticipating coinsurer had a duty to defend based on a potential for coverage and that there was,in fact,actual coverage under the nonparticipating coinsurer policies.id.at.the trial court denied the settling coinsurer motion for summary judgment,siding with the nonparticipating coinsurer that the settling coinsurer had to prove that it was entitled to contribution as a matter of law.ibid.the settling coinsurer filed a petition for writ of mandate challenging the trial court ruling.
the appellate court agreed with the settling coinsurer and rejected the nonparticipating coinsurer argument that the settling insurer bore the burden of proving that the coinsurer had a duty to indemnify their mutual insureds.safeco,supra,th at.the safeco court reasoned that a nonparticipating coinsurer waives its right to challenge the reasonableness of a settlement amount with the insured.id.at.the nonparticipating coinsurer,however,does not waive its right to raise other coverage defenses as affirmative defenses in a contribution action which means,of course,that the recalcitrant coinsurer has the burden of proof on those issues.ibid.therefore,the safeco court held that in the circumstances of their case where the nonparticipating coinsurer duty to defend is undisputed,and where by law the settlements are presumptively reasonable the burden of proof is on the nonparticipating coinsurer to establish that there was no coverage and not on the settling coinsurer to prove the opposite.ibid.therefore,the appellate court granted the settling coinsurer petition for a writ of mandate to the extent that it sought a determination that the settling coinsurer had met its burden by showing a potential for coverage,and the burden then shifted to the nonparticipating coinsurer to prove the absence of actual coverage.
national union rejects the application of the principles enunciated in safeco,arguing that safeco is factually distinguishable because it involved primary insurers not excess insurers,and because the public policy that supported the shifting of burdens in safeco is not present in this current situation.unlike the nonparticipating coinsurer in safeco,national union provided a defense under its primary policy and paid million under its primary policy toward the settlement of the kielty action.national union maintains that because topa seeks contribution from national union excess policy,adhering to the principle that topa must prove existence of actual coverage would not encourage insurance companies to disavow their contractual responsibilities to their insureds citation and,by extension,their responsibilities to coinsurers.safeco,supra,th at.
we agree with national union that safeco is factually distinguishable.as national union points out,national union tendered a defense under its primary policy.it is therefore not like the nonparticipating coinsurer in safeco who refused to tender its insured a defense and thereafter refused to contribute to the settlement.rather,the dispute here concerns whether national union excess policy provides coverage to advent for kielty injuries.additionally,unlike safeco,national union duty to defend was disputed below.although national union accepted tender of advent defense,it did so under a reservation of rights and never conceded that it was obligated to defend advent in the kielty action.
despite these factual distinctions,we find the rationale behind the in safeco to be applicable here.first,we note that the discussion of burdens is complicated by the fact that both topa and national union filed motions for summary judgment,or in the alternative,summary adjudication,below.these for summary judgment are crucial to understand each party burden of proof.that is because the burdens allocated to parties are,in part,dictated by whether a party is bringing the motion for summary judgment or opposing the motion for summary judgment.
take safeco as an example.in safeco,the moving party was the settling coinsurer.under the general principles governing summary judgment motions,the settling coinsurer as the moving party bore the burden to make a prima facie showing in its motion that there was no triable issue of material fact,it was entitled to judgment as a matter of law,and there was no defense to the cause of action.code civ,subds.c p.as articulated above,safeco held that the settling coinsurer met its initial burden on its summary judgment motion by making a prima facie showing that there was coverage under the nonparticipating coinsurer policy which was satisfied by showing that there was a potential for coverage.in other words,the settling coinsurer did not have to go out of its way to negate an affirmative defense such as lack of coverage.
like the settling insurer in safeco,topa bore the burden on its motion for summary judgment to make a prima facie showing that there was no triable issue of material fact that actual coverage existed under national union excess policy.a prima facie showing is one that is sufficient to support the position of the party in question.aguilar atlantic richfield cal th.certainly,in cases where the plaintiff has not settled the case,liability would often be conclusively established by the ensuing trial outcome.a trier of fact would determine which insured or insureds,if any,are liable for the plaintiff injuries.here,however,kielty settled the action before it went to trial.by settling the parties forgo their right to have liability established by a trier of fact,and the settlement becomes presumptive evidence of the insured liability and the amount thereof,which presumption is subject to being overcome by proof.safeco,supra,th at.in this case,national union continued to reserve its rights throughout the settlement process,so the settlement can not be used as presumptive evidence that national union policy applies.
what we are left with are the allegations in kielty complaint and the parties undisputed facts recounting the accident.from this,we believe that topa can satisfy its initial burden to make a prima facie showing of actual coverage if it can demonstrate a potential for coverage based on known extrinsic facts and the allegations of the complaint.as noted by safeco,this is the same as the potential liability triggering a duty to defend.safeco,supra,th at.
similarly,national union,on its motion for summary judgment,bears the initial burden to show that a cause of action can not be established or that there is a complete defense to topa causes of actions.code civ,subd.p.national union could achieve this by presenting affirmative evidence negating an essential element of topa claim.guz bechtel national,cal th.alternatively,national union could also meet its initial burden by proving each element of an affirmative defense to topa claim of coverage,such as the affirmative defense that there was no actual coverage.safeco,supra,th at characterizing absence of actual coverage as an affirmative defense to equitable contribution.if national union meets this burden,the burden would shift to topa to produce admissible evidence showing that a triable issue of fact exists.code civ,subd.p.
applying these principles,we come to the following conclusion topa is correct that in order to satisfy its initial burden on its motion for summary judgment,it had to make a prima facie showing of actual coverage.in other words,topa must show that there is a potential for coverage.the burden would then shift to national union to demonstrate that there is a triable issue of material fact that there is evidence or a reasonable inference showing that there is no actual coverage.on the other hand,when national union moves for summary judgment,it must satisfy its initial burden by showing there are undisputed facts supporting each element of its affirmative defense of lack of coverage.once national union has satisfied this initial burden,topa must prove that a triable issue of material fact exists again,that there is evidence or a reasonable inference that there is coverage.
application to this case 
with these concepts in mind,we first evaluate whether national union met its initial burden on its motion for summary judgment to demonstrate that coverage can not be established.we find that based on the undisputed facts in the record,national union met its initial burden.
according to the national union primary policy,coverage for additional insured extends only with respect to liability for bodily injury,property damage or personal and advertising injury caused,in whole or in part,by.your johnson acts or omissions or.the acts or omissions of those acting on your johnson behalf in the performance of your johnson ongoing operations for the additional insured s at the location s designated above.
the national union excess policy provides that national union will pay on behalf of the insured those sums in excess of the retained limit that the insured becomes legally obligated to pay as damages by reason of liability imposed by law because of bodily injury to which this insurance applies italics added.accordingly,the excess policy applies only to those claims covered by the primary policy.the issue is thus whether kielty injuries were caused,in whole or in part,by johnson or by someone acting on behalf of johnson.
the following facts are undisputed kielty was working as a cement pump operator for johnson when the accident occurred.around noon,kielty was directed by a johnson foreman to retrieve a piece of plywood located outside between two buildings,building and building.the path to retrieve the plywood was outside.kielty did not return after being sent on this errand,and other workers searched for him twice in the area between buildings and.later,another subcontractor employee found kielty in a stairwell area inside of building.johnson was not performing work in the interior of building at the time of the accident.
in the underlying kielty action,kielty alleged that certain named defendants,including advent,were negligent and caused his injuries.johnson was not named in kielty lawsuit.
based on these undisputed facts,national union maintains that it is clear that kielty injuries were not caused by johnson or someone acting on behalf of johnson,which topa argues could include the johnson foreman or kielty himself.although a johnson foreman directed kielty to retrieve the plywood,the path was entirely outside.furthermore,johnson was not conducting work in the interior of building at the time of kielty fall.there is no evidence shedding light on the circumstances of kielty fall and whether he was at fault himself.based on the foregoing,we agree with national union assessment that it met its initial burden by demonstrating that johnson or kielty acts did not cause kielty injuries.
topa,however,claims that it met its burden in opposing national union summary judgment motion by demonstrating that a triable issue of fact exists regarding the existence of coverage.topa argues that based on the undisputed facts,kielty injuries were potentially caused by johnson or kielty,because a t all relevant times kielty was acting on johnson behalf and kielty injuries may have resulted from his own acts or omissions while he was acting on behalf of johnson.
national union argues that topa evidence is merely speculation,and not admissible evidence.speculation is not evidence that can be utilized in opposing a motion for summary judgment.knapp doherty th.speculation also differs from a reasonable inference.when opposition to a motion for summary judgment is based on inferences,those inferences must be reasonably deducible from the evidence,and not such as are derived from speculation,conjecture,imagination,or guesswork.joseph di loreto,th.
we agree with national union that topa does not actually provide evidence that shows that kielty injuries were caused by johnson acts or omissions or kielty own acts or omissions.the undisputed facts reflect that kielty was directed by the johnson foreman to retrieve plywood.however,for some reason,kielty went inside the building,when the path to the plywood was outside,and fell down a stairwell.there is no evidence that johnson caused kielty to enter building.the foreman did not tell him to enter the building.johnson was not even doing work inside building.in the kielty action,kielty never alleged that johnson was at fault for his fall and kielty himself could not remember how he fell.
topa seems to claim that based on the undisputed circumstances of kielty fall the fact that he was at the jobsite and was directed by the johnson foreman to retrieve plywood when he fell it can be reasonably inferred that johnson was at fault.we disagree with topa assessment,which relies purely on speculation,not reasonable inferences.
speculation about facts has been found to be insufficient when construing an insurer duty to defend which is broader than the duty to indemnify.when construing whether an insurer has a duty to defend courts have routinely held that the duty is determined by looking at the facts alleged or otherwise disclosed.it does not include made up facts,just because those facts might naturally be supposed to exist along with the known facts.friedman management,norcal mutual ins.th.an insured may not trigger the duty to defend by speculating about extraneous facts regarding potential liability or ways in which the third party claimant might amend its complaint at some future date.gunderson fire ins.exchange th.along these same lines,we do not believe that an insurer establishes there is a duty to indemnify by speculating about extraneous facts.nor is such speculation sufficient to create a triable issue of material fact.
national union directs us to paul fire marine ins.american dynasty surplus lines ins.th paul.in paul,a licensed contractor arb entered into a contract to perform construction work at a rail maintenance yard.subsequently,arb entered into a subcontract with sasco to perform electrical work.sasco was required to add arb as an additional insured under sasco liability policy with american dynasty.id.at.the subcontract with sasco provided that sasco agreed to indemnify arb and the owner of the project for damages arising out of or resulting from the performance of its work,or from injury or destruction of property that arises or is alleged to have arisen in whole or in part by an act or omission of sasco or any subcontractor under sasco,or any servants,agents,or employees.id.at.arb had its own general liability policy issued by paul.ibid.
one day,an employee of sasco was injured at the worksite after arb was a pipe connected to a fuel tank that exploded,striking the employee.paul,supra,th at.sasco was not involved in for the pipe,nor did its subcontract involve.at the time,arb was working independently of sasco.prior to the explosion,the employee had heard a hissing noise,which frightened him and caused him to run from his worksite.while running,he was struck by a fragment from the pipe in his leg.the employee filed a lawsuit against arb and the project owner.arb and the project owner tendered its defense to paul,and paul tendered defense to american dynasty,contending that the lawsuit was covered under the additional insured endorsement issued by american dynasty.ibid.american dynasty denied coverage and refused tender of the defense.ibid.subsequently,paul provided a defense to arb and the project owner,and ultimately settled the lawsuit.paul and arb then brought a cause of action against sasco and american dynasty for breach of contract and declaratory relief,seeking to recover the amount that had been paid to settle the employee lawsuit.id.at.the trial court agreed with paul and arb,but the appellate court did not.following an appeal,the appellate court reversed the trial court judgment in favor of paul and arb.id.at.
interpreting the language of the subcontract agreement,the paul court stated that by expressly limiting sasco obligation to indemnify from acts or omission arising out of or resulting from the work that sasco was to perform,the parties intended to limit the scope of sasco indemnity to injuries occurring in circumstances over which it has at least some control and where it is engaged in activity that is causally related in some manner to the injury for which indemnity is claimed.paul,supra,th at.further,t o construe the promise of indemnity made by sasco as applying merely because its employee was present within the zone of danger created solely by the negligence of arb would offend the clearly expressed intent of the parties in article of the subcontract id.at.
topa attempts to argue that it is sufficient that kielty was at the project site that day when he was injured.however,like in paul,there is no evidence that kielty was engaged in activity over which johnson had control over at the time of his accident.as we stated before,the undisputed facts reflect that kielty was told to retrieve plywood outside,and the path to the plywood was completely outside.somehow,kielty fell down an unguarded shaft in building.at the time,johnson was not performing work inside building.it was also not alleged that the unguarded shaft where kielty sustained his injuries was hazardous due to some act or omission by johnson or its employees.the only theory of causation advanced by topa is the fact that kielty was at the project site at the time of the accident.and as articulated in paul,mere presence at a jobsite is insufficient to find that an accident or injury arose from a subcontractor actions.along those same lines,we do not believe that mere presence at a jobsite is sufficient to find that the accident was caused by johnson acts or omissions.
topa cites to several cases from other jurisdictions that it claims supports its points.first,it cites to first mercury ins.shawmut woodworking supply d first mercury.in first mercury,the plaintiff insurance company first mercury sought a declaratory judgment that the defendants a general contractor and a subcontractor were not additional insureds under a general liability policy it had issued to fast trek,a.id.at.in september,a steel web structure collapsed,killing one fast trek worker and injuring three others.ibid.the employees sued.like this present case,first mercury policy extended coverage to the defendants but only for injuries caused,in whole or in by part,by fast trek acts or omissions or the acts or omissions of those acting on fast trek behalf in the performance of fast trek ongoing operations for defendants.id.at.
first mercury argued that it had no duty to defend the defendants,because there was no coverage since the employees complaints did not name fast trek as a defendant.therefore the lawsuit did not allege that the injuries were caused by fast trek.first mercury,supra,d at.the federal district court disagreed,concluding that it could consider facts outside the four corners of the state court complaints that showed there was a possibility that the injuries could have been caused at least in part by the acts or omissions of fast trek or those acting on its behalf.ibid.
first,the district court held that facts extrinsic to the complaints including an osha report suggested the possibility of coverage,because there was evidence that the accident was at least partially attributable to fast trek.first mercury,supra,d at.the court also held that the allegations in the four corners of the complaints sufficiently created the possibility of coverage.id.at.two of the complaints alleged that the employees were working for fast trek at the time of the accident and that the general contractor and subcontractor caused their injuries through their agents,servants,or employees which would include fast trek.id.at.two of the other complaints similarly alleged that the general contractor and subcontractor acted negligently through their agents,servants,employees which again would include fast trek.ibid.the complaints therefore suggested a possibility of coverage triggering first mercury duty to defend.id.at.
topa also cites to ramara,westfield ins,which was cited by the first mercury court.in ramara,an employee of a construction subcontractor was injured at a jobsite.the employee thereafter asserted claims against the general contractor and not the employer who he was barred from suing under the state worker compensation scheme.the ramara court held that consideration of the four corners of the complaint gave rise to the possibility of coverage and the general contractor was entitled to a defense under the subcontractor additional insured provision.the employee had alleged in its complaint that the general contractor was acting by and through its agents,servants,employees.accordingly,the court held that it was possible that the jury could find that the employer conduct caused the employee injury.id.at.
lastly,topa relies on pro con,interstate fire cas.d.in pro con,the allegations of the underlying complaint clearly established that the complained of injury arose from the insured operations,even though the insured was not expressly named in the complaint.id.at.
first mercury,ramara,and pro con are readily distinguishable from the present case.kielty did not allege in his complaint that his accident was caused in whole or in part by those acting on behalf of advent,which would have conceivably included johnson as a subcontractor working under advent subcontractor,pacific.neither do the undisputed facts show that kielty injuries were sustained as a result of johnson acts at the project site that day.again,kielty argument that johnson was responsible,in whole or in part,for kielty accident is based solely on speculation.
additionally,we must reject topa argument to the extent that it claims that advent and the project owner against johnson in the main kielty action,which alleged that johnson was negligent,creates a potential for coverage.the allegations made by advent and the project owner in their against johnson were not asserted against johnson in the main kielty action the action for which indemnity and coverage are sought.therefore,the allegations in the can not create coverage.see monticello ins.essex ins.th.
for these reasons,we do not believe that topa satisfies its burden in opposing national union motion for summary judgment.topa speculations about unknown facts fail to show that a triable issue of material fact exists regarding actual coverage.accordingly,we do not believe the trial court erred when it granted national union motion for summary judgment.without actual coverage,topa can not obtain equitable contribution from national union.it is also not entitled to a declaration that it is entitled to reimbursement from national union.
and for these same reasons,we do not find that topa met its initial burden on its motion for summary judgment to make a prima facie showing of actual coverage.topa showing below consisted of its speculation regarding facts that do not actually exist in the record.we can not reasonably infer from the stated evidence that johnson,or kielty himself,caused kielty injuries we can only use guesswork or our imagination.accordingly,we do not find the court erred when it denied topa motion for summary judgment.
other insurance clauses 
additionally,even if we were to find that national union excess policy provided coverage to advent as an additional insured,national union would still be entitled to judgment in its favor.we agree with national union that the topa policy was a specific excess policy that attached prior to national union general excess policy.
policy language 
the national union excess policy expressly states that national union will not make any payment under the excess policy unless and until.the total applicable limits of scheduled underlying insurance have been exhausted by the payment of loss to which this policy applies and any applicable,other insurance have been exhausted by the payment of loss other insurance is defined as a valid and collectible policy of insurance providing coverage for damages covered in whole or in part by this policy.
the topa excess policy provides that its excess liability indemnity extends to indemnify the insured for the amount of loss which is in excess of the applicable limits of liability,whether collectible or not,of the underlying insurance inserted in item of the declarations item of the declarations lists,as the general liability policy,the landmark policy advent primary policy.loss is defined as the sum paid in settlement of losses for which the insured is liable after making deduction for all recoveries,salvages or other insurance other than recoveries under the policy of the underlying insurance whether recoverable or not,and shall include all expenses and costs.
specific and general excess policies 
when two insurers cover the same level of liability,both primary or both excess on the same risk as to the same insured,courts may require each to contribute to the cost of defending the claim or indemnifying the loss.carmel development rli ins.th,carmel development.many insurance policies contain an other insurance clause that attempt to limit the insurer liability to the extent that other insurance policies may cover the same risk.id.at.although courts honor coverage terms,including other insurance clauses,whenever possible,where the policies of two or more insurers of a common insured,providing the same level of coverage for the same risk,contain conflicting other insurance clauses if one insurer pays more than its share of the loss or defense costs without participation from the other insurer or insurers,a right to contribution arises.ibid.
even when an insurance policy has an other insurance clause that purports to be excess only and another insurance policy provides for pro rata coverage,the prevailing judicial view is that imposing the entire liability for a loss on the former would annul that policy language,and create the anomaly that courts will enforce proration between policies only when they both have conflicting excess other insurance language barring proration.carmel development,supra,th at.the general rule when multiple policies share the same risk but have inconsistent other insurance clauses is to prorate according to each policy limits.id.at.
national union argues that carmel development is directly on point and compels a conclusion that topa excess policy was a specific excess policy that attached before national union general excess policy.in carmel development,a dispute arose between two excess insurers,rli insurance company rli and fireman fund insurance company fireman fund.carmel development,supra,th at.carmel development company carmel was the general contractor on a project constructing golf and residential facilities.carmel subcontracted with largo concrete company largo,which in turn subcontracted with cab concrete cab.during construction,a cab employee was severely injured at the worksite.the employee filed a lawsuit against carmel and largo and settled against largo.the lawsuit against carmel proceeded to a jury trial,and a jury awarded the employee more than million in damages.ibid.
carmel was insured by a commercial general liability policy issued by reliance insurance company reliance and a million excess liability policy from fireman fund.carmel development,supra,th at.largo had a primary commercial liability policy with acceptance insurance company acceptance and a commercial umbrella policy with rli.reliance settled the employee lawsuit for million,with reliance paying its policy limit of million and fireman fund paying million.ibid.
subsequently,carmel sued acceptance and rli seeking a judicial determination that it was an additional insured under the acceptance policy and that rli as the excess insurer was required t
