swepco is a general electric utility business that generates,transmits,distributes,and sells electric power and energy to customers in its service area.it is a public utility within the meaning of arkansas code annotated,meaning that it is subject to the jurisdiction of the arkansas public service commission the commission.
on december,swepco filed with the commission an application for a certificate of environmental compatibility and public need certificate to construct a pulverized power plant turk plant in hempstead county,arkansas.in january,hchc and others owning property adjacent to or in the general proximity of swepco proposed plant site were allowed to intervene in the proceeding before the commission.on november,after receiving public and agency comments and conducting a public hearing on the application,the commission granted swepco a certificate in connection with the turk plant.hchc has appealed the commission decision to grant the certificate to the arkansas court of appeals.
the certificate issued to swepco is subject to various conditions,including the condition that swepco obtain and comply with all necessary permits required by the united states environmental protection agency epa and the arkansas department of environmental quality adeq.at the time that the instant litigation was commenced,swepco was in the process of obtaining a psd permit,as required by the caa,a,and epa and adeq regulations.on june,adeq issued a draft psd permit for the turk plant.thereafter,hchc submitted written comments to adeq and participated in a public hearing regarding the draft permit.
in may,swepco began site preparation work at the proposed site of the turk plant.this work included the following site clearing grading and site leveling installing a detention pond for surface water runoff control installing construction trailers,office trailers,break trailers,and installing parking lots,storage and laydown areas for construction equipment and construction materials installing utilities telephone lines,computer lines,electrical,sanitary and potable water to construction facilities ordering,mobilizing and storing construction equipment on site ordering,mobilizing and storing construction materials on site installing access roads to and on site and installing temporary security fencing on site.
on may,hchc filed this citizen suit against swepco pursuant to a.in its complaint,hchc alleged that swepco had begun actual construction of the proposed turk plant without first obtaining a valid psd permit as required by the caa.hchc asked the district court to enjoin swepco from further construction on the proposed plant site until such time as a psd permit had been obtained from the adeq.in response,swepco asserted that it had not begun actual construction of the turk plant.rather,it contended that it was engaging in site preparatory work that is allowed by epa and adeq regulations,along with the epa guidance memorandums interpreting the psd requirements.
after conducting a hearing on hchc motion for a preliminary injunction,the district court issued an order denying the preliminary injunction on july.at the time of the district court judgment,the adeq had not yet issued a final permit to swepco.hchc timely filed a notice of appeal on july.
on november,the adeq issued swepco the psd permit.acting pursuant to the epa approval of its state psd program,the adeq has now permitted swepco to construct and operate the turk plant.but in early december,hchc and others filed requests for an adjudicatory hearing on the turk plant psd permit.all challenges were consolidated into a proceeding before an administrative law judge alj with the arkansas pollution and ecology commission apc ec.the alj has not yet held a hearing on the merits of the permit challenges.
under arkansas code annotated c,the issuance,modification,or revocation of a permit by the adeq that is subject to an adjudicatory appeal is automatically stayed.but this provision permits the apc ec to grant an application by a party to modify or terminate the otherwise automatic stay under appropriate circumstances to avoid substantial prejudice to any party.ann.c c.swepco invoked this provision,filing a motion for partial relief from automatic stay to avoid substantial job losses and to allow swepco to continue constructing,but not operating,the facility.hchc opposed swepco request.after a hearing on december,the apc ec granted swepco motion and modified the automatic stay to the extent that it would have otherwise precluded swepco from proceeding with the construction activities at the site.construction of the turk plant is now underway in hempstead county,arkansas.
ii.discussion 
in its motion to dismiss the appeal as moot,swepco asserts that it has now received the psd permit under the caa and has lawfully begun construction at the site,rendering moot hchc appeal of the denial of its motion for a preliminary injunction to halt preconstruction activities.
in response,hchc argues that the appeal should not be dismissed for two reasons.first,hchc maintains that caa a authorizes a citizen suit when a person proposes to construct or constructs a caa facility without a valid permit under the caa.according to hchc,a claims are viable even in relation to permits if the permits are the subject of administrative or legal challenges testing their validity.thus,hchc asserts that a live case and controversy exists because swepco permit is the subject of an administrative and legal challenge testing whether swepco has proposed to construct and is constructing the hempstead plant without a valid permit.
second,hchc argues that,in interlocutory appeals regarding requests for preliminary injunctive relief,doctrine encourages appellate courts to resolve the underlying merits of a case if legal and factual issues were sufficiently illuminated in the proceedings before a district court and if doing so serves judicial economy.hchc maintains that the relevant legal and factual issues were sufficiently and exhaustively illuminated and presented in the district court and that the parties will incur undue expense and burden if this matter is remanded.hchc thus seeks to avoid reargument of these substantive issues to the district court on remand.as a result,hchc contends that,even assuming there is no longer a case or controversy regarding hchc request for preliminary relief,the court sho
