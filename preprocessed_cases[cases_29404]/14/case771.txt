in this matter,a school playground has become a neighborhood battleground.this case arises from objections by appellants eureka citizens for responsible government eureka citizens james emery,and andrew and ida nash collectively,appellants to use by the eureka church of the nazarene church,and its related redwood christian school school collectively,applicant,of a portion of its property as a school playground the project.appellants contend that the city of eureka city improperly granted post hoc approval of illegally constructed project improvements,failed to properly apply and enforce its own land use ordinances,and failed to conduct an appropriate environmental review as required by the california environmental quality act pub.resources code,et.ceqa.the trial court denied appellants petition for writ of mandate seeking to overturn the city approval of the project.we affirm.
facts and procedural history 
the church has occupied the property at e street in eureka for over years.for the past years,the church has operated the redwood christian school on its property.the school,which is limited to students in grades,is located within a predominantly single family residential district and therefore required a conditional use permit cup,which was granted by the city on march,one of the conditions of the approval by the city was that all school related activities be conducted within the buildings or at neighborhood playgrounds.
during the summer months of,school volunteers,unaware of the preexisting use restrictions,constructed the outdoor playground that is the focus of this dispute in an area of approximately feet by feet on a corner of the school property at the north property line a surrounding four foot high masonry fence was constructed and a prefabricated play structure,surrounded by wood fibers used as a safety surface,was installed in this area.
appellants andrew and ida nash formerly occupied the residence immediately to the north of the school.appellants nash and emery and other neighbors raised objections,and in july,the city gave notice to the school that the playground was unauthorized,and use of the play area was suspended the church then applied for modification of the cup to authorize the outdoor playground use previously prohibited 
an initial study for the project was prepared by city staff and circulated.the initial study recommended adoption of a mitigated negative declaration mnd of environmental impact.see guidelines,after public hearing on october,the eureka planning commission accepted the staff recommendations,adopted the mnd,and approved the project subject to certain mitigating conditions.
that decision was appealed to the city council by neighboring property owner and appellant james emery,individually and as president of the prairie addition neighborhood association association the association consists of owners of residences in the area surrounding the church and school.
a public hearing on the appeal was held before the city council in december.after hearing arguments from the project opponents and proponents,the city council continued the hearing and ordered preparation of an environmental impact report eir,focusing in particular on noise impact issues raised by the opponents a draft eir was prepared and circulated.among other things,the draft eir incorporated three noise studies done on the project a report by shn consulting engineers geologists,commissioned by respondents the shn study a report by winzler kelly,consulting engineers,commissioned by the association the winzler kelly study and the staff initial study.
after circulation and public comment,a final eir was prepared and the continued public hearing was set for march,after further public hearing,the city council unanimously adopted findings of fact on the evidentiary record made ceqa findings pursuant to public resources code section certified the final eir and approved the project with the zoning variance and subject to certain mitigating conditions of approval,including requirements for landscape screening,restrictions on hours of use,and limitations on school enrollment.
on april,appellants filed a petition for writ of mandate in the humboldt superior court seeking,inter alia,to set aside the certification of the eir and the approvals based on that certification following hearing on december,the trial court,by order filed december,denied the writ.appellants then dismissed their remaining causes of action,and judgment was entered in favor of respondents on january.this appeal followed.
ii.discussion 
appellants arguments focus on two areas.first,they assert that the city failed to comply with the mandates of ceqa.second,they contend that the city acted in derogation of its own land use and zoning ordinances in approving the amended cup and granting a variance from the zoning ordinances.
standard of review 
scope of the administrative record 
appellants moved in the trial court to correct or augment the administrative record,submitting additional documents which the city had declined to include in its certified record.these documents included items of correspondence to or from various city officials,only some of which relate to the applications for the project,and some of which appellants assert are relevant to ongoing land use violations by the applicant.the city objected that the proffered materials were neither presented to,nor considered by,the city council in its deliberations or decision.the motion was denied.appellants submit the same materials here.
as respondents correctly observe,appellants fail to provide a transcript of the trial court proceedings on the motion,or any order reflecting the ruling below.failure to provide an adequate record concerning an issue challenged on appeal requires that the issue be resolved against the appellants.hernandez california hospital medical center th,d hernandez.on the state of the record provided,we find no error in denial of the motion.
the content of administrative records in ceqa proceedings is governed by public resources code section,subdivision e it has been observed that this section contemplates that the administrative record will include pretty much everything that ever came near a proposed development or to the agency compliance with ceqa in responding to that development.county of orange superior court vedanta society th,d,italics omitted vedanta society.nevertheless,unlike the circumstances presented in vedanta society,appellants here fail to establish that any of the additional proffered items fall within the categories where inclusion is mandated by the statute.
evidence may be considered in administrative mandamus proceedings only if the evidence was unavailable at the time of the hearing in the exercise of reasonable diligence or if improperly excluded from the record.code civ,subd.e western states,supra,cal th at,d.appellants made no showing in the trial court that either exception applied,and make no such showing here.we therefore decline to consider the materials submitted by appellants which are outside the certified administrative record.see cadiz land rail cycle th,d.
ceqa compliance 
whenever the approval of a project with potential environmental impact is at issue,the statute and regulations have established a process to ensure that public agencies inform their decisions with environmental considerations.san lorenzo valley community advocates for responsible education san lorenzo valley unified school dist.th,d san lorenzo valley see also gentry,supra,th at,d.
the first tier is jurisdictional,requiring that an agency conduct a preliminary review in order to determine whether ceqa applies to a proposed activity.guidelines.ceqa applies to a project unless the project is exempt.pub.resources code.if the project is not exempt,the agency must proceed to the second tier and conduct an initial study.santa monica chamber of commerce city of santa monica th,d see guidelines.if the project does not qualify for a negative declaration,the third step in the process is to prepare a full eir.pub.resources code,guidelines,subd.b,san lorenzo valley,supra,th at,d gentry,supra,th at,d.the eir is the heart of ceqa.laurel heights improvement regents of university of california cal th,d,laurel heights ii.
in this case,the city found that conflicting noise studies submitted by the applicant and the opponents raised a fair argument of significant environmental noise impacts,and a full eir was prepared.see gentry,supra,th at,d eir required if the record supports a fair argument of significant environmental impact.appellants argue that the eir was flawed and inadequate.they assert that the draft eir was improperly prepared by the applicant and rubber stamped by the city so that the final eir failed to represent the independent judgment of the city.they further allege that the draft eir as circulated did not properly describe the scope of the project.they contend that the city findings based on the final eir failed to adequately address noise impacts of the project,that the project is incompatible with the historic character of the neighborhood,that aesthetic and safety impacts were ignored,and that the city failed to adequately respond to public comments.
applicant preparation of the draft eir 
appellants first complain that the initial draft of the eir was prepared by counsel for the applicants,and was therefore biased and legally inadequate.we find nothing improper in the applicant preparation of the draft document.
when an eir is required,the lead agency is responsible for preparing it,but rather than preparing it using its own staff,the agency may enlist the initial drafting and analytical skills of an applicant consultant pub.resources code,subd.a,subd.a guidelines,subd.d,so long as the agency applies its independent review and judgment to the work product before adopting and utilizing it.friends of la vina county of los angeles d.la vina sunset drive city of redlands th,d guidelines,subd.e.this methodology is common in california,and the guidelines affirmatively endorse preparation of a draft eir in the manner used in this case.la vina,supra,at.the preparation requirements of ceqa and the guidelines turn not on some artificial litmus test of who wrote the words,but rather upon whether the agency sufficiently exercised independent judgment over the environmental analysis and exposition that constitute the eir.la vina,supra,at.
the eureka community development director,kenneth hamblin,assured the city council that city staff had reviewed the draft eir and had made modifications to it.here the city also retained a consultant,environmental science associates esa,to conduct a comprehensive peer review of the draft eir.esa prepared a written report with comments and proposed changes which were sent to the applicant for incorporation in the draft eir the esa report concluded that the draft eir was consistent with the description of the proposed project adequately assessed the potential noise impact of the proposed project complied with the requirements of ceqa and reached an appropriate conclusion regarding potential noise impacts based on the studies done.
the city council made an express finding that city staff were directly involved in the review and preparation of the draft eir and final eir,that staff reviewed and commented on the administrative drafts prior to circulation,and that the eir at all times represented the independent judgment and analysis of the city.
substantial evidence supports the finding that the city conducted a detailed review and critique of the applicant submission,and that it applied its independent review and judgment to the work product as it was required to do.
the eir was adequate 
claims of prior illegality 
appellants argue that the project description,as reflected in the eir,was improperly skew ed by failure to consider the nature and consequences of what appellants deemed prior illegal activities of the applicant,including historic zoning violations and alleged code violations in the construction of the playground in other words,appellants insist that the eir improperly assumed that the playground,which they contend was illegally constructed,would continue to exist even if the application to allow its use by the school were denied.
as appellants acknowledge,however,preparation of an eir is not generally the appropriate forum for determining the nature and consequences of prior conduct of a project applicant,and environmental impacts should be examined in light of the environment as it exists when a project is approved.guidelines,subd.a riverwatch county of san diego th,d riverwatch fat county of sacramento th,d.appellants argue that riverwatch is distinguishable in that the lead agency conducting the environmental review in riverwatch was a different agency than that responsible for enforcement issues.they contend that since the city is also responsible for enforcement of its codes,the concerns expressed by the court in riverwatch,regarding burdens which the development of early baselines would impose on eir drafters in determining the nature of any prior illegality riverwatch,supra,at,d,would not arise.however,what riverwatch found to be the more prudent method of dealing with alleged prior illegality reliance in the first instance on direct enforcement by the agencies charged with the responsibility of doing so,and second,to rely on the enforcing agencies to comment in the eir no less application here.because the prior illegality was subject to enforcement actions and the enforcing agency participated in the ceqa process,ceqa did not require any further accounting for prior activity at or within the vicinity of the project.riverwatch,supra,at,d.
the guidelines set forth the requirements for a project description.guidelines.the description provided in the eir is in compliance with these requirements,and accurately describes the project as the application to modify the existing cup for the school.while any alleged code violations in the construction of the playground may have been relevant to the city consideration of the variance requested,it was not a ceqa consideration 
content of the eir 
appellants challenge the sufficiency of the eir and the city findings on noise impact,aesthetic,and safety issues.they also challenge the sufficiency of the city response to public comments.
noise impacts 
it is evident from the record that the noise impacts were the principal focus of the debate over the project.the noise impacts were analyzed in the city staff report,in the applicant shn study,and in the winzler kelly study commissioned by appellants.appellants complain that the shn study was flawed and technically incompetent,failed to comport with the acoustical analysis standards contained in the city general plan policy,and provides no factual basis for the city ultimate findings that the noise levels generated by the project would not have a significant environmental impact.
disagreements among experts does not make an eir inadequate.guidelines,association of irritated residents county of madera th,d when experts in a subject area dispute the conclusions reached by other experts whose studies were used in drafting the eir,the eir need only summarize the main points of disagreement and explain the agency reasons for accepting one set of judgments instead of another.technical perfection is not required we look not for an exhaustive analysis but for adequacy,completeness,and a effort at full disclosure.rio vista farm bureau center county of solano th,d.
appellants correctly cite citizens com.to save our village city of claremont th,d for the proposition that speculation,unsubstantiated opinion,or evidence that is clearly inaccurate or erroneous,do not constitute substantial evidence.in that case,however,no evidentiary support was provided to support a fair argument that an eir was required in the first instance.while appellants here contest the methodology used and the conclusions reached in the shn study,the esa peer review found that shn used an approach and that the measured noise levels accurately characterize the contribution of the children playing on the playground to the noise in the vicinity of the redwood christian school playground.
while appellants challenge the methodology used by shn and the validity of the conclusions reached,our supreme court has cautioned reviewing courts against performing our own scientific critiques of environmental studies,a task for which we have neither resources nor scientific expertise.laurel heights improvement regents of university of california cal d,laurel heights i.our duty is not to pass on the validity of the conclusions expressed in the eir,but only on the sufficiency of the report as an informative document.the issue is not whether the studies are irrefutable or whether they could have been better.the relevant issue is only whether the studies are sufficiently credible to be considered as part of the total evidence that supports the findings.id.at.in this instance,the city staff conducted its own analysis of noise impacts in its initial study,and the city found that both the shn and winzler kelly engineering firms were well respected and qualified to prepare such studies.
the shn study concluded that the project would result in a less than decibel increase above ambient noise levels in the area.the city acknowledged the disagreement among the experts on the issue of noise.after consideration of the conflicting evidence,the city found that the playground overall noise levels would not create a significant impact,and that,based on cited evidence from the eir,the noise levels generated by the project would not significantly exceed ambient noise levels generated by other residential activities and traffic noise.the project is located on a minor arterial street,and the city determined that transportation generated noise from traffic on e street was,and would continue to be,the greatest contributor to the ambient noise level in the area.to ensure that overall noise levels would not significantly exceed ambient noise,mitigation measures,including landscape screening,were required,and the city further provided for review of the project after one year.the matter relied upon by the city for its findings included fact,a reasonable assumption predicated upon fact,or expert opinion supported by fact,which constitute substantial evidence to support the findings.pub.resources code,subd.e.
appellants also insist that the shn study was defective in failure to conform to the acoustical study guidelines of the city general plan.the city contends that,as a charter city,general plan consistency is not required in this context,relying upon government code section and verdugo woodlands homeowners.city of glendale d.the city acknowledges contra authority in friends of b street city of hayward d.we need not decide whether such an exemption applies in this case,since the evidence does not establish any clear inconsistency with the general plan.
a finding of consistency requires only that the proposed project be compatible with the objectives,policies,general land uses,and programs specified in the applicable plan.in its initial study of september,addressing project noise impacts,city staff notes that the goal of the general plan noise standards is to protect residential neighborhoods from excessive noise,and that the project would not generate excessive noise beyond that created by ambient conditions.in its finding of fact,the city expressly found that the noise generated by children using the playground will not exceed the noise standards for noise as described in the adopted general plan.
courts accord great deference to a local governmental agency determination of consistency with its own general plan,recognizing that the body which adopted the general plan policies in its legislative capacity has unique competence to interpret those policies when applying them in its adjudicatory capacity.save our peninsula,supra,th at,d,citing city of walnut creek county of contra costa d.because policies in a general plan reflect a range of competing interests,the governmental agency must be allowed to weigh and balance the plan policies when applying them,and it has broad discretion to construe its policies in light of the plan purposes a reviewing court role is simply to decide whether the public officials considered the applicable policies and the extent to which the proposed project conforms with those policies.napa citizens for honest government napa county bd.of supervisors th,d.the record confirms that the city considered the project conformity to the policies of the general plan.
ii.historical resource impact 
appellants assert that the city failed to analyze the impact of the project on the historic character of the neighborhood.the guidelines provide that a project that may cause a substantial adverse change in the significance of an historical resource is subject to ceqa.guidelines,subd.b.a historical resource is one listed in,or eligible for listing in the california register of historical resources a resource included in a local register of historical resources unless the preponderance of evidence demonstrates that it is not historically or culturally significant any object,building,structure,site,area,place,record,or manuscript which a lead agency determines to be historically significant,if the lead agency determination is supported by substantial evidence.guidelines,subd.a.
a substantial adverse change in the significance of an historical resource is defined as physical demolition,destruction,relocation,or alteration of the resource or its immediate surroundings such that the significance of an historical resource would be materially impaired.guidelines,subd.b,italics added.the significance of historical resources is materially impaired when the project d emolishes or materially alters in an adverse manner those physical characteristics of an historical resource that account for or convey its historical significance.guidelines,subd.b a,italics added.
appellants contend that experts in historical preservation confirmed that the historic district surrounding the site has been materially impaired by installation of the play structure,citing a study by stillman associates,commissioned by appellants and incorporated in the eir.that study,however,offers no such conclusion.while discussing the presence of about historically significant structures in the block general neighborhood of the project which are identified in a local historic register,it posits no damage to,or impairment of,any of them.certainly it does not,and could not,suggest that the project contemplated any demolition of,or material alteration of,the physical characteristics of the identified historically significant structures.contrary to appellants argument,the only conclusion expressed in the study was that the prairie addition neighborhood was culturally significant,and that the size,bright color,and lack of setbacks create a neighborhood intrusion.
nothing in the study indicates that the neighborhood,as opposed to individual structures within it,meets the guidelines definition for a historical resource,and it was never identified as such by the city as the lead agency.as the city noted in its response to the comments to the draft eir,the evidence cited by appellants simply does not create the possibility that the project will in some way make any structure less historic appellants acknowledge the absence of case authority for the premise they assert here,and they fail to show any inadequacy of the eir in this regard.
iii.aesthetic impacts 
appellants contend that the playground will not be aesthetically pleasing and will degrade the existing visual character of the area,thus having a significant adverse aesthetic effect on the environment.they assert that the eir failed to address this issue.
aesthetic issues are properly studied in an eir to assess the impacts of a project.pub.resources code,subd.d pocket protectors city of sacramento th,d.however,a lead agency has the discretion to determine whether to classify an impact described in an eir as significant,depending on the nature of the area affected.guidelines,subd.b mira mar mobile community city of oceanside th,d mira mar national parks conservation county of riverside th,d.despite appellants reference to the presence of historically significant structures in the general neighborhood of the pro
