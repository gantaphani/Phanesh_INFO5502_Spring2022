service of summonsa 
a summons in an action or proceeding is issued by the clerk of the court,to be served on the defendant in a manner authorized by law.it is the usual means by which the court gives jurisdictional notice to the defendant,directs the defendant appearance,and thus acquires jurisdiction of the defendant person.citations.a summons may be had at the simple request of the plaintiff and may be served either by a court officer or a private individual.witkin,cal.procedure ed.actions,fn.
the sma contains a summons requirement for any action to challenge an agency decision pertaining to a subdivision any action or proceeding to attack,review,set aside,void,or annul the decision of an advisory agency,appeal board,or legislative body concerning a subdivision,or of any of the proceedings,acts,or determinations taken,done,or made prior to the decision,or to determine the reasonableness,legality,or validity of any condition attached thereto shall not be maintained by any person unless the action or proceeding is commenced and service of summons effected within days after the date of the decision.thereafter all persons are barred from any action or proceeding,italics added.
case law has made it clear that this day service of summons requirement is mandatory and acts as a statute of limitations,barring actions under the sma in which the service of summons is not accomplished within days after the challenged decision of the legislative or advisory body.friends,supra,th at,d.the day requirement applies to all types of actions seeking review of a legislative or advisory body decisions under the sma,regardless of the legal basis.id.at,d.
in friends,which was published on november,the court held as a matter of first impression that ceqa challenges raised in a writ petition that pertain to an agency decision concerning a subdivision under the sma are subject to the day service of summons requirement.friends,supra,th at,d friends was required to comply with the day summons requirement for the ceqa cause of action,because it both overlapped with the sma causes of action and could have been and was brought under the sma.
torrey hills does not contest the court findings that all claims in its writ petition fell within the scope of the sma and could have been brought under the sma.it also concedes it did not meet the day service of summons requirement.the day period expired on december.it contends,however,that the day period was tolled under code of civil procedure section,subdivision d for impossibility.
code of civil procedure section,and subdivision d,provides that i n computing the time within which service must be made pursuant to this article,there shall be excluded the time during which service was impossible,impracticable,or futile due to causes beyond the plaintiff control.italics added.torrey hills cites no authority for the proposition that this statute applies to the day requirement under government code section.in maginn city of glendale th,d,the court assumed for purposes of discussion that it could consider code of civil procedure section,subdivision d in the context of the day rule,but on the facts the court rejected the impossibility argument.
even if code of civil procedure section,subdivision d,is applicable here,torrey hills has made an insufficient showing of impossibility.the exceptions codified in code of civil procedure section,subdivision d must be construed strictly against the plaintiff.shipley sugita th,d.the excuse of impossibility,impracticability,or futility should be strictly construed in light of the need to give a defendant adequate notice of the action so that the defendant can take necessary steps to preserve evidence.bishop silva d.when plaintiff problems are within its control,no relief is available.ibid.the
