morrison homes,developer obtained a development agreement and tentative subdivision maps for the construction of two residential subdivisions in patterson,california.at the time those documents were approved,the city of patterson city allowed developers to pay a fee of per house in lieu of building affordable housing.about three years later,city increased this fee to per house and sought to apply the increased fee to developer two residential projects among others.
developer sued city claiming that the increased fee violated its vested property rights,its contractual rights under the development agreement,various statutory provisions,and constitutional provisions requiring voter approval of special taxes.the trial court found that the increased fee was permitted under section d ii of the development agreement and the amount of the increase was reasonably justified.the court entered judgment accordingly,and developer appealed 
we will conclude that the meaning of the contractual term reasonably justified presents a question of law and that,under an objective test,the term is meant to incorporate the legal standards generally applied to such fees.those legal standards require that the amount of a development fee be limited to the cost of that portion of a public program attributable to the development.city has failed to show that the increase in its fee satisfies this standard and,therefore,has failed to show that the increase was reasonably justified as required by the development agreement.
the judgment is reversed and the matter remanded for further proceedings.
development project 
developer owns two residential subdivisions,known as magnolia and bella flora and consisting of single family residential lots.the subdivisions are part of a larger development known as patterson gardens,which contains acres that are divided into seven different areas or phases.plans for patterson gardens include five areas of low density residential housing that cover acres and contain a total of dwelling units.
city conducted environmental and land use review in connection with its approval of the proposed development of patterson gardens.also,pursuant to government code section et,city entered into a development agreement with developer,dated january,development agreement.that agreement provides for the development of patterson gardens and establishes certain development rights in that project.
the city council approved the development agreement in january,and that approval became ordinance.
section of the development agreement states that,except as the agreement provides otherwise,the developer shall pay only those fees in effect prior to the effective date of the development agreement and specifically listed in exhibits residential development and development.those exhibits list certain capital facility fees,connection fees,and use fees.exhibit lists over fees,including an affordable housing fee at per unit.exhibit also states that the affordable housing fee is referenced in section of the development agreement.
section of the development agreement addresses how the parties will satisfy city affordable housing objectives.the developer has four alternatives build affordable housing units develop senior housing within the project obtain a sufficient number of affordable residential unit credits from other residential developments within city or pay an fee at the time the building permit is issued for a market rate housing unit.
section d ii of the development agreement,which is central to the contractual issues,provides in full 
developer shall pay an fee in an undetermined amount per edu equivalent dwelling unit for housing and an undetermined amount per edu for low very housing,but in no event less than the current fee of per edu.developer acknowledges that the city is currently preparing an updated analysis of its affordable housing fee and hereby agrees to be bound by the revised fee schedule,including indexing as provided by ordinance at the time of adoption of the fee,providing the same is reasonably justified.said fee shall be paid at the time a building permit is issued for each unit.
the city council also adopted resolution in january.the resolution approved the combined development plan and vesting tentative subdivision map for the patterson gardens project subject to the conditions set forth in exhibit e hereto.condition provided development of patterson gardens shall be in accordance with the approved final development plan,as modified by these conditions and as may be modified by a development agreement between the city and developer.condition also stated that the terms of the development agreement will control in the event of a conflict with the conditions.
city first adopted an affordable housing fee in.the fee originally was set at per new single family home,payable as a condition to the issuance of a building permit for such construction.
in may,city received a study prepared by its consulting firm,crawford multari clark associates,which addressed certain fees and recommended raising the affordable housing fee.that study reviewed four different approaches to calculating the affordable housing fee.one approach,the leverage analysis,considered the cost of providing an affordable single family house and assumed federal or state funding would require the local government to provide only percent of the total amount needed.it produced a fee of per unit.
in july,the city council adopted resolution,which increased the affordable housing fee to per new single family home.
in november,the city council adopted resolution,which adjusted the fees allowed under certain development agreements,including the agreement for patterson gardens.the resolution stated that the fees assessed under the development agreements could be adjusted periodically to reflect increases in the current construction cost index the resolution also stated that the index had experienced larger than normal increases and these increases warranted an adjustment to the fees allowed under the development agreements.the resolution adjusted certain fees,but not the affordable housing fee.
a declaration of david moran states that,by,city strategies for supplying affordable housing were falling short.he further states that in city investigated ways to improve the supply of affordable housing,including revisions to the development impact fee.an outcome of the investigation was a development impact fee justification study update prepared for city by crawford multari clark associates fee justification study.moran is listed as one of the authors of this study.
the fee justification study recommended increasing the affordable housing fee up to per market rate unit.this recommendation did not rely on the prior assumption part of the leverage approach to calculating the fee that the local fee could be used as leverage to obtain federal grants and loans.instead,the recommendation was based on bridging the affordability gap between the cost of a new market rate unit and the cost of units affordable to very low,low,and moderate income households.the affordability gap analysis compared the cost of units to an estimate of what the three different income levels could afford.the difference was an estimate of the subsidy someone of that income level would need to be able to obtain housing.the analysis estimated a subsidy of was needed for each unit of moderate income housing,a subsidy of was needed for each unit of low income housing,and a subsidy of was needed for each unit of very low income housing.
the next step in the calculation involved multiplying the amount of the subsidy for each income level by the number of units needed for that income category.when the three products of this multiplication were added together,the sum was the total amount of the subsidy needed for affordable housing.the fee justification study identified the number of units needed for each income level by referring to addendum to the regional housing needs assessment for stanislaus county prepared by the stanislaus council of governments that document allocated units of affordable housing to patterson,consisting of units of very low income,units of low income,and units of moderate income housing 
the fee justification study treated the allocation as establishing city need for affordable housing at units.the prior approach had defined the need for affordable housing by assuming that percent of all new dwellings in a project should be affordable to low or very low income households and that another percent should be affordable to moderate income households.
the estimates of the subsidy required per unit of affordable housing multiplied by the number of units needed for each income level produced a total subsidy of million.the study spread this total subsidy over the unentitled units in patterson as of january the result was the per unit fee of.
in march,the city council relied on the fee justification study and adopted resolution,which set the affordable housing fee at per new single family home.
proceedings 
in october,developer filed a complaint and writ petition challenging city imposition of the per unit exaction as well as city characterization that it was an increase in the affordable housing fee.
after an initial hearing in may,the trial court allowed the parties to submit additional evidence.city submitted the declaration of moran discussed above.see fn,ante.developer objected to the declaration on a number of grounds,all of which the trial court later overruled.
after another hearing,in august,the trial court reopened the case and directed the parties to provide a stipulation that attached a copy of the regional housing needs assessment for stanislaus county prepared by the stanislaus council of governments during and adopted in october.the parties submitted the stipulation in october.
the trial court issued its written decision on december.the court denied developer petition for writ of mandate,found for city on all causes of action,and overruled all objections.the court found that the methodology used by city in determining the amount of the affordable housing fee at issue is reasonable and the absolute amount of the fee here is clearly reasonable compared to that charged in other localities,using the comparisons the parties agreed the court could consider.

standards of review 
ii.vested rights claim 
developer contends that the fee violates its rights under the vesting tentative map and under government code section.
we recognize that vested rights protection extends to a property owner who has obtained a vesting tentative map.toigo town of ross th,fn,d.we conclude,nonetheless,as discussed below,that in the circumstance presented by this appeal developer contention about vested rights does not require a separate analysis.
rights vested by vesting tentative map 
city approval of the vesting tentative map was subject to conditions,and those conditions explicitly state that in the event of a conflict between the development agreement and the vesting tentative map,the terms of the development agreement shall control.therefore,if the increased fee is authorized by the development agreement,it will not offend the rights established by the approval of the vesting tentative map.in other words,the right that vested when the map was approved was the right to have any increase in the affordable housing fee comply with the terms of the development agreement 
consequently,the critical question in this appeal is whether the increased fee complied with the terms of the development agreement.if it did,then the increase will not violate any right vested under the vesting tentative map.
government code section 
iii.violation of the terms of the development agreement 
contractual language in dispute 
the development agreement clearly stated that the amount of the affordable housing fee was undetermined when the agreement was made,and that the new amount would in no event be less than per unit.whether the fee subsequently imposed by city violated the development agreement centers on the meaning of the following sentence from section d ii 
developer acknowledges that the city is currently preparing an updated analysis of its affordable housing fee and hereby agrees to be bound by the revised fee schedule,including indexing as provided by ordinance at the time of adoption of the fee,providing the same is reasonably justified.italics added.
meaning of developer acknowledgement 
developer contends its acknowledgement of the preparation of an updated analysis should not be interpreted to mean that city was allowed to change the method of analysis upon which it based the affordable housing fee.in developer view,city was allowed only to update that method of analysis and,thus,was bound to continue to use the leverage approach when calculating revisions to the affordable housing fee.
we conclude that the language in section d ii of the development agreement can not be interpreted as compelling city to use a particular methodology when calculating revisions to the fee.the reference to an updated analysis is not accompanied by language indicating it is a binding requirement or condition imposed on city.instead,it is stated merely as an acknowledgement by developer.in contrast,when the parties intended to impose a requirement or condition on the revised fee,they expressed this intent clearly.specifically,developer agreed to be bound by the revised fee provided it was reasonably justified.accordingly,we reject the view that the development agreement required city to use the leverage approach when calculating the revised fee.
meaning of reasonably justified 
the parties dispute what the phrase reasonably justified means.city contends this standard effectively waived any legal requirements that otherwise might have applied to the fee increase.in contrast,developer contends the standard incorporated the legal requirements applicable to the fee increase.see witkin,summary of cal.law ed.contracts,and cases cited therein generally,existing legal standards are implied by law into a contract.developer contends,in other words,that the terms can not be interpreted as consenting to an increase that did not conform to otherwise applicable law.
to resolve this dispute over the meaning of the development agreement,we assume that the ordinary rules of contract interpretation apply.no party has argued otherwise.
california courts have long recognized that the interpretation of a written instrument is a judicial function unless the interpretation turns upon the credibility of extrinsic evidence citation.the brea oil,th,d.in this case,the parties presented no conflicting extrinsic evidence regarding what was intended by the term reasonably justified at the time of contracting.consequently,we conclude the meaning of the term reasonably justified presents a question of law subject to independent review on appeal.smith selma community hospital th,d interpretation of a writing is a question of law where credibility of extrinsic evidence is not an issue.
a court determination of the meaning of a contract is designed to give effect to the mutual intention of the parties as it existed at the time of contracting.when contractual language is clear and explicit,it governs.alternatively,where uncertainty or ambiguity exists,the language must be interpreted in the sense in which the promisor believed,at the time of making it,that the promisee understood it.this rule is designed to protect the objectively reasonable expectations of the promisee.bank of the west superior court cal th,d,see generally wonnell,expectation,reliance,and the two contractual wrongs san diego.
here,we conclude that an objectively reasonable person would expect the term reasonably justified to mean that any increase in the affordable housing fee would conform to existing law.in other words,part of the way one would show a fee is reasonably justified is to show that it does not violate established legal principles.the contrary interpretation,which would conclude that the term did away with applicable legal requirements,would create much greater change in the relationship between the parties.an objectively reasonable person would expect more explicit language to implement such a change.thus,it is too great a leap to infer t
