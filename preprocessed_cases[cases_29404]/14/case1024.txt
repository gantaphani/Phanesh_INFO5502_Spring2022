plaintiff,korte luitjohan contractors,filed a complaint against the illinois department of transportation idot and thiems construction company,defendant,in the circuit court of montgomery county.the circuit court dismissed the claim against idot,entered a summary judgment for defendant on plaintiff claims for breach of contract,and awarded plaintiff interest for late payment.defendant appealed and plaintiff.the appeals raise issues regarding whether idot is a proper party,whether the circuit court erred by entering a summary judgment in favor of defendant on the claim for breach of contract,and whether the circuit court erred by awarding interest to plaintiff for an improper retainage.we affirm in part and reverse in part.
defendant,a general contractor,won a bid for the construction of a highway project.defendant then subcontracted with plaintiff to excavate a trench,supply trench backfill,and install a sewer pipe.the parties entered into a contract requiring them to abide by the plans and specifications set forth in the general contract between defendant and idot.the contract between plaintiff and defendant contained additional terms addressing such issues as the distribution of payments,which we will discuss.

defendant appealed,and plaintiff,naming idot as a party.
the initial issue is whether idot was a proper defendant before the circuit court.in count i of its complaint,plaintiff sought to foreclose a lien on public finds and named idot as a defendant.plaintiff requested that idot be ordered and directed to pay to the plaintiff the amount found due with interest and costs.on appeal,plaintiff contests the court dismissal of idot as a party.we conclude that the dismissal was appropriate.
