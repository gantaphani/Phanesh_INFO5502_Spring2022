in this case we determine whether courts of appeals have jurisdiction to hear appeals from judgments of county courts or county courts at law following a de novo appeal from a small claims court.the harris county civil court at law rendered a default judgment against yusuf sultan sultan carpet and floors after sultan failed to appear for trial.sultan appealed to the fourteenth court of appeals,which dismissed sultan appeal for want of jurisdiction based on section d of the texas government code wl.because we agree that courts of appeals do not have jurisdiction over cases originally filed in small claims court,we affirm the court of appeals judgment.

savio mathew mathew sued sultan in small claims court for damages resulting from the installation of a laminate floor in mathew home.the small claims court awarded mathew,and sultan filed an appeal for a de novo trial in the harris county civil court at law.see.gov t code a,b.a trial was set and notice was sent to sultan however,because sultan allegedly did not receive the trial notice,he did not appear.consequently,the county court rendered a default judgment against him.sultan appealed to the court of appeals.citing section d of the texas government code,the court of appeals concluded that it did not have jurisdiction and dismissed the appeal.wl.we granted sultan petition for review to determine whether courts of appeals have jurisdiction over judgments of county courts or county courts at law following a de novo appeal from a small claims court.
discussion 
a party dissatisfied with a small claims court judgment may appeal to the county court or county court at law for a de novo trial if the amount in controversy exceeds.gov t code a,b.the texas government code provides that a j udgment of the county court or county court at law on the appeal from the small claims court is final.id.d emphasis added.the question here is whether the word final in section d means final and appealable or final and not appealable.
before,several courts held that a county court or county court at law judgment on de novo appeal from a small claims court could be appealed to the court of appeals.see,galil moving storage,mcgregor,antonio,no pet.sablatura ellis,dist,no pet.see also alan wright et,appellate practice and procedure,smu.in,however,the first court of appeals held that the word final in section d meant that there is no further appeal beyond the county court or county court at law.davis covert,dist,pet.dism overruling sablatura.the davis holding has since been followed by most texas courts of appeals.see,oropeza valdez,antonio,no pet.woodlands plumbing rodgers,pet.denied howell aviation servs.aerial ads,no pet.williamson auto,christi,pet.dism lederman rowe,no pet.gaskill sneaky,worth,pet.denied automania,may,wl april,no pet.martin vaughan,wl,no pet.townsend accidental injury treatment,wl,no pet.not designated for publication.
although we have never specifically addressed the finality language in section d,we have twice considered similar language in other statutes.in seale mccallum,we held that a statute declaring that the district court judgment on an election contest was final precluded appellate review of election contests by the courts of civil appeals.we stated 
the election contest was instituted and tried under the provisions of revised statutes,which,while providing for a contest of primary elections,declared that the decision of the district court or judge trying the contest should be final as to all district,county precinct,or municipal offices.the plain purpose of the clause quoted was to deny appellate jurisdiction to the courts of civil appeals over contested elections of the character here involved.
id.at.in mobil oil matagorda county drainage dist,we reached the opposite conclusion.in that case,we reviewed section of the texas water code,which gives the commissioners court exclusive jurisdiction over certain proceedings relating to drainage districts and provides that the commissioners court judgment on such issues is final.id.at construing.water code.we concluded that t he legislature did not intend by using the term final in section to prevent all review of commissioners court orders,and we therefore held that commissioners court orders annexing territory for drainage districts were subject to review by the district court.id.
while both mobil oil and seale are instructive in that they address similar language,neither case offers direct insight into the legislature intent in using the word final in section d.when construing a statute,o ur primary objective is to ascertain and give effect to the legislature intent.dep t of transp.city of sunset valley.to discern that intent,we consider the objective the law seeks to obtain and the consequences of a particular construction.gov t code,see also city of sunset valley,at.we must consider the statute as a whole and give meaning to the language that is consistent with its other provisions.city of sunset valley,at.applying these principles,we conclude that by declaring in section d that the judgment of the county court or county court at law is final,the legislature intended to prohibit appeals to the courts of appeals.the legislature created the small claims court to provide an affordable and expedient procedure for litigating claims involving relatively small amounts of money see act of may,ch.laws,creating small claims court and noting t he fact that many citizens of the state of texas are now in effect denied justice because of the present expense and delay of litigation when their claims involve small sums of money and the further fact that the discouragement of litigation based on financial ability is contrary to the public policy of this state see also sanders,the small claims court,viewing the small claims court act as a whole,it must be concluded that the main object and purpose of the law was to place justice within the reach of many texas citizens,who were previously denied such relief because the litigation expense and delay overshadowed their small claim.this basic purpose is reflected in almost every aspect of small claims court procedure.for example,the institution of a small claims action requires little more than completing a form.see.gov t code b.the hearing is informal,with the sole objective being to dispense speedy justice between the parties.id.d.on appeal,the county court must dispose of the claim with all convenient speed.id.a.when construing section d in the context of other small claims court provisions,all of which underscore the legislature basic goal of providing a simplified and inexpensive court procedure,it is reasonable to conclude that in section d,the legislature intended to forgo the added time and expense which inevitably accompany an appeal to the court of appeals 
in mobil oil,we rejected matagorda county contention that the word final in section of the texas water code meant not reviewable,reasoning that the legislature did not intend to prevent all review of commissioners court orders annexing territory to drainage districts.see mobil oil,at.here,however,we note that section d incorporates a form of appellate review.the legislature has specifically provided that a dissatisfied party can obtain review of a small claims court judgment by appealing to the county court or county court at law for a de novo trial.see.gov t code a,b.thus,in section d the legislature intended not to prevent all review of a small claims court judgment,but rather to limit the extent of review and thereby minimize the expense and delay of litigation.see act of may,ch.laws.
sultan contends that because a final judgment is required for an appeal,we can not interpret the word final in section d as prohibiting review by the court of appeals.in mobil oil,we reasoned that a judgment,though final,may yet be one that is reviewable.it is the finality which makes a judgment a subject for review.at.granted,under the general rule,an appeal may be taken only from a final judgment.lehmann.but the term final,as applied to judgments,has more than one meaning.street honorable second court of appeals.indeed 
the term final judgment applies differently in different contexts.a judgment is final for purposes of appellate jurisdiction if it disposes of all issues and parties in a case.the term final judgment is also used with reference to the time when trial or appellate court power to alter the judgment ends,or when the judgment becomes operative for the purposes of res judicata.
id.citing mcwilliams mcwilliams,dist,no writ.
interpreting final in section d to mean final for purposes of appeal to the court of appeals would construe the statute to mean that every judgment by a county court concerning a small claims matter is appealable.this interpretation ignores interlocutory judgments.to be final for purposes of appeal,a judgment must dispose of all issues and parties in a case.id.at.such a determination is made on a basis.see lehmann,at noting that whether a judicial decree is a final judgment must be determined from its language and the record in the case.there are many instances in which a judgment is interlocutory and not appealable to the court of appeals.see,parking of am.wilson,partial summary judgment that did not dispose of all claims was clearly interlocutory webb jorns,order dismissing hospital from suit was interlocutory where trial court did not sever cause against hospital warren walter,judgment setting aside default judgment and granting new trial was interlocutory office employees int l union local southwestern drug,order authorizing depositions was interlocutory citizens bank of beaumont callaway,writ ref order compelling arbitration was interlocutory.therefore,we read section d to mean that a final judgment from the county court is not appealable.
furthermore,to construe section d to mean final and appealable would be redundant.absent section d,an appeal to the court of appeals would be allowed in small claims cases where the amount in controversy exceeds.see.gov t code a granting courts of appeals jurisdiction over cases in which the district courts or county courts have jurisdiction when the amount in controversy or the judgment rendered exceeds,exclusive of interest and costs.civ.prac.allowing appeals to the courts of appeals in civil cases where the judgment or amount in controversy exceeds,exclusive of interest and costs.thus,to allow the county court judgment in a small claims case to be appealed to the courts of appeals,the legislature need not specifically declare that the judgment of the county court is final and appealable.we must avoid,when possible,treating statutory language as surplusage.cont l cas.ins.functional restoration.our interpretation is also guided by the principle that a specific statute controls over a more general one.columbia hosp.moore.here,section,which applies only to civil cases originating in small claims court,controls over section,which applies to all civil cases.gov t code a,a emphasis added.
sultan also argues that to deny him the opportunity to appeal to the courts of appeals violates the texas constitution open courts provision.see.const.art.i.we disagree.under the texas constitution,the courts of appeals have jurisdiction over all cases of which the district courts or county courts have original or appellate jurisdiction,under such restrictions and regulations as may be prescribed by law.id.art.v,emphasis added.as we stated in seale mccallum,the principle is fixed that the legislature has the power to limit the right of appeal by declaring in section d that the judgment of the county court or county court at law on an appeal from the small claims court is final,the legislature exercised its constitutional power to restrict the jurisdiction of the courts of appeals 
finally,we recognize that there is a difference between the justice court and small claims court with respect to a party ability to appeal to the court of appeals.under section a of the texas government code,small claims courts have concurrent jurisdiction with the justice courts in actions involving amounts not exceeding.gov t code a.nonetheless,there is no statute restricting the right to appeal to the courts of appeals in cases originating in justice courts.a few courts of appeals have reasoned that,given this jurisdictional overlap,it is illogical for the legislature to allow appeals to the courts of appeals for claims initiated in a justice court,but not for claims initiated in a small claims court.see,davis covert,dist,pet.dism howell aviation servs.aerial ads,no pet.
we do not agree that the difference is illogical.to the contrary,it would seem illogical for the legislature to have created the small claims court if the small claims court was intended to be identical in all respects to the justice court.as we have mentioned,in creating the small claims court,the legislature sought to provide an accessible and affordable forum for litigation.the limitation on appeals is merely one of several measures intended to facilitate this goal.even if the difference between the justice court and small claims court were illogical,the problem would be one for legislative,not judicial solution.state jackson,see also enron spring indep.sch,the wisdom or expediency of a law is for the legislature to determine,not this court.
conclusion 
we hold that under section d of the texas government code,the courts of appeals lack jurisdiction over cases originally filed in the small claims court.accordingly,we affirm the judgment of the court of appeals dismissing sultan appeal for want of jurisdiction.see.a.
the jurisdictional structure of the texas court system is unimaginably abstruse.take for example this case,which raises what one might think would be a relatively simple question can a judgment for damage caused by home flooring installation be appealed to the court of appeals here is the court answer yes,if the judgment was rendered by a district court,or by a county court or a statutory county court in a case that originated in or was transferred to that court from a justice court or small claims court,or was appealed from a justice court in a case that originated there or was transferred there from the small claims court,but no,if the judgment was rendered by county court or a statutory county court in a case appealed from a small claims court.one might wonder why the answer should be so complicated,and why the court of appeals jurisdiction should depend on where,among several trial courts all with jurisdiction,the case was first filed and whether it was transferred.why,indeed.
in all fairness,the court is trying to make sense of a ambiguous statute that is part of a jurisdictional scheme that has gone from elaborate,when the statute was enacted,to byzantine.today complex answer to a simple question does not much worsen matters that are already in terrible shape.but we are seldom presented with the opportunity to give a jurisdictional statute a reasonable construction that results in more uniformity and simplicity even if only slightly more,and given that opportunity in this case,i would seize it.since,the court of civil appeals and its successor,the court of appeals,have had jurisdiction over any civil case involving more than i would hold that jurisdiction does not depend on where the first judgment in the case was in the small claims court,the justice court,the statutory county court,the county court,or the district court.to keep things simple,i would leave statutory probate courts for another day accordingly,i respectfully dissent.
as i see it,the principal error in the court analysis is that it does not pay proper attention to the context in which the statutory language we have to construe was written and the jurisdictional scheme of which it is a part.the small claims court act was enacted in and has since been recodified and amended in,four trial courts had jurisdiction over claims for money damages the district court,with a minimum jurisdictional limit of the county court in each county,with jurisdiction of claims involving between and the additional statutory county courts in counties,with the same monetary limits as the county courts and the justice court,with exclusive jurisdiction of claims up to the act created a fifth court,the small claims court,but no new judges each justice of the peace in addition to being judge of the justice court was also made judge of the small claims court notwithstanding the justice court constitutionally exclusive jurisdiction of claims up to the small claims court was given jurisdiction of wage claims up to and other monetary claims up to thus,the small claims court and justice court had concurrent jurisdiction over the smallest claims,and the same justice of the peace heard them,whether sitting as judge of the justice court or as judge of the small claims court.neither court jurisdiction overlapped that of the statutory county court,the county court,or the district court.
the purpose of the act,according to the legislature,was to address t he fact that many citizens of the state of texas are now in effect denied justice because of the present expense and delay of litigation when their claims involve small sums of money but it is doubtful whether the act did much to facilitate the adjudication of small claims already being handled by the same justices of the peace in the justice courts the act prescribed procedures that are less extensive than the rules applicable in justice courts but not appreciably simpler in actual practice for example,the act permits an action to be commenced by filing a simple,sworn statement but does not permit oral pleadings,which are standard in justice court discovery is permitted in justice court and while it was not expressly permitted at first in small claims courts,it is now perhaps the most significant difference between the two courts was the act admonition,inapplicable in justice court,that 
in every case before the small claims court,it shall be the duty of the judge to develop all of the facts in the particular case.in the exercise of this duty,the judge may propound any question of any witness or party to the suit or upon his own motion may summon any party to appear as witness in the suit as,in the discretion of the judge,appears necessary to effect a correct judgment and speedily dispose of such case 
this is in contrast to cases holding that,although a trial judge may examine a witness during a bench trial,a trial judge should not examine witnesses who are testifying before a jury a jury trial may be demanded in either court 
the jurisdictional structure of the trial courts has changed markedly since.the constitution has been amended to omit a minimum monetary limit on the district court jurisdiction and whether any such limit remains is an unresolved question the constitution has also been amended to omit monetary limits on the county court jurisdiction limits now prescribed by statute are generally from up to but at least one county court has no civil jurisdiction at all monetary jurisdictional limits on statutory county courts are generally from to but they vary widely from county to county,and many such courts have no monetary limits.the justice court retains exclusive jurisdiction over claims up to but the upper monetary limit of its jurisdiction has been increased by statute to,exclusive of interest the small claims court also has jurisdiction of all monetary claims up to,exclusive of costs for many individual courts,statutes limit or extend jurisdiction based on the subject matter of cases.also,county court judges,statutory county judges,justices of the peace as judges of the justice courts,and justices of the peace as judges of the small claims courts may,within their discretion,transfer cases to one another if the transferred case is within the transferee court jurisdiction,and sit for one another on any case over which the sitting judge would have jurisdiction in his or her own court i can not begin to describe in detail the jurisdiction of texas trial courts.my point here is merely to show how monetary limits and the jurisdictional boundaries among trial courts have changed in the past half century.
it is in this full historical context that the provision here in question must be construed.the small claims act permits an appeal to the county court or statutory county court from a final judgment in a case involving more than,exclusive of costs the appeal is actually a trial de novo in the county court or statutory county court section of the act,now recodified as section d of the government code,then states that the judgment on appeal is final as the court notes,the term final,as applied to judgments,has more than one meaning.in section of the act,final could mean one of three things not interlocutory,and therefore subject to way the word is used a few sentences earlier in permitting an appeal from a final judgment not subject to appeal at all or no longer subject to nullification by trial de novo,like the small claims court judgment,but appealable like any other judgment.i agree with the court that the first meaning makes section a false statement because it is possible for judgments of the county court or county court at law to be interlocutory.for example,a plaintiff might sue two defendants and take a default judgment against one,which would be interlocutory until it was severed or the entire case was adjudicated.the statement that a judgment on appeal is final can not mean that a judgment on appeal is not interlocutory.
the court adopts the second possible meaning of final,that the judgment of the county court or statutory county court after trial de novo can not be appealed to the court of appeals.for several reasons,i think the court construction is implausible.
first if the legislature intended section to mean that a small claims court case could never reach the court of civil appeals,then it stated nothing that was not already true.the maximum jurisdictional limit of the small claims court in was,and it was that high only for wage claims.the limit for other monetary claims was.the minimum jurisdictional limit of the court of civil appeals was thus,no case within the small claims court jurisdiction could ever reach the court of civil appeals unless the amount in controversy increased during the trial de novo appeal in the county court or statutory county court,and there was at least some authority that seemed to prohibit such a change in the case thus,under the law as it existed in,no case within the small claims court jurisdiction could ever be appealed past the county court or statutory county court,and there was no reason for the legislature to reiterate that fact in the act.
second as the court says,the legislature clear intent in creating the small claims courts was to provide an affordable and expeditious procedure for litigating claims involving relatively small amounts of money up to in.consistent with that intent,the act did not allow appeal in cases involving up to and it might well have allowed only one appeal in cases involving between and.but it would have been entirely inconsistent for the legislature to have created a court to handle small claims expeditiously and at the same time set up a structure that,when the court jurisdiction was increased,would make the small claims court the only court in the state whose judgments on significant claims could not be reviewed by the court of civil appeals.the legislature surely foresaw that the small claims court monetary jurisdictional limits might be increased over the years,as they were in and the current limit of is no longer a relatively small amount of money,at least in the same sense was in.the department of labor reports that with inflation,in is now the equivalent of in even if the legislature did not contemplate that a successor body would someday consider a claim for within the jurisdiction of the small claims court,there is also no reason to think that it intended for judgments on much larger claims,in whatever court they might be rendered,not to be appealed to the court of appeals.
third indeed,the legislature expressed the contrary intent,what was then article of the texas revised civil statutes annotated,which stated in pertinent part 
an appeal or writ of error may be taken to the court of appeals from every final judgment of the district court in civil cases,and from every final judgment in the county court in civil cases of which the county court has original jurisdiction,and from every final judgment of the county court in civil cases in which the court has appellate jurisdiction,where the judgment or amount in controversy exceeds one hundred dollars exclusive of interest and costs 
section of the act was never amended or.it and article were recodified in as sections and section a of the texas government code,respectively article,the provision,controls over section more importantly,however,the of article shows that the legislature never intended an exception to the court of civil appeals jurisdiction for cases originating in small claims court.
fourth on several occasions the legislature has expressly prohibited appeals from statutory county courts to the court of appeals in cases in which the amount in controversy does not exceed,exclusive of interest and costs,implying that an appeal can be taken in any case in which a greater amount is in controversy.for example,section of the texas government code,pertaining to the county court at law in potter county,states 
c an appeal or writ of error may not be taken to the court of appeals from a final judgment of a county court at law if 
the judgment or amount in controversy does not exceed,exclusive of interest and costs and 
the case is a civil case over which the court has appellate or original concurrent jurisdiction with the justice court 
similar provisions apply to the statutory county courts in cameron county grayson county and lubbock county although the statutes pertaining to the three latter counties were enacted prior to the statute pertaining to potter county was enacted in after the small claims court act.in,when statutes pertinent to the jurisdiction of constitutional county courts were recodified in chapter of the government code the revision was no less explicit.section,inter alia,provides generally that a constitutional county court has limited concurrent jurisdiction with the justice courts and that 
c if under subchapter e provisions relating to particular counties a county court has original concurrent jurisdiction with the justice courts in all civil matters in which the justice courts have jurisdiction,an appeal or writ of error may not be taken to the court of appeals from a final judgment of the county court in a civil case in which 
the county court has appellate or original concurrent jurisdiction with the justice courts and 
the judgment or amount in controversy does not exceed,exclusive of interest and costs 
as the revisor note explains,subsection c was derived from similar provisions found in each of the local laws codified in subchapter e in which the county court is given full concurrent civil jurisdiction with the justice courts.these statutes show that the legislature intent before and after passing the act was that the court of civil appeals would have jurisdiction in cases involving more than.
moreover,other statutes clearly contemplate that a final judgment marks when a case can be appealed,in the absence of language expressly providing otherwise,rather than when a judgment can not be appealed.section of the property code also contemplates that express language is necessary to bar appeal of an otherwise appealable final judgment of a county court 
a final judgment of a county court in an eviction suit may not be appealed on the issue of possession unless the premises in question are being used for residential purposes only 
section of the health and safety code is also express in limiting the availability of an appeal statutes barring or limiting review in this court are no less explicit.section b of the government code,provides that a judgment of a court of appeals is conclusive on the law and facts,and a petition for review is not allowed to the supreme court,in certain cases,unless a further exception applies 
to reiterate,if the court has correctly construed section of the act,then the following is true of a case involving 
jurisdiction in court of appeals 
filed in the district court 
filed in the county court or statutory county court,and decided by the judge of that court,another such court,or a justice of the peace 
filed in the justice court,and decided by a county court or statutory county court judge,or by a justice of the peace 
filed in the small claims court,transferred to the justice court,county court or statutory county court,and decided by any judge or justice of the peace eligible to sit 
filed in the small claims court,and decided by any county court or statutory county court judge,or by a justice of the peace 
no reason can be offered for the one anomaly.nor is the appellant loss,due to an incorrect but unreviewable judgment,necessarily limited to,as one of the cases cited by the court illustrates.in oropeza valdez defendant oropeza sought review of a county court judgment for,on the ground that this award was void insofar as it exceeded both the jurisdiction of the justice court and the that plaintiff valdez had sought and obtained in the justice court the san antonio court of appeals dismissed his appeal for want of jurisdiction,citing section d of the government code,but suggested that there might be other legal remedies available oropeza took up this vague invitation,seeking injunctive and declaratory relief in the district court,asserting that the county court at law judgment was void because it awarded monetary relief in excess of the jurisdictional limit of the small claims court the district court concluded that the county court judgment was not void,and the court of appeals,noting that the district court could have concluded that the increased damages were properly awarded because they had accrued because of the passage of time,affirmed thus,even if the damages awarded had exceeded the jurisdiction of the justice the county a far more substantial amount,a litigant would be left without judicial review 
the third possible meaning of final in section of the small claims court the judgment of the county court or statutory county court after de novo trial is,unlike the small claims court judgment,final and appealable like any other anomalous consequences,preserves the limit on appeal for small claims of up to,and is a reasonable construction of the statute.a judgment of the small claims court,subject to appeal by trial de novo,is not final in the same sense as other judgments as chief justice calvert wrote for the court in southern canal state bd.of water eng rs 
in lone star gas state,we said power to try a case de novo vests a court with full power to determine the issues and rights of all parties involved,and to try the case as if the suit had been filed originally in that court.the sine qua non of a de novo trial as that term is used to describe a retrial of a matter or controversy theretofore tried by another tribunal is the nullification of the judgment or order of the first tribunal and a retrial of the issues on which the judgment or order was founded.when jurisdiction of the second tribunal attaches,the judgment or order of the first tribunal is not merely suspended,but is nullified.examples of that type of trial are found in our statutes applicable to appeals from justice court judgments and from awards made by the industrial accident board 
in the small claims court act,the legislature had referred to a judgment of the small claims court as final,meaning subject to trial de novo,and may simply have wanted to emphasize for small claims litigants that the judgment after trial de novo was final in yet another sense of the word.this,in my view,is the most plausible construction of section,and certainly the least problematic.
for these reasons,i would hold that the court of appeals had jurisdiction of petitioner appeal and would reverse and remand to that court for consideration of the merits.
the statute provides that a j udgment of the county court or county court at law on the appeal from the small claims court is final.gov t code d emphasis added.
the small claims court jurisdictional limit is.see.gov t code a.
for example,appealing to a county court requires only that the appellant file an appeal bond and a notice of appeal.see.gov t code b ci
