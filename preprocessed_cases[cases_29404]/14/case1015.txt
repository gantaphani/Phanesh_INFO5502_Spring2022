plaintiff,the wauconda fire protection district district,sought declaratory and injunctive relief against defendants,lake county,illinois county,and stonewall orchards,llp stonewall,after the county approved new construction by stonewall despite stonewall noncompliance with a district ordinance.defendants filed motions to dismiss,which the circuit court of lake county granted.the district appealed,and the appellate court affirmed in part,reversed in part,and remanded the cause to the circuit court.d.we granted leave to appeal.the issues now before us are whether this court has jurisdiction to hear the matter before it and,if so,whether the district ordinance is enforceable against stonewall.we hold that jurisdiction is proper,and that the district ordinance is enforceable.accordingly,we affirm the judgment of the appellate court,which remanded the cause for further proceedings.
background 
stonewall,a private entity,operates a golf course located within the common boundaries of unincorporated lake county and the district.in november,stonewall submitted plans to the county and the district for construction of a clubhouse on the golf course.the initial plans provided for a sprinkler system.a revised version of the plans did not.the county approved the revised plans and issued a building permit to stonewall in october.
during construction of the clubhouse,the district informed stonewall that a district fire protection ordinance required the clubhouse to have a sprinkler system.the ordinance provides 
an automatic fire sprinkler system,approved by the wauconda fire protection district,shall be installed in all new construction of buildings of the following use groups as defined by the boca building code,edition assembly,business,education,factory and industrial,high hazard,institutional,mercantile,residential,and storage.wauconda fire protection district fire sprinkler ordinance,eff.november.
unlike the district sprinkler ordinance,the county building code does not require the installation of a sprinkler system in the clubhouse.according to the county code,structures such as the clubhouse,which fall into the assembly use group,are only required to contain an automatic fire suppression system where the fire area exceeds square feet.boca national building code,as amended by lake county ordinance adopting the boca national building code eff.august,
in june,around the time the clubhouse was nearing completion,the district filed a complaint in the lake county circuit court seeking to enjoin the county from issuing stonewall a temporary occupancy permit for the clubhouse,and to enjoin stonewall from occupying the clubhouse,until stonewall installed a sprinkler system.the district cited section of the fire protection district act act ilcs west as the basis for its authority to adopt and enforce its fire protection ordinance.
the county and stonewall filed motions to dismiss.they argued the district had no authority under section to adopt or enforce its sprinkler ordinance.section states 
the board of trustees of any fire protection district incorporated under this act has the power and it is its legal duty and obligation to provide as nearly adequate protection from fire for all persons and property within the said district as possible and to prescribe necessary regulations for the prevention and control of fire therein.the board of trustees may provide and maintain life saving and rescue equipment services and facilities,including an emergency ambulance service.except in cities having a population of or more inhabitants and except in municipalities in which fire prevention codes have been adopted,the board of trustees has the express power to adopt and enforce fire prevention codes and standards parallel to national standards.emphasis added.ilcs west.
specifically,the county and stonewall argued the county is a municipality for purposes of section,and because the county has adopted a fire prevention code,the county code,not the district ordinance,applies to stonewall.alternatively,the county argued it could not be compelled to enforce the district ordinance by withholding permission to occupy the clubhouse from stonewall,because section does not provide fire protection districts with the authority to require other governmental entities to enforce district regulations.
while the proceedings were pending against the county and stonewall,the county issued stonewall a temporary occupancy permit.thereafter,the district filed an amended complaint.the district sought to enjoin the county from issuing a final certificate of occupancy to stonewall.in addition,it sought a declaratory judgment that the district has the authority to enact regulations within unincorporated lake county,and that the district sprinkler ordinance is enforceable against stonewall.
the circuit court granted defendants motions to dismiss,and the district filed notice of appeal.on appeal,the appellate court,with one justice dissenting,affirmed the judgment of the circuit court in part,reversed it in part,and remanded the cause for further proceedings.d.the appellate court reversed the judgment of the circuit court as to the injunctive relief sought against stonewall and the declaratory relief sought against both defendants.it held that the district sprinkler ordinance is enforceable against stonewall,because the county is not a municipality for purposes of section.d at.the court reasoned that other sections of the fire protection district act use the word municipality to refer to cities,villages,and incorporated towns,not counties,and that the definition of municipalities adopted by the statute on statutes statute ilcs west is consistent with that understanding of the term.d at.as to the injunctive relief sought against the county,the appellate court affirmed the judgment of the circuit court,holding that the district must enforce its ordinance against stonewall without seeking enforcement by the county.d at.the appellate court noted that while section gives fire protection districts the authority to enact and enforce fire prevention regulations,the statute does not indicate that the legislature intended a fire protection district to have the power to require a county to withhold an occupancy permit.d at.
the county filed an affidavit of intent to file a petition for leave to appeal to this court with the appellate court on october,days after entry of the appellate court judgment.on november,within days after entry of the judgment,the county filed its petition for leave to appeal with this court clerk.the same day,the clerk informed the county its petition could not be accepted by the court because the october,affidavit of intent had not been sworn and subscribed by a notary public.the county immediately filed a motion seeking leave to file its petition for leave to appeal instanter.on november,an order was entered granting the county motion,the effect of which was to extend the county deadline for filing its petition for leave to appeal to november,despite the invalidity of its affidavit of intent.we later granted the county petition for leave to appeal pursuant to supreme court rule.
the county challenges the appellate court interpretation of section.before addressing the statutory interpretation issue on the merits,we must consider the district argument that this court does not have jurisdiction to hear this matter because the county failed to file a timely petition for leave to appeal.
supreme court rule 
at the time the county filed its affidavit of intent to file a petition for leave to appeal to this court supreme court rule b stated,in part 
a party seeking leave to appeal must file the petition for leave in the supreme court within days after entry of the judgment of the appellate court,or within the same days file with the appellate court an affidavit of intent to file a petition for leave,and file the petition within days after the entry of such judgment.the supreme court,or a judge thereof,on motion,may extend the time for petitioning for leave to appeal,but such motions are not favored and will be allowed only in the most extreme and compelling circumstances.b.
in the past,we have referred to this familiar rule in jurisdictional terms.see,maggio willis,roth illinois farmers insurance.in maggio,we held we did not have jurisdiction to hear the plaintiff appeal because the plaintiff failed to file a petition for leave to appeal within days of the entry of the appellate court judgment on rehearing.maggio,at.likewise,in roth,citing maggio,we dismissed the cause before us on the ground that leave to appeal was improvidently granted.roth,at.there,because the defendant affidavit of intent had no legal effect,it was insufficient to extend the defendant time for filing a petition for leave to appeal,and without the extension,the defendant petition was untimely.roth,at.
the district now contends that because the county affidavit of intent was defective,and therefore had no legal effect,the county deadline for filing its petition for leave to appeal expired days after the appellate court entered its october,judgment.accordingly,the district argues this court had no authority to grant the county an extension for filing its petition for leave to appeal outside the applicable filing period.
the concept of jurisdiction encompasses a broad array of specific doctrines that define and limit the power of courts.see,black law dictionary ed defining various types of jurisdiction.in a general sense,jurisdiction refers to a court power to decide a case or issue a decree.black law dictionary ed.for this court,as well as the appellate court and the circuit courts,the basis of that power is the illinois constitution.
according to the illinois constitution,circuit courts have original jurisdiction in all justiciable matters,except when the supreme court has original and exclusive jurisdiction.const,art.vi.the appellate court may exercise original jurisdiction when necessary to complete the determination of any case on review.const,art.vi.appeals to the appellate court from final judgments of the circuit courts are a matter of right,except when a case is directly appealable to the supreme court or the judgment in question is a judgment of acquittal after a trial on the merits in a criminal case.const,art.vi.as to the jurisdiction of the supreme court,the constitution provides that the supreme court may exercise original jurisdiction in cases relating to revenue,mandamus,prohibition,or habeas corpus.const,art.vi,a,and that it has original and exclusive jurisdiction over actions concerning the redistricting of the general assembly.const,art.iv,b and the ability of the governor to serve or resume office.const,art.v,d.appeals to the supreme court from circuit court judgments imposing the death penalty are a matter of right.const,art.vi,b.in addition,appeals to the supreme court from the appellate court are a matter of right if a federal or state constitutional question arises for the first time in and as a result of the action of the appellate court,or if the appellate court certifies that a case decided by it involves a question of such importance that the supreme court should decide the case.const,art.vi,b.
the constitution also vests the supreme court with supervisory authority over all courts.const,art.vi.as part of this supervisory authority,the supreme court may promulgate rules governing the proceedings of the courts of this state.see.const,art.vi.the constitution specifically enables the supreme court to create rules governing appeals from the appellate court.const,art.vi,c,and direct appeals from the circuit courts in cases other than those involving the death penalty.const,art.vi,b.
collectively,these constitutional provisions define the subject matter jurisdiction of the circuit courts,the appellate court,and this court,and allow this court to establish procedural rules governing the exercise of that jurisdiction.the circuit courts and the appellate court have no discretion to excuse compliance with the rules this court establishes pursuant to its supervisory authority.see,mitchell,neither the trial court nor the appellate court has the authority to excuse compliance with the filing requirements of the supreme court rules governing appeals,quoting in re smith,d.in mitchell,this court held the appellate court had no jurisdiction over an appeal where the initial period for filing notice of appeal under rule a a had elapsed,and where the appellant failed to file a motion for leave to file a late notice of appeal pursuant to rule e e.mitchell,at.this court also approved the appellate court reasoning that the circuit court lacked the authority to extend the time for filing a notice of appeal,because after days had elapsed from the time the circuit court entered its final order,the circuit court lost jurisdiction over the matters resolved in that order.mitchell,at.similarly,in archer daniels midland barth,this court held the appellate court had no jurisdiction over an appeal where the appellant notice of appeal was not timely filed because the appellant filed a motion to reconsider prior to the date on which judgment was formally entered by the circuit court,and the motion did not extend the time within which the appellant could file his notice of appeal.archer daniels,at.in short,as applied to the circuit courts and the appellate court,our rules are jurisdictional and must be strictly observed.
on the other hand,this court supervisory authority includes the discretion for this court to excuse compliance with the rules it establishes in accordance with that authority.while our rules govern the exercise of our jurisdiction,they do not place limitations upon it.only the illinois constitution limits this court subject matter jurisdiction.our rules thus do not require this court to automatically dismiss a matter when a litigant fails to strictly comply with their provisions.
we acknowledge that in maggio we noted o ur rules demand strict compliance in the timely filing of appeals or affidavits of intent as a matter of jurisdiction.maggio,at.we also acknowledge reaffirming this proposition in roth.roth,at.indeed,we do expect litigants to comply with our rules.as we expressed in roth,our rules would have little force if the legal community perceived that we,as a court,do not enforce the rules or tailor them to fit the exigencies of the moment.w e must emphasize that the supreme court rules are rules of procedure and that it is incumbent upon litigants to follow them.roth,at.we do not,in any way,retreat from this position.we clarify,however,that our rules regarding the filing of appeals and affidavits require compliance as a matter of jurisdiction merely in the sense that we will,within our discretion,enforce the consequences of noncompliance to preserve the orderly exercise of our constitutionally defined jurisdiction.they are not a jurisdictional bar in the sense that a litigant noncompliance automatically deprives us of the power to adjudicate a matter brought before us.therefore,we reject the district argument that we had no authority to allow the county to file its petition for leave to appeal after the filing period had elapsed.the extension was appropriate,and this case is now properly before this court.
we further note that this case is factually distinguishable from maggio and roth.neither of those cases presented circumstances in which a litigant requested leave to file its petition for leave to appeal instanter after expiration of the filing deadline.in maggio,the petitioner filed a second petition for rehearing with the appellate court without regard for the possibility the second petition would not stay the time period for filing a petition for leave to appeal.maggio,at.likewise,in roth,the petitioner took no measures to inform this court its affidavit of intent was defective.roth,at.
moreover,this case is not one in which the county simply ignored the rules of this court.the county did not,for instance,allow the filing deadline to expire without filing its petition for leave to appeal and then file a motion to extend the time for petitioning for leave to appeal after the deadline.here,to the contrary,the county filed its petition for leave to appeal within the period allowed after the filing of a valid affidavit of intent.then,immediately upon discovering the defect in its affidavit,the county notified this court of its situation and requested relief.
ii.the meaning of municipalities in section 
we now turn to the issue of whether the term municipalities in section of the fire protection district act includes counties.we review this statutory interpretation issue de novo.see advincula united blood services.the primary objective of statutory interpretation is to determine and effectuate the intent of the legislature.yang city of chicago.this inquiry properly begins by examining the language of the statute at issue.nottage jeka.in the absence of a statutory definition,a term within a statute must be given its ordinary and popularly understood meaning.in re.
the county argues that counties are municipalities for purposes of section and that,as a result,the county fire prevention regulations,not those of the district,apply to stonewall.the term municipalities is not defined in the fire protection district act.accordingly,the county argues this court should interpret section in light of section of the counties code ilcs west and the definition of municipality in the municipal adoption of codes and records act codes and records act ilcs a west.section of the counties code grants counties the authority to adopt regulations governing building construction,including fire prevention regulations.the codes and records act authorizes a municipality to adopt a national fire prevention code by reference and defines m unicipality as any fire protection district or other political subdivision of the state of illinois having power to legislate on the subject matters mentioned in this act.ilcs a west.we find the counties code and the codes and records act to be inapposite because of the direct applicability of the definition of municipalities in the statute on statutes ilcs west to this case.
the statute on statutes must be observed in interpreting a statute unless doing so would be inconsistent with the manifest intent of the general assembly or repugnant to the context of the statute.ilcs west.the statute adopts the definition of municipalities set forth in the illinois constitution ilcs west,which provides 
municipalities means cities,villages and incorporated towns.units of local government means counties,municipalities,townships,special districts,and units,designated as units of local government by law,which exercise limited governmental powers or powers in respect to limited governmental subjects,but does not include school districts.emphasis added.const,art.vii.
this definition of municipalities excludes counties.counties fall into the more general category of units of local government,which,notably,includes municipalities but treats them as distinct from counties.
in this case,applying the statute on statutes definition of municipalities to interpret the meaning of municipalities in section is consistent with the manifest intent of the legislature.the purpose of the fire protection district act is to protect the health,safety,and welfare of the public by ensuring the provision of adequate fire prevention and control services.see ilcs west.interpreting the exception in section that exempts certain cities and municipalities from the coverage of the act not to include counties comports with the legislature intent to ensure the provision of fire prevention and control services.under this interpretation,in some unincorporated areas,both fire protection district and county fire protection regulations will apply,not simply one of the two.this potential double coverage is consistent with ensuring adequate fire protection.
applying the statute on statutes definition of municipalities to interpret the meaning of municipalities in section is also consistent with the context of the fire protection district act.various sections of the act refer to municipalities and counties as distinct entities.see,ilcs west addressing apportionment between municipalities and counties of the costs of elections to organize fire protection districts ilcs west distinguishing between county and municipal address number systems for fire protection districts ilcs west distinguishing between counties and municipalities in addressing disconnection from one fire protection district and transfer to another.in addition,various sections of the act use the word municipality to refer specifically to cities,villages,and incorporated towns.see,ilcs west addressing the subject of a cquiring apparatus from a municipality in terms of acquiring it from any city or village or incorporated town ilcs west indicating a fire protection district may contract with any city,village,or incorporated town adjacent to it for fire protection service to be furnished by such municipality ilcs west referring to a city,village,or incorporated town as a municipality in the context of disconnecting territory from a fire protection district ilcs west referring to a city,village,or incorporated town as an annexing municipality in the context of disconnecting territory from a fire protection district ilcs west referring to a city,village,or incorporated town as such municipality in the context of disconnecting territory from a fire protection district.taken together,these sections of the fire protection district act provide strong evidence the legislature did not intend to categorize counties as municipalities for purposes of the act,but rather intended municipalities to include cities,villages,and incorporated towns.therefore,the statute definition of municipalities as cities,villages,and incorporated towns is consistent with the context of the act itself.
in sum,we agree with the district and the appellate court that section reference to municipalities does not include counties.for purposes of section,municipalities refers to cities,villages,and incorporated towns,not counties.under this interpretation,the county is not a municipality,and the district sprinkler ordinance is enforceable against stonewall.
iii.equal protection 
the county further argues that interpreting municipalities to exclude counties creates a classification that violates the equal protection guarantee of the united states constitution.see,amend.xiv.specifically,the county asserts that this interpretation creates two classes of property owners treated unequally on the basis of where they reside.individuals and businesses whose property is located in cities,villages,and incorporated towns are not obligated to comply with a fire protection district regulations as long as their municipality has adopted its own fire prevention code.on the contrary,individuals and businesses whose property is located in the unincorporated areas of a county are obligated to comply with a fire protection district regulations,even if,as in this case,the county in which they reside has adopted a comprehensive fire prevention code.the county reasons that,under this interpretation of the statute,residents of unincorporated areas that must comply with fire protection district regulations are forced to bear a greater economic burden than residents of cities,villages,and incorporated towns.
in conducting an equal protection analysis,we apply the same standards under both the united states constitution and the illinois constitution.nevitt langfelder.the guarantee of equal protection requires the government to treat similarly situated individuals in a similar fashion.jacobson department of public aid.it does not prevent the government from drawing distinctions between different categories of people in enacting legislation,but it does prohibit the government from doing so on the basis of criteria wholly unrelated to the legislation purpose.jacobson,at.where legislation does not affect a fundamental right or involve a suspect or classification,the appropriate level of scrutiny is the rational basis test.nevitt,at.under the rational basis test,a court review of a classification is limited and deferential.committee for educational rights edgar.the court simply inquires whether the means the statute employs to achieve its purpose are rationally related to that purpose.jacobson,at.if any set of facts can reasonably be conceived to justify the classification,it will not be construed as violating the equal protection guarantee.miller,at.
section of the fire protection district act does not affect a fundamental right or involve a suspect or classification.therefore,section is subject to the rational basis test.the purpose of the fire protection district act,as mentioned,is to protect the public by ensuring the provision of adequate fire prevention and control services.see ilcs west.if the term municipalities is interpreted to mean cities,villages,and incorporated towns,then section creates a residency classification,in that residents of cities,villages,and incorporated towns with fire protection codes are not obligated to bear the cost of complying with a fire protection district regulations,but residents of the unincorporated areas of a county are obligated to do so.our inquiry is thus whether this residency classification is rationally related to the purpose of protecting the health,welfare,and safety of the public by providing adequate fire prevention and control services.we find it is.
in distinguishing between counties and municipalities in section,the legislature could reasonably have concluded that,as a general matter,counties are less likely than municipalities to have comprehensive fire prevention regulations in place,and that,as a result,the residents of unincorporated areas run a greater risk of being inadequately protected from hazards than the residents of municipalities.to minimize the risk of inadequate protection,it was reasonable for the legislature to devise a fire protection plan that,in some instances,requires residents of unincorporated areas to comply with both fire protection district and county fire prevention regulations.accordingly,the legislature decision to exempt only cities,villages,and incorporated towns with fire prevention codes from the authority of fire protection thereby require unincorporated area residents,but not municipal residents,to comply with fire protection district reasonably related to the legitimate purpose of protecting the health,welfare,and safety of the public by providing adequate fire prevention and control services.therefore,interpreting municipalities to exclude counties does not raise any doubt as to the constitutionality of section.
iv.injunctive relief 
we have determined conclusively that,for purposes of section,municipalities does not include counties.as a result,the district had the authority to enact its sprinkler ordinance within unincorporated lake county,and the ordinance is enforceable against stonewall.there remains to be decided the remedial issue of whether the circuit court correctly denied the district request to enjoin the county from granting a certificate of occupancy to stonewall.neither party explicitly addressed this issue in the briefs submitted to this court,and we see no reason to disturb the conclusion of the circuit court and the appellate court that issuing an injunction against the county would be inappropriate in this case.if the county has determined the clubhouse meets the requirements for obtaining a certificate of occupancy,then it has the authority to issue the certificate.see ilcs west county board may require occupants of commercial buildings outside limits of cities,villages,and incorporated towns to obtain occupancy permits from county.the district can enforce its sprinkler ordinance on its own accord without interfering with the county enforcement of its fire prevention regulations.
the issue of injunctive relief might be different if this case presented a situation in which a fire protection district regulation conflicted with a county regulation.we note,however,that it does not.both regulations at issue here can be applied without conflict.the district ordinance requires the installation of a sprinkler system in the clubhouse,because the clubhouse falls within the set of use groups listed in the ordinance.see wauconda fire protection district fire sprinkler ordinance eff.november.the county building code,on the other hand,does not require a sprinkler system,because the clubhouse does not exceed square feet in area.see boca national building code,as amended by lake county ordinance adopting the boca national building code eff.august.the regulations establish different fire protection standards for buildings falling within the same assembly use group.in this instance,however,the district regulation is simply more stringent than that of the county.we need not resolve the question of what happens if a fire protection district regulation and a county regulation conflict.
conclusion 
we hold that the district ordinance is enforceable against stonewall.the reference to municipalities in section does not include counties,and this interpretation of the statute does not raise any doubt as to its constitutionality.the circuit court,however,was correct to deny the district request to enjoin the county from issuing a certificate of occupancy to stonewall.accordingly,we affirm the appellate court judgment,which remanded this matter to the circuit court for further proceedings.
appellate court judgment affirmed.
i concur in the conclusion that this court has jurisdiction to review this appeal and the ultimate holding that the district ordinance is enforceable against stonewall.while i agree with the outcome of this appeal,i write separately because i believe the county affidavit of intent to file a petition for leave to appeal complies with rule b.
the affidavit of intent to file petition for leave to appeal to the illinois supreme court in this case reads as follows 
lake county,illinois,by and through its attorneys michael waller,state attorney of lake county,and daniel jasica and joseph chervin,assistant state attorneys,hereby states that it intends to file a petition for leave to appeal to the illinois supreme court from the order dated october.
joseph chervin hereby states under oath that it is the intention of the to file a petition for leave to appeal to the illinois supreme court.emphasis added.
the document was signed by joseph chervin,one of the assistant state attorneys representing the county.
today opinion contains no analysis of the specific language of this affidavit.rather,it assumes that the affidavit was noncompliant with rule b because the attorney signature was not notarized.
in robidoux,this court found that an affidavit stating it was signed under oath met the requirements of rule a.robidoux oliphant.in roth,i concurred with the majority holding that the affidavit of intent to file petition for leave to appeal was not an affidavit within the meaning of rule b because it contain ed no recital that it was made under oath.roth,at,kilbride,concurring in part and dissenting in part.however,in roth,i disagreed with the majority strict enforcement of rule b nonspecific attestation requirements when this court approved as minimally sufficient under rule a an affidavit containing no notary attestation or other independent evidence that an oath was administered to the person who signed it.roth,at,kilbride,concurring in part and dissenting in part,citing robidoux,at.i specifically noted 
neither rule a nor rule b refers directly to notarization or oaths of averment or any other attestation requirement necessary to render the subject document an affidavit.roth,at,kilbride,concurring in part and dissenting in part.
here,the attorney signed the document asserting it was made under oath.the affidavit in this case is more akin to the affidavit in robidoux,asserting it was made under oath,than the affidavit in roth,lacking any such averment.accordingly,i would hold that the affidavit in this case sufficiently complied with rule b and,therefore,this court has jurisdiction to review the appeal.
this court has treated compliance with rule b as jurisdictional.see at.at,at at.at,at freeman,dissenting,joined by mcmorrow.i agree with justice freeman that compliance with our supreme court rules is jurisdictional under section of article vi of the illinois constitution.const,art.vi,and the analysis in today decision improperly turns to section of article vi.const,art.vi,at.at,at.at.at,at freeman,dissenting,joined by mcmorrow.justice freeman correctly points out that this court power to hear and decide cases is separate and distinct from our supervisory power.at.at,at freeman,dissenting,joined by mcmorrow.accordingly,i believe that this court has unnecessarily invoked its supervisory authority to reach the merits of this appeal.i disagree,however,with justice freeman conclusion that the appeal should be dismissed because this court lacks jurisdiction.at.at,at freeman,dissenting,joined by mcmorrow.
at the heart of the jurisdictional issue in this appeal is the uncertainty of the affidavit requirement.filing an affidavit of intent to file a petition for leave to appeal is,technically speaking,jurisdictional.
i agree with justice freeman,however,that this court discretionary enforcement of rule b is profoundly unfair.at.at,at,freeman,dissenting,joined by mcmorrow.in my view,this court is attempting to overcome the unfairness of strictly enforcing a nonspecific affidavit requirement by unnecessarily exercising its supervisory authority.
the real issue is not the application or enforcement of rule b.rather,the unfortunate dilemma is this court inconsistent interpretation of the nonspecific affidavit requirements of our supreme court rules.see robidoux,roth,at,kilbride,concurring in part and dissenting in part.
justice freeman has offered a number of alternative proposals to amend rule b.while i may agree with one or more of his suggestions,i believe it may be more prudent merely to abolish the affidavit of intent provision.instead,rule b should be amended to provide that all petitions for leave to appeal must be filed within days unless extended upon order entered pursuant to a timely motion as already provided by rule b.in the end,a simple overhaul of affidavit requirements in general would be preferable to this court inconsistent interpretations of affidavits in robidoux and roth.litigants should not be required to search case law and incur unnecessary fees and costs in unraveling the intricacies of our practice rules to determine the affidavit requirements under a particular rule.rather,our rules should be clear and straightforward.
for the foregoing reasons i specially concur.
i can not agree with the majority on the issue of jurisdiction.i believe that the majority resolution of this issue not only overrules our own precedent and misconstrues our constitution,but establishes a policy of rule b enforcement which is profoundly unfair.accordingly,i respectfully dissent.
the facts in this case are straightforward.the appellate court filed its opinion in this matter on october.twenty days thereafter,the county filed in the appellate court a document entitled affidavit of intent to file petition for leave to appeal to the illinois supreme court.on november,exactly days after the appellate court issued its opinion,the county filed with this court its petition for leave to appeal pla.normally,the county pla would have been timely,because filing an affidavit of intent allows a party to file its pla up to days after the date the appellate court issues its opinion.b.however the county affidavit had not been sworn and subscribed to by a notary public,a fact which serves as the genesis of today jurisdictional debate.
on the day the county filed its pla,a clerk in our clerk office noticed the faulty affidavit and contacted an assistant state attorney for the county by telephone.citing this court decision in roth illinois farmers insurance,the clerk informed the assistant that the pla was untimely because the improper affidavit did not extend the original period for pla filing and,as a result,the pla could not be accepted for filing.according to the affidavit of that assistant,the county sent a motion to this court by overnight courier on friday,november,seeking leave to file its pla instanter.the motion was filed with this court on monday,november.in the motion,the county asked this court to allow it to file the pla because the county had i attempted to comply with this court rules in good faith,ii attempted to rectify promptly its error once the court called it to attention,and iii extended considerable time and resources in preparing the pla.the county stated that although its purported affidavit admittedly failed to include a jurat executed by a notary public that failure was inadvertent.the motion,heard by a single justice on behalf of the entire court,was granted on november 
in its brief,the district argues that we should follow roth and dismiss the appeal as improvidently granted because the county pla did not suffice to confer jurisdiction on this court.the district points out that because the affidavit of intent was not sworn before a notary public,it was ineffective to extend the time for filing the pla,and thus,the pla failed to comply with the mandatory time requirements established by the rules of this court.in response,the county concedes that its affidavit was of no effect,but contends that this court order granting the motion to file the pla instanter extended the time for filing a pla,as provided in rule,effectively waiving the time limits for the instant appeal.
the majority decides this issue in favor of the county,but on grounds other than the county argued.the majority holds that compliance with the rules for appeals to this court is not a jurisdictional requirement,because this court is free to excuse noncompliance with its own rules.the majority states that our rules do not place limitations upon our jurisdiction.at.at,at.i disagree with the majority analysis and conclusion for several reasons.
first,the majority is clearly overruling roth.that case involved a situation identical to the case at bar.there,as here,a litigant filed a purported affidavit of intent with the appellate court,then filed a pla with this court within days but more than days after the appellate court filed its opinion.roth,at.there,as here,no notary public witnessed the purported affidavit.and there,as it should be here,we dismissed the appeal even though we had already granted leave to appeal.the reason we did so was that the lack of notarization rendered the first document a nonaffidavit,which meant the pla was late therefore we dismissed the appeal because o ur rules demand strict compliance in the timely filing of appeals or affidavits of intent as a matter of jurisdiction.emphasis added.roth,at,quoting maggio willis.
the majority purports to reaffirm our decisions in roth and maggio willis.see at.at,at.but the majority statement that our rules are not a jurisdictional bar at.at,at could hardly be more clearly inconsistent with the holding in roth and maggio that o ur rules demand strict compliance in the timely filing of appeals or affidavits of intent as a matter of jurisdiction.roth,at,quoting maggio,at.moreover,pardoning the county clear,unexcused noncompliance with our rules in this county offers no justification for its failure to file a proper in the face of our previous position that our rules would have little force if the legal community perceived that we,as a court,do not enforce the rules or tailor them to fit the exigencies of the moment.roth,at.the majority statement that we do not,in any way,retreat from the above statement in roth at.at,at rings startlingly hollow.
but more troubling than the majority utter disregard for our precedent is its flawed constitutional analysis.the majority touches on a number of constitutional provisions in its segue away from the clear precedent of roth and maggio.indeed,the majority mentions nearly every provision having to do with the jurisdiction of illinois courts,even those which clearly have nothing to do with this case.the majority notes the provisions relating to the original jurisdiction of the circuit court,the appellate court,and the supreme court.at.at,at.the majority notes the constitutional provisions for appeals from the circuit court to the appellate court and from the circuit court to the supreme court.at.at,at.the majority also notes the of which are present in this which there is an appeal as of right from the appellate court to the supreme court.see at.at,at.yet,in remarkable defiance of the law of averages,the majority never focuses its attention upon the single constitutional provision relevant to our jurisdiction in this case,namely,appeals from the appellate court to this court other than appeals of right.
instead,the majority veers off into a discussion of this court supervisory and general rulemaking authority.at.at,at.only in this context,in passing,does the majority mention that the constitution enables this court to create rules governing appeals from the appellate court.at.at,at,citing.const,art.vi,c.but section of article vi is the only possible source of appellate jurisdiction in the instant case.
this court jurisdiction is defined by section of article vi of the illinois constitution,which is helpfully entitled supreme.const,art.vi.subsection a defines our original jurisdiction,subsection b defines our jurisdiction over direct appeals from the circuit court,and subsection c establishes our jurisdiction to hear appeals from the appellate court.see.const,art.vi,a,b,c.therefore,because the instant case involves an appeal from the appellate court,subsection c is the only relevant provision.accordingly,i believe it is worth setting out in its entirety 
appeals from the appellate court to the supreme court are a matter of right if a question under the constitution of the united states or of this state arises for the first time in and as a result of the action of the appellate court,or if a division of the appellate court certifies that a case decided by it involves a question of such importance that the case should be decided by the supreme court.the supreme court may provide by rule for appeals from the appellate court in other cases.emphasis added.const,art.vi,c.
the above provision is quite clear.in other cases than appeals as of right,we have jurisdiction over appeals as we provide by rule.thus,contrary to the majority assertion see at.at,at,our rules are,in fact,inextricably bound up with our jurisdiction over appeals from the appellate court.indeed,the constitutional commentary specifically states,in the comments on a similar provision in section b,that our jurisdiction is subject to our rule making powers.see.const,art.vi,b,constitutional commentary,at the authority over the supreme court jurisdiction is subject only to the court rule making powers and not to legislation.
it is uncontroverted that there is no appeal as of right in the instant case.therefore,we have jurisdiction over this appeal only as we have provided by rule.and our rules do not provide for appeals when plas are filed late because of a faulty affidavit of intent.see roth,at.thus,we do not have jurisdiction over such appeals,as this court correctly held in roth,following maggio.and,therefore,we ought to dismiss the instant appeal.
i do agree with the majority that noncompliance with our rules is not a jurisdictional defect in the context of appeals as of right.our constitution has directly granted us jurisdiction to hear those appeals without any reference to our rules.const,art.vi,c.but in all other appeals from the appellate,of course,the instant constitutional grant of jurisdiction explicitly references only those appeals for which we have by rule provided.
as i mentioned previously,instead of looking to that portion of the constitution which defines our jurisdiction to hear cases,the majority turns to section of article vi,which grants this court g eneral administrative and supervisory authority over all courts.const,art.vi.the majority notes that our general rulemaking authority is derived from this section.the majority then posits that because our rules are enacted pursuant to our supervisory authority,that same supervisory authority must allow us to break them.at.at,at.
i believe this is an erroneous line of reasoning.first of all,our authority to craft rules regarding appeals from the appellate court to this court other than appeals as of right derives from section,not section the constitutional commentary specifically notes that s ection was not intended to alter the powers of the judicial and legislative branches with respect to the rule making powers.const,art.vi,constitutional commentary,at.as this court has previously recognized,our power to hear and decide cases is separate and distinct from our supervisory power.see administrative office of the illinois courts state municipal teamsters,chauffeurs helpers union,local,distinguishing supreme court authority to hear and decide cases from our general administrative and supervisory authority over the courts of this state.thus,even if the majority were correct in its conjecture that our supervisory authority permits us to break at will any rules we make pursuant to our supervisory authority,that would not permit our action here,where the rules in question were not established pursuant to our supervisory authority.moreover,even if this position were defensible,i would strongly urge my colleagues to reject it for the reasons this court endorsed in roth and which the majority avows still to believe our rules would have little force if the legal community perceived that we,as a court,do not enforce the rules or tailor them to fit the exigencies of the moment.at.at,at,quoting roth,at.here,indeed,the majority is directly stating that we showing by our actions in this case that we enforcement of our rules to the exigencies or whims of the moment.
it is true that we have previously issued opinions pursuant to our supervisory authority.see,mcdunn williams.however,until today,this step has only been taken in the most extraordinary circumstances requiring our supervision over the court system.in mcdunn,for example,two candidates were vying for a single judgeship.the appellate court resolved this situation via the somewhat surprising remedy of making them both judges.both parties having gotten what they wished,neither appealed.we addressed the case nevertheless,because the appellate court order created an unacceptable situation in the circuit court,which it was entirely,this court to resolve through our supervisory authority over the courts of this state.see mcdunn,at.the few other occasions on which we have exercised this power have involved similarly compelling circumstances.
by contrast,the instant case involves no matter which might be said even remotely to require exercise of our supervisory authority.it is a straightforward appeal involving a matter of statutory construction,in a dispute having nothing to do with any illinois court.our general administrative and supervisory authority over all illinois courts ought not to be construed as a license to ignore our rules whenever we like.see at.at,at.it is an unusual and broad grant of power,but it ought to be invoked with restraint,only when action is required to maintain the integrity of the court system,not to decide cases on a whim when litigants have flubbed our rules regarding appeals.see.const,art.vi,constitutional commentary,at the addition of the words and supervisory to section were intended to strengthen the concept of central supervision of the judicial system emphasis added.
there was a simple,procedure by which the county could have invoked this court jurisdiction in an appeal from the appellate court decision.one step in that procedure had to be taken within days after the appellate court decision file either a pla in this court or an affidavit of intent in the appellate court.rather than filing a pla,the county chose to file an affidavit of intent.the affidavit requirement of rule b is neither unclear nor onerous.any claim that the rule is unclear on its face would be irrelevant,moreover,as this court issued its opinion in roth in december of,nearly a year before the county filed its affidavit in this case.our decision in roth made it quite clear that this court jurisdiction turns on compliance with this court rules,specifically the affidavit requirement of rule b.indeed,even more specifically,we made clear that there were jurisdictional implications when a rule b affidavit of intent is not sworn before a notary public.roth,at.this court had held with crystal clarity that the p
