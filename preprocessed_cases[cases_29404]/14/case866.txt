in these consolidated appeals arising from a construction defect action,we are presented with issues relating to the application of code of civil procedure,section the plaintiffs seek reversal of a summary judgment granted to a contractor on the ground that the plaintiffs had filed their complaints more than years after the substantial completion of plaintiffs homes.the trial court rejected plaintiffs claim that the willful misconduct exception set out in subdivision f of section precluded defendants reliance on the limitation period the court held that plaintiffs had failed to provide evidence that the alleged acts of willful misconduct had been committed directly by the defendants or under their supervision.
in granting defendants motion for summary judgment,the trial court acknowledged that plaintiffs had presented evidence of latent structural defects in their homes.plaintiffs experts had opined that such defects involved deviations from the building code and construction plans,involved efforts to achieve cost savings,appear to be the result of willful misconduct,and could not be present in the houses absent either defendants knowledge of them or defendants reckless failure to inspect and supervise construction of the houses.nonetheless,the court held that plaintiffs had not produced evidence that connected defendants to the actual construction of the homes in general,to the specific latent defects in particular,or to a failure to provide for supervision of construction.
based on the legal doctrine that subjects principals to liability for the wrongs of their agents committed in the course of the agency,the principle,supported by both case and statutory law,that supervision of construction is a nondelegable duty of developers and general contractors,reasons of sound public policy and the wording of the statute itself,we conclude that defendants may not successfully assert the limitations period set out in section as a defense to this suit if the trier of fact determines that there was willful misconduct involved in the construction of plaintiffs homes,such willful misconduct resulted in the alleged latent construction defects and such willful misconduct was committed by the defendants or the facts and circumstances are such that the willful misconduct of others is appropriately chargeable to them.as we explain,we believe that plaintiffs have raised triable issues of fact on each of these points.
in order to succeed on a motion for summary judgment based on the claimed expiration of the limitation period set out in section,a defendant is not required to produce any evidence with respect to the willful misconduct exception in subdivision f unless and until the plaintiff has first produced some substantial evidence of the existence of such misconduct.because plaintiffs,however,have produced such evidence,and it has not been conclusively rebutted by defendants,the trial court erred in granting summary judgment 
factual and procedural background 
this construction defect action was initiated by a complaint filed on behalf of plaintiffs.the majority of them appeal no.from a summary judgment entered in favor of defendants glenfed development corporation and glenfed development ventures corporation defendants defendants,in turn,have filed appeals from the summary judgments granted to the subcontractors that were named as in defendants for indemnification,breach of contract and warranties,and willful misconduct nos.and.the subcontractors were granted summary judgment after the trial court determined that the defendants had no liability to plaintiffs for damages for the alleged construction defects in such circumstance,there was no basis to hold the subcontractors liable to defendants on the.defendants appealed from those judgments as a precaution in case of a reversal of the judgment entered against plaintiffs.
the operative complaint 
plaintiffs filed this action on december.although it was originally filed as a class action,class certification was later denied and the class allegations were stricken by the court.the operative fifth amended complaint the complaint alleges causes of action for strict liability,breach of express and implied warranties,negligence,and negligence per se.the focus of the complaint is defendants development of plaintiffs homes in a residential subdivision located in palmdale,california.defendants acted as both the developer and general contractor.
according to the complaint,defendants planned,developed,built,financed sold plaintiffs houses in or about.the soil upon which the houses were constructed was improperly prepared,the concrete foundations of the homes were improperly prepared and constructed,and the damage to the respective houses has continuously existed since the date of construction.structural framing in the houses was so negligently constructed as to constitute a defective and dangerous condition.as a result,substantial latent defects were created and caused to exist in the houses,and they continue to exist.
plaintiffs alleged that the acts and omissions that caused such latent defects in their houses were the result of defendants willful misconduct.such deficiencies,which constitute the proximate cause of plaintiffs damages,were not known by plaintiffs nor were they apparent by reasonable inspection they were only determinable by expert analysis,including destructive testing.defendants intended that the houses would be purchased by members of the public and used by them without inspection for latent defects defendants knew or should have known that plaintiffs would rely on defendants skill,judgment and expertise to see to it that the houses were reasonably fit for their intended purpose and free of such defects and defendants made such implied warranties about the houses.the failure of defendants to conform to their express warranties was known to defendants or should have been known to them because it was reasonably discoverable by defendants at the time the houses were constructed and sold to plaintiffs.to remedy and correct such defects will require extensive repair and replacement.
the motions for summary judgment 
a.the moving papers 
as a starting date for calculating the running of each plaintiff limitation period,defendants used the respective dates of recordation of notices of completion for the plaintiffs homes,subd.g.according to defendants,the result of their calculations was that of the named plaintiffs were brought into the case either by the original complaint or by subsequent amended complaints more than years after the limitation period commenced running as to their own particular house,and therefore their suits are barred by section.
opposition to defendants motion 
plaintiffs opposition to defendants motion was based on declarations from two experts who have worked on numerous construction defect cases,tariq shamma and scott vivian.after setting out their extensive experience in their respective fields the experts addressed latent construction defects in plaintiffs houses that had been uncovered by destructive testing.the experts opined that most of the defects undermined the structural integrity of the homes and created a substantial risk of injury to persons property.
the following is a sampling of the structural defects described by plaintiffs experts horizontal attachments for vertical truss support members were not made in the garages,which created a risk of injury when a homeowner used the rafters for storage this defect was readily visible to the expert eye and should have been recognized by defendants construction supervisors the structural integrity of the houses was severely undermined by a failure to effect shear transfer shear transfer allows buildings to withstand horizontal stresses such as are caused by wind and earthquakes there were inadequate or nonexistent holdowns on shear walls in the houses the holdowns secure shear transfer members to structural members,and their absence means the structural integrity of the houses is severely undermined there was a consistent pattern of inadequate or installation of straps and hangers on load bearing members the purpose of the straps and hangers was to secure load bearing members to each other t he failure to properly install straps and hangers called for in the plans,and indeed,where any competent builder knows they are vitally necessary,severely undermined the structural integrity of the house some driveways are short by as much as three and feet,making it impossible to park a full size vehicle in the driveway without blocking the sidewalk there were defects in the stucco per cent of the windows tested were not watertight and unreasonably leak this condition was the result of a failure to use appropriate flashing and there was a failure to use asphalt polyethylene sheeting around the windows,which was called for in the plans approved by the city instead,less expensive sisal kraft paper was used.
plaintiffs experts opined that the defects involved conspicuous failures to comply with applicable building code provisions,with the building plans,and with basic construction industry practices were of a type that inevitably would have been recognized by any competent construction supervisor conducting even minimal inspections of the type required in a construction project such as the one involved here,and would have caused the construction supervisor to require the responsible subcontractors to remedy the defects immediately,before work could proceed on the houses and had the financial impact of producing,in defendants favor,substantial cost savings.
the experts were of the opinion that the defects were not negligently caused.that is,they were not the result of someone trying to do something correctly,but carelessly failing to do so.rather,the defects appeared to be the result of willful misconduct by defendants in that they were so serious and prevalent that they were either the result of a deliberate decision to cut corners for cost savings or the result of a near total,virtually reckless,failure by the developer to adequately supervise subcontractors.the experts expressed the view that it was not reasonably possible for the builder,and the builder contractors,agents and employees,to have failed to observe or been aware of the defects.the defects are all things that could not possibly be present absent either the express or tacit approval of the builder or as a result of a complete failure by the builder to exercise even minimal supervision and conduct even minimal inspections of the work in progress.however,none of these defects would be apparent to the average home buyer or the average realtor when inspecting a home prior to purchasing it.
forty of the plaintiffs each filed personal declarations stating that they had purchased their home with the understanding it was part of defendants development and had been built according to building codes using proper materials and building practices,and that their decision to buy their home was made in reliance on such representations,as well as on the written warranties provided by defendants.the plaintiffs also stated that although they had looked at their respective properties a number of times before they purchased them,they have no special training which would enable them to recognize defects like the ones on which this suit is based,and they did not recognize or observe such defects before they purchased their home,and only became aware of the defects shortly before they became plaintiffs in this suit 
c.the trial court ruling on the summary judgment motions 
the trial court issued a lengthy ruling and subsequent order on defendants motion in which it concluded that defendants had met their burden of showing a complete defense to the plaintiffs claims by demonstrating that their claims were barred by the limitation period set out in section.the trial court rejected plaintiffs argument that an issue of fact existed as to the application of subdivision f of section.the court instead held that the undisputed material facts in plaintiffs separate statement,which corresponded to the evidence in their experts declarations,did not raise a triable issue of material fact on the question of defendants alleged willful misconduct.the court concluded that defendants were therefore entitled to a summary judgment in their favor,and the subcontractors were necessarily also entitled to summary judgments on defendants.plaintiffs made a motion for reconsideration which the court denied.thereafter,a judgment in favor of defendants was signed and filed.plaintiffs then filed this appeal no.and defendants have appealed from the two judgments granted to the subcontractors nos.and 
issues on appeal 
the initial question we must address is whether,when a defendant moves for summary judgment on the basis of section statute of limitations,and the plaintiff complaint has alleged willful misconduct in connection with latent construction defects,it is the defendant or the plaintiff who has the burden of producing evidence on that issue.the second and primary issue presented is whether a finding that willful misconduct by somebody has occurred in connection with the construction of a plaintiff home,when such construction results in latent defects in the home,is sufficient to preclude a developer and general contractor reliance on section,even in the absence of evidence that the developer and general contractor had actual knowledge of the willful misconduct or had itself directly engaged in such willful misconduct in some manner.
discussion 
standard of review of orders granting motions for summary judgment 
we conduct a de novo review of the order granting the respective motions for summary judgment.price wells fargo bank d.in doing so,we apply the same rules the trial court was required to apply in deciding those motions.
as the parties moving for summary judgment,defendants bore an initial burden of producing of a prima facie showing that there was no triable issue of material fact in the plaintiffs case and that defendants were entitled to judgment as a matter of law.only if defendants carried that burden were the plaintiffs then faced with a burden of production of their make a prima facie showing of the existence of a triable issue of material fact.aguilar atlantic richfield cal th,d,aguilar.a prima facie showing is one that is sufficient to support the position of the party in question.citation.no more is called for.id.at,d.
f rom commencement to conclusion,the party moving for summary judgment bears the burden of persuasion that there is no triable issue of material fact and that he is entitled to judgment as a matter of law there is a triable issue of material fact if,and only if,the evidence would allow a reasonable trier of fact to find the underlying fact in favor of the party opposing the motion in accordance with the applicable standard of proof thus,a plaintiff moving for summary judgment bears the burden of persuasion that each element of the cause of action in question has been proved,and hence that there is no defense thereto.code civ,subd.p.a moving defendant or bears the burden of persuasion that one or more elements of the cause of action in question can not be established,or that there is a complete defense thereto,subd.p.aguilar,supra,cal th at,d,italics and fns.omitted.h ow the parties moving for,and opposing,summary judgment may each carry their burden of persuasion production depends on which would bear what burden of proof at trial.the california supreme court has held to the effect that the placement and quantum of the burden of proof at trial are crucial for purposes of summary judgment.citation.id.at,d.
because a summary judgment denies the adversary party a trial,it should be granted with caution.michael los angeles county of adoptions d.declarations of the moving party are strictly construed,those of the opposing party are liberally construed,and doubts as to whether a summary judgment should be granted must be resolved in favor of the opposing party.the court focuses on issue finding it does not resolve issues of fact.the court seeks to find contradictions in the evidence,or inferences reasonably deducible from the evidence,which raise a triable issue of material fact.id.at.
in responding to defendant motion,plaintiffs had the burden of production respecting the issue of willful misconduct 
for purposes of motions for summary judgment and summary adjudication s a defendant or moving for summary judgment has met his or her burden of showing that a cause of action has no merit if that party has shown that one or more elements of the cause of action,even if not separately pleaded,can not be established,or that there is a complete defense to that cause of action.once the defendant or has met that burden,the burden shifts to the plaintiff or to show that a triable issue of one or more material facts exists as to that cause of action or a defense thereto,subd.p.
a defendant moving for summary judgment based on an affirmative defense must present evidence that supports each element of its affirmative defense,which would also be its burden at trial.anderson metalclad insulation th,d.here,defendants affirmative defense was section statute of limitations for latent construction defects,which defendants separate statement of undisputed material facts sought to address by setting forth the date that the notice of completion for each plaintiff home was recorded,and the date the respective homeowner was named as a plaintiff in this suit.on appeal,plaintiffs argue that defendants had the additional burden of producing evidence regarding the statutory prohibition against applying the statute in suits based on willful misconduct,subd.f.we disagree.with respect to the exception,plaintiffs,not defendants,had the burden of production,specifically,the burden of producing sufficient evidence to raise a triable issue of material fact as to whether their action was based on willful misconduct.
while subdivision a of section provides a defendant with a statute of limitations affirmative defense,subdivision f of that statute precludes a court from applying such limitation period in the defendant favor where the action is based on willful misconduct.willful misconduct is an exception to the limitation period,and plaintiffs would bear the burden of production and persuasion at trial regarding the issue of willful misconduct since it is they who are asserting the exception.hobart hobart estate cal d.that plaintiffs may have anticipated defendants reliance on a limitations defense by alleging facts supporting a statutory exception to that defense is not sufficient to justify shifting the burden that otherwise would be imposed on plaintiffs.
therefore,once defendants met their burden of production on their statute of limitations affirmative defense,the burden of production shifted to plaintiffs to raise a triable issue of material fact on the matter of willful misconduct,subd.p.as we observed above,a party burden of production persuasion with respect to a summary judgment motion is dependent on its burden of proof at trial.aguilar,supra,cal th at,d.
the nature of willful misconduct 
in ewing cloverleaf bowl cal d,the supreme court stated w illful misconduct implies the intentional doing of something either with knowledge,express or implied,that serious injury is a probable,as distinguished from a possible,result,or the intentional doing of an act with a wanton and reckless disregard of its consequences.accord,potter firestone tire rubber cal th,d,conc.and dis.opn.of kennard.
as defendants and amici supporting their position emphasize,section was enacted in by the legislature to provide a firm and final outside limitation period for construction suits involving claims for latent defects.lantzy,supra,cal th at,d.t he purpose of section is to protect contractors and other professionals and tradespeople in the construction industry from perpetual exposure to liability for their work.citations.the statute reflects a legitimate concern that expanding concepts of liability could imperil the construction industry unless a statute of limitations was enacted.citation.such concerns legitimately include the prohibitive cost of insurance against a perpetual and never ending risk citation,at,d.the legislature,however,included an exception to this firm and final outside limitation period.in subdivision f of section,any action based on either willful misconduct or fraudulent concealment was expressly excluded.the issues before us involve the former.
unfortunately,there is little case authority discussing willful misconduct as the term is used in section,subdivision f.the supreme court,however,did recently discuss generally the issue of liability for willful or wanton behavior.home grocery cal th,d,disapproved on another ground in aguilar,supra,cal th at,d,fn.it noted that the case law appears relatively uniform on the following points.first,it is generally recognized that willful or wanton misconduct is separate and distinct from negligence,involving different principles of liability and different defenses.citations.unlike negligence,which implies a failure to use ordinary care,and even gross negligence,which connotes such a lack of care as may be presumed to indicate a passive and indifferent attitude toward results,willful misconduct is not marked by a mere absence of care.rather,it involves a more positive intent actually to harm another or to do an act with a positive,active and absolute disregard of its consequences.citations.so,for example,a person who commits an assault and battery may be guilty of willful misconduct citations,but a person who fails to perform a statutory duty,without more,is not guilty.citations.while the word willful implies an intent,the intention must relate to the misconduct and not merely to the fact that some act was intentionally done.citations.thus,even though some cases of negligence may involve intentional actions,the mere intent to do an act which constitutes negligence is not enough to establish willful misconduct.citations.second,willfulness generally is marked by three characteristics actual or constructive knowledge of the peril to be apprehended actual or constructive knowledge that injury is a probable,as opposed to a possible,result of the danger and conscious failure to act to avoid the peril.citations.as the foregoing suggests,willful misconduct does not invariably entail a subjective intent to injure.it is sufficient that a reasonable person under the same or similar circumstances would be aware of the highly dangerous character of his or her conduct.citations,supra,at,d,see also ewing cloverleaf bowl,supra,cal d at,shell oil winterthur swiss ins.th,d.ordinarily whether an action constitutes willful misconduct is a question of fact.colich sons pacific bell d.
in the only california appellate decision that we have been able to find expressly discussing this issue,the court had before it facts remarkably similar to those presented here.a defendant builder had sold to plaintiffs a home that had been built over an oil sump.after subsidence caused considerable damage,the plaintiffs filed suit about years after the substantial completion of the home plaintiffs had only owned it for about nine years.the defendant builder responded with a motion for summary judgment relying on the limitation period set out in section,subdivision a.in opposition,the plaintiffs submitted the declaration of their expert,a general contractor who had inspected the foundation to their home.after describing the tests that had been conducted,the experts declaration expressed the opinion that it would have been impossible to pour the foundation of the home without seeing the evidence,in plain view,that the lot was over an oil sump.the evidence was so clear,according to the expert,that it makes me of the opinion that there was a conscious effort to ignore this condition.felburg don wilson builders d.
the felburg court concluded that the entire record including other evidence of the sumps existence,as well as the experts declaration raised a triable issue of fact as to the builders knowledge of the presence of the sump and his possible concealment thereof with fraudulent intent.in concluding that a factual question was presented as to the application of the willful misconduct exception,the court noted,i nsofar as we have been able to discover,there is no published decision assessing the impact of subdivision f of section,which excepts from its application actions based on willful misconduct or fraudulent concealment these are not barred by the statute.in the instant case,plaintiffs pleaded these elements,willful misconduct and fraudulent concealment,in the first,second and particularly the third causes of action against developer wilson.the term willful misconduct as used in the statute encompasses not only intentional wrongdoing,but negligence of such a character as to constitute reckless disregard for the rights of others.felburg don wilson builders,supra,d at.
at a minimum,felburg illustrates the proposition that a contractor or developer can not avoid application of section,subdivision f,by a claim of ignorance of the existence of a serious latent defect where the evidence permits the reasonable inference that he knew or should have known otherwise 
plaintiffs presented sufficient evidence to raise a triable issue of material fact regarding the application of the willful misconduct exception 
the trial court acknowledged the depth of the information in plaintiffs experts declarations regarding the presence of serious latent structural defects in plaintiffs houses that undermine the structural integrity of the homes and create a substantial risk of injury to persons property.however,the court found there was no evidence to explain defendants connection to the construction of plaintiffs homes in general,or the specific defects in particular.
the court ruled that plaintiffs had failed to specifically connect defendants with the willful misconduct that plaintiffs experts opined took place during construction.that is,plaintiffs failed to show that either defendants themselves engaged in the actual construction or supervision of construction of the homes such that defendants had to have observed the defects but chose to ignore them,or defendants were responsible for supervision of construction,but failed to carry out their supervisory duties.based on such lack of evidence,the court stated that a trier of fact could not infer willful misconduct by defendants in connection with the defects.on that basis,the court concluded plaintiffs claims against defendants were,as a matter of law,barred by the statute of limitations set out in section.in our view,the record in this case,and a proper construction and application of the statute,compel a contrary conclusion.
the record before us demonstrates that the defendants,acting in their capacity as general contractor and developer,hired subcontractors to construct the homes purchased by the plaintiffs.defendants essentially argue that whatever willful misconduct may have occurred in the construction process was done by such subcontractors and there was no evidence produced by plaintiffs demonstrating that defendants had any knowledge of or participation therein.this argument,however,fails to recognize the legal significance of the position occupied by a general in a residential construction project such as we find in this case.
general is liable for acts of subcontractors 
a developer of homes is strictly liable for defects in the construction of such homes.kriegler eichler homes,d.although subcontractors may be independent contractors when working for the general contractor or the owner of property on which residential units are being built,the owner or the general contractor is still liable for damages caused by defects in such work.muth urricelqui d.in muth,the muths were general contractors who sued three of their subcontractors for indemnity after they the muths were found liable,in a prior action,to persons who had purchased a house built by the muths.the house suffered damages because of a landslide and subsidence.the subcontractors were the soils engineer,civil engineer,and the grading contractor,and they acted as independent contractors in that they were not directed or supervised by the muths in performing their subcontract work.id.at.the muth court stated that despite this independent contractor status,the muths,as owners of the tract of land used for the subdivision and as general contractors,could not escape liability for the damage to the buyer of the house by seeking refuge in the defense that the damages were proximately caused by the negligence of one or more of their subcontractors.id.at.
the obvious reason for this rule is that owners and general contractors have supervision over the construction,including the work of the subcontractors.it has been held that the owner of property can not escape liability for a dangerous condition on his property by having an independent contractor assume the duty of constructing or repairing a building or chattel.citations.there is no reasonable distinction between the owner inability to escape liability and that of the contractor.the contractor,equally with the owner of the property,has supervision over the entire building and its construction,including the work performed by a subcontractor,and where he negligently creates a condition,either by himself or through a subcontractor,he is primarily responsible for that condition and the consequences that may follow from it.he is in full control of the construction and knows or should know what is being placed in the building.dow holly manufacturing cal d,accord,muth urricelqui,supra,d at.such supervisory obligation is a duty and can not be avoided by entrusting it to an independent contractor.finnegan royal realty cal d.this conclusion is supported by relevant statutory law.
supervisory obligations of general are consistent with licensing statutes 
provisions in the business and professions code regarding the licensing of contractors make this point.the defendants in this case,in their capacity as the general contractor,were required to be licensed as were their subcontractors.vallejo development beck development th,d.in california,contractors licenses may be issued to individuals,to copartnerships,and to corporations.an individual can qualify for a license either in his own capacity or by a qualifying person acting as a responsible managing employee rme.a copartnership or limited partnership can qualify for a license either by a general partner or a qualifying person acting as an rme,and a corporation can qualify by a qualifying person acting as an rme or a responsible managing officer rmo.bus,subd.b.
the licensing law has as its purpose to protect the public from incompetent and dishonest construction and building services,such that the law provide s minimal assurance that all persons offering such services in california have the requisite skill and character,understand applicable local laws and codes,and know the rudiments of administering a contracting business.ranchwood communities limited partnership jim beat construction,supra,th at,d.thus,the contractors state license board requires an applicant for a license to show such degree of knowledge and experience in the classification applied for,and such general knowledge of the building,safety,health,and lien laws of the state and of the administrative principles of the contracting business as the board deems necessary for the safety and protection of the public.bus,subd.a.additionally,disciplinary action against a license may be taken for,among other things,a willful departure in any material respect from accepted trade standards for good and workmanlike construction bus,subd.a,and for w illful or deliberate disregard and violation of the building laws of the state,or of any political subdivision thereof bus.
most significantly,provisions of the business and professions code require that the rme or rmo who qualifies for a contractor license on behalf of an individual or business firm is responsible for exercising that direct supervision and control of his or her employer or principal construction operations as is necessary to secure full compliance with the provisions of this chapter on contractors and the rules and regulations of the board relating to the construction operations.bus,italics added.california code of regulations,title,section,subdivision b provides that f or purposes of section of the business and professions code,direct supervision and control includes any one or any combination of the following activities supervising construction,managing construction activities by making technical and administrative decisions,checking jobs for proper workmanship,or direct supervision on construction job sites.italics added.therefore,as a person acting on behalf of his or her contractor principals,the rme or rmo would be in a position to observe willful misconduct in the construction of houses.having observed such misconduct,he or she would have a duty to report it to the contractor,since the purpose of the licensing laws is protection of the public.finally,under civil code section the contractor is deemed to have notice of the misconduct even if not informed of it by the rme or rmo.with this notice,the contractor would have a duty to rectify the problem.this duty of supervision imposed by the statutory licensing scheme,like the above discussed duty of supervision imposed by case law,is reasonably viewed as a nondelegable duty and the general contractor is not relieved of the supervisory duties by entrusting them to an independent contractor.finnegan royal realty,supra,cal d at.
principles of sound public policy support holding a general responsible for any willful misconduct involved in a construction project 
as already mentioned,developers of mass produced homes are strictly liable for construction defects regardless of the developer active fault.kriegler eichler homes,supra,d at.the developer is thus held to be,as a matter of law,the absolute guarantor of the work done by the subcontractors it chooses.there is no sound public policy reason to deviate from this principle when the question is extending the statute of limitations applicable to those defects as opposed to imposing monetary liability for the defects.in both instances,it is the developer who is in the better economic position to bear the loss rather than the injured party who justifiably relied on the developer skill and implied representation.id.at.to hold that the developer is not subject to the provisions of,subdivision f,because the willful misconduct was committed by its chosen subcontractors would allow the developer to escape the strict liability established by kriegler.
moreover,imputing the subcontractor willful misconduct to the developer is not only consistent with the policies underlying kriegler,it is also fully consistent with general principles of respondeat superior,which hold a principal liable not just for the negligence of an agent but for intentional acts of the agent so long as the misconduct occurs within the course and scope of the agency,mary city of los angeles cal d.indeed,while defendants and the amici supporting their position claim that it would be unfair to impute willful misconduct by an agent to an innocent principal for purposes of tolling a limitations period,such a result would not be a novel one.in lightner mining lane cal,the supreme court noted that t he fraud of the agents will be imputed to the principal for the purpose of preventing the running of the statute of limitations whether the principal was aware of it or not,at.
subdivision f of section is an incentive to developers and general contractors to engage in close supervision of their projects so that willful misconduct can be avoided even if simple negligent construction defects can not.it is an incentive for the general contractor and the developer to choose subcontractors carefully,with an eye toward quality construction rather than just the bottom line.indeed,at the legislative hearings on the enactment of section,the representative from the north coast builders exchange,the builders exchange legislative counsel and the california state builders exchange testified he was of the opinion that willful violations in the construction industry were a very minor thing and this was because it been economically weeded out,there is a reduced number of licensed contractors in california,the industry was policing itself,and the licensing board was quite effective.
moreover,as a matter of public policy,when a developer or general contractor receives the economic benefits of the willful misconduct associated with the construction of an improvement to real property,then as between the innocent third party purchaser of the improvement and the developer or general contractor,the purchaser should not be required to bear the burdens associated with such misconduct.nothing in section suggests otherwise.we note,with emphasis,that subdivision f states only that the limitation period shall not apply to actions based on willful misconduct or fraudulent concealment italics added,and this case is clearly based on plaintiffs allegations of willful misconduct by either defendants or parties hired by defendants to construct defendants residential building project.given that statutory language,it is only necessary that the action be based on and arise from willful misconduct by someone.it does not matter whether defendants committed such misconduct directly or it was done by subcontractors hired by them.
conclusion 
we have no trouble concluding that a defendant,acting as the developer and general contractor,can be held liable after years for the willful misconduct of others involved in the project,because subdivision f of section does not specifically exclude a general contractor or a developer the rules regarding vicarious liability of principals are an overlay on this action case and statutory law include supervisory requirements for developers and contractors,and the rmos and rmes of licensed contractors public policy considerations fully support such conclusion and,perhaps most significantly,subdivision f,by its terms,applies to an action it is not limited to the conduct of the specific defendant seeking to assert a limitations defense.the result we reach is not a judicially created extension or expansion of liability it merely represents an application of the relevant body of law to an express statutory exception to the firm and final limitation on a contractor liability exposure for latent defects.nothing in the language of section indicates the legislature intended to dispense with the doctrines of vicarious liability and nondelegable duties,nor with the statutory responsibilities of contractors for supervision of their work,when a defendant developer or general contractor claims a right to the limitation provision and the plaintiff asserts the willful misconduct exception to the application of that provision.
there is evidence in this record,if believed by a trier of fact,that would support findings that willful misconduct had occurred in the construction of plaintiffs homes and that such misconduct had caused the construction defects of which plaintiffs complain,and defendants,as the contractor for the project where plaintiffs homes were constructed,a had at least constructive knowledge of the peril created by the construction activity and the resulting defects,b had at least constructive knowledge that injury or damage to future homebuyers such as plaintiffs was a probable,as opposed to a possible,result of the defects created by the construction activity,and c consciously failed to take action to avoid such injury or damage.under the principles articulated in,supra,cal th at pages,d,such findings would support the conclusion that willful misconduct had occurred in the construction of plaintiffs homes and had caused plaintiffs damages and that defendants were liable therefore.
we find that plaintiffs produced sufficient evidence on the question of willful misconduct to defeat defendants summary judgment motion.whether the defendants or their subcontractors actually engaged in acts of willful misconduct,whether the latent defects of which plaintiffs complain resulted from such acts,and whether the facts and circumstances presented at trial are sufficient to justify charging defendants with such willful misconduct under the legal principles discussed above,are all matters that must be resolved by the trier of fact upon remand 
the judgments in favor of certain will be reversed 
it is clear to this court,from ou
