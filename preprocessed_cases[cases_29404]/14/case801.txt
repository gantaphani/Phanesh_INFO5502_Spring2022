here we conclude that the legislature has not recognized an ocean boater right to a view of the coastline as a factor in regulating development.the legislature has given the california coastal commission coastal commission enumerated powers to regulate such development.but,the legislature has not empowered the coastal commission to add the factor of a boater right to a view of the coastline as a factor to deny or restrict development in the coastline zone.

facts and procedural history 
appellant owns a acre parcel north of cayucos on the harmony coast.the property is in an ocean shoreline sensitive resource area,zoned agricultural,and is used for cattle grazing.it has a topography with a steeply sloped ridge that extends down to a flat marine terrace.the marine terrace is about feet wide and abuts the ocean bluff.there is no beach below the bluff.a commercial abalone farm is on a nearby parcel.
on february,the san luis obispo county planning commission county granted appellant a permit to construct a square foot residence,a barn,and a mile access from highway to a building site on the southeast end of the marine terrace.the coastal development permit cdp included conditions which addressed concerns about steep slopes,erosion,drainage,scenic and visual resources,agricultural use,and potential environmental impacts.
on april,two coastal commission members appealed county issuance of the permit on the ground that the proposed development was inconsistent with the policies and ordinances of the san luis obispo county local coastal plan lcp,subds.a b.
coastal commission conducted a de novo hearing and found that the proposed development would be visible from the ocean.on april,it conditionally approved the cdp but imposed special conditions requiring,among other things,that the project be resited at a higher elevation on the northwest corner of the marine terrace and that a ll development,the residence,all impermeable pathways,turnarounds,courtyards,garages,swimming pools,retaining walls,shall be confined within an area of no greater than square feet.coastal commission required that all structures be single story,that the barn not be constructed,and that the access be relocated to reduce its length,visibility,and impact on agricultural land.
appellant filed a petition for administrative mandamus alleging that coastal commission had no authority to impose development conditions to protect views of the coastline from offshore,vantage points.coastal commission argued that the enjoyment of uncluttered views from the ocean was a public resource protected by the lcp.
the trial court agreed with the coastal commission saying that the beauty of a sunrise from a vantage point offshore is afforded the same protection as a sunset seen from land.the court fully appreciates the difficulties appellant has had with the approval process and the conditions attached to the approval of his beautifully designed residential project.it may be compared to being nibbled to death by ducks while this court might not agree with any or all of the modifications or conditions,it fully understands the reasons given by the coastal commission and finds that substantial evidence exists in the record for each of them.
as we shall explain,coastal commission views and those of the trial court,can not be sustained.the coastal commission has subordinated a landowner real property rights to the occasional boater right to a view of the coastline if and when the california legislature expressly codifies a boater right to a view of the coastline,the courts can and will lawfully give it credence.but the coastal commission is not empowered to legislate a boater right to a view of the coastline.

the issue is whether the coastal commission may,in effect,add language to section by construing it.the attorney general argues that it may do so.section of the coastal act provides that the scenic and visual qualities of coastal areas shall be considered and protected as a resource of public importance.permitted development shall be sited and designed to protect views to and along the ocean and scenic coastal areas,to minimize the alteration of natural land forms,to be visually compatible with the character of surrounding areas,and,where feasible,to restore and enhance visual quality in visually degraded areas emphasis added.the statute does not expressly state a vantage point.
the coastal commission and the attorney general construction of the section adds the words and from between the italicized words along,and the.the statute would thus read,protect views to and along,and from,the ocean this expansive reading of the statute stretches the fabric too thin.the courts are loath to construe a statute which has the effect of adding language to a statute.people buena vista mines,th,d.courts may add language to a statute in extreme cases where they are convinced the legislature inadvertently failed to utilize the words which would give purpose to its pronouncements.id.at,d.in our view,this is not such a case.at this late date,it is unreasonable to assume that the legislature meant to include ocean based views to the shore when it enacted section thirty years ago.moreover
