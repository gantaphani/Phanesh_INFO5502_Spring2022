public contract code section provides that the prime contractor on a public works project can not s ubstitute a person as subcontractor in place of the subcontractor listed in the original bid unless any of nine listed circumstances exists and the awarding authority consents,subd.a.the statute further provides that absent the awarding authority consent,the prime contractor can not allow a subcontract to be performed by anyone other than the original subcontractor listed in the original bid,subd.b.
in the instant case,kemp.construction,kemp was the prime contractor for the los angeles unified school district the district on two public works construction projects the huntington park elementary school the huntington park project and the los angeles center for enriched studies the laces project.titan electric corporation titan was kemp electrical subcontractor on the projects.
during construction,kemp petitioned under section to replace titan with another subcontractor on both projects,alleging inter alia that titan had failed or refused to perform its subcontracts,subd.a and substantially delayed or disrupted the progress of work,subd.a.titan opposed the substitution requests and demanded an administrative hearing.following several continuances to accommodate the parties settlement talks,the district held separate hearings on each substitution request.by that time,another electrical subcontractor hired by kemp had completed the subcontract work on both projects.
following the hearings,the district issued decisions on each project initial decisions,followed by amended decisions granting kemp request for substitution.the district also denied titan request for rehearing.titan filed petitions for writ of administrative mandate in the superior court challenging the district decisions permitting substitution.the superior court denied the petitions,and titan now appeals.
titan contends that section,subdivision b,prohibited kemp from replacing titan before the district consented to the substitution,and that the district had no authority to consent to substitution after another subcontractor had completed the work.titan asks us to hold that kemp substitution of titan was wrongful as a matter of law and that lausd ex post facto consent was unauthorized.
we hold that section contemplates that the awarding authority consent to substituting out a listed subcontractor and substituting in a proposed replacement will occur before the prime contractor permits the replacement to perform any work.however,a deviation from this chronology,such as in the instant case,is permissible so long as the procedure used actually complies with the substance of the reasonable objectives of the statute namely,the prevention of bid peddling and bid shopping after the award of a public works contract,and the providing of an opportunity to the awarding authority to investigate the proposed replacement subcontractor before consenting to substitution.
procedural and factual 
titan subcontracts 
in march,kemp entered prime contracts with the district for the huntington park and laces projects.in april,it entered subcontracts on both projects with titan under which titan was to perform the electrical work.titan subcontracts obligated titan to furnish all labor,materials,equipment and other facilities required to perform the work to complete the electrical work on the projects,and to prosecute its work in accordance with kemp progress schedule.construction of the two projects proceeded concurrently.
kemp agreement to advance payroll to titan 
beginning in early february,kemp became dissatisfied with titan progress on the huntington park project.on february,kemp sent the first of a series of letters in all complaining that titan was behind schedule and insisting that titan put additional workers on the job.
kemp ceo greg solaas received a telephone call from titan owner john nelson and titan don quillao.nelson and quillao explained that titan could obtain more workers from the international brotherhood of electrical workers ibew,but that titan was in a cash crunch and could not fund the extra payroll.solaas agreed that titan would cover the payroll for eight workers on the huntington park project,and that kemp would pay weekly advances to titan to cover the payroll for every other worker that titan supplied.the agreement was oral and separate from kemp subcontracts with titan.titan continued to be responsible for the entire payroll on the laces project.
kemp continued dissatisfaction with titan progress 
in the weeks leading up to april,kemp made weekly payroll advances to titan totaling for the huntington park project.however,in kemp view,titan was still understaffing the job and was behind schedule at the critical stage of the electrical view reiterated in ten letters to titan through april,in which kemp demanded additional workers and additional shifts.finally,on april,kemp wrote this last week we were given a revised schedule by titan electric for the completion of the low voltage systems so we could again set up the district inspections.as of today it appears that titan and first fire a subcontractor of titan will again not be ready.the district has inspectors set up to start testing the various electrical systems this coming thursday we can not again reschedule these inspections.we are out of time.titan and first fire need to work around the clock if need be to complete all work for the thursday inspections.
kemp concern over titan solvency 
kemp practice had been to pay the weekly advances to titan on tuesdays,and titan would pay the ibew union employees on wednesdays.as of wednesday,april,kemp had not yet advanced titan the payroll for the extra workers on the huntington park project,a sum which totaled.
before making the advance,kemp controller,pat sullivan,spoke by telephone with nelson titan owner and quillao titan vice president.in the conversation,sullivan asked why kemp still had to advance payroll and whether nelson had a line of credit for the company.nelson responded that his line of credit was gone and that he had no cash to cover titan checks.sullivan asked for information on titan expected profit on the huntington park and laces projects.he later received a fax from titan stating that titan expected to lose money on the huntington park project,and to make only to on the laces project.
sullivan then reviewed the invoices submitted by titan to kemp.he discovered that in april titan submitted conditional releases and invoices from a material supplier,main electric,reflecting that it was owed for materials supplied in february and march.sullivan did not expect the debt,because the releases and invoices should have been submitted in the month that the materials were supplied.
sullivan briefed solaas,titan ceo.they contacted titan supplier main electric and inquired why the conditional releases in the amount of for february and march had not been submitted until april.main electric told them that titan had instructed main electric not to supply kemp with the releases.
solaas became concerned that if kemp paid the advance,it might not have enough collateral to pay titan suppliers others of whom might not have submitted invoices and payroll taxes if titan truly had insufficient funds.he was also concerned that given titan apparent financial difficulties,titan might use the payroll advance to pay other debts.solaas therefore decided not to make the advance until kemp sorted out titan situation.
kemp withholding of the april payroll advance 
quillao titan had called several times on april asking when the advance would be paid.late in the afternoon on april solaas ultimately returned the calls and told quillao that kemp would not issue the check until it was able to sort out titan situation.quillao warned that if titan did not receive the advance,titan workers were going to get paid on both jobs and were going to stop work.solaas asked whether titan had an available line of credit to cover the payroll.quillao replied that the credit line was maxed out,that titan had no cash,and that titan could not give kemp a note on a house in exchange for the advance.under these circumstances,solaas refused to issue the advance.
titan april failure to staff the projects 
having been informed late on april that kemp would not make the advance on the huntington park project,nelson titan president instructed titan workers on both the huntington park and laces projects to stay home.the next day,april,the only titan employees who appeared at the huntington park and laces projects were the project manager for the projects,the foremen,and a few other workers looking for their paychecks.titan also sent one of its drivers to pick up its tools from the sites.
solaas learned that titan had concurrently abandoned two other,unrelated projects when the prime contractor on those projects refused to advance funds.on the morning of april,solaas called quillao and asked what was happening to titan.quillao told him that titan was going to wind down operations and could not afford to do the jobs anymore.he told solaas that kemp could come over to their warehouse,pick up all the light fixtures,all the conduit and everything for phase ii of the huntington park project.kemp did so.
kemp april letters to the ibew 
solaas wanted to ensure that titan employees on the projects got paid,and that the ibew union,which supplied electrical workers on the projects,knew it.to do so,kemp needed a union subcontractor as a vehicle for payment.electric was a union subcontractor with which kemp had worked several times over the past to years.solaas knew to be reputable and trusted it to receive the advance and pay it out to titan employees.therefore,he asked whether it would pay titan workers if kemp advanced the funds.was reluctant to get involved,but agreed.thus,on the morning of april,kemp faxed separate letters to the ibew,with copies to titan,informing the ibew that kemp had hired electric to replace titan electric for refusing to complete the huntington park and laces projects.we have instructed electric to cover the payroll for titan electric for the period of april thru,for the project s.
according to solaas,although the letters to the ibew stated that kemp had hired,kemp had not entered a contract with to perform work under titan subcontracts.rather,kemp was simply using to transmit the payroll advance to titan employees,and kemp had agreed with that if titan failed to return to work,kemp would pay on a basis to complete the work.kemp,however,did not enter a formal contract with.further,kemp did not have perform any work on the huntington park and laces worksites on april or april,and not until may,did kemp issue its first check to.that check was to pay titan employees for the work they had performed under titan subcontract.
kemp april requests for substitution 
in the afternoon of april,based on titan failure to send employees to the project sites,kemp sent the district written requests under section to replace titan on the huntington park and laces projects with another electrical subcontractor,electric,and listed address and contractor license number.in its requests for substitution,kemp contended,inter alia,that titan had failed or refused to perform its subcontracts,subd.a and substantially delayed or disrupted the progress of work,subd.a.as in the huntington park project,the electrical work on the laces project was on critical path,and it was imperative that titan complete its work in order to keep the project on schedule.
kemp april notices to titan to cure 
on the morning of april,kemp faxed titan notices to cure for both projects,stating on april,titan electric advised kemp that it was abandoning the referenced project due to its inability to pay its electrical employees working on the project.as a result of titan electric actions,you are hereby given notice to cure this condition within hours from the time of abandonment in accordance with your subcontract agreement,section,paragraph.failure to cure this condition will result in immediate termination and substitution.titan never responded to kemp notices to cure,and did not return to the job sites.
scheduling the administrative hearing 
the same day that kemp faxed the notices to cure april,the district faxed titan notices that it had received requests from kemp for substitution on the huntington park and laces projects.on may,titan requested a hearing on each substitution request.the district initially set the hearings for june.however at kemp request made on behalf of both parties the hearings were postponed to accommodate settlement talks ultimately,the hearings were held on august,before a district hearing officer.by then,the electrical work covered by titan subcontracts on both projects had been completed by a r on a basis.according to solaas and sullivan,as a result of a r having to complete the work,kemp stood to lose on the electrical subcontracting for the huntington park project and for the laces project.
titan disputes kemp evidence 
at the administrative hearings,kemp presented evidence setting forth the foregoing history.titan disputed certain points of kemp showing primarily through the testimony of its president,john nelson.nelson testified that he was not informed until late on april,that kemp would not be advancing the payroll for the extra workers on the huntington park project.nelson instructed the workers on both projects not to go to work on april.instead,nelson sent the project manager and foremen on the projects to the work sites,and sent his driver to pick up titan tools in order to secure them until the problems were worked out.
on april,nelson called solaas,but was told he was unavailable.nelson never called back,and never responded to the april notices to cure.according to nelson,the notices to cure were a sham,because titan had effectively been replaced on april,nelson received a copy of kemp letters to the ibew stating that kemp had hired a r,and nelson also learned that a r had hired most of titan workers,including titan project manager on both projects and the foremen.further,nelson was informed by his project manager that a r started work on april.
nelson had the ability to pay the employees on the huntington park and laces projects,though he would have had to make some arrangements.he did not have a credit line,but did have private sources of financing.even though he could have gone to those sources,he refused to cover the payroll on the jobs because,in his view,he was already financing the huntington park job to the tune of grand and was going to finance any more.that is,nelson considered the payroll advances to be advances for work already completed,and titan had not yet received payment for more than it had billed for completed work.nelson admitted that on the same day he directed workers not to appear at the laces and huntington park jobsites,he also directed workers not to appear at two other unrelated projects.
according to nelson,titan had substantially completed its work on both the huntington park and laces projects.titan intended to complete its work and would have done so but for kemp interference by hiring a nelson denied telling any supplier not to submit invoices timely.
nelson admitted that as of the date of the hearings,titan address was a box rather than an office,that titan no longer had any employees,and that he had canceled titan insurance on its tools and equipment in may.however,he denied that titan was bankrupt or out of business.it subcontracted its labor,and was involved in other projects.
the district decisions 
on november,the district hearing officer issued substantially identical written decisions granting kemp request for substitution on both projects under section,subdivisions a and a.on march,titan requested a rehearing.on may and,respectively,the hearing officer filed amended decisions with regard to the laces and huntington park projects.the amended decisions amplified the findings supporting substitution.the hearing officer concluded in part that o nce kemp discontinued early payments to titan,titan employees either abandoned the project because they had not been paid by titan,or because they had been ordered not to report to the huntington park and laces projects.titan failed to perform its subcontract and substantially delayed or disrupted the progress of the work under,subds.a and a by failing to provide electricians to work on the project s on april,and by failing to respond to kemp notice to cure.it was apparent during the hearing s that titan made no reasonable effort to timely complete the work kemp could reasonably expect titan to perform.neither the initial nor the amended decisions expressly approved a r as the replacement subcontractor.
on august,titan again requested rehearing.titan contended that it had new evidence,namely,video tapes of the job sites taken on april,and a declaration from quillao.according to titan,the video tapes showed that titan work was substantially complete on april and that a r had already begun work.in his declaration,quillao denied that he told kemp that titan was winding down its business,that titan would not return to work on the projects,or that kemp should pick up titan materials.on august,the district denied titan rehearing request.
titan mandate petitions 
titan filed petitions for administrative mandate in the superior court challenging the district decisions.the superior court consolidated the petitions and denied them.the court limited its review of the administrative record to the evidence submitted at the administrative hearings.it did not consider the evidence submitted with titan august,rehearing request,because that evidence was available at the time of the administrative hearings but not presented by titan or considered by the district in granting kemp substitution requests.the court further ruled that the district did not abuse its discretion in refusing to consider the purportedly new evidence or grant rehearing,because titan failed to show good cause for failing to produce the evidence at the hearings 
with respect to the district findings that substitution was justified under section,subdivisions a and a,the court concluded that substantial evidence supported those findings.the court also rejected titan contention that because a r electric had replaced titan before the administrative hearings were held,the district lacked jurisdiction to grant the substitution requests.the court reasoned that n othing in the statute or case authority indicates that the awarding authority s jurisdiction to conduct such hearing and decide whether the substitution is permitted lapses if the prime contractor brings in another subcontractor before the hearing is held.
discussion 
the statutory scheme 
the legislature enacted the subletting and subcontracting fair practices act,et,of which section is a part,to prevent bid shopping and bid peddling after the award of a public contract and to give the awarding authority the opportunity to investigate and approve the initial subcontractors and any replacements.see southern cal.acoustics,supra,cal d at,brady,supra,th at,d.as here relevant,a prime contractor who bids on a public works project must list in its bid each subcontractor who will perform work in an amount in excess of of percent of the prime contractor total bid,subd.a.if the public entity accepts the prime contractor bid,section forbids the prime contractor from s ubstitut ing a person as subcontractor in place of the subcontractor listed in the original bid,except that the awarding authority,or its duly authorized officer,may consent to the substitution of another person as a subcontractor when any of nine listed circumstances exists,subd.a.all of the listed circumstances involve the subcontractor inability or unwillingness to perform the subcontract.brady,supra,th at,d.the two circumstances relevant here are w hen the listed subcontractor fails or refuses to perform his or her subcontract subd.a,and w hen the awarding authority,or its duly authorized officer,determines that the subcontractor is substantially delaying or disrupting the progress of the work subd.a.section further prohibits the prime contractor from permit ting a subcontract to be voluntarily assigned or transferred or allow ing it to be performed by anyone other than the original subcontractor listed in the original bid,without the consent of the awarding authority,or its duly authorized officer,subd.b.
the procedure for obtaining the public entity consent requires the awarding authority to provide the subcontractor with written notice of the prime contractor request for substitution,subd.a.the subcontractor then has five working days within which to file written objections to the request.ibid.if objections are filed,the entity must give the listed subcontractor written notice of a hearing on the request for substitution at least five working days in advance.ibid.
the consequences of an unauthorized substitution can be severe for the prime contractor the subcontractor may sue the prime contractor but not the public entity for damages southern cal.acoustics,supra,cal d at,and the public entity may cancel the prime contractor contract or assess a penalty not to exceed percent of the amount of the subcontract involved.also,an unauthorized substitution may subject the prime contractor to discipline by the contractors state license board.
the district consent to kemp substitution request substantially complied with section 
titan contends that section,subdivision b,prohibited kemp from replacing titan before the district consented to the substitution,and that the district had no authority to consent to substitution after another subcontractor had completed the work.titan asks us to hold that kemp substitution was wrongful as a matter of law and that lausd ex post facto consent was unauthorized we disagree.although section contemplates that the awarding authority consent to substitution and approval of a replacement subcontractor will occur before the replacement performs the subcontract,a deviation from this procedure is valid so long as the procedure used actually complies in substance with the reasonable objectives of the statute.here,such substantial compliance occurred.
in construing a statute,we seek to effectuate the intent of the legislature,following certain rules.we first look to the ordinary meaning of the statutory language,which controls if it is without ambiguity or uncertainty.lungren deukmejian cal d.such plain meaning,however,is discerned by reading the statute in context,and l iteral construction should not prevail if it is contrary to the legislative intent apparent in the statute.the intent prevails over the letter,and the letter will,if possible,be so read as to conform to the spirit of the act.ibid.
we agree with titan that the plain meaning of the statutory language,construed in context,contemplates that the awarding authority consent to substituting out a listed subcontractor and substituting in a proposed replacement will occur before the prime contractor permits the replacement to perform any work.that is,section compels the awarding authority to give the listed subcontractor written notice of the prime contractor substitution request conduct a hearing on the substitution request if the listed subcontractor timely requests and consent to substitution only if one of the nine listed statutory circumstances exists.further,unless the awarding authority consents,the prime contractor may not s ubstitute a person as subcontractor in place of the subcontractor listed in the original bid,subd.a,or allow a subcontract to be performed by anyone other than the original subcontractor listed in the original bid,subd.b.
kemp argues that there is a distinction under section between a prime contractor substitution of one subcontractor for another,which requires the awarding authority prior consent,and a prime contractor termination of a listed subcontractor,which kemp contends does not.according to kemp,a lthough titan termination was a necessary preliminary step before another subcontractor could be substituted in,the plain language of section did not prohibit kemp from terminating titan without prior approval,nor did it prohibit the district from subsequently consenting to that termination on statutorily recognized grounds.kemp distinction between substitution and termination is not one drawn by the statute.regardless of terminology,if a listed subcontractor is to be replaced by another subcontractor in literal compliance with section,subdivisions a and b,the awarding authority entity will grant the prime contractor request for substitution finding a valid statutory ground and also approve a suggested replacement subcontractor before the prime contractor permits the replacement to perform any work covered by the subcontract.see brady,supra,th at,d awarding authority must approve the particular entity that will serve as the substitute subcontractor and a bsent approval,a second subcontractor may not perform work on the public project fred early,county sanitation dist.d.clear meaning of,subd.b is that the person named in the bid as subcontractor must do the work unless it is given to some one else with the consent of the authority.further,under the plain terms of the statute,the procedure of section is obligatory in the sense that the prime contractor and the awarding authority are required to follow it in order to effect a substitution,as opposed to being merely directory in the sense that the awarding authority may choose not to follow it.see conditioning,auburn union school dist.th,d conditioning.
although titan is correct in arguing that section contemplates the holding of the substitution hearing and the issuance of a ruling before a replacement subcontractor performs the subcontract,titan is incorrect in asserting that the failure to comply with that chronology necessarily invalidates the awarding authority consent.as the district correctly notes,nothing in the statutory language purports to invalidate an awarding authority consent to substitution simply because a prime contractor has done what it may not do under section,subdivision b allow a subcontract to be performed by a replacement subcontractor without the prior consent of the awarding authority.the statute simply does not address this situation.rather,the failure to literally comply with an obligatory statutory procedure,such as that of section,is valid if the procedure used complies in substance with all reasonable objectives of the statutory scheme.see conditioning,supra,th at,d applying substantial compliance doctrine to prime contractor failure to give notice under section,applicable to request to substitute inadvertently listed subcontractor miller starr,cal.real estate ed,doctrine of substantial compliance applies to the procedures for the substitution of a subcontractor.
kemp argues in part that the procedure here complied with the purposes of the statute and should not be invalidated.we agree.
the procedural prerequisites to holding the substitution hearings were met.the district provided timely notice to titan of kemp requests for substitution on the huntington park and laces projects.after receiving titan requests for a hearing,the district initially scheduled the hearings for june,but later postponed them at the request of the parties to permit settlement negotiations.after settlement negotiations failed,the district ultimately held the hearings on august,and found two statutory grounds justifying kemp substitution requests titan failed to perform its subcontract,subd.a and substantially delayed or disrupted the projects,subd.a.by then,a r had completed the subcontract work,though the record does not show precisely when the work was finished.on appeal,titan does not contend that substantial evidence fails to support the district findings.hence,for purposes of our analysis,we take the grounds for substitution found by the district to be established.thus,while it is true that titan had the statutory right under section to perform the subcontract unless statutory grounds for a valid substitution exist ed southern cal.acoustics,supra,cal d at,that right was not violated.
the sole procedural irregularity in the granting of the substitution request was the district holding of the hearings and granting consent to substitution after kemp had permitted a r to complete the subcontract work.but under the facts here,this procedure did not violate the purposes of the statute.substantial compliance,as the phrase is used in the decisions,means actual compliance in respect to the substance essential to every reasonable objective of the statute.citation.where there is compliance as to all matters of substance,technical deviations are not to be given the stature of noncompliance.citation.substance prevails over form.when the plaintiff embarks on a course of substantial compliance,every reasonable objective of the statute at issue has been satisfied.southern pac.transportation state bd.of equalization d.see conditioning,supra,th at,d.as here relevant,the objectives of section are to prevent bid shopping and bid peddling and to give the awarding authority the opportunity to investigate and approve proposed replacement subcontractors.see southern cal.acoustics,supra,cal d at,brady,supra,th at,d.
the administrative record demonstrates that no bid shopping by kemp or bid peddling by a r occurred.kemp replaced titan with a r because,as the district found,titan abandoned the projects.indeed,kemp evidence at the hearing established that kemp initially contacted a r only after being informed by titan,don quillao,that titan was winding down its business and would not return.further,kemp initially contacted a r simply to use it as a conduit for distribution of the payroll advance to titan employees.thus,the statutory goal of preventing bid shopping and bid peddling was preserved.
the statutory purpose of giving the district the opportunity to investigate a r so as to ensure the quality of the work was also met.kemp requests for substitution named a r as the proposed replacement subcontractor,and listed a r address and contractor license number.hence,the district had the opportunity to investigate a r before consenting to substitution.the evidence in the administrative record showed that kemp had previously worked with a r several times over the prior to years,and knew a r to be reputable.nothing in the record suggests that the district thought otherwise,or that it found a r work to be substandard.although the district did not formally approve a r as titan replacement,the granting of kemp substitution request constituted implicit approval of a 
titan asserts that the postponements of the hearings from june to august,occurred solely at kemp request,and suggests that the delay was sought to permit a r to complete the subcontract work.the administrative record,however,shows that in requesting the postponements kemp spoke for both parties.see fn,ante.further,there is no evidence that titan ever objected that postponement of the hearings would prejudice titan by permitting a r to complete the projects before a ruling on the substitution requests could be obtained.
titan contends that permitting the administrative hearing to be held after the replacement subcontractor has performed the subcontract allows the prime contractor to create artificial grounds for substitution.according to titan,a prime contractor could prevent the listed subcontractor from performing by hiring a replacement contractor.then the prime contractor could seek substitution under section,subdivision a,on the ground that the listed subcontractor failed or refused to perform.the prime contractor could thus circumvent the statute by creating the very condition that is grounds for substitution.that is precisely what happened in this case.further,according to titan,because the subcontract would have already been completed,the listed subcontractor would have little incentive to seek a hearing and the awarding authority would have little incentive to invalidate the substitution.
titan argument posits a result that can not occur under section and did not occur here.in titan hypothetical,the listed subcontractor is able and willing to perform.however,all of the statutory circumstances justifying substitution under section involve a subcontractor who is unable or unwilling to perform.brady,supra,th at,d.were a prime contractor to prevent an able and willing subcontractor from completing the subcontract as posited by titan,the subcontractor could not be deemed to have faile
