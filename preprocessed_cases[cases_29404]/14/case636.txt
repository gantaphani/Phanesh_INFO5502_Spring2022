in this appeal hill seeks review of a judgment on a brought by respondent udc universal development,udc,pursuant to an indemnity provision in the parties contract.the judgment required hill,which had denied udc tender of defense,to reimburse udc for the costs of its defense in a third entity lawsuit.hill contends that the parties contract required no defense because hill negligence was not alleged in the third party complaint or established in udc action and udc was barred because its contract with hill was illegal.we find no error and affirm the judgment.
hill also seeks review of a postjudgment order under code of civil procedure section,in which the court granted its motion for verification but denied its request for costs and attorney fees in the.we find no abuse of discretion in the court application of the statute and will therefore affirm this order as well.
background 
between july and february the parties entered into two contracts under which hill would provide engineering and environmental planning services in connection with the development of a residential condominium complex called village hidalgo,later known as valle vista.udc was the developer of the project.among the provisions of the agreement was paragraph,which obligated hill to indemnify udc under certain conditions and to defend udc against any suit,action or demand brought against udc on any claim or demand covered herein.
in october the homeowners association of valle vista hereafter,the hoa filed a first amended complaint against udc which by then was called shea homes for property damage resulting from defective conditions at the project,due in part to negligent planning and design of open space and common areas.during the ensuing litigation the hoa submitted consultant reports describing the adverse effects of drainage problems at the site,as well as soil instability,erosion,settling,and other geotechnical concerns.
in november udc for indemnity against numerous subcontractors,eventually substituting hill for one of its roe defendants.in the first,second,and sixth causes of action for equitable,comparative,and express contractual indemnity,udc tendered its defense against hoa action to all based on their contracts with udc.
hill answered the with a general denial and numerous affirmative defenses,thereby rejecting udc tender.udc therefore paid for its own defense between january,the date of tender by service of the amended and january,when hoa lawsuit was dismissed pursuant to a settlement with the defendants.the september settlement encompassed udc against all of the except hill.
on september,hill moved for summary judgment,asserting that the lawsuit was barred by the applicable statute of limitations and udc failure to be properly licensed rendered its contracts with hill illegal and barred its claims against hill.the superior court denied hill motion,and on july,the proceeded to trial.
on july,before the matter was submitted to the jury,udc moved for a directed verdict.udc sought a ruling that hill was liable for udc defense costs under its agreement to defend and indemnify udc.one week earlier,the supreme court had issued its opinion in crawford weather shield cal th,d,crawford,holding that a contractual indemnitor incurs a duty to defend the indemnitee as soon as the indemnitee tenders its defense to the indemnitor.the parties stipulated that the jury would determine the factual issues of negligence and breach of contract,followed by the trial court application of the indemnity provisions in the parties contract in light of crawford.
the jury was given a special verdict form on which to record its findings as to whether any party had been negligent and whether hill had breached its contract with udc.on july,it unanimously found that hill had not been negligent and had not breached the contract.the trial court then took up the issue of hill duty to defend udc in light of the jury finding that hill had not been negligent.the court suggested that it would be a meaningless duty to defend if it did not arise from an accusation or complaint of negligence arising from the work.hill then raised the question of whether the duty exists if there has been no evidence of such a claim by the hoa.the trial court invited additional briefing on that issue,along with further written argument on the applicability or effect of crawford.
at a hearing on september,udc urged the court to apply crawford by ruling that hill owed udc a defense upon its tender hill,on the other hand,argued that crawford was distinguishable.according to hill,the indemnity provision of the parties contract was exceptionally broad,the defense provision did not come into play absent a finding of negligence by hill,and the negligence allegations in the underlying complaint did not target or implicate hill.
the trial court adhered to its earlier view that the parties contract called for a defense upon an allegation of some negligence in the manner in which the work was conducted.it was only the duty to indemnify,the court explained,that depended on a finding of negligence.the court stated that a separate duty to defend must occur before the duty to indemnify arises.o therwise,you would need the duty to defend.the duty to indemnify would include all costs associated with the defense of the lawsuit based upon the work of the subcontractor.so,you know,logically i do understand how or why you would have a separate duty to defend unless it arose at the time that the litigation was occurring as opposed to the duty to indemnify.the court further rejected hill argument that crawford should not be applied retroactively.
the parties then discussed apportionment of costs and attorney fees for the present action.hill asserted the right to recover costs as the prevailing party on udc allegations of breach of contract and negligence udc maintained that hill had not prevailed on breach of the contractual obligation to defend udc.the court deferred that issue pending further briefing on october,it entered an order and a judgment requiring hill to reimburse udc for the defense costs it had incurred in defending the hoa claims related to hill work.on november,hill filed a timely notice of appeal from the judgment.
meanwhile,shortly after entry of judgment hill moved for verification of udc compliance with code of civil procedure section.according to hill,udc had not filed a certificate of merit as required by that statute and therefore should be ordered to pay hill its costs and fees in the.in opposition,udc asserted that hill had waived this claim,having raised it for the first time in the history of the parties dispute.udc further asserted that hill was not entitled to verification because it had not obtained a favorable conclusion to the litigation,within the meaning of code of civil procedure section.in any event,udc argued,it had satisfied the purpose of the statute because it brought its case against hill with a good faith and reasonable belief that the action was meritorious,based on the expert opinion of a licensed engineer in the field.
on november,the superior court entered its order granting the verification motion but denying hill request for attorney fees and costs.the court rejected udc waiver argument,but it concluded that udc had fully complied with the requirements of code of civil procedure section and that good cause existed for filing the against hill.although udc had not filed a certificate required by the statute,hill had not shown additional fees or expenses resulting from that omission.hill,having already filed its notice of appeal from the judgment,separately appealed from this postjudgment order.
discussion 
a.the judgment on the cross.hill duty to defend 
hill primary assertion of error is directed at the court finding that hill had a duty to defend udc against the hoa lawsuit.in hill view,the parties contract called for a defense only when the underlying claims arose out of hill negligence,whereas here there was no negligence finding by the jury or even allegation in the underlying hoa complaint.hill also contends that the court ruling was inconsistent with the jury determination that hill had no duty to defend udc.as for the trial court reliance on crawford,hill argues that the case is distinguishable and in any event should not be applied retroactively.none of these contentions can succeed.
the argument that the court ruling was inconsistent with the jury verdict on the defense issue is based on a false premise,contrary to the procedural posture of the case.as noted earlier,the question of whether hill had breached its duty to defend udc was discussed before the matter was submitted to the jury,at the outset of a hearing on proposed jury instructions and other issues.the court set forth its understanding of the parties agreement on these matters as follows first of all,we do have a final form of the special verdict form at this point but the parties have agreed to submit a special verdict form based upon negligence and breach of contract and reserve to the court the application of the indemnity provisions to those findings by the jury.is that a fair statement of what counsel have agreed to counsel for both parties answered affirmatively.the court proposed to decide the indemnity issues after the jury returned its verdict,and neither party objected.
the special verdict form asked whether hill had been negligent and corollary questions if the answer was yes,whether any other person or entity had been negligent,and whether hill had failed to do something that the contract between it and udc required it to do.this last question,in hill view,called for a determination of the defense issue,on which evidence had already been presented.but the only such evidence hill points to is evidence regarding negligence by hill.the jury was not given evidence on the request for a defense and its refusal,nor was it ever asked specifically to consider whether hill refusal to defend udc constituted a breach of the consulting agreement.
the single query whether hill failed to do something it was required to do under its contract was so broad as to be meaningless without further clarification for the jury.the jurors could not have been expected to examine all potential sources of breach without further guidance,nor would they have necessarily reasoned that no negligence by hill meant no breach of its duty to defend.the focus of udc argument on both the negligence and breach of contract claims was not hill defense obligation,but its obligation to perform its work in a competent and professional manner conversely,hill argument was confined to defending hill performance and refuting criticism of its work on the project.its counsel summarized by telling the jury,at the end of the day,at the end of this trial it comes down to a single question for all of you has udc convinced you that hill and its civil engineer were negligent.the instructions likewise stated the contract issue as whether hill had breached its contract by failing to perform its work in a professional manner.clearly the duty to defend was not an issue presented to the jury through evidence,in closing arguments,in the court instructions,or on the verdict form.consequently,the jury findings can in no conceivable way be interpreted to encompass the duty to defend,an issue that was purposely withheld from its deliberations.
hill argument is not only contrary to the record of the trial,it is inconsistent with its own statements when the issue was before the lower court.in its written and oral arguments hill insisted that the parties contract required no defense of udc unless hill was negligent.at the hearing hill attorney pointed out that hill had prevailed on breach of contract and negligence.the court then asked,you prevailed upon the negligence.you did prevail upon the breach of contract if the duty to defend was breached by you correct udc attorney that our interpretation,your honor.the court correct hill attorney correct,your honor.
thus,the record of all the superior court proceedings related to this issue convinces us that both the parties and the court understood that the duty to defend was a matter for the court to decide.that the court did so independently of the jury verdict did not constitute error in itself.whether it correctly interpreted the parties contract and correctly applied supreme court authority are questions to which we turn next.
hill contends that the contracts between the parties created a defense obligation only if a claim against udc arose out of hill negligence.the pertinent provision was paragraph of the consultant agreement,which stated consultant hill shall indemnify and hold owner,developer,and their respective officers,directors,employees and agents free and harmless from and against any and all claims,liens,demands,damages,injuries,liabilities,losses and expenses of any kind,including reasonable fees of attorneys,accountants,appraisers and expert witnesses,to the extent they arise out of or are in any way connected with any negligent act or omission by consultant,its agents,employees or guests,whether such claims,liens,demands,damages,losses or expenses are based upon a contract,or for personal injury,death or property damage or upon any other legal or equitable theory whatsoever.consultant agrees,at his own expense and upon written request by developer or owner of the subject property,to defend any suit,action or demand brought against developer or owner on any claim or demand covered herein.notwithstanding the above,consultant shall not be required to indemnify developer or owner from loss or liability to the extent such loss or liability arises from the gross negligence or willful misconduct by developer,owner,or agents,servants or independent contractors who are directly responsible to developer or owner,or for defects in design furnished by such person.italics added.
focusing on the phrase any claim or demand covered herein,hill maintains that in order for a duty to defend to arise,there had to be at least an allegation by the hoa that its damages arose at least partially from negligence on the part of hill.to determine the merit of this position requires an examination of crawford,supra,cal th,d,on which the trial court based its ruling.
peters jmp,the in crawford,was a developer which retained weather shield to supply windows for a residential construction project.weather shield promised to indemnify and save jmp harmless against all claims for damages loss,theft growing out of the execution of weather shield work,and at its own expense to defend any suit or action brought against jmp founded upon the claim of such damage,loss or theft.crawford,supra,cal th at,d.when some of the homeowners in the development sued jmp,weather shield,and others for construction defects,jmp against weather shield and other subcontractors,seeking indemnity and a defense.all parties except weather shield and another subcontractor settled.in the homeowners action,the other subcontractor was found liable,but weather shield was not.
the trial court in crawford ruled that the jury verdict released weather shield from any duty to indemnify jmp,but it had nonetheless had an obligation to defend jmp against the homeowners action,insofar as those claims concerned the windows supplied by weather shield,regardless of whether weather shield was ultimately found negligent.cal th at,d.weather shield along with the other subcontractor was therefore ordered to pay a portion of jmp defense fees and the attorney fees jmp had incurred in prosecuting its.ibid.affirming the trial court ruling and majority opinion of the court of appeal,the supreme court construed the parties agreement to require weather shield to defend,from the outset,any suit against jmp insofar as that suit was founded upon claims alleging damage or loss arising from weather shield negligent role in the project.id.at,d.in so holding,the court recognized the significance of civil code section,which in subdivision obligates a contractual indemnitor to provide a requested defense in respect to the matters embraced by the indemnity the defense obligation arose as soon as defense was tendered and did not depend on the outcome of the litigation that is,the duty existed even if it was later determined,as a result of this very litigation,that weather shield was not negligent.ibid.
hill attempts to distinguish crawford on the ground that there the homeowners expressly alleged negligence by weather shield,whereas here the hoa complaint contained no such allegations of defective performance by hill.this case,hill contends,is more comparable to mel clayton ford ford motor th,d,where the indemnity provision required the manufacturer to defend and indemnify the dealer against claims arising out of an occurrence caused solely by a production defect in a vehicle supplied to the dealer.id.at,d.the appellate court held that the trial court had erred by reading into the contract a duty to defend the manufacturer whenever a complaint merely included a claim for product liability,without limiting the obligation as the contract specified.id.at,d.thus,in mel clayton ford,it was not an distinction that negated the duty to defend.rather,given the word solely in the clause there at issue,the crucial fact was that the suit for which a defense was sought included allegations other than those to which the manufacturer had limited its defense duty design or production defects attributable to the manufacturer itself.crawford,supra,cal th at,d.
the contract at issue in this case,however,does not limit the scope of hill obligation as strictly as that of the parties in mel clayton ford.the indemnity provision does not state that there must be an underlying claim of negligence specifically against hill in order to trigger hill defense obligation.it calls for indemnification when claims against udc arise out of or are in any way connected with a negligent act or omission by hill.the duty to defend applied to any suit,action or demand brought against udc on any claim or demand covered herein.
the clause under scrutiny here is comparable to the provision considered in crawford,where weather shield promised to defend jmp in any suit or action brought against jmp founded upon a claim of damage growing out of the execution of weather shield work.crawford,supra,cal th at,d.even if any claim or demand covered herein is interpreted to refer back to the indemnity requirement,that clause is so broadly worded as to apply to claims in any way connected with any negligent act or omission by hill or upon any other legal or equitable theory whatsoever.the defense provision is thus not so dissimilar to that of crawford as to justify departure from the guidance of the legislature and the supreme court.
we thus are unconvinced by hill assertion that the underlying plaintiff must have alleged negligence by the consultant in order for the consultant defense obligation to arise.in a construction project involving multiple consultants and subcontractors,any of them might have been negligent.an indemnitee should not have to rely on the plaintiff to name a particular subcontractor or consultant in order to obtain a promised defense by the one the indemnitee believes is responsible for the plaintiff damages.here the hoa sufficiently alleged that doe defendants through were architects,engineers,and consultants who provided design services to udc in connection with the planning,design,specification,inspection,development and construction of the project.udc in turn named numerous and roes,eventually substituting hill as one of the roes liable for the negligent services provided in the surveying,design,grading,testing,and inspection of the property on which the condominium homes were built.the negligent act or omission language limited hill indemnity liability to the scenario in which hill was proven negligent.the duty to defend,however,arose when the attributed responsibility for the hoa damages to hill deficient performance of its role in the project.although the hoa complaint did not specifically identify each subcontractor or the details of each role in the project,its general description of the defects in the project implicated hill work.this was sufficient to trigger hill duty to defend.
hill continues to argue that the jury eventual no negligence finding rendered the entire indemnity clause,including the defense provision,inapplicable.the trial court properly rejected this position,emphasizing that the indemnity and defense clauses pertained to separate obligations.if any claim or demand covered herein refers back to claims and demands identified in the indemnity clause,it obviously can not be premised on a proven negligent act or omission by hill unless there is first a finding of such negligence.as the trial court pointed out,requiring such a determination would render meaningless the defense obligation and contravene civil code section and the supreme court admonition that a duty to defend arises out of an indemnity obligation as soon as the litigation commences and regardless of whether the indemnitor is ultimately found negligent.
hill maintains,however,that crawford should not be applied retroactively.hill acknowledges the general rule that case law applies retroactively to all cases still open on direct review and to all events,regardless of whether such events predate or postdate announcement of the rule.ticor title ins.employers ins.of wausau th,fn,d see also newman emerson radio cal d,explaining when,in compelling circumstances,narrow exceptions override general rule of retroactivity in interests of fairness and public policy.hill nevertheless invokes the exception for situations in which the parties have reasonably relied on the previously existing state of the law.newman emerson radio,supra,cal d at.here,hill argues,it reasonably relied on regan roofing superior court th,d in denying tender.in making this argument hill confronts a substantial hurdle,as our supreme court has repeatedly rejected claims that new case law should not be applied retroactively,even in the context when one party asserts reliance on past judicial authority.see,waller truck ins.exchange,cal th,d.
although we are directed to no evidence in the record that hill actually relied on regan roofing in declining udc defense,we will assume that fact for purposes of expediency.hill unilateral reliance on regan roofing,however,did not justify its refusal of tender.that case involved summary adjudication of a duty to defend which was overturned as premature,as there had as yet been no determination of negligence by the subcontractors that would give rise to a duty to indemnify and a related duty to defend.id.at,d.only an exemplar subcontract had been submitted to the trial court in the motion.id.at,d.part of the appellate court rationale concerned the practical problems for an immediate or current duty to defend,given the subcontractors involved in various areas or phases of the project.regan roofing,supra,th at,d.the court did not directly address the question of whether the duty to defend was a separate obligation from the provision requiring indemnification of damages paid,but appears to have assumed the two were interdependent.here the superior court emphasized that the duty to defend is distinct from the duty to indemnify,a point reinforced in crawford.
the fourth district,division one,itself later cautioned against uniform reliance on its regan roofing decision in subsequent indemnity situations contrary to the indemnitor subcontractor argument,nothing we said in regan roofing is inconsistent with the freedom of contract discussed in continental heller amtech mechanical services,th,d.in regan roofing we merely held that it was premature to decide whether a subcontractor could be required to contribute to the defense of a claim before either its fault had been established or any determination had been made that such a defense existed notwithstanding fault.we did not suggest that an agreement which required indemnity from a faultless indemnitor was in any manner improper or unusual.centex golden const.dale tile th,fn,d.the superior court recognized this procedural distinction in rejecting hill excuse.
in any event,we disagree with the premise of hill assertion that crawford so dramatically changed previously established law that its retroactive application would punish and severely prejudice hill and hundreds of other litigants.the
