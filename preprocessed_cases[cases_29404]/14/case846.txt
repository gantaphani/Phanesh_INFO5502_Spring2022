introduction 
citizens for responsible equitable environmental development creed appeals the trial court judgment denying its petition for a writ of mandate and dismissing its complaint for injunctive and declaratory relief against respondents city of san diego redevelopment agency,san diego centre city development corporation,and the city of san diego collectively respondents creed filed this lawsuit seeking to require respondents to prepare a environmental impact report eir pursuant to the california environmental quality act ceqa pub.resources code et to analyze a hotel project proposed by real party in interest westfield america,westfield and various entities affiliated with westfield 
on appeal,creed claims respondents abused their discretion in determining that the potential environmental impacts of the hotel project were adequately examined in two prior eirs a eir that analyzed environmental impacts associated with the update of the centre city community plan community plan,and a eir that updated the eir in connection with the development of a baseball stadium in the community plan planning area planning area.
creed claims respondents were required to prepare a separate eir for the hotel project because section requires a eir for all redevelopment projects undertaken as part of a redevelopment plan respondents failed to satisfy the statutory requirements for relying on the eir as a master environmental impact report under section a fair argument can be made that the hotel project will have significant environmental impacts respondents reliance on the prior eirs violated ceqa rules for limited environmental review associated with a project undertaken pursuant to a program eir guidelines and ceqa goals of information disclosure,public participation,and governmental accountability required a eir.we affirm the judgment.
factual and procedural background 
in,respondents adopted the master environmental impact report for the centre city redevelopment project and addressing the centre city community plan and related documents meir.the meir evaluated the potential environmental impacts that would result throughout the entire planning area from the update of the community plan,the adoption of the redevelopment plan for the centre city redevelopment project,and the adoption of other related programs in downtown san diego.
in,respondents adopted the final subsequent environmental impact report to the final master environmental impact report for the centre city redevelopment project and addressing the centre city community plan and related documents for the ballpark and ancillary development projects,and associated plan amendments seir.the seir was prepared to supplement information contained in the meir.the seir analyzed the potential environmental impacts related to the development of a baseball stadium and various ancillary projects in the planning area.
in july,real parties in interest submitted an application to construct a,hotel in the planning area,on the north side of g street above the horton plaza g street parking garage.in october,respondents prepared the final environmental secondary study for the proposed hotel project secondary study.the secondary study determined that the hotel project was likely to cause significant environmental impacts,including increased traffic and air pollution.however,the secondary study concluded that all of the potential significant environmental impacts that would be caused by the hotel project had been analyzed sufficiently in the meir and the seir,and that a new eir for the hotel project was therefore not required.in november,respondents approved the hotel project.
in january,creed filed a petition for a writ of mandate and complaint for injunctive and declaratory relief against respondents.creed claimed respondents had violated ceqa by relying on the meir and seir in approving the hotel project,and requested that the trial court order respondents to prepare a eir for the hotel project.in august,after briefing and oral argument,the trial court entered judgment denying the petition and dismissing the complaint.
creed timely appeals.
discussiona.ceqa overview 
in sierra club county of sonoma th,d sierra club,the court provided an overview of ceqa and a description of some of the types of eirs that may be prepared pursuant to that statute 
central to ceqa is the eir,which has as its purpose informing the public and government officials of the environmental consequences of decisions before they are made.citation.
an eir must be prepared on any project a local agency intends to approve or carry out which may have a significant effect on the environment,guidelines,subd.f.fn.omitted.the term project is broadly defined and includes any activities which have a potential for resulting in a physical change in the environment,directly or ultimately.guidelines,subd.d,subd.a citation.the definition encompasses a wide spectrum,ranging from the adoption of a general plan,which is by its nature tentative and subject to change,to activities with a more immediate impact,such as the issuance of a conditional use permit for a development proposal.citation.
to accommodate this diversity,the guidelines describe several types of eir,which may be tailored to different situations.the most common is the project eir,which examines the environmental impacts of a specific development project.guidelines.a quite different type is the program eir,which may be prepared on a series of actions that can be characterized as one large project and are related either geographically,as logical parts in the chain of contemplated actions,in connection with issuance of rules,regulations,plans,or other general criteria to govern the conduct of a continuing program,or as individual activities carried out under the same authorizing statutory or regulatory authority and having generally similar environmental effects which can be mitigated in similar ways.guidelines,subd.a citation.
an agency also may adopt a master environmental impact report as defined in section.section provides that such a report may be prepared in connection with various projects including a general plan,element,general plan amendment,or specific plan,subd.a.section,subdivision b specifies the required contents of a master environmental impact report.sections and describe the use of such a report in approving subsequent projects.
judicial review under ceqa is generally limited to whether the agency has abused its discretion by not proceeding as required by law or by making a determination not supported by substantial evidence.citations.sierra club,supra,th at,d.the precise standard of review to be used in determining whether an agency has abused its discretion under ceqa varies depending on the type of claim under review.ibid.
section does not require respondents to prepare a separate eir for the hotel project 
creed claims section requires respondents to prepare a separate eir for the hotel project.we apply the de novo standard of review to this claim,as it raises an issue of statutory interpretation.lincoln place tenants ass city of los angeles th,d question of statutory interpretation is reviewed de novo in determining whether agency abused its discretion under ceqa.
in construing any statute,w rules of statutory construction require us to ascertain the intent of the enacting legislative body so that we may adopt the construction that best effectuates the purpose of the law.citation.we first examine the words themselves because the statutory language is generally the most reliable indicator of legislative intent.citation.the words of the statute should be given their ordinary and usual meaning and should be construed in their statutory context.ibid.if the statutory language is unambiguous,we presume the legislature meant what it said,and the plain meaning of the statute governs.citation.whaley sony computer entertainment america,whaley th,d.
section provides 
a an environmental impact report for a redevelopment plan may be a master environmental impact report,program environmental impact report,or a project environmental impact report.any environmental impact report for a redevelopment plan shall specify the type of environmental impact report that is prepared for the redevelopment plan.
b if the environmental impact report for a redevelopment plan is a project environmental impact report,all public and private activities or undertakings pursuant to,or in furtherance of,a redevelopment plan shall be deemed to be a single project.however,further environmental review of any public or private activity or undertaking pursuant to,or in furtherance of,a redevelopment plan for which a project environmental impact report has been certified shall be conducted if any of the events specified in section have occurred.
creed contends that section requires that every project undertaken as part of a redevelopment plan has to receive environmental review unless the plan itself was the subject of a project eir.italics added.however,the plain language of section does not require that an agency take any such action.rather,section prohibits an agency from requiring further environmental review of redevelopment plans for which a project eir has been prepared,unless the circumstances specified in section exist in other words,section does not contain any requirement that an agency prepare a project eir.rather,it precludes an agency from requiring further environmental review under the circumstances specified in that statute.
creed argues that one can infer from the statute legislative history the legislature intent to require such eirs via section although we need not consider this argument in view of the plain language of section whaley,supra,th at,d,the legislative history offered by creed supports our interpretation.section was amended in september.stats,ch,eff.prior to the amendments,former section provided 
for all purposes of this division ceqa,all public and private activities or undertakings pursuant to,or in furtherance of,a redevelopment plan shall be deemed to be a single project.however,further environmental review of any public or private activity or undertaking pursuant to,or in furtherance of,a redevelopment plan shall be conducted if any of the events specified in section have occurred.
creed claims the amendments to section were a response to the court of appeal decision in friends of mammoth town of mammoth lakes redevelopment agency th,d mammoth lakes.in mammoth lakes,the court considered a town program eir,which was prepared in connection with a redevelopment plan that listed separate public improvements.id.at,d.the program eir did not analyze the potential direct or indirect environmental impacts of the projects.id.at,d.the mammoth lakes court held that the eir was inadequate,based in large part on its conclusion that,to the extent environmental information was available regarding the projects at the time the eir was approved,it should have been contained in the program eir.the court reasoned that if the program eir were deemed sufficient,notwithstanding the fact that it failed to include available information on the environmental impacts of the projects,section would prohibit any further environmental review.id.at,d.
as the treatise upon which creed relies in its opening brief explains,the amendments to section were intended to make clear that further environmental review of a redevelopment plan would be precluded only if a project eir had been prepared for the plan.beatty et,redevelopment in california ed hereinafter beatty.the amendments do not require further environmental review for redevelopment projects whose environmental effects have been adequately studied in a program eir 
the effect of the changes to public resources code section was to restore the flexibility that had been lost a result of the mammoth lakes case.eir prepared in connection with the adoption of a redevelopment plan may be either program or project eirs.only if the eir is a project eir will the prohibition on further environmental review contained in subsection,subdivision b be applicable.if the eir is a program eir,it will be subject to the same procedures and limitations as other program eirs.
most eir prepared for redevelopment plan adoptions will be program adoptions.a program eir prepared in connection with redevelopment plan adoption is usually a more general document than an eir that might be prepared for a discrete development project.the program eir should focus on the cumulative or synergistic impacts of the entire program.at this stage,less specific information is required about subsequent plan implementing activities than will be the case when those activities are before the public agency for decision.at that point,the agency must examine the environmental record to determine whether it adequately discloses and analyzes the environmental consequences of the specific implementing activity.if it does,then the agency may proceed with the decision on the basis of the existing environmental record.if it does not,the further environmental studies disclosing those specific impacts must first be prepared.beatty,supra,italics added.
there is nothing in either the plain language of section or in its legislative history that requires the preparation of an eir of any kind.specifically,section does not require an agency to prepare an eir for a project whose environmental impacts have been sufficiently analyzed in a prior program eir or master eir in part,post,we consider whether respondents properly determined that the hotel project potential environmental effects were adequately examined in a prior program eir.
because creed has not established that the meir is a master environmental impact report,we need not consider its arguments that respondents have not satisfied the statutory prerequisites of that section 
creed claims that in approving the hotel project,respondents violated ceqa to the extent that respondents relied on the meir as a master environmental impact report,as that term is defined in section.
in the trial court,respondents maintained that the meir was a program eir as defined by the guidelines,section,subdivision a,and not a master environmental impact report as defined in section.respondents explained that although the meir title included the words master environmental impact report,the meir was adopted in,the year prior to the amendments to ceqa that established the existence of the master environmental impact report as defined under section.stats,ch.further,the meir states that it is a program eir.
creed has failed to put forth any argument that the meir is in fact a master environmental impact report as defined in section,rather than a program eir as defined in the guidelines section,subdivision a.instead,creed assumes that the meir is the same as a master eir under ceqa,and argues that respondents violated various statutory requirements pertaining to master eirs.because creed has failed to establish that the meir is a master environmental impact report within the meaning of section,we reject creed argument that respondents failed to comply with the statutory requirements pertaining to the use of such reports in approving the hotel project.
d.the fair argument standard does not apply to judicial review of an agency determination that a project potential environmental impacts were adequately analyzed in a prior program eir 
creed claims respondents were required to prepare an eir for the hotel project because a fair argument can be made that the project would have significant environmental impacts.
the fair argument standard provides that an agency must prepare an eir whenever it can be fairly argued on the basis of substantial evidence that the project may have significant environmental impact.no oil,city of los angeles cal d.this test establishes a low threshold for the initial preparation of an eir,reflecting a preference for resolving doubts in favor of environmental review.sierra club,supra,th at,d.
the sierra club court outlined the appropriate standard of judicial review of an agency fair argument determination 
a court reviewing an agency decision not to prepare an eir in the first instance must set aside the decision if the administrative record contains substantial evidence that a proposed project might have a significant environmental impact in such a case,the agency has not proceeded as required by law.citation.stated another way,the question is one of law,the sufficiency of the evidence to support a fair argument.citation.under this standard,deference to the agency determination is not appropriate and its decision not to require an eir can be upheld only when there is no credible evidence to the contrary.citation.sierra club,supra,th at,d.
however,the fair argument standard does not apply to judicial review of an agency determination that a project is within the scope of a previously completed eir.sierra club,supra,th at,d.once an agency has prepared an eir,its decision not to prepare a supplemental or subsequent eir for a later project is reviewed under the deferential substantial evidence standard.santa teresa citizen action group city of san jose santa teresa th,d,citing sierra club,supra,th at,d see also sierra club,supra,th at,d concluding evidence does not support a determination that proposed project was either the same as or within the scope of the project,program,or plan described in the program eir.this rule applies to determinations regarding whether a new eir is required following a level of review.kostka zischke,supra,citing santa teresa,supra,th at,d.
in santa teresa,supra,th at,d,the city evaluated the potential environmental impact of a proposed water recycling project within an area known as the golden triangle and its possible expansion,in an eir that was completed in.the eir evaluated the golden triangle portion of the project at the project level guidelines,and the future expansion of the project at program level guidelines.santa teresa,supra,th at,d.in,the city completed an initial study for one possible route for expansion of a pipeline portion of the project,which resulted in a negative declaration id.at,d.in,the city conducted a second initial study for a slightly different proposed expansion.id.at,d.also in,the city adopted the second initial study by way of an addendum to the initial eir.the addendum stated,a subsequent eir will not be prepared because the project described in this addendum does not involve new significant environmental effects or a substantial increase in the severity of previously identified significant effects.id.at,d.
the petitioners filed a petition for a writ of mandate seeking to set aside the city action as a violation of ceqa.santa teresa,supra,th at,d.the trial court denied the petition.id.at,d.on appeal,the petitioners claimed that the initial study was inadequate because it relied on the eir.id.at,d.the santa teresa court rejected the petitioner argument that the fair argument standard applied to its claim 
when an agency has already prepared an eir,its decision not to prepare a supplemental or subsequent eir for a later project is reviewed under the deferential substantial evidence standard.citation.petitioners argue that the stricter fair argument rule should apply.we disagree.
when the public agency has already prepared an eir,no supplemental or subsequent eir is required unless there are substantial changes in the project or the circumstances surrounding the project,or if new information becomes available.the reviewing court upholds an agency decision not to require a supplemental or subsequent eir if the administrative record as a whole contains substantial evidence to support the determination that the changes in the project or its circumstances were not so substantial as to require major modifications of the eir.sierra club,supra,th at,d.this deferential standard is a reflection of the fact that review has already occurred.citation.id.at,d.
in this case,creed contends that the evidence overwhelmingly supports a fair argument that the hotel project is likely to have significant environmental impacts.in support of its claim,creed asserts that respondents secondary study revealed that the project was likely to have significant environmental impacts.assuming this is accurate,the secondary study went on to conclude that,no p otentially s ignificant e nvironmental i impacts were identified in the preceding environmental evaluation that had not been considered in the.
as noted above,the fair argument standard does not apply to review of an agency determination that a project potential environmental impacts were adequately analyzed in a prior program eir.santa teresa,supra,th at,d.therefore,in view of respondents determination that the project potential environmental impacts were adequately analyzed in the meir and the seir,we reject creed argument that the fair argument standard requires that respondents prepare an eir for the hotel project.
finally,creed expressly states that it is not raising a substantial evidence challenge to respondents determination that the meir and the seir adequately addressed the potential environmental impacts of the hotel project in raising its claim pertaining to the applicability of the fair argument standard however,creed did raise an analogous challenge in the context of arguing that respondents failed to satisfy the statutory prerequisites for utilizing the meir as a master environmental impact report as that term is defined in section.we concluded in part,ante,that we need not consider creed arguments pertaining to whether respondents satisfied the statutory prerequisites for utilizing the meir as a master environmental impact report in light of creed failure to establish that the meir is such a report.however,to the extent creed brief can be construed to raise a substantial evidence challenge to respondents determination that the hotel project potential environmental impacts were adequately addressed in the meir and seir,we consider this argument in part,post.
respondents did not violate ceqa in determining that the potential environmental effects of the hotel project were adequately examined in the meir and seir 
creed claims that respondents violated ceqa in determining that the potential environmental effects of the hotel project were adequately examined in the meir and seir 
natural resources defense council city of los angeles th,d ndrc does not preclude respondents from relying on the meir in approving the hotel project 
creed claims ndrc prohibit s r espondents from relying on the meir.in ndrc,the los angeles harbor department lahd prepared a program eir in in connection with various contemplated improvements at the port of los angeles port.ndrc,supra,th at,d.in,the united states army corps of engineers prepared an eir for the purpose of analyzing impacts of deepening various channels at the port.id.at,d.in may,the city of los angeles city entered into a with a lessee,china shipping,for the purpose of constructing a container terminal at the port.id.at,d.shortly thereafter,the city issued a notice of decision that stated that the city council had approved the project and had determined that the project had been adequately analyzed in the and eirs.id.at,d.
the petitioners filed a petition for a writ of mandate asserting that the city had violated ceqa.ndrc,supra,th at,d.the trial court denied the petition.ibid.on appeal,the ndrc court determined that the city had violated ceqa by failing to prepare an additional eir addressing impacts that were outside the scope of the prior eirs.ndrc,supra,th at,d.
ndrc is legally and factually distinguishable from this case,and does not stand for the proposition that a eir is required even where a governmental entity has determined that the potential environmental impact of a project was adequately considered in a prior eir.in ndrc,the court noted that the city had entered into a side letter agreement with the lessee that addressed environmental concerns based on the city apparent concern that not all environmental issues had been addressed in the prior eirs.ndrc,supra,th at,d.in addition,notwithstanding this side letter agreement,the city failed to prepare an initial study to determine whether additional environmental analysis was required.id.at,d.the ndrc court concluded,the fact that the port and china shipping entered into a side letter agreement addressing environmental concerns arising from th
