coalition for a sustainable future in yucaipa coalition appeals from a judgment denying its petition for writ of mandate.the petition challenged a shopping center approved by respondents city of yucaipa and its city council jointly,city and proposed by respondent and real party in interest target stores,target on land owned by respondent and real party in interest palmer general corporation palmer.the principal ground of the petition was that the project conflicted with affordable housing requirements,but it also alleged failures to properly consider and deal with greenhouse gas emissions,urban decay effects,and traffic impacts.the appellant opening brief focuses on the affordable housing and greenhouse gas issues.
prior to the filing of a respondents brief,city and target moved to dismiss the appeal on the ground of mootness,and coalition opposed the motions.the motions were denied without prejudice to reconsideration by the panel deciding the case however,the court took up the issue again,and after further letter memoranda,determined that the appeal had been rendered moot.
the mootness determination was based on events subsequent to the filing of the appeal target and palmer abandoned the project because of litigation between them over a claimed breach of contract respecting the project.city rescinded the resolutions approving the project,a general plan amendment necessary to the project,and the certification of the environmental impact report for the project,all of which occasioned the litigation resulting in this appeal and were its sole subjects.
the court has considered appellant and respondents letters both filed april,pursuant to the order filed march.that order suggested the appropriate disposition of the appeal would be reversal of the judgment appealed solely to restore jurisdiction to the superior court to dismiss the action.compare paul milk depots,cal d,paul.the court considered the disposition appropriate in view of respondents abandonment of the project and city rescissions.although appellant naturally approved the proposed disposition,respondents objected on the grounds that the case had not been rendered moot in a manner that rendered the superior court decision erroneous and that there is no outstanding relief that would be rendered improper by this court determination of mootness.in support of the second ground,respondents distinguished two cases in which the paul disposition was used to vacate judgments granting injunctions that were no longer proper.
discussion 
to justify our use of the paul disposition in this case,we will first look at paul to see why the supreme court reversed with directions to dismiss.we will then address respondents attempted distinctions.
in paul,creamcrest dairy products company creamcrest,the predecessor of milk depots,milk depots,and a milk distributor as opposed to a milk producer,sold milk for the lesser producer price in violation of the minimum price set by a regulation of the director of the california department of agriculture,charles paul state.state sued to enjoin creamcrest and recover civil penalties.the superior court rendered judgment in favor of creamcrest,finding the regulation unauthorized by the statute under which it was promulgated.subsequently,creamcrest went bankrupt and milk depots substituted in.state appealed.paul,supra,cal d at.
while the appeal was pending,creamcrest distributor license was revoked on other grounds,and creamcrest ceased doing business and sold its physical plant to milk depots.a new regulation superseded the old regulation and omitted the price differential that the judge had found unauthorized.the supreme court held that the issues of the injunctive relief and even the civil penalties which would have survived bankruptcy were mooted by creamcrest status as an insolvent corporation with no assets.paul,supra,cal d at.furthermore,although the public interest in the correctness of the trial court invalidation of the price differential might have justified ignoring the mootness of the case as to the parties to reach an important legal question,the effective repeal of the old regulation removed that question from consideration.id.at.
the supreme court then took up the issue of the proper disposition.the court noted that the usual disposition of a moot appeal is dismissal.paul,supra,cal d at.the problem with dismissal in paul was that t he dismissal of an appeal is in effect an affirmance of the judgment ibid.the court then wrote,as we do not reach the merits of the appeal in the case at bench,it is appropriate to avoid thus impliedly affirming a judgment which holds unconstitutional a regulation of the director of agriculture promulgated pursuant to the milk stabilization act.since the basis for that judgment has now disappeared we should dispose of the case,not merely of the appellate proceeding which brought it here.citations.that result can be achieved by reversing the judgment solely for the purpose of restoring the matter to the jurisdiction of the superior court,with directions to the court to dismiss the proceeding.citations.such a reversal,of course,does not imply approval of a contrary judgment,but is merely a procedural step necessary to a proper disposition of this case.id.at,italics added.the supreme court disposed of the case as follows in the main appeal case number the judgment is reversed and the cause remanded for the purpose of restoring the matter to the jurisdiction of the superior court,with directions to dismiss the action as moot.id.at.
the judgment in paul had two problems.the first problem was that the basis for th e judgment had disappeared the regulation had been superseded and creamcrest was defunct.id.at.thus,there was neither justification for an injunction to enforce a superseded regulation nor an entity on which to impose civil penalties there was no longer an actual controversy,and the case was moot.ibid.the second problem was that the judgment merits had not been fully and finally litigated and never would be because the judgment was moot.ibid.by becoming moot,the judgment had escaped appellate review.a trial court judgment rendered moot on appeal and dismissed has not been fully litigated in the sense that the appellate review begun on the merits was never completed.nevertheless,this judgment may have a continuing preclusive effect on subsequent litigation appellate courts have disagreed as to whether such a judgment may or may not be considered final so as to have res judicata or collateral estoppel effect.see,chamberlin city of palo alto d.not final chamberlin but lyons security pacific nat.bank th,d final lyons see also rest d judgments,com.a affirming for issue preclusion purposes while noting possible difference in treatment of judgments rendered moot pending appeal in state and federal courts.
the question faced in paul was what should the disposition of the appeal be from a judgment with these problems a dismissal of the appeal was inappropriate twice over.since the judgment merits had not been fully litigated,the affirmance implied by a dismissal of the appeal was unjustified.since the case itself,not just the appeal,had been rendered moot by the disappearance of the basis for the judgment,a mere dismissal of the appeal failed to address the mootness of the case underlying the appeal.however,justifying a reversal was problematic because the reversal implied that the judgment was erroneous when the merits of the judgment had not been finally litigated.furthermore,the reversal of the judgment would imply that additional proceedings should take place in the trial court,which would be inappropriate in view of the case mootness.the advantage of a reversal over a dismissal was threefold a reversal could include directions to dismiss the underlying case a reversal vacated the judgment so the court had jurisdiction to follow the directions and dismiss the case and,reversal itself ensures that the judgment can have no issue preclusive effect 
furthermore,the reversal could be qualified so as not to imply that the judgment was in error,only moot.thus,a qualified reversal would remove any implication that the judgment h
