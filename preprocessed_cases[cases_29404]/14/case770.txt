the city found the entire project was exempt from compliance with ceqa because it involved a minor alteration to land,and issued a notice of exemption at the same time it issued a conditional use permit cup for the project,tit,subd.a.all further references to title are to title of the california code of regulations.the exemption finding was never challenged.merrilee madrigal,the santa ana river watershed coalition,and the hb river park foundation collectively madrigal challenged the later issuance of a grading permit,on the grounds the permit was inconsistent with the cup and the issuance of the permit was not exempt from ceqa compliance and required environmental review.madrigal petitioned the trial court for a writ of mandate the trial court entered judgment denying the petition,finding the city did not abuse its discretion in issuing the grading permit without conducting an environmental review.
we affirm.the grading permit was consistent with the cup.the cup contemplated the use of fill as part of the grading process,although no specific amount of fill was mentioned at that time.the fact two different grading plans,prepared six years apart,estimate two different amounts of fill does not mean either of the grading plans was inconsistent with the cup.the grading permits issued in connection with those grading plans were also consistent with the cup.
additionally,madrigal did not meet the burden on appeal of proving that the issuance of the grading permit was discretionary,rather than ministerial,or that it was not otherwise exempt from ceqa.
