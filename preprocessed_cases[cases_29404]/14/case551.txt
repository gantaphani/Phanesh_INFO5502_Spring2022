this is an action for mandamus and declaratory relief brought by plaintiff construction industry force account council,a trade association whose membership includes unions,contractors associations and contractors throughout california.following discovery and a contested hearing,the trial court ruled that defendant ross valley sanitary district the district lacked statutory authority under public contact code section to engage its own work force to complete a sewer system improvement project costing over without putting the project out for competitive bid and contract the trial court thereafter granted a peremptory writ of mandate commanding the district to,inter alia,cease and desist from taking further action with respect to about miles of its small diameter sewer pipe with force account workers,and to conduct all future replacement of this pipe through competitive bid and contract.
the district has appealed this decision,challenging both the trial court interpretation of public contract code section,as well as certain factual findings underlying its conclusion that the district undertook a district project,within the meaning of the statute,costing in excess of the statutory threshold.for reasons set forth below,we reverse.
factual and procedural background 
section of the public contract code was enacted in its original form in as part of article,the provisions of which shall apply to contracts by sanitary districts as provided in the sanitary district act of pursuant to division commencing with section of the health and safety code.section,in particular,provides when the expenditure required for a district project exceeds fifteen thousand dollars,it shall be contracted for and let to the lowest responsible bidder after notice,subject to section.district project,in turn,is defined for purposes of article as any construction,reconstruction,alteration,enlargement,renewal,or replacement of sewer facilities which the district is authorized to do,including,but not limited to,the furnishing of supplies or materials for any such.work.
in its original form,the statute applied to sanitary district projects exceeding five thousand dollars in value.in,the statute was amended such.that the dollar amount was increased to ten thousand dollars,and in,pursuant to another amendment,this amount was increased to the current level of fifteen thousand dollars added stats.ch.amended stats.ch.stats.ch.sb.
the district,as a local sanitary district charged with operating and maintaining approximately miles of collection sewer lines and pumping stations in marin county,is governed by article.see health,to.most of these sewer lines are neighborhood lines ten inches or less in diameter referred to herein as small diameter sewer pipe.the district has long recognized the need to eventually replace about miles of this small diameter sewer pipe,which has become old and dilapidated in many locations.
historically,the district work on its aging sewer lines has been accomplished by performing spot repairs on problematic sections of pipe.this work,as well as manhole rehabilitation or replacement,was performed by the district construction and maintenance personnel,which is comprised of varying numbers of district employees,as well as by private contractors.
however,in recent years,a more modern technique known as pipebursting has become the preferred method for addressing problem areas along the district sewer lines.in,the district began experimenting with this new technique,which allows it to replace sections of sewer line by digging two holes about feet apart,and then using a hydraulic pump to pull a device through the old pipe,bursting the old pipe and leaving a new pipe in its wake.with pipebursting,the district can replace foot sections of pipe in about three days and without trenching,rather than engaging in weeks of spot repairs.
in,the district board authorized the hiring of a team of new employees capable of doing pipebursting work,as well as more traditional maintenance work,to address problem sections within the approximately miles of small diameter sewer lines.public meetings were held at which the board discussed this plan.plaintiff,in attendance at these meetings,objected orally and in writing on the ground that the public contract code required the district to put out to competitive bid any of its pipebursting work.the district,however,rejected plaintiff position.thereafter,in and,the district used workers to perform pipebursting work on several roads in marin county.
on june,plaintiff filed its petition for a writ of mandate in marin superior court,seeking a peremptory writ pursuant to code of civil procedure section to compel the district to put out to competitive bid its capital pipe bursting project hereinafter,project.in this petition,plaintiff alleged that the project exceeded in cost,and had already been implemented using workers on sewer lines at san francisco boulevard and los angeles boulevard in san anselmo,and at bothin road in fairfax.the petition further alleged the district was proceeding in violation of section by refusing to comply with the statute competitive bidding requirements with respect to the project.finally,the petition alleged plaintiff and its members would suffer irreparable harm if the district were permitted to continue violating the public contract code competitive bidding procedures.
after discovery and a contested hearing,the trial court entered a writ of mandate on may.this writ set forth the trial court findings that section is a force account limit statute,and that the district decision to hire and train a new capital pipe bursting crew was primarily for the purpose of replacing its aging pipes and,thus,constituted a district project under section.
on june,plaintiff submitted for the court consideration a proposed judgment directing issuance of peremptory writ of mandate to respondents ross valley sanitary district and ross valley sanitary district board of directors and a peremptory writ of mandate.the district objected on the ground that the writ of mandate entered may,constituted the judgment in this case,and that any further judgment would be substantively improper.the trial court overruled this objection and,on july,entered judgment directing issuance of a peremptory writ of mandate to the district.on august,the clerk of the superior court executed the peremptory writ of mandate,which commanded the district to cease and desist from taking further action with respect to about miles of its small diameter sewer pipe with force account workers,conduct all further and future replacement of the approximately miles of sewer pipe ten inches in diameter or less through competitive bid and contract and conduct all further and future work in excess of the limits imposed by section through competitive bid and contract.this appeal ensued.
discussion 
a writ of mandate lies to compel the performance of an act which the law specially enjoins,as a duty resulting from an office,trust,or station citation.two basic requirements are essential to the issuance of the writ a clear,present and usually ministerial duty upon the part of the respondent citations and a clear,present and beneficial right in the petitioner to the performance of that duty citation.citation.citation.as to the petitioner interest,the writ may not be issued where the injury is purely theoretical and the petitioner fails to show any benefit would accrue to him if the writ were issued,or that he will suffer any detriment if it is denied.citations.steelgard,jannsen d.
here,the district challenges the trial court grant of the peremptory writ of mandate on the following grounds.first,the district contends the trial court misinterpreted section as a force account limit statute that required the district to put out for competitive bid any district project costing over.second,the district contends two of the trial court underlying factual findings lack the support of substantial evidence to wit,that the district pipebursting work constitutes a district project and that this project exceeds in costs.finally,the district contends the trial court made several manifest errors of a procedural nature,including its decisions to reject the district request for a statement of decision,to overrule its demurrer,and to issue a second judgment after the district had already filed a notice of appeal of the may,writ of mandate.we address these contentions below to the appropriate extent.
is section a force account limit statute requiring the district to put out for competitive bid any district project costing over 
both parties recognize the primary issue on appeal is one of statutory interpretation,which we review independently.cal air conditioning,auburn union school district th.the rules of statutory interpretation are,of course.o ur fundamental task is to ascertain the legislature intent so as to effectuate the purpose of the statute.citation.we begin with the language of the statute,giving the words their usual and ordinary meaning.citation.the language must be construed in the context of the statute as a whole and the overall statutory scheme,and we give significance to every word,phrase,sentence,and part of an act in pursuance of the legislative purpose.citation.in other words,we do not construe statutes in isolation,but rather read every statute with reference to the entire scheme of law of which it is part so that the whole may be harmonized and retain effectiveness.citation.citation.if the statutory terms are ambiguous,we may examine extrinsic sources,including the ostensible objects to be achieved and the legislative history.citation.in such.circumstances,we choose the construction that comports most closely with the legislature apparent intent,endeavoring to promote rather than defeat the statute general purpose,and avoiding a construction that would lead to absurd consequences.citation.smith superior court cal th,d.boy scouts of america national foundation superior court th.
additionally,w e examine the history and background of the statutory provision in order to ascertain the most reasonable interpretation of the measure.citation.doe city of los angeles cal th,d.even where the plain language of the statute dictates the result,the legislative history may provide additional authority confirming the court interpretation of the statute.id.at.boy scouts of america national foundation superior court,supra,th at.
in our case,the district argues section should not be interpreted to require competitive bidding for district projects exceeding the threshold amount.rather,the district asks us to interpret section to permit a sanitary district to use employees to complete a project regardless of total cost,and to require a district compliance with the competitive bidding procedures in article only if it chooses to contract out to a third party a project meeting the cost threshold.in promoting this interpretation,the district reasons as follows.
first,the district notes section contains no express statutory directive limiting a sanitary district authority to perform force account work.the district then turns its focus to section,another provision of article,providing that this article shall apply to contracts by sanitary districts.italics added.according to the district,the term,contracts,in section would be pure surplusage unless the provision as a whole is interpreted to mean article is triggered only when a district contracts out work.
we agree with the district interpretation,if not its entire analysis.like the district,we begin with the fact that section contains no express statutory directive limiting a sanitary district authority to perform force account work.this silence is indeed significant.as our appellate colleagues in the third district explain,when called upon to determine whether a statute sets a force account limit based on the value of a local agency public works project,courts must start with the premise that,absent a statutory directive,a public entity is not bound to engage in competitive bidding.construction indus.force account council amador water agency th,amador water.the reason is this while there are powerful purposes served by competitive bidding,preventing waste,favoritism,and corruption,there is no public policy that requires all public entities to engage in that practice.rather,the legislature imposes competitive bidding requirements on public entities within its purview when the legislature determines it is in the public interest to do so.ibid.
nor can any such.statutory directive be found in section.like section,section is silent with respect to force account work and,in particular,with respect to any supposed limitation on a sanitary district right to rely on force account work rather than competitive bidding.rather,section simply states that article applies to contracts by sanitary districts.we agree with the district this provision,read in a straightforward manner,means article,which includes section,applies when a district contracts with a third party for public work,and not when a district relies on force account work.
moreover,to the extent there is any ambiguity in the language of sections or,we apply the rule requiring us to harmonize all parts of the entire legal scheme,giving significance to each.word,phrase,sentence and part of the act in pursuance of the legislative purpose,which,in this case,is to hold public entities to open contract bidding procedures so as to guard against favoritism,improvidence,extravagance,fraud and corruption to prevent the waste of public funds and to obtain the best economic result for the public.citations.construction industry force account council delta wetlands th,delta wetlands.reasonably construing sections and conjunctively in light of this legislative purpose,we are left to conclude that section only operates to require competitive bidding when a sanitary district contracts out a district project costing over.indeed,to interpret these statutes otherwise would require us to import language into the statutes restricting a sanitary district autonomy to use force account work for certain projects that otherwise is not there and,ignore clear language in section restricting application of article to contracts by sanitary districts.the law forbids both.it is equally improper to read things into statutory provisions,particularly when they are clearly stated as here delta wetlands,supra,at,and to render statutory language mere surplusage brown superior court cal d.see also san diego serv.auth.for freeway emergencies superior court d,a court should not presume the legislature intended to legislate by implication.citation.although in years past it may have been necessary for courts to read into a statute provisions not specifically expressed by the legislature,the modern rule of construction disfavors such.practice.
our need to respect the existing statutory language and overall legal scheme is particularly important in light of the legislature demonstrated capacity to enact force account limit statutes that directly say what they mean to wit,that a public entity may not complete a public work project with its own labor force,but must put the work out for competitive bid,when work is not to be done by the district itself by force account,and the amount involved is thousand dollars,or more,any contract for the doing of the work shall be let to the lowest responsible bidder when work is done by the district itself by force account,the amount shall not exceed.when the expenditure required for the work exceeds,it shall be contracted for and let to the lowest responsible bidder.see also amador water,supra,th at the legislature has shown it can make clear when it chooses to do so whether projects must be bid or can be completed by the agency itself.under these circumstances,it is improper to infer from the provision a limitation on the agency authority,nor does it advance the purposes of competitive bidding to infer a limitation.
at the same time,declining to accept the trial court interpretation of section does not undermine the legislative policies reflected in the statutory scheme.as the delta wetlands court explained,the legislative goals of guarding against favoritism,corruption and fraud,and ensuring prudent expenditure of public funds are less relevan
