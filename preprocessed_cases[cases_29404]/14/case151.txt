skanska usa building,and american home assurance,collectively skanska appeal the district court order denying skanska motion to compel arbitration in a civil action filed by patten grading paving,patten.in its complaint,patten alleged that skanska breached their subcontract agreement by failing to pay patten for grading work on a construction project skanska managed.skanska sought to compel arbitration based on a clause in the agreement that required patten to submit any claims arising thereunder to arbitration.the district court denied skanska motion,finding that skanska participation in the action up to that point constituted a waiver of the arbitration provision.because we conclude the record here does not support such a finding,we reverse and remand.
the underlying facts are not in dispute.skanska is the to the original contractor for a renovation project at the blue ridge middle school in greer,south carolina,that began in june.the original contractor retained patten to perform the grading and site utility work specified in the renovation plans.although patten work was to be completed by august,patten asserted that project delays attributable to the general contractor both prevented it from meeting this deadline and resulted in additional expenses for patten.when the renovation was completed in early,skanska refused to pay patten additional amounts patten claimed were due.patten mailed a demand letter to skanska in october and filed the underlying complaint in south carolina state court on december.
invoking,skanska removed patten action to federal court the following month and filed its answer.the parties thereafter exchanged written discovery,including interrogatories and requests for production of documents.in july,patten acknowledged during discovery that a rider to the subcontract agreement it entered into with beers york construction,skanska,required that any claims arising under the subcontract be submitted to arbitration.the parties also participated in mediation,which ended unsuccessfully in august.although the district court had directed that discovery end on august,patten sought and received permission to file an amended complaint adding an additional claim,prompting the district court to reopen discovery and extend the discovery period to.
by motion on august,skanska requested a stay of proceedings and an order compelling patten to submit its claims to arbitration.in support,skanska noted patten acknowledgment of the rider requiring patten to submit any claims arising under the contract to arbitration the district court denied skanska motion,finding that skanska participation in litigation amounted to a waiver of its contractual right to have patten claims submitted to arbitration.specifically,the court noted that the action had been proceeding for over eight months and that the parties had engaged in discovery,participated in mediation,and had a motion decided before the court.the district court further noted that because patten ha d expended to prosecute its case,compelling arbitration would result in actual prejudice to patten,a conclusion it found to be reinforced by the fact that patten would have to pay a substantial initial fee to engage the american arbitration association if skanska motion were granted.id.skanska appeals the district court order,which we have jurisdiction to consider pursuant to a.see stedor,armtex,cir.
although the underlying factual findings of the district court are entitled to deference,the decision to deny skanska motion for stay and to compel arbitration is reviewed de novo.microstrategy,lauricia,cir.
the rights and responsibilities of the parties with respect to the arbitration agreement are governed by the federal arbitration act,codified at faa moses cone mem l hosp.mercury constr,d.the primary substantive provision of the faa,declares that a written agreement to arbitrate shall be valid,irrevocable,and enforceable,save upon such grounds as exist at law or in equity for the revocation of any contract.as a result of this federal policy favoring arbitration,any doubts concerning the scope of arbitrable issues should be resolved in favor of arbitration,whether the problem at hand is the construction of the contract language itself or an allegation of waiver,delay,or a like defense to arbitrability.moses cone mem l,at.emphasis added.
to further facilitate arbitration,the faa authorizes a party to an arbitration agreement to demand a stay of proceedings in order to pursue arbitration,provid ed the applicant for the stay is not in default of that right.such default or waiver arises when the party seeking arbitration so substantially utiliz ed the litigation machinery that to subsequently permit arbitration would prejudice the party opposing the stay.maxum,salus,cir.however,in concert with other circuits,we have consistently held that because of the strong federal policy favoring arbitration we will not lightly infer the circumstances constituting waiver.am.recovery computerized thermal imaging,cir.the party opposing arbitration on the basis of waiver thus bears a heavy burden,at internal quotations omitted am.recovery,at.with the framework of the faa and applicable case law in mind,we turn to an analysis of the facts presented here.
patten argues on appeal that the district court properly found that skanska waived its right to invoke arbitration,as skanska substantial utilization of the litigation machinery would prejudice patten.in support of this general position,patten points to skanska failure to raise the arbitration clause as an affirmative defense in its answer and the resulting delay in seeking arbitration,the extent of skanska participation in activity during that delay,the imminence of trial at the time skanska filed its motion to compel arbitration,skanska participation in mediation,and the fact that patten had incurred in expenses and would allegedly face approximately in arbitration fees if compelled to arbitrate.we address each contention in turn.
patten first argues that the delay of almost eight months between the filing of patten complaint and skanska motion to compel skanska failure to assert the right to compel arbitration as an affirmative defense in its a default under of the faa we disagree.
preliminarily,we question patten assertion that eight months is the appropriate time frame to consider in making a determination of waiver here.throughout these proceedings,skanska has explained its delay by noting that it was the to the original contractor for the blue ridge middle school project,and that due to the manner in which it succeeded the original general contractor,it only learned of the precise terms of patten subcontract agreement including the arbitration provision as discovery unfolded.significantly,patten does not contest skanska proffered explanation.indeed,rather than attempting to demonstrate that skanska was actually or constructively aware of the rider ab initio patten argues only that skanska was certainly aware of the rider and arbitration clause as of may,when it requested patten admission that the rider applied to the subcontract agreement.
given these facts,we find it inappropriate to charge skanska with the full eight months that patten action was pending before the district court.in light of patten failure to contest skanska proffered explanation,we find that the delay properly attributable to skanska should be measured,at the earliest,from may,venters city of delphi,cir recognizing that pertinence of affirmative defense may arise only after discovery,and that the defendant proper recourse is a timely assertion of that defense.as skanska moved to compel arbitration on august,the delay properly attributable to it is no more than four months.
