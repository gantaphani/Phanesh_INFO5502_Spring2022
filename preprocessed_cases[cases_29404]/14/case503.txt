in this government contract case,the armed services board of contract appeals board rendered two lengthy opinions one on the contractor entitlement to recover on the many claims for additional compensation it had submitted to the contracting officer,and the second on the amount of recovery on those claims on which it prevailed the quantum decision.equip,cch,wl equip,cch,wl.the contractor challenges both of these decisions on numerous grounds.we affirm both of them.
the basic facts,as found by the board in its first entitlement decision,are not disputed.they may be summarized as follows 
in august,the appellant equipment entered into a contract to repair the fresh water system and tank at a navy base in california for.equip.i,cch at finding of fact ff.the contract also required to maintain two sets of contract drawings showing any deviations,including buried or concealed construction and utility features revealed during construction,and upon completion of the work to deliver the sets of drawings to the contracting officer.id.at ff.work was to begin on august,and be completed by may.id.at ff.
because of what described as a large number of unknown obstructions and pipelines being encountered,work did not proceed smoothly.id.at ff.the parties negotiated and executed f change order modifications during the performance of the contract,most of which provided for additional payments to id.at ff.as the contract provided,each of these bilaterally executed modifications release d the government from further payment to for the matters covered.id.at.
by early,relations between the parties had deteriorated.in an april letter,the navy directed to show cause why the contract should not be terminated because of its failure to diligently prosecute the work.id.at ff.the letter stated that although several unexpected problems were encountered,had been fully compensated for each changed condition and the amount of change order work would not be considered an adequate defense for failing to diligently prosecute the work.id.
although it is unclear what followed,it is undisputed that in a may,letter,the navy ordered to stop work,and on may,base security removed jc from the base and work ceased.id.ff.subsequently,the government acknowledged that the revised contract completion date was may.id.ff.
then filed with the contracting officer a formal claim for an equitable adjustment of slightly more than two million dollars,id.at ff,which later was reduced to,id.at.the contracting officer rejected most of these claims but awarded.id.at ff.
in its appeal to the board,sought recovery on separate claims.after a hearing that produced a voluminous record consisting of approximately to thousand pages and pages of transcript,id.at,the board allowed nineteen claims in whole or in part and rejected the remaining claims.the claims on which prevailed were remanded for negotiation and settlement.id.at passim.
when the parties were unable to settle those claims,filed a quantum complaint with the board seeking an equitable adjustment of.equip.ii,cch at.it also contended that the issuance of the stop work order and termination of the contract was erroneous and must be converted into a termination for the convenience of the government.id.
after a further evidentiary hearing,the board awarded but did not extend its time for performance.id.at.the board also held that it lacked jurisdiction to consider request to change the character of the contract termination because had not raised that issue before the contracting officer.id.at.
the government contends that to the extent appeal challenges the board denial of of its claims in the entitlement decision,it is untimely,and we therefore have no jurisdiction to consider it.relying upon our precedent,the government argues that the entitlement decision was a final one that could have appealed and that its failure to do so within the period for appeal under the contract disputes act of,g a,precludes it from challenging that decision in its appeal from the board quantum decision.
the government conclusion,however,does not follow from its premise.the fact that the board earlier entitlement decision may have had sufficient finality to make it immediately appealable does not mean that the contractor failure to take such appeal precludes it from challenging that ruling in its appeal from the board second decision,which was the board final action in the case.
our recent decision in brownlee dyncorp,is dispositive of this issue and requires rejection of the government contention.in that case the board held for a contractor and remanded for the parties to attempt to settle the amount of same procedure it followed in the present case.id.at.on remand,the government stipulated to the amount it owed,and the board entered a final judgment for that amount.id.at.the government then appealed from that judgment,challenging only the board earlier entitlement ruling in favor of the contractor.id.at.
this court rejected dyncorp contention that the government challenge to the board entitlement ruling was untimely because it was not filed within days of its rendition.the court pointed out that although prior decisions had permitted the parties to appeal from entitlement decisions under similar circumstances,see,dewey electronics united states,no cases h e ld or suggest ed that appeals we re required before the question of quantum wa s resolved,dyncorp,at emphasis in the original.the court concluded that although the government could have appealed from the board entitlement decision at the time it was rendered,the government later appeal was not time barred,id.at.
in a supplemental filing here the government sought to distinguish dyncorp because that case involved only a single claim by the contractor,whereas here asserted multiple claims.the government provides no reason,convincing or otherwise,why this distinction should produce a different result,and we can not discern any.indeed,the government position in this case is inconsistent with the policy underlying the final judgment rule the avoidance of unnecessary multiple appeals.
under the government theory,was required first to appeal the board entitlement decision and then,if it was dissatisfied with the board subsequent quantum decision,take a second appeal to challenge that ruling.the government theory thus could lead to two appeals,while the course followed permits the entire controversy between the parties to be resolved in a single appeal.we see no reason to follow the cumbersome course the government proposes.in the present appeal,may litigate questions relating to both the board entitlement and quantum decisions.
mounts a broadside attack upon the board findings in both opinions,in which it challenges the board evaluation of the evidence on a large number of factual issues.in effect,it is asking us to retry the case and to substitute our judgment for that of the board on many of the board factual determinations.under the contract disputes act,however,board decisions on factual questions are final unless,among other things,they are not supported by substantial evidence.b.the evidence supporting the challenged factual determinations is substantial,and there is no occasion for us to discuss that evidence in detail.
accordingly,we shall address only those legal arguments that warrant discussion.
jack butler,president,was a principal witness for.the board found that his testimony was not credible and rejected a number of claims based upon that testimony.contends that because the board treated butler as an expert witness,it improperly rejected his testimony and relied on contrary testimony by witnesses.it urges us to overturn the board finding that butler was not a credible witness and to accept his testimony.
although the administrative judge stated at the hearing that he would treat butler as an expert on utilities,the testimony of butler that urges us to accept was not expert testimony but fact testimony.an example relates to claims,and,in which the central dispute was whether procured outside imported dirt to use as backfill to close up its excavations for which it sought additional compensation or instead
