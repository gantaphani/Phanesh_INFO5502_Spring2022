facts proceedings 
ellis was injured in february while working on an apartment complex construction site in biloxi,mississippi.the negligence asserted occurred on that site where ellis had been working for a month.in his complaint,ellis identifies himself as an adult resident citizen of jackson county,state of mississippi.
with the exception of ellis,however,all parties involved in this suit are alabama residents,partnerships,or corporations.the apartment complex was owned by landings associates,landings.a partner of landings,the mitchell company,was the general contractor for the construction project,and the mitchell company subcontracted with trustmark,whose employee,scotty jones,allegedly constructed the wooden platform that is claimed to have caused ellis injury landings,the mitchell company,and trustmark are alabama partnerships or corporations,and all maintain their principal places of business in alabama.trustmark was not registered to do business in mississippi at the time,its mississippi certificate of authority having been revoked prior to the accident.jones is an alabama resident too,and he commuted from his alabama home to mississippi on days that he worked on the construction site.
trustmark in turn in alabama with rusty stevens,an alabama subcontractor.stevens hired ellis,also in alabama ellis spent the first nine months of his employment for stevens working with jones in alabama on trustmark projects.he then spent only the one month prior to his injury working in mississippi.notably,stevens maintained workers compensation insurance only in the state of alabama.he secured that insurance through liberty mutual insurance company liberty mutual also an alabama cover all his employees,including ellis,while they worked out of state 
after ellis accident,stevens filed a notice of injury with the alabama department of industrial relations,and liberty mutual filed a combination supplementary and claim summary form with the same alabama agency.ellis received workers compensation benefits pursuant to the state of alabama workers compensation law.
proceedings 
after ellis began receiving the workers compensation benefits under stevens policy in alabama,he filed this tort action in the southern district of mississippi,seeking damages for injuries resulting from appellees alleged negligence.the district court determined that mississippi workers compensation law should control the case,interpreting mississippi code as a statutory directive on choice of law.the court then held that mississippi law barred ellis tort suit.
on appeal,we vacated and remanded,rejecting the district court determination 
section is not a statutory directive that takes the place of mississippi ordinary rules,which remain antecedent to application of.therefore,before the district court may consider,it must find that mississippi rules direct it to apply mississippi law.if consideration of those rules directs the district court to alabama law,then is irrelevant 
on remand,the district court conducted a succinct mississippi analysis and again concluded that mississippi law should govern the case 
in the court opinion under the most significant relationship test,mississippi law applies.notably,the accident occurred in mississippi.the negligent conduct which allegedly caused the injury occurred in mississippi.finally,the injured plaintiff appears to have been a mississippi resident 
the court then applied mississippi code,held that mississippi workers compensation statute barred ellis from bringing this tort action against appellees,and granted appellees motion for a summary judgment of dismissal 
ellis then timely filed a notice of appeal.
ii.analysis 
standard of review 
we review a district court determination de novo jurisdiction in this case is based on diversity of citizenship.when sitting in diversity,we apply the rules of the forum,determine which state substantive law should apply 
choice of law 
a substantive conflict exists between the workers compensation schemes of alabama and mississippi.mississippi workers compensation law provides the exclusive remedy of a subcontractor injured employee suits against or the general contractor for damages are generally barred alabama workers compensation law permits a subcontractor injured employee to sue or the general contractor whose negligence causes his injury we must determine which of these states law governs this case.
mississippi test consists of three steps determine whether the laws at issue are substantive or procedural if substantive,
classify the laws as either tort,property,or contract and look to the relevant section of the restatement second of conflict of laws.
the conflicting laws at issue here involve workers compensation and are not therefore do not automatically dictate application of mississippi law as ellis brings tort claims,we apply chapter of the restatement second of conflict of laws.section of the restatement directs that tort actions should be governed by the law of the state with the most significant relationship to the occurrence and the parties and suggests types of contacts that should be considered for such a determination 
contacts to be taken into account to determine the law applicable to an issue include 
a the place where the injury occurred,
b the place where the conduct causing the injury occurred,
c the domicil e,residence,nationality,place of incorporation and place of business of the parties,and 
d the place where the relationship,if any,between the parties is centered.
these contacts are to be evaluated according to their relative importance with respect to the particular issue 
the restatement also instructs that the weighing of these factors should be guided by the seven general considerations set out in 
a the needs of the interstate and international systems,
b the relevant policies of the forum,
c the relevant policies of other interested states and the relative interests of those states in the determination of the particular issue,
d the protection of justified expectations,
e the basic policies underlying the particular field of law,
f certainty,predictability and uniformity of result,and 
g ease in the determination and application of the law to be applied 
the supreme court of mississippi has further explained that t he principles of sections and of the restatement second defy mechanical are less rules of law than guideposts.
here,the first two factors favor mississippi,as both the injury and the allegedly negligent conduct that caused the injury took place on the construction site in mississippi.these factors,however,are not dispositive.the restatement makes clear that for personal injury actions the local law of the state where the injury occurred determines the rights and liabilities of the parties,unless some other state has a more significant relationship under the principles stated in generally,the state where the injury occurred has a interest in awarding relief under its workers compensation law because the state might otherwise be required to care for the injured employee.mississippi does not have that interest here,however,because ellis has already received protection from the state of alabama pursuant to its workers compensation law.
the second two factors favor alabama.even though ellis is a mississippi resident,his relationship with his employer,stevens,was centered in alabama,as were all other relevant business relationships.and,all other parties are alabama corporations or residents.most importantly,stevens took out and maintained alabama wo
