this appeal requires us for the first time to interpret certain provisions of the class action fairness act of cafa,stat.codified in scattered sections of.specifically,after the defendants removed the case from state court to the district court,the plaintiff moved to remand to state court that motion was granted.because we agree that the district court properly placed the burden of proof on the defendants to establish federal subject matter jurisdiction under cafa,and appropriately determined that the defendants failed to prove that the plaintiff claims exceeded cafa amount in controversy requirement of million,we will affirm.
we repeat verbatim the district court recitation of the facts of this case because of its brevity and accuracy

on august,the district court granted the plaintiff motion to remand to state court,concluding that the requisite amount in controversy of million had not been demonstrated.the defendants then timely filed a petition for leave to appeal on august,as well as a motion for a stay of the remand order pending appeal.the district court granted the stay that same day.this court then granted the defendants leave to appeal.see morgan gay,cir.pursuant to c,we have days from october,to decide the appeal.see,miedema maytag,cir braud transp.serv.of illinois,cir.but see patterson dean morris,cir garza,dissenting arguing that the plain language of c mandates that the day time limit begin from when the appeal is filed.

the first issue we address is whether the district court properly placed the burden of proof on the defendants to establish federal subject matter jurisdiction under cafa.the defendants concede that cafa is silent as to which party bears the burden of proof on the amount in controversy.in an attempt to convince this court that the burden to establish the amount in controversy falls upon the plaintiff rather than themselves,the defendants focus on the legislative history of cafa as opposed to the text of the statute.
the defendants are correct that the legislative history indicates that some members of congress probably wished to switch the burden of proof from the party seeking removal to the party seeking remand.the senate judiciary committee report issued ten days after cafa was signed by the president states that i f a purported class action is removed pursuant to these jurisdictional provisions,the named plaintiff s should bear the burden of demonstrating that the removal was improvident,that the applicable jurisdictional requirements are not satisfied,at,reprinted in.see also id.at,at noting that plaintiff should have the burden of demonstrating that all matters in controversy do not in the aggregate exceed the sum or value of,exclusive of interest and costs.further,this senate report states that new section d is intended to expand substantially federal court jurisdiction over class actions.its provisions should be read broadly,with a strong preference that interstate class actions be heard in a federal court if properly removed by any defendant.id.at,at.these passages indicate that at least some members of the senate thought that cafa shifts the burden to the party wishing to litigate in state court and,more generally,close cases should fall under federal jurisdiction.
the defendants reliance on cafa legislative history is misplaced,for at least two reasons.first,the actual text of cafa makes no reference to this legislative history.prior to the passage of cafa,the party seeking to remove a case to federal court bore the burden to establish jurisdiction.see,lujan defenders of wildlife,d the party invoking federal jurisdiction bears the burden of establishing these elements.boyer tools,cir.the text of cafa does not explicitly address whether it shifts this burden to the party seeking to keep the class action in state court.the seventh circuit was the first court of appeals to confront this issue.writing for a unanimous panel,judge easterbrook went so far as to state that none of the statute language is even arguably relevant to the inquiry.brill countrywide home loans,cir.the problem with relying solely on cafa legislative history is that the portion that supports does not concern any text in the bill that eventually became law.
the only section of cafa that might be applicable to this debate is its findings and purposes,which broadly indicates an intent by congress to make federal courts more available to class action litigants however,the findings and purposes say nothing about,and should not be taken by this court as an indication that congress intended to shift a burden.see miedema,at rejecting the findings and purposes for similar reasons.it should take more than a few lines in a senate judiciary committee report and some vague language in a statute findings and purposes section to reverse the proposition that the party seeking removal carries the burden.second,and related,as a general matter this court need not look to legislative history at all when the text of the statute is unambiguous and there is no indication that congress,for example,made a typographical error in drafting this part of the statute.morgan gay,at stating that,where the uncontested intent of congress shows that the statute contains a typographical error,the court duty is to make a common sense revision to the text of the statute.
while several district courts have shifted the burden from the party seeking removal,no appellate court to date has done so.in addition to the aforementioned seventh and eleventh circuits in brill and miedema,respectively,the ninth circuit has also held that the burden remains with the party seeking removal.see abrego abrego v.the dow chem,cir per curiam.we see no reason to create an exception for cafa to the practice in removal actions.accordingly,we join our sister courts of appeals.under cafa,the party seeking to remove the case to federal court bears the burden to establish that the amount in controversy requirement is satisfied.
the second issue we address is whether the district court appropriately determined that the defendants failed to prove that the plaintiff claims exceeded cafa amount in controversy requirement of million 
the standard what the defendants are required to prove 
the supreme court has long held that plaintiffs may limit their claims to avoid federal subject matter
