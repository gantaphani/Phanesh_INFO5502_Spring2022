insurance code section calls for an appraisal process to resolve disputes between the parties to a standard form fire insurance policy over the actual cash value of property loss claims.however,the appraisal panel power is restricted to the factual task of valuing the items of property submitted for appraisal.matters of statutory construction,contract interpretation and policy coverage are not encompassed within the ambit of a section appraisal.
in this action for declaratory and other relief,respondent douglas kirkwood has asserted that appellant california state automobile association bureau csaa is improperly interpreting and applying the amendments to section,which set out the precise method of determining actual cash value of lost or injured property under an open policy of fire insurance.the trial court denied,without prejudice,csaa motion to compel appraisal,reasoning that kirkwood had properly invoked its declaratory relief powers to resolve a matter that was outside the scope of a statutory and contractual appraisal.csaa appeals the order denying its motion to compel appraisal.we conclude the trial court properly denied the motion,and accordingly affirm the order.
background 
legal underpinnings 
in california,the insurance code establishes the terms of standard fire insurance policies.such policies shall be on the standard form.section details the standard provisions.the standard insuring clause calls for coverage to the extent of the actual cash value of the property at the time of loss,but not exceeding the amount which it would cost to repair or replace the property with material of like kind and quality within a reasonable time after the loss,italics added.
in,with the passage of assembly bill introduced as part of the homeowners bill of rights following the wildfires in southern california,section was amended to state exactly how the measure of actual cash value should be determined.see stats,ch.section,subdivision b section b now reads,in part b under an open policy that requires payment of the actual cash value,the measure of the actual cash value recovery,in whole or partial settlement of the claim,shall be determined as follows in case of a partial loss to the structure,or loss to its contents,the amount it would cost the insured to repair,rebuild,or replace the thing lost or injured less a fair and reasonable deduction for physical depreciation based upon its condition at the time of the injury or the policy limit,whichever is less.italics added.
implementing regulations promulgated thereafter now mandate that the insurer itemize,justify and fully explain all adjustments to the amount claimed,including for depreciation,and that depreciation must be attributable to the condition and age of the property when the amount claimed is adjusted because of depreciation,all justification for the adjustment shall be contained in the claim file.any adjustments shall be discernable,measurable,itemized,and specified as to dollar amount,and shall accurately reflect the value of the depreciation any adjustments for depreciation shall reflect a measurable difference in market value attributable to the condition and age of the property and apply only to property normally subject to repair and replacement during the useful life of the property.the basis for any adjustment shall be fully explained to the claimant in writing,tit,subd.f,italics added.
section specifies several additional provisions pertinent to this appeal.the paragraph entitled requirements in case loss occurs requires the insured to give the insurer written notice of loss,and furnish a complete inventory of the destroyed property,showing in detail quantities,costs,actual cash value and amount of loss claimed in the event the insured and insurer disagree as to the actual cash value or amount of loss,the appraisal provision requires the parties to take part in an informal appraisal proceeding unless they mutually agree otherwise,in which each party selects a competent and disinterested appraiser,who in turn selects a competent and disinterested umpire the appraisers selected by the parties are required to appraise the loss,stating separately actual cash value and loss to each item if they fail to agree,they submit their differences to the umpire.and finally,the paragraph denoted suit reads no suit or action on this policy for the recovery of any claim shall be sustainable in any court of law or equity unless all the requirements of this policy shall have been complied with 
factual background 
kirkwood was insured by csaa under a homeowner policy.it was an open policy in which the value of the covered items was not agreed upon,but was left to be determined following a loss.the policy provided that csaa would pay actual cash value or the replacement cost of lost or damaged personal property.in his complaint kirkwood alleged that on august,his home and personal property were destroyed as the result of a fire.he submitted his personal property claim to csaa,setting forth a physical depreciation amount based on the actual condition of each item at the time of the loss.csaa provided kirkwood with a contents inventory summary,which showed that a blanket depreciation schedule was applied to certain categories of property.for instance,many items were depreciated at to percent,and the depreciation was tied to the age of the item without regard to its condition.
kirkwood challenged the settlement offer,in particular what he asserted was excessive depreciation that was nearly triple what he had calculated,and accused csaa of violating section b quoted in pt,ante.csaa responded that it was aware of section,had asked the department of insurance for guidelines on how to determine actual cash value using the language of fair and reasonable deduction for physical depreciation,but indicated the department had no guidelines.csaa stated it did not believe the code changes the language of the contract between an insured and their carrier.
thereafter kirkwood sued csaa for declaratory relief,breach of contract,bad faith,and violation of the unfair competition law ucl.bus.the complaint included kirkwood individual claims as well as class action allegations,all relating to the assertion that csaa use of standardized depreciation schedules to determine depreciation of personal property items ran afoul of california law as well as the parties insurance contract.the declaratory relief cause of action asserted a present controversy as to whether csaa violated section b and various regulations by depreciating personal property through a secret,standardized schedule rather than through an examination of the actual physical condition of the property,and whether csaa was entitled to conceal its method of depreciation from its insureds.kirkwood sought a declaration that defines the rights and obligations under the policy,on behalf of himself and all others similarly situated,and asserted he was entitled to a judicial determination of the parties rights and obligations regarding section.the breach of contract cause of action alleged that csaa breached its obligation under the contracts of insurance with kirkwood and each class member by failing to make a fair and reasonable deduction for physical depreciation based upon the condition of the item,by failing to justify the basis for its depreciation,and by failing to properly pay the actual cash value of the lost property as a result of the excessive depreciation determined by csaa standardized claims handling procedures.
csaa demanded that kirkwood dismiss the lawsuit and proceed with an appraisal.kirkwood rejected the demand for appraisal,responding that the appraisal provision had no effect on his action because the lawsuit presented questions of law and coverage,and appraisers have no authority to resolve such issues.
faced with this rejection,csaa demurred and moved to strike.the court granted and denied in part the motions.csaa also moved to compel an appraisal pursuant to the appraisal clause in the policy which essentially tracked the standard form provision detailed in section.the trial court denied the motion to compel appraisal,without prejudice,so that csaa could raise this issue again after the court resolved the issue of interpretation of section b.
subsequently,kirkwood filed a first amended complaint csaa again demurred and moved to strike the class allegations.the court sustained csaa demurrer to the breach of performance claim on behalf of the class,without leave to amend and the ucl cause of action on behalf of the class,with leave to amend.it denied the motion to strike class allegations to the extent the demurrer rulings did not moot those concerns.
kirkwood submitted a second amended complaint realleging declaratory relief and ucl causes of action on behalf of the class,as well as individual breach of contract and breach of the implied covenant of good faith and fair dealing claims.shortly thereafter this appeal followed.
ii.discussion 
introduction 
csaa is adamant that kirkwood action pivots on its purported failure to pay him the full amount of the actual cash value for his personal property,and therefore the dispute is subject to mandatory appraisal under section.kirkwood insists that the matter hinges on the meaning of section b and csaa obligations thereunder.hence,his efforts to obtain declaratory relief as to the correct interpretation of section b combined with injunctive relief requiring csaa to comply with the statute are proper pursuits at this juncture.
we think the trial court was right in its conclusion that an appraisal was not mandated right now because the declaratory relief cause of action asked the court to make a declaration that csaa was misconstruing section b.denying the motion to compel appraisal without prejudice,the court was clear i do see how the plaintiff gets out of an appraisal later.in other words,given the limited role of an appraisal,the court essentially bifurcated the case,determining that it should first issue a declaration on the statutory issue,and then have it inform the appraisal when it goes forward.in short the court ruled that the agreement to arbitrate did not include the threshold contract and statutory interpretation issues,which were beyond the purview of the appraisers.we agree.
appraisal clause role of appraiser 
an agreement to conduct an appraisal included in a standard fire insurance policy constitutes an agreement within the meaning of code of civil procedure section,subdivision a and thus is considered to be an arbitration agreement subject to the statutory contractual arbitration law.louise gardens of encino homeowners,truck ins.exchange,th.an appraisal pursuant to section is deemed an arbitration as a matter of law.mahnke superior court th,mahnke.code of civil procedure section generally provides that where a party to an arbitration agreement petitions the court with allegations of an agreement to arbitrate a controversy and another party refuses to arbitrate,the court shall order the parties to arbitrate the controversy if it determines that an agreement to arbitrate the controversy exists a party may petition the court to confirm,correct or vacate an appraisal award the court must confirm unless it corrects and confirms as corrected,vacates the award,or dismisses the proceeding.code civ.
once the appraisal provision in an insurance policy is invoked,however,the appraisal process itself is limited.it shall not include any legal proceeding or procedure not specified under california insurance code section.nothing in the regulations is intended to preclude separate legal proceedings on issues unrelated to the appraisal process,tit,subd.e.
and,although an appraisal is a special form of limited arbitration,there are significant differences between the powers of an arbitrator and those of an appraiser.an arbitrator role is closely analogous to that of a judge in a judicial proceeding,empowered to exercise what are essentially judicial functions.in re marriage of assemi cal th.arbitrators are chosen by the parties to serve as judges to decide the matters submitted to them.ibid.thus,subject to the confines of the arbitration agreement,a private contractual arbitrator normally will have the power to decide any question of contract interpretation,historical fact or general law necessary,in the arbitrator understanding of the case,to reach a decision.citations.cable connection,directv,cal th.further,parties to an arbitration may agree to have the same rights to discovery and deposition as apply in civil court.code civ,subd.b.
on the other hand,section calls for an informal appraisal proceeding,unless the parties mutually agree otherwise,with no depositions,interrogatories,and the like,no formal rules of evidence,and no court reporter.the direction to maintain informality in appraisal proceedings was inserted into section in,in response to complaints of insurer abuses after the oakland hills fire of,the northridge earthquake,and the napa earthquake of.mahnke,supra,th at.specifically,it was inserted i n an effort to equalize the positions of insurers and insureds and to streamline the appraisal process by reducing the opportunity for delaying tactics by insurers mahnke,supra,th at stats,ch.
additionally,section constrains the role of the appraiser to that of appraising the loss,stating separately actual cash value and loss to each item appraisers have no power to interpret the insurance contract or the governing statutes.the function of appraisers is to determine the amount of damage resulting to various items submitted for their consideration.it is certainly not their function to resolve questions of coverage and interpret provisions of the policy.jefferson ins.superior court cal d,jefferson kacha allstate ins.th.under section,an appraiser has authority to determine only a question of fact,namely the actual cash value or amount of loss of a given item.jefferson,supra,cal d at.
declaratory relief principles 
code of civil procedure section states any person interested under a written instrument,or under a contract,or who desires a declaration of his or her rights or duties with respect to another may,in cases of actual controversy relating to the legal rights and duties of the respective parties,bring an original action for a declaration of his or her rights and duties in the premises,including a determination of any question of construction or validity arising under the instrument or contract.
declaratory relief operates prospectively,serving to set controversies at rest before obligations are repudiated,rights are invaded or wrongs are committed.thus the remedy is to be used to advance preventive justice,to declare rather than execute rights.baxter healthcare denton th.declaratory relief serves a practical purpose in stabilizing an uncertain or disputed legal relation,thereby defusing doubts which might otherwise lead to subsequent litigation.ibid.the correct interpretation of a statute is a particularly suitable subject for a judicial declaration.in re claudia th.resort to declaratory relief therefore is appropriate to attain judicial clarification of the parties rights and obligations under the applicable law.baxter healthcare denton,supra,th at.
the remedy of declaratory relief is cumulative and does not restrict other remedies.code civ.moreover,the court power to render declaratory relief is discretionary,and it may refuse to exercise the power in any case where its declaration or determination is not necessary or proper at the time under all the circumstances.the mere fact that another remedy is available will not suffice as sufficient grounds for a court to decline a declaration,because declaratory relief is not intended to be exclusive or extraordinary.rather,it is alternative and optional.in re claudia,supra,th at.a court is only justified in refusing a declaration because of the availability of another remedy when it concludes that more effective relief could and should be obtained by another procedure,and for that reason a declaration will not serve a useful purpose.ibid.
csaa asserts that section itself,as well as community assisting recovery,aegis security ins.th,community assisting and several federal district court opinions,dictate reversal in this case.
