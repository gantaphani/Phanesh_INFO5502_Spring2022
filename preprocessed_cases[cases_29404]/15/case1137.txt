background 
this case arose from the application by emerald casino,emerald,to renew its riverboat gambling license and relocate its operations pursuant to section a of the riverboat gambling act ilcs a west.the act,which took effect in,created the board to regulate riverboat gambling throughout illinois,ch,par.a and authorized the board to issue up to riverboat gambling licenses,ch,par.e.four licenses were to be issued for riverboat gambling on the mississippi river,one was to be issued for riverboat gambling on the illinois river south of marshall county,one was to be issued for riverboat gambling on the des plaines river in will county,and locations for the other four licenses were to be determined by the board,ch,par.e.
in,the board issued a license to emerald,then known as,to operate a riverboat casino on the mississippi river in east dubuque,illinois.shortly thereafter,emerald began operating the silver eagle casino.after the initial duration of emerald license elapsed,it renewed the license for one year in and again in.in april,emerald applied for a third renewal,but the board denied its application.emerald and the village of rosemont rosemont,as defendants in this case,maintain that by early,the east dubuque site had become economically infeasible,due in part to strong competition from nearby iowa riverboats.emerald further asserts that it was seeking to move its operations to a new location away from the mississippi river at the time it applied to renew its license in.
after the board denied emerald renewal application,emerald pursued an administrative appeal of the board decision before an administrative law judge alj.in may,the alj affirmed the board denial of emerald application.the alj also denied emerald two motions for reconsideration.
in july,while emerald administrative appeal was pending,emerald stopped operating its riverboat casino.emerald maintains that,during the first two years after its casino became nonoperational,it continued to seek the board approval to move its business to a new location.
in june,while emerald operations lay dormant and before the board could take final action on the alj may order,the general assembly enacted public act.public act added section to the riverboat gambling act,which provides in part that 
a licensee that was not conducting riverboat gambling on january,may apply to the board for renewal and approval of relocation to a new home dock location authorized under section c and the board shall grant the application and approval upon receipt by the licensee of approval from the new municipality or county,as the case may be,in which the licensee wishes to relocate pursuant to section j.ilcs a west.
section j,as amended by public act,authorizes the board to allow a relocation under section a only if the local governing body approves it by majority vote.ilcs j west.
in july,rosemont approved the relocation of emerald home dock to the village of rosemont.shortly thereafter,in september,emerald applied to the board for renewal of its license and relocation of its operations pursuant to section a.the board denied emerald application in january,and in march,it issued emerald a written notice of denial and a disciplinary complaint seeking to revoke emerald license.among other things,the disciplinary complaint alleges emerald failed to follow the board rules regarding disclosures and transfers of ownership.the license revocation proceedings against emerald are ongoing as of the date of this decision.in re disciplinary action of emerald casino.gaming,no.
after the board denied emerald application for renewal and relocation,emerald filed an action in the cook county circuit court seeking declaratory relief and a writ of mandamus ordering the board to approve its application.see emerald casino,illinois gaming board,d.the action was commenced in may.in for summary judgment,emerald and the board,through the attorney general,disputed whether the board had the discretion to deny emerald application when emerald met the criteria of section a.emerald casino,d at.the circuit court granted summary judgment in favor of the board.emerald casino,d at.
on appeal,emerald and rosemont,which was granted permission to intervene in the lawsuit after the circuit court ruled in favor of the board emerald casino,d at,argued that the language of section a is mandatory and therefore required the board to grant emerald application emerald casino,d at.the appellate court reversed the circuit court grant of summary judgment.it held the legislature intended shall to be mandatory when it enacted section a.emerald casino,d at.the court reasoned,in part,that a mandatory construction of the statute is consistent with the act stated purpose of assisting economic development and promoting tourism,because by requiring the board to approve emerald application for renewal and relocation,the legislature ensured that emerald license would be put back to use.see emerald casino,d at.furthermore,the court concluded that even though a mandatory reading of shall creates an exception to the license renewal requirements of the riverboat gambling act ilcs west,the plain language of section indicates the legislature intent to create such an exception.see emerald casino,d at.the board in emerald casino filed a petition for leave to appeal,which was denied.emerald casino,illinois gaming board,table.
in may,while the emerald casino action was still pending,illinois citizen and taxpayer philip crusius filed the lawsuit that is the subject of this appeal in the cook county circuit court on behalf of all illinois taxpayers and the state of illinois.the board,its individual board members,the state comptroller,and the state treasurer were named as defendants.crusius sought a declaratory judgment that section a violates the illinois constitution special legislation clause he also sought to enjoin the expenditure of any state funds or the transfer of any state property in the administration of public act,which contains section a.
crusius filed a motion for summary judgment on the special legislation issue ilcs west.the board,through the attorney general,filed a combined motion to dismiss ilcs west,arguing that crusius lacked standing to file suit ilcs west and that he failed to state a cause of action ilcs west.subsequently,the circuit court granted rosemont leave to intervene as a defendant ilcs west,and it too filed a combined motion to dismiss.in an oral ruling,the circuit court found that crusius had standing to bring the action,but that section a is constitutional.accordingly,it dismissed crusius complaint with prejudice for failure to state a cause of action.
the appellate court affirmed.d.initially,it upheld the circuit court decision on standing d at,which is not at issue in this appeal.the court also held that section a does not constitute special legislation.d at.the statute,the court noted,permits the only nonoperational riverboat gambling licensee in the state to request relocation to an economically viable site.d at.prior to the enactment of section a,the riverboat gambling act stated purpose of assisting economic development and promoting tourism was frustrated,because a licensee operating at a site that was economically nonviable had no means of relocating to a site where it could generate economic benefits for the state.d at.in light of these considerations,the court concluded that the distinction the legislature drew in section a between a licensee at a nonviable location and licensees at viable locations is not arbitrarily narrow and does not benefit a particular group without a reasonable basis.d at.
we granted crusius leave to appeal pursuant to supreme court rule.afterward,we allowed emerald and the official committee of unsecured creditors of emerald casino,committee to intervene in the lawsuit as appellees.we also allowed the state defendants,through the attorney general,to realign with crusius as appellants.

section of article iv of the illinois constitution provides 
the general assembly shall pass no special or local law when a general law is or can be made applicable.whether a general law is or can be made applicable shall be a matter for judicial determination.const,art.iv.
the special legislation clause prohibits the general assembly from conferring a special benefit or privilege upon one person or group and excluding others that are similarly situated.allen woodfield chevrolet,citing best taylor machine works.while the legislature has broad discretion to make statutory classifications,the special legislation clause prevents it from making classifications that arbitrarily discriminate in favor of a select group.in re estate of jolliff.our inquiry into special legislation issues is thus twofold.we must determine whether the statutory classification at issue discriminates in favor of a select group and,if so,whether the classification is arbitrary.allen,at,citing jolliff,at.
a special legislation challenge is generally judged under the same standards applicable to an equal protection challenge.miller rosenberg.where,as here,the statute under consideration does not affect a fundamental right or involve a suspect classification,we review it under the deferential rational basis test.allen,at,jolliff,at.under this test,the statute is constitutional if the classification it establishes is rationally related to a legitimate state interest.allen,at,jolliff,at.if this court can reasonably conceive of any set of facts that justifies distinguishing the class the statute benefits from the class outside its scope,it will uphold the statute.jolliff,at,miller,at.
it is clear section a discriminates in favor of a select group.the statute distinguishes between licensees that were not conducting riverboat gambling on january,ilcs a west and those that were,and it confers a benefit on the former that is unavailable to the latter.the specific nature of this benefit was at issue in emerald casino,where the appellate court held that section a is mandatory,not permissive,and therefore requires the board to grant an application for renewal and relocation submitted pursuant to the statute.see emerald casino,d at.for purposes of this appeal,the parties have accepted the emerald casino court interpretation of section a.it is not at issue before this court.
just as it is clear section a discriminates in favor of a select group,it is clear emerald is the only riverboat gambling licensee that falls within that group.of the current licensees,only emerald qualifies under section a as a licensee that was not conducting riverboat gambling on january,ilcs a west.by that date,emerald had ceased operating its riverboat casino at the east dubuque site.
the main point of contention in this case is whether the classification section a establishes is rationally related to a legitimate state interest.as plaintiffs briefs clarify,they do not argue that the fact only emerald benefits from section a renders the statute irrational.rather,the gravamen of their argument is that section a undermines the riverboat gambling act goal of maintaining public confidence in the riverboat gambling industry and its regulation.see ilcs b west.specifically,plaintiffs note the board has expressed its concern with emerald suitability as a licensee by denying its application for license renewal on two occasions and by initiating license revocation proceedings against it.yet,despite the board statutory obligation to regulate emerald licensing ilcs g west,its reservations about emerald suitability as a licensee,and the act limitations on suitable riverboat gambling locations ilcs e west,section a requires the board to allow emerald to renew its license and relocate its gambling operations.
in response,defendants argue that section a furthers the riverboat gambling act goals of assisting economic development,promoting tourism,and generating revenue for education.see ilcs a west.emerald,they point out,was the only licensee whose operations were dormant when the general assembly enacted section a.therefore,it was rational for the general assembly to allow emerald to renew its license and establish gambling operations at a different,more lucrative site,where it might again generate economic benefits for the state.
we agree with defendants that section a is rationally related to the riverboat gambling act economic goals.section a of the act now states 
this act is intended to benefit the people of the state of illinois by assisting economic development and promoting illinois tourism and by increasing the amount of revenues available to the state to assist and support education.ilcs a west.
the general assembly thus intended that the act achieve the economic goals of assisting development,promoting tourism,and generating revenue for education.
at the time section a was enacted,emerald was the only riverboat gambling licensee in the state whose operations were dormant.it was rational for the legislature to conclude that recommencing emerald operations would promote the economic goals of the riverboat gambling act.likewise,it was rational for the legislature to focus its attention solely on emerald,as emerald was the only nonoperational licensee.
in addition,the specific means the legislature chose to revive emerald gambling operations possess a rational basis.section a allows emerald to have its license renewed and to relocate its operations to a different site.prior to the enactment of section a,the riverboat gambling act contained no provision enabling a licensee having financial difficulties to relocate its operations.see ilcs et west.the legislature could rationally have determined that emerald business would fare better if emerald were given the opportunity to operate somewhere other than the east dubuque site,which had proved to be economically unviable,due in part,perhaps,to competition from nearby iowa riverboats.having made such a determination,and recognizing emerald license had not been renewed in,the legislature could rationally have concluded that emerald automatic and immediate relicensure would best ensure its prompt relocation.
plaintiffs assert,however,that the riverboat gambling act economic goals and its regulatory goal are inextricably linked,and that the former can not be achieved at the expense of the latter,which,as mentioned,they maintain is undermined by section a circumvention of the board regulatory authority.in support of this contention,plaintiffs point to the language of section b of the riverboat gambling act stating that riverboat gambling will enhance investment,development,and tourism in illinois successfully only if public confidence is maintained in the riverboat gambling industry and its regulation ilcs b west.plaintiffs misconstrue section b.
the best evidence of legislative intent is the language of the statute,and that language must be given its plain and ordinary meaning.king first capital financial services.section b of the act,which immediately follows the act statement of its economic goals,provides 
while authorization of riverboat gambling will enhance investment,development and tourism in illinois,it is recognized that it will do so successfully only if public confidence and trust in the credibility and integri
