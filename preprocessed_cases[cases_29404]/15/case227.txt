opinion of the court 
the truth in lending act,et,imposes disclosure requirements on creditors,exposing them to such penalties as money damages,attorney fees and rescission for failure to disclose finance charges accurately.see a g a.however,in,in an effort to prevent creditors from being subject to extraordinary liability for small disclosure discrepancies,congress amended the act to include a tolerances for accuracy provision.cong.rec.daily ed,statement of leach.under that provision,a creditor is not liable for undisclosed finance charges if those charges fall within a specified range of error.f.we decide whether a truth in lending act defendant who does not specifically defend on the ground that any inaccuracies in its disclosure fell within the tolerance range waives the protection that provision provides.in procedural parlance,we decide whether a tolerances for accuracy defense is affirmative requiring that it be pled specifically or general thus not requiring that it be pled specifically.
we hold that the defense is general,and that a defendant need not specifically raise the act tolerances provision in order to avoid liability for disclosure errors that fall within its range.we thus affirm the ruling of the district court.
facts and procedural history 
in february,gaye sterten secured a loan in the amount of from option one mortgage corporation.the purpose of the loan was to refinance the second mortgage on her home and to consolidate her medical and credit card bills.sterten obtained the loan through a mortgage broker,main line capital,working with one of main line owners,thomas girone.girone was also the president of the title insurance agency used in the transaction,village land transfer.the closing for the loan took place at sterten home with only sterten and girone present.girone helped sterten execute an adjustable rate note in favor of option one and a mortgage granting option one a lien on her real property to secure the loan.sterten signed,among other documents,a settlement statement,the mortgage,a truth in lending disclosure statement,and a mandatory notice of right to cancel.
nearly two years later,sterten sent a letter to option one contending that the closing of the loan had not been done in accordance with the requirements of the truth in lending act and requesting a rescission of the loan.on march,after option one had disputed her right to rescind,sterten filed a chapter bankruptcy petition in the bankruptcy court for the eastern district of pennsylvania.option one then filed a proof of claim.in response,sterten filed an adversary proceeding in her bankruptcy case,seeking rescission of the loan along with various statutory penalties sterten alleged two specific truth in lending act violations that she was never provided with either her truth in lending disclosure statement or her notice of right to cancel form and that the finance charges were not accurately disclosed.option one denied both allegations,maintaining specifically with respect to its disclosure of the finance charges that it acted at all times relevant hereto in full compliance with all applicable laws acts.option one answer.
a trial was held,at which both sterten and girone testified.the bankruptcy court found girone more credible than sterten on whether she had received the required forms and ruled in option one favor on that claim.with respect to the adequacy of option one disclosure,the parties agreed that ten specific fees and charges listed on the settlement statement,totaling roughly,had not been included as part of the finance charge disclosed in the truth in lending disclosure statement.the court examined each fee and concluded that only two of mark up in the appraisal fee and charged for notary as finance charges under the truth in lending act the court then sua sponte applied the act tolerances for accuracy provision,f,concluding that,because the in nondisclosed finance charges were within the tolerance range,the disclosure was accurate as a matter of law.it thus entered judgment in favor of option one on both the rescission and the damages claims.
sterten then filed a motion to alter or amend the bankruptcy court order.she argued that the court should not have applied the act tolerances for accuracy provision because option one had failed to raise it as an affirmative defense and had therefore waived it on january,the bankruptcy court granted sterten motion,concluding that f is an affirmative defense and that,because option one failed to raise f in its pleadings,at trial,or at any other point in th e proceeding,it waived the defense.sterten option one mortgage in re sterten,at.the court declared rescission and awarded sterten in statutory damages along with reasonable attorney fees.id.at.
option one then appealed to the district court on march,the district court reversed the bankruptcy court amended judgment,holding that b ecause the tolerances for accuracy provision is not an affirmative defense,the bankruptcy court original verdict in favor of option one was correct and should not have been disturbed.sterten option one mortgage in re sterten,d.it therefore ordered the bankruptcy court initial judgment restored.id.sterten timely appealed.

iii.analysis 
the truth in lending act tolerances provision reads in pertinent part as follows 
f tolerances for accuracy 
in connection with credit transactions not under an open end credit plan that are secured by real property or a dwelling,the disclosure of the finance charge and other disclosures affected by any finance charge 
shall be treated as being accurate for purposes of a claim for damages if the amount disclosed as the finance charge 
a does not vary from the actual finance charge by more than and 
shall be treated as being accurate for purposes of a claim for recission if 
a the amount disclosed as the finance charge does not vary from the actual finance charge by more than an amount equal to of one percent of the total amount of credit extended 
neither party disputes that the in undisclosed finance charges falls within the tolerance range for both sterten damages claim and her claim for rescission what sterten disputes is whether option one was in a position to take advantage of the protection f provides.sterten makes two specific arguments on that point.first,she argues that the truth in lending act tolerances for accuracy provision sets out an affirmative defense that option one waived by not pleading it in the initial stages of the litigation second,she argues that,even if option one was not required to raise the tolerances provision as an affirmative defense,its failure to raise the defense in any fashion at any point in the litigation amounted to a waiver.
is the tolerances for accuracy provision an affirmative defense 
federal rule of civil procedure b allows a party to contest the particulars of a complaint simply by issuing a general denial in a responsive pleading.see charles allen wright arthur miller,federal practice procedure ed,at wright miller no prescribed set of words need be employed in framing the general denial any statement making it clear that the defendant intends to put in issue all of the averments in the opposing party pleading is sufficient.that is what option one did when it asserted in its answer that,with respect to its disclosures,it acted at all times relevant hereto in full compliance with all applicable laws acts.rule c governs affirmative defenses,which are generally waived if not specifically raised by responsive pleading or by appropriate motion.elliot frantz,cir.at the time of these proceedings,rule c stated in pertinent part that i n pleading to a preceding pleading,a party shall set forth affirmatively several listed defenses and any other matter constituting an avoidance or affirmative defense.c emphasis added.the question we face is whether the truth in lending act tolerance for error is invoked by a rule b general denial,or whether it falls within rule c any other matter provision and therefore requires affirmative pleading.
rule c itself provides little guidance for determining which defenses,other than those specifically set out,fall within its ambit.our court has yet to endorse any particular approach to making that determination 
many courts in addressing this issue have focused on the relationship between the defense in question and the plaintiff primary case.thus,for instance,the court of appeals for the fifth circuit has stated that pertinent to the analysis of whether a defense is an affirmative defense is the logical relationship between the defense and the cause of action asserted by the plaintiff.ingraham united states,cir.the ingraham court also explained that this inquiry requires among other things a determination whether the matter at issue fairly may be said to constitute a necessary or extrinsic element in the plaintiff cause of action.id.the court of appeals for the first circuit has held that the test for whether a given defense falls within the rule c residuary clause is whether the defense shares the common characteristic of a bar to the right of recovery even if the general complaint were more or less admitted to.wolf,at citation and internal quotation marks omitted.
as a theoretical matter,this focus on whether a defense raises factual or legal issues other than those put in play by the plaintiff cause of action nicely tracks the distinction between a general denial and an affirmative defense.when we are asking whether a particular defense is an affirmative defense,what we are really asking is whether that defense is adequately asserted merely by denying the allegations made in the complaint,or whether more is required.to answer that question,we need to determine whether the defense notes issues not raised,even by implication,in the complaint.
in practice,however,focusing solely on the relationship between the defense and the plaintiff cause of action is of limited use where,as here,what is at issue is precisely the nature of that relationship.see wright miller ed,at noting that this mode of analysis has a certain tautological quality to it because all it suggests is that matters that are not part of the plaintiff substantive case are to be pleaded,in a sense,determining what matters are part of the plaintiff case is the very thing to be ascertained by deciding whether a certain issue is or is not an affirmative defense.option one argument is that the tolerances provision defines what counts,for legal purposes,as an accurate truth in lending act disclosure,and thus sterten invoked the provision when she alleged that option one disclosures were inaccurate.see option one br.t he debtor claim fails once the court applies the very statutory scheme that creates the claim in the first place,not because the lender has introduced any extrinsic facts or countervailing principles of law.emphasis in original.sterten argument,on the other hand,is that the tolerances provision sets out a statutory exception to liability that a defendant must demonstrate applies to the undisclosed finance charges.see sterten reply br.i t is not true that a borrower can not prevail if the finance charge is less than of one percent of the finance charge.the lender is obliged to show something more,that the tolerance applies to the charges at issue.
it is helpful to look instead at what rule c is intended to avoid.as we have explained in a different context,t he purpose of requiring the defendant to plead available affirmative defenses in his answer is to avoid surprise and undue prejudice by providing the plaintiff with notice and the opportunity to demonstrate why the affirmative defense should not succeed.robinson johnson,cir see also ingraham,at central to requiring the pleading of affirmative defenses is the prevention of unfair surprise.a defendant should not be permitted to lie behind a log and ambush a plaintiff with an unexpected defense.as a practical matter,that is the proper focus of our,given what sterten was already required to show,option one failure to raise the tolerance issue specifically deprived her of an opportunity to rebut that defense or to alter her litigation strategy accordingly.
we see no reason to think that sterten suffered any unfair surprise as a consequence of option one failure to plead specifically the tolerances for accuracy defense.the analysis a plaintiff must undertake to show any undisclosed finance charges under the truth in lending there were discrepancies between what was charged and what was disclosed in the truth in lending disclosure statement,and that those undisclosed fees fall within the act definition of a finance charge is the same analysis required to show that the undisclosed charges exceeded f range of error.as the district court aptly noted,in her complaint,sterten alleged all disclosure violations she believed were attributable to option one sterten does not,and can not,argue that had she been aware earlier that f was implicated,she would have alleged more substantial violations sterten,d at.thus it is hard to see how option one failure to invoke the tolerances provision disadvantaged sterten in any way.
sterten nonetheless contends that there was unfair surprise in her case,arguing that the tolerance defense is not a mechanical process which would be applied and churn out a result in exactly the same manner whether it were raised by a party defendant prior to trial or not raised until after trial.sterten br.she makes two specific arguments in support of this claim,neither of which persuades us.
first,sterten notes that,while the tolerance range when a creditor seeks rescission is normally of one percent of the total amount of credit extended,f a,it shrinks to when foreclosure proceedings have been filed,i.therefore,she contends,the application of the tolerance defense depends on facts outside the debtor primary,whether foreclosure has begun.sterten br.while this claim is undeniably true,it is hard to see how it presents an unfair surprise problem.whether foreclosure proceedings have,in fact,begun is something a truth in lending act plaintiff is in a position to know.there is thus no reason why a plaintiff under the act would be surprised or burdened by the application of one range of tolerance rather than another.that the amount of error tolerated varies if foreclosure proceedings have begun is not,then,enough to place the pleading burden on the defendant.see gomez toledo,d explaining that placing the pleading burden on the defendant is appropriate where a defense hinges on facts peculiarly within the knowledge and control of the defendant.
second,sterten argues that,had she known that tolerance of the finance charges was at issue,she may have well undertaken to prove or argue that these charges were institutional rather than attributable to mere mathematical error.sterten br.emphasis in original.but there is nothing to suggest that applying the tolerances provision turns on the motives of the creditor.the sole support sterten provides for that proposition is one reference in case law to a statement by paul sarbanes offered in support of adding the tolerances provision to the act.id.citing inge rock fin,cir.inge quotes senator sarbenes as saying that t his increased tolerance
