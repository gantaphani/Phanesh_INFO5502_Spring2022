opinion of the court 
this truth in lending act case concerns a credit card solicitation that fleet bank,and fleet credit card services,collectively fleet sent to appellant,denise roberts,encouraging her to open an account with fleet based on a promise of a fixed annual percentage rate apr.the solicitation stated that the interest rate was not an introductory rate and that i t wo go up in just a few short months.the solicitation also stated that w ith an extraordinary fixed apr the fleet titanium mastercard goes beyond all expectations.sometime after roberts opened her fleet account,the bank sent her a letter stating that it was increasing the fixed apr to.roberts brought this class action claiming that fleet violated the federal truth in lending act tila,et,when it failed to clearly and conspicuously disclose that the apr that it was offering was limited in duration and subject to its asserted contractual right to change the interest rate at any time.the district court granted summary judgment to fleet,concluding that the materials fleet sent to roberts allowed it to change the rate.
we agree with roberts that fleet solicitation materials could cause a reasonable consumer to be confused about the temporal quality of the offer.we therefore believe that a material question of fact exists as to whether the bank made any misleading statements in the mailings to roberts and failed to disclose information required under the tila clearly and conspicuously.accordingly,we reverse the entry of summary judgment and remand for further proceedings.
background 
in may,roberts received a packet of solicitation materials from fleet urging her to apply for its new titanium mastercard.the packet included an introductory flyer,a solicitation letter,a invitation,and an initial disclosure statement ids.the introductory flyer indicated that the card would have a fixed apr on both purchases and balance transfers.under the heading financial advantages,the flyer again stated that the fixed apr was.
in addition to the flyer,the solicitation letter emphasized that the card would carry a fixed the letter further stated that the exceptionally low would apply not only to any purchases made with the card but also to any balance transfers from existing credit card accounts to the titanium account.the letter twice claimed that the fixed apr was not an introductory rate,and promised that i t wo go up in just a few short months.
in order to obtain the titanium mastercard,the recipient was required to complete the invitation form.the front side of the invitation indicated that the credit card carried a fixed apr on purchases and balance transfers.on the back of the invitation fleet listed the terms of offer and the consumer information sections.the first two sentences of the terms of offer stated the following 
i request a fleet titanium mastercard account upon acceptance of my request by fleet bank ri,national association in rhode island.i agree to the terms of the cardholder agreement mailed with my card,including those which provide that the cardholder agreement and may account will be governed by rhode island and federal law and that my agreement terms including rates are subject to change.
the consumer information section contained the schumer box,the table of basic credit card information required under the tila,et,as amended by the fair credit and charge card disclosure act of the schumer box contained a column with the heading annual percentage rate apr for purchases and balance transfers.the box beneath that heading indicated apr was the applicable rate.inside the schumer box,fleet listed two specific circumstances under which that rate could change if the prospective cardholder failed to meet any repayment requirements or upon closure of the account.fleet listed no other circumstances under which the apr could be changed.
the ids instructed the applicant to p lease read this together with the terms of offer and the consumer information enclosed.under the heading rate information,the ids indicated that the apr for the fleet titanium card would be for any purchases or balance transfers.like the schumer box,the ids noted two specific circumstances under which fleet could change the fixed rate failure of the prospective cardholder to meet any repayment requirements or closure of the account.fleet included no other circumstances in the ids under which it could change the.
roberts completed and returned the invitation to fleet.in june,she received her fleet titanium mastercard,along with the cardholder agreement.section of the agreement,titled annual percentage rate,indicated that the apr would be.in this section fleet also reiterated that it reserved the right to change the rate under the circumstances described above.however,in section of the cardholder agreement,titled change in terms,fleet stated that 
we have the right to change any of the terms of this agreement at any time.you will be given notice of a change as required by applicable law.any change in terms governs your account as of the effective date,and will,as permitted by law and at our option,apply both to transactions made on or after such date and to any outstanding account balance.
fleet later sent roberts a letter notifying her that fleet would be increasing the apr on the titanium mastercard.in july,thirteen months after roberts had received her card,fleet increased the fixed rate apr to.
procedural 
on december,roberts filed this class action,asserting a claim pursuant to the tila and claims under rhode island law for violation of the unfair trade practices and consumer protection act,laws et,breach of contract,and unjust enrichment.fleet moved to dismiss the tila claim on february,submitting as exhibits to the motion documents that fleet asserted the district court could consider as incorporated into the complaint.on june,the district court,stating that s ince all parties rely on matters outside the pleadings,the motion will be treated as a motion for partial summary judgment under fed.civ,granted fleet motion based on its conclusion that fleet had not violated the disclosure requirements of the tila.roberts fleet bank,wl,at.june.the district court added that roberts was at liberty to pursue the remaining counts of her complaint.id.

iii.discussion 
a.the truth in lending act 
congress enacted the tila in.the stated purpose of the tila is to assure a meaningful disclosure of credit terms so that the consumer will be able to compare more readily the various credit terms available to him and avoid the uninformed use of credit,and to protect the consumer against inaccurate and unfair credit billing and credit card practices.a.in,concerned that consumers were still not receiving accurate information about the potential costs of credit cards,congress strengthened the tila protections for credit card consumers through enactment of the fair credit and charge card disclosure act,a bill to provide for more detailed and uniform disclosure by credit and charge card issuers,at the time of application or solicitation,of information relating to interest rates and other costs which may be incurred by consumers through the use of any credit or charge card,at,reprinted in.
in particular,congress determined that consumers were being inundated with credit card solicitations that failed to disclose basic cost information about the cards being promoted.prior to the passage of the fair credit and charge card disclosure act,the tila did not require issuers to provide such information until the consumer actually received the card.congress decided that demanding early disclosure of relevant cost information from credit card companies would enable consumers to shop around for the best cards.see,at,reprinted in.
congress delegated the responsibility of prescrib ing regulations to carry out the purposes of the tila to the federal reserve board.a.in response to this mandate,the board promulgated regulation z,and it also published a comprehensive official staff interpretation,pt.supp.both of these measures were published in accordance with the broad powers that congress delegated to the board to fill gaps in the statute.ortiz rental management,cir.in light of congress explicit delegation of authority,we defer quite broadly to the board interpretation.see ford motor credit milhollin,d noting that because tila is a complicated act,such deference is necessary.see generally chevron,natural res.def.council,et,d.
the tila requires a credit card provider to disclose certain information in direct mail applications and solicitations,including annual percentage rates.c a i.the board regulations also require a credit card issuer to disclose the applicable annual percentage rate.a b requiring disclosure of e ach periodic rate that may be used to compute the finance charge on an outstanding balance for purchases expressed as an annual percentage rate.the tila requires that information described in c a,such as annual percentage rates,must be clearly and conspicuously disclosed in a tabular format.a and c.likewise,the board regulations mandate that disclosures required under a b through be provided in a prominent location on or with an application or a solicitation,or other applicable document,and in the form of a table with headings,content,and format substantially similar to any of the applicable tables found in appendix a a.the board regulations also dictate that a creditor shall make the disclosures required by this subpart clearly and conspicuously in writing.a.hence,both the tila and regulations require a credit card issuer to disclose the applicable annual percentage rate clearly and conspicuously in a table,commonly referred to as the schumer box.
schumer box 
roberts asserts that fleet failed to clearly and conspicuously inform consumers that the apr was subject to change at any time.the ids and the schumer box included in fleet solicitation materials stated only two conditions under which fleet could raise roberts apr failure of the cardholder to meet any repayment requirement or upon closure of the account.roberts argues that,because a reasonable consumer could read this list as exhaustive and conclude that the apr could be raised only under those two described circumstances,this disclosure was neither clear nor conspicuous.
because the purpose of the tila is to assure meaningful disclosures,the issuer must not only disclose the required terms,it must do so accurately.rossman fleet bank ass n,cir.the accuracy demanded excludes not only literal falsities,but also misleading statements.id.citing gennuso commercial bank trust,cir.as the tila is a remedial consumer protection statute,we have held it should be construed liberally in favor of the consumer.rossman,at quoting ramadan chase manhattan,cir.see also begala pnc bank,ohio,cir we have repeatedly stated that tila is a remedial statute and,therefore,should be given a broad,liberal construction in favor of the consumer.fairley,cir the tila is to be enforced strictly against creditors and construed liberally in favor of consumers.
construing the tila strictly against the creditor and liberally in favor of the consumer,as we must,we believe that the tila disclosures in this case,read in conjunction with the solicitation materials,present a material issue of fact as to whether fleet clearly and conspicuously disclosed its right to change the.we therefore conclude that the district court erred in granting summary judgment to fleet on roberts tila claim.
in the schumer box,fleet stated that the apr could change in the event of nonpayment or closure of the account.fleet listed no other conditions under which the apr could change.we believe that it would be just as reasonable,if not more reasonable,for a consumer to conclude from the information contained in the schumer box that the apr could be changed only under the two listed circumstances as it would be for a consumer to conclude that fleet could change the apr at any time.roberts has raised a genuine issue of material fact as to the adequacy of fleet disclosures and should have been permitted to proceed to trial on the matter.
fleet argues that it adequately disclosed the necessary information in the schumer box and that the board regulations prevent it from including a change in terms provision in the schumer box.we rejected a similar argument in rossman.the dispute in rossman arose from solicitation materials fleet sent to potential customers indicating that its platinum mastercard carried no annual fee.at.despite the fact that fleet indicated in the schumer box that it would not charge an annual fee,fleet instituted an annual fee within the first year of rossman receipt of the credit card.see id.at.fleet argued to the court that a clear and conspicuous statement of its authority to change the annual fee at any time was unnecessary because the provision of the agreement is not among the terms that must be disclosed in tabular format under the tila.see id.at.in rejecting this argument,the court stated that the issue was not fleet obligation to disclose the provision,but its obligation to disclose annual fees.id.
similarly,in this case,the issue is not fleet obligation to disclose the provision,but its obligation to disclose the.our inquiry focuses on whether fleet disclosures in the schumer box provided an accurate representation of the legal obligation of the parties when the relevant solicitation was mailed.id.at.as we explained above,we believe roberts raised a question of material fact as to whether fleet clearly and conspicuously provided an accurate representation of the.
solicitation materials 
roberts claims that fleet representations in the solicitation letter that the apr would be an extraordinary,low fixed apr of and that the rate was neither introductory,nor would it rise in just a few short months further support her position that fleet failed to comply with the tila.before addressing this argument,we must first decide whether the tila permits a court to analyze the solicitation materials,in addition to the information contained in the schumer box,in determining whether a reasonable consumer would comprehend the required disclosures.
fleet does not specifically argue that we are not permitted to consider information outside of the schumer box in determining whether a credit card company has complied with the requirements of tila.fleet does argue,however,that the clear and conspicuous standard only applies to required disclosures in the initial disclosure statement and the schumer box.while we agree with the premise of this argument,we reject its broader implications when congress decided to require credit card issuers to disclose required terms in a clear and conspicuous manner,we doubt that it intended for us to ignore other statements made by those issuers in their credit card solicitation materials.because t he purpose of the tila is to assure meaningful disclosures,we have recognized that t he accuracy demanded excludes not only literal
