this case presents the question of whether the notice requirements of the truth in lending act tila,and regulation z,as interpreted by the federal reserve board official staff commentary,apply to discretionary interest rate increases that occur because of consumer default.we hold that regulation z requires a creditor to provide contemporaneous notice of such rate increases.
factual and procedural background 
james mccoy mccoy brought this action on behalf of himself and others similarly situated against chase manhattan bank,usa,chase,a national bank located in delaware.mccoy alleges that chase increased his interest rates retroactively to the beginning of his payment cycle after his account was closed to new transactions as a result of a late payment to chase or another creditor.mccoy claims that the rate increase violated tila and delaware law because chase gave no notice of the increase until the following periodic statement,after it had already taken effect.the district court dismissed mccoy complaint with prejudice,holding that because chase discloses the highest rate that could apply due to mccoy default in its cardmember agreement with mccoy cardmember agreement,no notice was required.

discussion 
federal tila claim 
congress enacted tila to assure a meaningful disclosure of credit terms so that the consumer will be able to compare more readily the various credit terms available to him and avoid the uninformed use of credit,and to protect the consumer against inaccurate and unfair credit billing and credit card practices.a.regulation z,adopted by the federal reserve board to implement tila,addresses when and how notice of changes in terms must be given 
written notice required.whenever any term required to be disclosed under is changed or the required minimum periodic payment is increased,the creditor shall mail or deliver written notice of the change to each consumer who may be affected.the notice shall be mailed or delivered at least days prior to the effective date of the change.the timing requirement does not apply if the change has been agreed to by the consumer,or if a periodic rate or other finance charge is increased because of the consumer delinquency or default the notice shall be given,however,before the effective date of the change.
c.section requires that a creditor disclose inter alia each periodic rate that may be used to compute the finance charge.a.
the parties dispute the meaning of the phrase any term required to be disclosed under.chase argues that the phrase applies only to the contractual terms of chase agreement.mccoy suggests the phrase also applies to the list of specific items a requires be disclosed,which includes the interest rate that may be used.
although we find mccoy interpretation more natural,we acknowledge that the text of regulation z is ambiguous.
we defer to an agency interpretation of its own ambiguous regulation provided it is not plainly erroneous or inconsistent with the regulation.auer robbins,d citing robertson methow valley citizens council,d.we do not permit the agency,under the guise of interpreting a regulation,to create de facto a new regulation.christensen harris county,d.
chase argues that the federal reserve board frb official staff commentary interprets regulation z to require no notice in this case.we disagree.
comment is the most salient official staff commentary to c and,when describing the amount of notice required for different kinds of changes,provides that a notice of change in terms is required,but may be mailed or delivered as late as the effective date of the change i f there is an increased periodic rate or any other finance charge attributable to the consumer delinquency or default.c,cmt.the of comment is to require notice when a cardholder interest rates increase because of a default,but to specify that the notice may be contemporaneous,rather than fifteen days in advance of the change.under comment,mccoy has stated a claim.
chase argues that because comment repeats language from regulation z,a different portion of the official staff commentary,comment,should govern instead.comment specific reference to interest rate increases attributable to the consumer delinquency or default is directly on point and therefore governs.even if we decided that comment,despite preceding comment,could somehow be interpreted as an exception to it,we would still hold that comment does not dispel chase obligation to notify its account holders of discretionary rate increases.
comment to c describes the circumstances in which regulation z requires no notice of a change in terms 
changes initially disclosed.no notice of a change in terms need be given if the specific change is set forth initially,such as rate increases under a properly disclosed plan,a rate increase that occurs when an employee has been under a preferential rate agreement and terminates employment,or an increase that occurs when the consumer has been under an agreement to maintain a certain balance in a savings account in order to keep a particular rate and the account balance falls below the specified minimum.in contrast,notice must be given if the contract allows the creditor to increase the rate at its discretion but does not include specific terms for an increase for example,when an increase may occur under the creditor contract reservation right to increase the periodic rate.
c,cmt.emphasis added.
the effect of comment,assuming arguendo it applies,depends on how the phrase specific is defined.mccoy argues that the specific change is set forth initially and the specific terms for an increase are included in a contract when the contract gives consumers the information they need in order to know what interest rate they will be charged and under what conditions.chase argues that any agreement that specifies the possibility of an interest rate increase if the cardholder defaults and establishes any boundaries on the potential amount of the increase adequately sets forth a specific change.
mccoy reading of comment use of the word specific is reinforced by the three examples comment includes of rate increases for which notice is not required.the first example is rate increases under a properly disclosed plan.id.variable rate plans specify that the interest rate will fluctuate in direct correspondence with an externally determined variable rate such as,for example,the federal prime rate.providing additional notice of the interest rate charged under a variable rate plan would be redundant because variations in the interest rate are not discretionary,and the method for computing the interest rate based on the federal prime rate is fully specified in advance.creditors in that circumstance need not provide additional notice because consumers can predict their precise interest rate according to a formula.
the second example in comment is a rate increase that occurs when an employee has been under a preferential rate agreement and terminates employment.id.again,the notice of such a rate increase would be redundant because it occurs whenever the employee terminates employment.nothing suggests the creditor possesses any discretion over whether to increase the rates or by how much to do so once the event triggering a higher rate occurs.
the third example is an increase that occurs when the consumer has been under an agreement to maintain a certain balance in a savings account in order to keep a particular rate and the account balance falls below the specified minimum.id.again,the use of the word occurs rather than the phrase may occur suggests that additional notice would be redundant because the increase is all three examples pertain to rate increases that are spelled out in cardmember agreements and ascertainable by the consumer without additional notice.
in contrast to these examples,the increase here occurs at chase discretion and the most pertinent specific terms for an increase the actual amount of the increase and whether it will not disclosed in advance.the cardmember agreement states that chase may change mccoy interest rate and impose a rate up to the maximum rate described in the pricing schedule.the agreement further states that mccoy account may lose its preferred rates if he defaults.although the agreement defines what constitutes a default triggering chase ability to exercise this discretion,a default is only one of the conditions required for an increase it may be necessary,but apparently it is not sufficient.chase outlines several other criteria it may obtain and use to review mccoy account for the purposes of determining its eligibility for preferred rates,including mccoy consumer credit reports,his payment history and level of utilization over the life of his account,and his other relationships with chase and its affiliates.
chase does not disclose to mccoy how it may use this information and provides mccoy with no basis for predicting in advance what retroactive interest rate chase will choose to charge him if he defaults.under the agreement,when mccoy defaults,he will not know whether his rate will stay the same,increase slightly,or rise to the maximum default rate until he receives his next periodic statement listing the new rate.worse yet,this new rate would then apply retroactively.
chase argues that the terms for an increase are adequately specified because the concept of a default is defined and because consumers are aware of the maximum rate they might pay in the worst case scenario.it further argues that the discretionary increase that may occur when a consumer defaults can be reconceptualized as an automatic increase,followed by a discretionary reduction in rates.the district court accepted this line of reasoning,concluding that a decision not to increase a rate is analytically indistinct from a decision to lower a rate.
this argument proves too much because it would apply equally to comment example of when contemporaneous notice is required.comment specifically explains that notice must be given when an increase may occur under the creditor contract reservation right to increase the periodic rate.c,cmt.like a reservation right to increase the periodic rate,the contract provision authorizing chase to increase a defaulted consumer interest rate up to the maximum default rate at its discretion does not give the cardholder sufficient information to know what rate will apply and therefore requires the creditor to provide notice.chase contract allows the creditor to increase the rate at its discretion,c,cmt,and does not specify the relevant terms,including the conditions that are necessary and sufficient for an increase to occur and the actual amount of the increase that will occur.chase agreement not to increase the interest rate higher than a preset,maximum does not materially distinguish its cardmember agreement from a contract reservation right to increase the periodic rate.an interpretation of comment as eliminating regulation z notice requirement even where consumers do not have sufficient information to determine whether their interest rate will be raised,or by how much,dilutes the meaning of the word specific beyond recognition.
chase argues that we must nevertheless interpret regulation z to require no notice in this case because we must defer to a advance notice of proposed promulgated for public comment by the federal reserve in,which briefly characterizes existing law in the process of explaining a proposal to amend regulation z to increase the amount of notice for interest rate increases to days in most cases.truth in lending,proposed june,anpr.
consideration of the anpr does not lead us to change our interpretation of the frb official staff commentary.chase observes that the anpr includes as an example of when a notice is not required,some credit card account agreements that permit the card issuer to increase the periodic rate if the consumer makes a late payment,noting that b ecause the circumstances of the increase are specified in advance in the account agreement,the creditor currently need not provide a notice under current d the new rate will appear on the periodic statement for the cycle in which the increase occurs.the effect of this language is ambiguous,however,because the term notice could,as chase argues,refer to contemporaneous notice required for changes in interest rates,but might instead refer only to the fifteen days advance notice required for changes in contractual terms 
the anpr also contains language suggesting it is currently the case that notice is required even if the creditor specifies the penalty rate and the specific events that may trigger the penalty rate in the disclosures.the frb reaffirmed this view in the supplementary information published by the frb along with the final rule amending regulation z.in any case,frb chose to remove the ambiguous language entirely when it issued a final rule and supplementary information amending regulation z in.truth in lending.both the older anpr and the recently approved statement of the frb views clearly state it is currently the case under comments and that contemporaneous notice of rate increases is required even where the creditor specifies the penalty rate and the specific events that may trigger the penalty rate in the disclosures.id.
therefore,while language scattered throughout the anpr offers some support for each view of the official commentary,the anpr does not clearly weigh in favor of either interpretation of regulation z.this ambiguity is not surprising because the primary purpose of the anpr and the anpr that preceded it was to announce proposed amendments to regulation z and solicit comment,not to offer additional staff commentary on regulation z current requirements.
as the dissent notes,although no binding authority has addressed this question several district court opinions and one unpublished memorandum disposition in this circuit have accepted chase view.see,evans chase bank usa,cir unpublished disposition swanson bank of america,d williams.mut.bank,wl,dist.lexis,shaner chase bank,usa,d,evans chase manhattan bank usa,wl,dist.lexis.most of these decisions cite the district court analysis in evans,which held that chase set out the specific terms for an increase because chase gives the reasons for its rate changes.evans,wl,at,dist.lexis,at.in evans,the district court apparently labored under the misconception that comment precedes comment and therefore did not apply where the conditions specified in comment are met.see id.at,dist.lexis,at citing comment and then asserting that t he commentary goes on to state,however,that n o notice of a change in terms need be given if the specific change is set forth initially,quoting comment.possibly for the same reason,most of these courts did not even discuss comment and none attended to the anpr internal ambiguities or considered what kind of deference,if any,is owed to an agency characterizations of existing law when they are incidental to the purpose of an agency publication our own consideration of the frb official staff commentary,unofficial anprs,and the supplementary information accompanying its recent amendment of regulation z leaves us firmly convinced of the frb intent to require contemporaneous notice when rates are raised because of a consumer delinquency or default,as mccoy alleges occurred in this case.
state law claims 
in his second,third,and fourth causes of action,mccoy claims that chase practice of retroactively raising interest rates after a consumer defaults is unconscionable and that he is therefore entitled to declaratory relief,reformation,and damages for imposing an illegal penalty.the district court correctly noted that these causes of action are foreclosed if delaware law specifically authorizes the practice because,pursuant to the national bank act,delaware law governs what interest chase may charge and the methodology used to determine that interest rate.
we reverse the dismissal of these claims,however,because the delaware banking act authorizes rates of interest that vary in accordance with a schedule or formula.as the district court noted,a permissible schedule or formula may include a provision for a change in the rates of interest applicable to all or any part of outstanding unpaid indebtedness contingent upon the happening of any event or circumstance specified in the plan,including a default.id.section therefore would clearly authorize a schedule or formula that specified a higher interest rate that would automatically apply in the event of default.however,the language of does not appear to authorize rate increases that are discretionary and vary according to criteria in addition to the consumer default where those criteria are not specified in a schedule or formula contained in the agreement.
absent binding delaware court decisions construing the terms schedule,formula,or contingent upon in,our task is to predict how the highest state court would decide the issue using intermediate appellate court decisions,decisions from other jurisdictions,statutes,treatises,and restatements as guidance.arizona power,berkeley,cir quoting in re kirkland,cir.in this case,however,only federal district courts have construed and not one has adequately addressed the importance of the discretionary nature of the increases or whether such increases are really in accordance with a schedule or formula.see,swanson bank of,d,by describing the events which cause the rate increase to occur,defendant has complied with section.evans chase manhattan bank usa,wl,dist.lexis,at,concluding an agreement complied with because it described what events will cause default rates to go into effect.
these interpretations of neglect to consider fully whether rate increases truly are contingent upon a default and in accordance with a schedule or formula where they are discretionary and can result in a range of interest rates depending on undisclosed criteria beyond the occurrence of a default.a close analysis of the cardmember agreement reveals that it does not describe the specific events that will cause default rates to go into effect,evans,wl,at,dist.lexis,at emphasis added,but only those that may do so.it also fails to disclose how much chase will actually increase rates should it choose to do so.as a result,we hold that the rate increases mccoy faced under the cardmember agreement were not authorized by because no schedule or formula contained in the agreement revealed whether the increases would occur or how large they would actually be.
having held that the contract provision authorizing discretionary interest rate increases is not authorized by,we conclude that mccoy has made out a colorable claim that the provision may also be unconscionable under delaware law and he should be afforded a reasonable opportunity to present evidence as to its commercial setting,purpose and effect to aid the court in making its determination.see also evans,wl,at,dist.lexis,at noting that absent authorization under,plaintiffs unconscionability contention may have had some weight.
any increased interest charge stemming from a default that occurs retroactively functions as damages paid in the event of a breach,not compensation for the increased risk of,because mccoy would still owe that retroactively imposed additional charge even if he paid chase his entire balance the moment after he defaulted.for these reasons,we reverse the dismissal of mccoy second,third,and fourth causes of action.
mccoy fifth cause of action alleges chase committed consumer fraud by failing to provide notice of an increase in interest.delaware consumer fraud statute.a,prohibits 
the act,use or employment by any person of any deception,fraud,false pretense,false promise,misrepresentation,or the concealment,suppression,or omission of any material fact with intent that others rely upon such concealment,suppression or omission,in connection with the sale,lease or advertisement of any merchandise,whether or not any person has in fact been misled,deceived or damaged thereby,is an unlawful practice.
this allegation fails to state a claim for consumer fraud under a because chase openly and expressly notifies cardholders of the actions it reserves the right to take in the event of a default.although chase may have failed to fulfill its obligations under federal and delaware law,mccoy has not alleged facts to support a finding that it concealed or misrepresented the possibility that it might raise rates without notice when a consumer defaulted.we affirm the dismissal of mccoy fifth claim for relief.
mccoy sixth and seventh causes of action allege claims for breach of contract and tortious breach of the implied covenant of good faith and fair dealing.the cardmember agreement states that chase would notify mccoy of any change if required by applicable law.given the requirements under tila and delaware law discussed above,while mccoy clearly has stated a claim that chase breached this explicit contractual provision he can not state an implied duty of good faith claim because where the subject at issue is expressly covered by the contract,or where the contract is intentionally silent as to that subject,the implied duty to perform in good faith does not come into play.dave greytak,mazda motors of.consequently,we reverse the dismissal of the sixth cause of action and affirm the dismissal of the seventh.
conclusion 
under regulation z as interpreted by its official staff commentary,mccoy has stated a tila claim if chase failed to give him notice of an interest rate increase because of the consumer delinquency or default or if his contract with chase allows the creditor to increase the rate at its discretion but does not include the specific terms for an increase.c,cmt,cmt.having concluded that mccoy has stated a claim under either standard,we reverse and remand to the district court.we affirm the dismissal of mccoy fifth and seventh causes of action,but reverse the dismissal of mccoy other state law claims.
affirmed in part and reversed in part.costs on appeal to appellant.
before addressing the myriad arguments made by the majority,i think it would be helpful to put matters in the big picture.the claims made by mccoy have been raised in many other forums,usually by the same attorneys who represent him here.see evans chase bank usa.cir,swanson bank of,d williams.mut.bank,wl,augustine fia card,d penner chase bank usa,wl,evans chase manhattan bank usa,wl.in all of those cases the result was the opposite of the one reached here.in one case the court did at first indicate that it was inclined to rule in favor of the plaintiffs but reversed course when it was made aware of the advance notice of proposed rulemaking anpr issued by the expert agency,the federal reserve board frb or the board,which quite clearly showed that the board disagreed with their interpretation.shaner chase bank usa,d,citing.the majority concedes,as it must given the unanimity of results on the other side,that the regulation is ambiguous.but the majority then departs from those holdings,and from established supreme court precedent,by refusing to defer to the board interpretation in the face of that ambiguity,and by suggesting,somewhat misleadingly,that the board interpretation is less than clear.
the provision of regulation z at issue here provides that whenever any term required to be disclosed under is changed or the required minimum periodic payment is increased,the creditor shall mail or deliver written notice of the change to each consumer who may be affected.c emphasis added.this refers back to section a,which says,t he creditor shall disclose to the consumer each of the following items,to the extent applicable each periodic rate that may be used to compute the finance charge and the corresponding annual percentage rate.a emphasis added.so the question becomes the following did section c require chase to provide contemporaneous notice to mccoy of an increase in his interest rate due to his default when that increase was an implementation of the existing terms of his agreement with chase the majority says that although the regulation is ambiguous,the frb official staff commentary to c makes the answer a clear yes.the majority feels no need to give any deference to the board views expressed in its anprs,which lead to the opposite conclusion and which are reinforced by every other court that has considered the question.see supra.
the supreme court has instructed us to give respect and deference to the board when interpreting the truth in lending act,et tila.ford motor credit milhollin,d unless demonstrably irrational,federal reserve board staff opinions construing the act or regulation should be dispositive see also anderson.ford valencia,d.i would find that the supreme court requires deference to board interpretations found in anprs.this required deference,of course,reflects universally applicable supreme court jurisprudence in keying statutory and regulatory interpretation on deference to the views of the responsible executive agencies.see,chevron natural resources defense council,d.
on december,as the majority notes,the board issued a final rule amending section to require days notice for rate increases because of defaults,irrespective of whether the possibility of those increases was disclosed in a cardmember agreement.this new rule becomes effective in.truth in lending,to be codified at pt.it comes after at least two anprs,june,both of which recognized that requiring additional notice in these circumstances is a change from what is currently required.the anpr explains 
advance notice is not required in all cases.for example,if an interest rate or other finance charge increases due to a consumer default or delinquency,notice is required,but need not be given in advance.see current c comment c.furthermore,no notice is required if the specific change is set forth initially by the creditor in the disclosures.see current comment c.for example,some account agreements permit the card issuer to increase the periodic rate if the consumer makes a late payment.because the circumstances of the increase are specified in advance in the account agreement,the creditor currently need not provide a notice under current d the new rate will appear on the periodic statement for the cycle in which the increase occurs.
emphasis added 
the majority says that the relevance of the board statements is limited and we need not defer to them because they are not official comments,but merely incidental descriptions of current law contained in an anpr.despite the majority assertion to the contrary,its position conflicts starkly with that of the supreme court,which in anderson.ford gave significant weight to a nearly identical publication.see,at.calling a proposed official staff interpretation persuasive authority and concluding that we can not agree that the staff views expressed in the proposed ruling are wholly without significance.in anderson.ford,the board published for comment an official staff interpretation that was directly contrary to the view taken by three out of four courts of appeals.the board said that while a technical reading of regulation z might support the three courts of appeals,it was the board opinion that the disclosure was not the type of thing meant to be required by regulation z and was therefore not in fact required.id.at.the court said that the board interpretation did not conclusively establish the meaning of the words used in tila,but that absent some obvious repugnance to the statute,the board regulation implementing this legislation should be accepted by the courts,as should the board interpretation of its own regulation.id.at.the court strongly implied that this was so even if the text of the provision at issue suggested a contrary result,saying,
unaided by an administrative construction of the tila and regulation z,a court could easily conclude,based on the language of the statute and of regulation z,that the interest in unearned insurance premiums acquired by the creditor in this case should be characterized as a security interest that must be disclosed.but,in light of the proposed official staff interpretation of regulation z and the legislative history of tila and related statutes,it is evident that the board disagrees.
id.at.emphasis added.the court noted that it has frequently relied on the principle that a thing may be within the letter of the statute and yet not within the statute,because not within its spirit,nor within the intention of its makers.id.at.
an anpr does not meaningfully differ from a proposed official staff interpretation for purposes of the deference we ought to accord it.the supreme court decision in milhollin,d,also supports this view.although,as the majority points out,milhollin distinguishes between official and unofficial staff interpretations in specifying which of the frb views may be relied on for a defense under f,milhollin description of what makes an official interpretation official would apply equally to an anpr o fficial interpretations are published in the federal register,and opportunity for public comment may be requested.milhollin,at.the same is true of anprs.see.the proposed revisions take into consideration comments from the public on an initial advance notice of proposed rulemaking anpr published in december on a variety of issues relating to the format and content of credit disclosures and the substantive protections provided under the regulation.moreover,the court in milhollin did not restrict itself to consideration of official interpretations.it also considered frb public information letters and cch consumer credit guides in divining the agency views on the matter in question.see milhollin,at.nothing in milhollin suggests that similar deference would not be appropriate here.to the contrary,milhollin emphasized that the traditional acquiescence in administrative expertise is particularly apt under tila,because the federal reserve board has played a pivotal role in setting the statutory machinery in motion.at.quoting norwegian nitrogen products united states.in short,milhollin encourages more deference,not less,to the board stated views.
the majority also marshals auer robbins,d in support of its argument that anprs deserve no deference,but auer,too,cuts the other way.auer accords controlling deference to an agency interpretation found in a legal brief.at.briefs drafted in litigation necessarily carry less weight than proposed rules subject to notice and comment,yet the auer court deferred because there was no reason to suspect that the interpretation does not reflect the agency fair and considered judgment on the matter in question.id.at.see also bowles seminole rock sand.any doubts concerning this interpretation of the regulation are removed by reference to the administrative construction of the rule,including in bulletins issued with the regulation,the administrator first quarterly report to congress,and the administrator statement that this position had uniformly been taken in countless explanations and interpretations given to those affected by the regulation.
it follows that,even if we somehow owe less deference to statements of the board contained in an anpr than we would to an official comment,that does not mean we owe no deference at all,or less than controlling deference in the present case.see united states freightways,cir d eference to agency positions is not an proposition more informal agency statements and positions receive a more flexible respect.as a practical matter,the board has made its opinion regarding the correct interpretation of its own regulation more than clear,and for the various reasons explained by the supreme court on many occasions,see,milhollin,at,we owe that opinion deference.therefore,it is abundantly clear that the supreme court would not countenance disregard for the board opinion regarding the correct interpretation of regulation z,even if that opinion appears in an anpr rather than official staff commentary.
the majority,however,provides its own analysis based on its own interpretation of the frb official staff commentary regarding regulation z,brushing aside the board views found in anprs.the potentially relevant comments are comment to section c and comment to section c
