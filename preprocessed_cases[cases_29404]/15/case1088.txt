plaintiffs david cundiff,jennifer cundiff,john debruin,and eva debruin plaintiffs appeal from an order of dismissal entered after the trial court sustained,without leave to amend,the demurrer of defendants gte california incorporated and verizon california,gte california,verizon california,collectively defendants to plaintiffs first amended complaint 
defendants are in the business of supplying telephone service to portions of the state of california.part of their business includes supplying telephone equipment to their customers,including telephones.this suit concerns defendants rental charges for such telephones.plaintiffs,who seek certification as a class on behalf of all persons similarly situated to themselves,contend defendants charge their customers for obsolete or nonexistent telephones,and have imposed such charges,either intentionally or negligently,for over years,without their customers knowledge 
defendants demurrer was sustained when the trial court ruled that section of the public utilities code gives the public utilities commission the commission either exclusive or primary jurisdiction over the matters alleged in the amended complaint plaintiffs contend this case is not governed by section,but rather by public utilities code section,and therefore original jurisdiction is proper in the trial court plaintiffs also contend the doctrine of primary jurisdiction does not bar this suit,nor require its stay.
our examination of the relevant statutes and cases leads us to conclude that the commission does not have exclusive jurisdiction over this case,it was an abuse of discretion to find that the commission has primary jurisdiction over this case,and plaintiffs have stated facts sufficient to constitute multiple causes of action.therefore,we will reverse the order of dismissal and remand this case for further proceedings.
background of the case 
the amended complaint a.the alleged facts of the case 
this suit was filed in october.according to the amended complaint hereinafter the complaint,defendants have enjoyed a virtual monopoly of all residential telephone customers within that part of california to which defendants provide telephone service.david and jennifer cundiff have been customers of defendants since at least,while john and eva debruin have been defendants customers since at least.plaintiffs seek class certification for defendants customers who have,within the four years prior to the filing of the complaint,paid defendants monthly equipment rental charge,which plaintiffs describe as being a charge for obsolete or telephones.plaintiffs define obsolete as any rotary or other telephone provided by d efendants for which the residential customer has been charged rental fees for more than five years.
the complaint alleges that in,telephone companies were required to deregulate,which enabled telephone customers to purchase telephone equipment from sources other than their telephone service provider.prior to that,residential telephone customers were required to rent telephones from their telephone service provider,such as gte california.between and,other telephone companies,such as pacific bell,eliminated their telephone rental program gte california,however,continued to bill its customers for rental telephones 
since,the rates set by defendants and the information provided by them,for residential customers,for telephone rentals,have not been regulated by the government.since,defendants have billed residential customers on a monthly basis for telephone rental by using the term equipment rental on their bills.defendants monthly statements,however do not explain the equipment rental charge.nor have defendants periodically advised their customers that the equipment rental charge is for telephones.defendants bill their customers for unreturned or unaccounted telephones,particularly rotary telephones,that cost less than,even though the rental charges have added up to hundreds of dollars and in some cases over a thousand dollars,without informing their customers of this expense and of alternative options the customers have.moreover,the rental rates are grossly high.
plaintiffs assert that by characterizing the rental of such telephones as equipment rental,defendants have deceptively represented to their customers that the customers possess such rental equipment and are actively using it,and that the rental has some value to them.such characterization fails to inform customers of the cost benefit nature of the charge.such business practices have unjustly enriched defendants by tens of millions of dollars,and the burden has fallen primarily on senior citizens because this is the largest group of customers who had rotary telephones.
plaintiffs causes of action 
based on this alleged failure of defendants to inform their residential customers of the true nature and benefit of their monthly equipment rental charges,plaintiffs alleged defendants violated certain sections of the business and professions code,namely section et which addresses unfair competition,and section which addresses false or misleading statements in connection with the provision of services and goods.plaintiffs further alleged entitlement to relief under civil code section et the consumers legal remedies act and civil code sections and which address fraud and negligent misrepresentation.plaintiffs prayed for certification of a class,declaratory and injunctive relief,damages,including prejudgment interest,attorney fees,and other relief deemed appropriate by the court.
the demurrer 
in their demurrer,defendants asserted that under section,the commission has exclusive jurisdiction to hear this case.alternatively,defendants asserted that even if the trial court did not lack jurisdiction to hear it,the trial court should defer to the jurisdiction of the commission,under the primary jurisdiction doctrine,because that agency has special competence and a regulatory interest in regulating the provision of rental telephone services and because i nvoking the primary jurisdiction doctrine would also advance the goals of uniformity and consistency.the demurrer was filed on november,and the hearing was ultimately held on april,at which time the court sustained the demurrer without leave to amend on the ground that section gives the public utilities commission exclusive primary jurisdiction over the alleged matters.thereafter,plaintiffs dismissed the other defendants without prejudice gte corporation and bell atlantic corporation,and the case was dismissed by the trial court on june.this timely appeal followed 
defendants requests for judicial notice 
defendants sought and obtained judicial notice of administrative complaints filed with the commission,by two of defendants customers,respecting defendants policy of including a telephone rental charge on such customers bills and labeling the charge with a description that does not specifically identify it as being for rental of a telephone.in both of the complaints,the customers stated that defendants have been charging them such rental fees since or before,and that they have been unaware that they were paying rent on telephones.they demanded a refund of the charges.one complaint was filed in january or february,and gte california was directed by the commission to answer it.that complaint was ultimately dismissed by the complainant,wilma ker,later that year.however,the record does not reflect whether the complaint was settled or adjudicated by the commission prior to the dismissal.the record reflects that the other complaint,by a robert kaveney,was filed in november,and the commission directed verizon california to answer it.that complaint has recently been adjudicated by the commission,and we address that adjudication later in this opinion.
judicial notice was also taken of a february consumer advisory issued by the commission entitled renting buying your phone.the written advisory notes that since the,some customers of telephone companies may have replaced their rental telephones with ones they purchased for themselves and yet did not return the rentals to the telephone company,in which case the customers may still be paying the company monthly rental fee.the notice advises consumers who own their own telephone to review their current telephone bill to see if they are being charged for a rental telephone,to look for language such as phone rental,or equipment rental,and to contact their telephone company and stop the charges if they appear on the bill.the notice also advises consumers that if they are renting their telephone,they may wish to consider the cost effectiveness of returning it to the telephone company and purchasing their own telephone because renting a telephone for a year may be more expensive than purchasing one.
in february,the commission also initiated a proceeding to establish rules for protecting consumer rights in today competitive telecommunications services marketplace,and invited the public to file comments on the analyses and recommendations contained in a report prepared by our telecommunications division,and to present alternative ideas and proposals to promote consumer protection in the telecommunications industry.the commission order instituting rulemaking states that the telecommunications division sought to have the commission recognize certain consumer rights,including the right to clear and complete terms and conditions for service agreements between consumers and a provider,and be accurately billed for services they authorize.
contentions on appeal 
on appeal,plaintiffs contend the commission does not have exclusive jurisdiction over their claims,and the primary jurisdiction doctrine neither bars this suit nor warrants a stay of it.additionally,plaintiffs assert that the facts alleged in each of the counts in their complaint are sufficient to state a cause of action.
discussion 
istandard of review 
a demurrer tests the sufficiency of the allegations in a complaint as a matter of law.pacifica homeowners wesley palms retirement community d.we review the sufficiency of the challenged complaint de novo.coopers lybrand superior court d.we accept as true the properly pleaded allegations of fact in the complaint,but not the contentions,deductions or conclusions of fact or law.blank kirwan cal d.we also accept as true facts which may be inferred from those expressly alleged.marshall gibson,dunn crutcher th,d.we consider matters which may be judicially noticed,and we give the complaint a reasonable interpretation,reading it as a whole and its parts in their context.blank kirwan,supra,cal d at.we do not concern ourselves with whether the plaintiffs will be able to prove the facts which they allege in their complaint.parsons tickner th,d.
the judgment or order of dismissal must be affirmed if any of the grounds for demurrer raised by the defendants is well taken and disposes of the complaint.aubry hospital dist.cal th,d.it is error to sustain a general demurrer if the complaint states a cause of action under any possible legal theory.ibid.it is an abuse of the trial court discretion to sustain a demurrer without leave to amend if there is a reasonable possibility the plaintiffs can amend the complaint to allege any cause of action.to prove abuse of discretion,plaintiffs must demonstrate how the complaint can be amended.such a showing can first be made to the reviewing court.careau security pacific business credit,d.
this suit is authorized by section,not precluded by section 
section and section address different things.section defines and limits the power of courts to pass judgment on,or interfere with,what the commission does.section,on the other hand,confirms the full power of the courts to pass judgment on what utilities do.section explicitly authorizes california courts to hear claims against public utilities for damages.cellular plus,superior court th,d.the similarity between the two statutes is that they both dictate which courts have jurisdiction to engage in these activities.only appellate courts can review decisions and orders of the commission and interfere with its actions,whereas suits for relief against utilities can be brought in the trial court.
however,our supreme court has recognized that a plaintiff attempt to obtain relief under section may have the effect of interfering with the commission regulation of utilities.in waters pacific telephone cal d,the court stated that section must be construed as limited to those situations in which an award of damages would not hinder or frustrate the commission declared supervisory and regulatory policies.the plaintiff in waters sued the defendant,under section,for damages of,alleging defendant failed to provide her with adequate telephone service and such failure caused her damages.the court held the plaintiff action was barred by section because it interfered with the commission policy of limiting the liability of telephone utilities for ordinary negligence to a specified credit allowance,and the commission has relied upon the validity and effect of that policy in exercising its functions.id.at.in a subsequent case,the court stated under the waters rule,an action for damages against a public utility pursuant to section is barred by section not only when an award of damages would directly contravene a specific order or decision of the commission,when it would reverse,correct,or annul that order or decision,but also when an award of damages would simply have the effect of undermining a general supervisory or regulatory policy of the commission,when it would hinder or frustrate or interfere with or obstruct that policy.san diego gas electric superior court cal th,d.thus,trial courts have concurrent jurisdiction with the commission over controversies between utilities and others not inimical to the purposes of the public utility act.vila tahoe southside water utility d,italics added.san diego gas electric superior court,supra,cal th at,d.
assuming arguendo that the amount of money defendants charged each month as rent for telephones was approved by the commission,we do not perceive the thrust of plaintiffs complaint to be a challenge to that amount.nor do we perceive this as a suit challenging the commission decision to allow defendants to rent telephones to their customers.rather,plaintiffs are challenging the manner in which defendants billed them for rental of telephones,specifically,the alleged lack of information given to plaintiffs about the rental charge made each month by defendants.the gist of this suit is the alleged deception,intentional or negligent,resulting in plaintiff unknowingly paying rent month after month,year after year for telephones they do not use,or for telephones whose value is less than the cumulative rent plaintiffs paid to defendants for them.the gist of the suit is that if plaintiffs had been adequately informed about the nature of the equipment rental charge that they repeatedly paid,they would have chosen to not pay it.
in this respect,the instant case is similar to cellular plus,superior court,supra,th,d,where two cellular telephone companies were sued by their customers and others for.the plaintiffs alleged the two defendants engaged in wholesale and retail of cellular telephone service in that the prices charged by the defendants had remained almost identical for several years because the defendants agreed to that status and had not sought lower rates.the court ruled that section did not preclude the plaintiffs suit.it noted that the plaintiffs did not challenge the commission right to set rates for cellular service,and did not seek to have the commission change its rates,but rather sought damages and injunctive relief,under the cartwright act,for the alleged.id.at,d et.
also of interest is communications,los angeles cellular telephone cal th,d,which,like the instant case,involved claims of unfair competition violative of section et of the business and professions code.the defendant was in the business of selling cellular telephones and providing cellular telephone service.the plaintiffs business was selling cellular telephones they were not licensed to provide cellular telephone service.plaintiffs alleged defendant engaged in unfair competition when it sold cellular telephones below cost and made up for the loss of money on such sales by its increased sales of services.plaintiffs alleged they were harmed by defendant marketing strategy because they were not able to fairly compete with defendant sales of telephones.the supreme court observed that the commission had previously rescinded its prohibition against bundling,that is,selling cellular equipment and service as a package and discounting the price of the package.the prohibition was lifted even though the commission was aware that such packaging could result in cellular equipment dealers being unable to compete if equipment sales were involved in the bundling,but the commission order permitting bundling included a directive that state and federal laws respecting pricing and consumer protection were incorporated into its order.despite this prior activity by the commission on the subject of bundling,the supreme court ruled that permitting the plaintiffs case to go forward would not infringe on the commission regulatory authority and responsibilities.id.at,d.the court noted that the commission itself had two years earlier issued an opinion in which it stated that it is the courts,and not the commission that ha ve jurisdiction to determine violations of laws.id.at,d.the commission went on to say that while it would,of course,review a allegation brought before it in an appropriate proceeding,it is certainly not the primary enforcer of pricing law.citation.ibid.to that we add our observation that the commission is not the primary enforcer of consumer protection laws in general.
cellular plus,and communications,support plaintiffs assertion that section does not preclude this suit.additionally,plaintiffs can reasonably argue that the suit actually furthers policies of the commission because it seeks to force defendants to bill their customers in such a way that the customers are fully informed of the nature of defendants charges.indeed,the abovementioned consumer advisory notice issued by the commission in february demonstrates both the commission desire that consumers be fully informed about charges they may be paying for the rental of their telephones,and the commission concern that consumers may not be aware they have been paying rental charges which they would not have paid if they knew the facts about such charges.
in hartwell superior court cal th,d,the court reviewed suits by customers of certain water companies.the suits alleged the companies had,for many years,supplied the customers with water that did not meet the government water quality standards and the commission standards for water quality service,resulting in personal injuries to the plaintiffs.plaintiffs also,in effect,challenged the adequacy of the standards.the court ruled that while the challenge to the standards themselves was barred because it attempted to interfere with a broad regulatory program of the commission,the portion of the suit seeking damages for defendants alleged failure to meet water quality standards was not barred by section.id.at,d.the court observed that any redress of alleged violations that the commission itself might pursue would be essentially prospective in nature because the statutory remedies the commission can seek are designed to stop the utilities from engaging in current and ongoing violations and do not redress injuries for past wrongs.id.at,d.the court stated that because the commission can not award damages for past violations,the plaintiffs causes of action for damages would not interfere with the commission in implementing its supervisory and regulatory policies to prevent future harm.ibid.
in the instant case,defendants have not shown that the commission has authority to give plaintiffs the relief that plaintiffs can obtain under section,that is,restitution or damages based on defendants alleged violations of the aforecited provisions of the business and professions code and the civil code,including exemplary damages for willful wrongful acts.although defendants contend that section of the public utilities code can be applied here to afford such relief,we reject that contention section addresses complaints filed with the commission concerning rates charged for products and services,and it permits the commission to order a public utility to make reparations to a person who files such a complaint if the commission determines the public utility has charged an unreasonable,excessive,or discriminatory amount therefore in violation of any of the provisions of certain portions of the public utilities act,italics added.here,plaintiffs are not challenging defendants rates,only their billing disclosure practices.moreover,defendants do not explain what violation of the provisions of the public utilities act they are alleged to have committed that would make section applicable.
nor have defendants persuaded us that this case is precluded by the commission having already been presented with administrative claims,by two of defendants customers,that challenge the very billing practice at issue in the instant case.as noted previously,it does not appear from the record whether one of the claims was even addressed by the commission prior to its dismissal,and while the other claim filed by robert kaveney was recently decided by the commission,that decision has no impact on this case 
moreover,even when the commission investigation of a public utility results in a favorable outcome for the utility,such a determination does not necessarily preclude a suit from going forward against that utility.in hartwell superior court,supra,cal th,d,the commission made an investigation of water companies,including the defendant water companies in that suit,after the plaintiffs filed the suit charging personal injuries from unsafe drinking water.such investigation caused the commission to make a retrospective finding that the water companies had,for the previous years,substantially complied with the drinking water standards of california state department of health services.nevertheless,the hartwell court said the finding was not part of an identifiable broad and continuing supervisory or regulatory program of the commission citation,related to such routine commission proceedings as ratemaking and rulemaking nor was the commission determination part of an enforcement proceeding.id.at,d.thus,said the court,although an award by a jury,supported by a finding that the defendants did violate governmental water quality standards,would be contrary to the commission own decision,it would not hinder or frustrate the commission declared supervisory and regulatory policies,and u nder the provisions of section,it would also not constitute a direct review,reversal,correction,or annulment of the decision itself.accordingly,such a jury verdict would not be barred by the statute.id.at,d.additionally,said the court,although a commission finding of past compliance,or noncompliance,might be part of a future program,such program would not be interfered with by the plaintiffs suit since the remedies and enforcement options available to the commission do not include awarding damages to persons harmed by water companies that did not comply with drinking water standards id.at,d.
here,defendants have not demonstrated that if the commission were to find that their method of billing for telephone rentals complied with the commission order and opinion for billing such rentals see fn,ante,such a finding would be part of a broad and continuing supervisory or regulatory program related to routine commission proceedings such as ratemaking or rulemaking.in contrast is the case of day v.at t th,d,which impacted the commission ratemaking program.the plaintiffs in day,who alleged deceptive advertising in the way the defendants sold prepaid telephone cards to the public,were precluded from stating a cause of action for damages because under the filed rate doctrine,plaintiffs were presumed to know the rates the defendants had filed with the federal communications commission,and therefore plaintiffs could not have suffered damages when they paid the filed rates 
we thus conclude that section does not preclude plaintiffs case from proceeding under section.this case does not challenge the right of telephone ut
