background 
in,real party james benson filed this action on behalf of the general public.the original complaint contained four counts,three of which asserted violations of the ucl for unlawful,unfair,and fraudulent business practices,and a fourth brought under the fal for false advertising.the counts alleged petitioners violated several state and federal statutes,including section and civil code section,subdivision a of the consumers legal remedies act,et clra,by marketing and selling locksets with made in or similar labels although the products contained parts or involved foreign manufacture.the prayer sought injunctive relief and restitution for monies wrongfully acquired and retained by petitioners acts of unfair competition 
shortly after benson filed this lawsuit,petitioners learned about an unrelated investigation by the united states federal trade commission ftc concerning the country of origin labeling on their products.in late,petitioners entered into a consent order with the ftc restricting their use of such labels.benson kwikset,supra,th at,d.
the underlying action proceeded to a court trial in december.thereafter,the court issued a statement of decision that found petitioners violated the foregoing statutes between and by placing made in or similar labels on products which contained either screws or pins made in taiwan or involved latch performed in mexico.based on its findings,the court entered a judgment enjoining petitioners from labeling any lockset intended for sale in the state of california all american made,or made in usa,or similar unqualified language,if such lockset contains any article,unit,or part that is made,manufactured,or produced outside of the united states.
the trial court also ordered petitioners to notify its california retailers and distributors of the falsely labeled products and afford them the opportunity to return improperly labeled inventory for either a monetary refund or replacement with properly labeled items.but it denied benson request for restitution to the ultimate consumers,explaining in its statement of decision that the misrepresentations,even to those for whom the made in usa designation is an extremely important consideration,were not so deceptive or false as to warrant a return refund program or other restitutionary relief to those who have been using their locksets without other complaint.
both parties appealed from the judgment.while the appeals were pending,the electorate enacted proposition.it amended the ucl and fal to provide that,except for actions brought by the attorney general or other public prosecutors,only a person who has suffered injury in fact and has lost money or property as a result of unfair competition or false advertising may file suit.subsequently,the supreme court declared the amendments apply to cases pending when proposition became effective californians for disability rights mervyn,llc cal th,d,but a party who had filed suit on behalf of the general public before the amendment should be given the opportunity to allege and prove facts satisfying proposition new standing requirements branick downey savings loan cal th,d.
in,by a vote,this court upheld the trial court decision on the underlying merits.benson kwikset,supra,th at,d.but we vacated the judgment and,i n accordance with branick,remand ed the case to the trial court to allow benson to plead and prove facts giving him standing under the revised statutes.id.at,d.if benson successfully allege d and prove d his right to relief under the unfair competition law and the false advertising law,as amended by proposition,we directed the court shall reenter its original judgment.id.at,d.however,i f benson fail ed to plead or prove his right to maintain this lawsuit,the court shall enter a judgment dismissing the action.ibid.
after the remittitur issued,benson moved to amend the complaint to add real parties al snook,christina grecco,and chris wilson as named plaintiffs in an attempt to comply with this court directions in benson kwikset,supra,th,d.the trial court granted the motion.petitioners challenged the ruling by a writ petition to this court.the petition was summarily denied.
petitioners then demurred to the amended complaint.the trial court overruled the demurrer.this ruling led to petitioners second writ petition,the sole basis of which was that real parties could not satisfy the requirements to maintain a class action.this court issued an order denying it as well.a concurring opinion to the order cited this court recent decision in hall time,th,d and noted it was hard to comprehend how real parties had sustained any injury because of petitioners wrongful conduct.
the current petition 
both sides reacted to the comments in the concurring opinion.petitioners filed a motion for judgment on the pleadings,but withdrew it when real parties moved to file a second amended complaint.the trial court granted the latter request.
the amended complaint alleges benson and each of the other real parties purchased several kwikset locksets that were represented as made in or contained similar designations.when purchasing the locksets each plaintiff saw and read d efendants misrepresentations and relied on such misrepresentations in deciding to purchase them.each plaintiff was induced to purchase and did purchase d efendants locksets due to the false representation that they were made in and would not have purchased them if they had not been so misrepresented.in purchasing the locksets,each plaintiff was provided with products falsely advertised as made in,deceiving him or her and causing him or her to buy products he or she did not want.defendants made in misrepresentations caused each plaintiff to spend and lose the money he or she paid for the locksets.each plaintiff has suffered injury and loss of money as a result of d efendants conduct 
petitioners demurred to the second amended complaint.they argued a plaintiff does not adequately plead his or her injury in fact and loss of money under california ucl and fal by simply alleging that he or she was induced by a misrepresentation to spend money to purchase a product.
the trial court overruled the demurrer.it acknowledged the locksets have intrinsic value as locking devices and may be perfectly useful to other consumers who do not care about the place of a product origin.but real parties allegations they relied upon the alleged misrepresentations on the product packaging and were induced to buy products they did not want,suggest ed the products were unsatisfactory to them since t he alleged deception by petitioners caused the plaintiffs to buy products they did not want,t he court found the allegations to be a sufficient statement the plaintiffs suffered injury in fact and lost money or property as a result of the alleged fraud
