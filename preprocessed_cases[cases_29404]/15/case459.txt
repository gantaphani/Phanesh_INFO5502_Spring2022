in early october,requested a credit report from experian and discovered the bank notation.she sent a dispute letter to experian on october which stated

ii.analysis 
we review de novo the district court grant of summary judgment.see lamers dairy usda,cir citation omitted.summary judgment is properly granted when the pleadings,depositions,answers to interrogatories,and admissions on file,together with the affidavits,if any,show that there is no genuine issue as to any material fact and that the moving party is entitled to a judgment as a matter of law.c celotex catrett,d.material facts are those that might affect the outcome of the suit under the applicable substantive law.see anderson liberty lobby,d.we view the facts in the light most favorable to,the nonmoving party.see matsushita indus.zenith radio,d.
experian has the burden of showing that there is no genuine issue of material fact and that it is entitled to judgment as a matter of law.however,retains the burden of producing enough evidence to support a reasonable jury verdict in her favor.see anderson,at.a party who bears the burden of proof on a particular issue may not rest on its pleading,but must affirmatively demonstrate,by specific factual allegations,that there is a genuine issue of material fact which requires trial.beard whitley county remc,cir emphasis in original.t he mere existence of some alleged factual dispute between the parties will not defeat an otherwise properly supported motion for summary judgment the requirement is that there be no genuine issue of material fact.anderson,at.emphasis in original.
argues that experian willfully and negligently failed to conduct a reasonable reinvestigation of her dispute and failed to delete the inaccurate information from her file after investigation in violation of a the parties agree that experian is the type of consumer reporting agency that is regulated by the fcra.see f.
the fcra provides that,w henever a consumer reporting agency prepares a consumer report it shall follow reasonable procedures to assure maximum possible accuracy of the information concerning the individual about whom the report relates.b.once a consumer report exists,the fcra triggers various duties on the part of a reporting agency,including the obligation to reinvestigate when a consumer contends that her consumer report is inaccurate or incomplete.wantz experian info.solutions,cir citing a.if experian negligently violated any duty imposed by the statute,may collect actual damages,costs,and fees.see.if there was a willful violation,punitive damages are also available.see.

i f the completeness or accuracy of any item of information contained in a consumer file at a consumer reporting agency is disputed by the consumer and the consumer notifies the agency directly of such dispute,the agency shall,free of charge,conduct a reasonable reinvestigation to determine whether the disputed information is inaccurate and record the current status of the disputed information,or delete the item from the file before the end of the period beginning on the date on which the agency receives the notice of the dispute from the consumer.

the district court found that did not show that she suffered any damages because of the inaccuracy in her credit report during experian period of liability.experian must be notified of an error before it is required to reinvestigate.as we have made clear,the fcra is not a strict liability statute.sarver,at citation omitted see also a a requiring the consumer to notify the agency before the duty to reinvestigate arises.no reinvestigation is required until the credit reporting agency is notified of an error because to require otherwise would be burdensome and inefficient,and t he consumer is in a better position than the credit reporting agency to detect errors.henson csc credit,cir.the test set
