introduction 
plaintiff webster bivens bivens appeals from the trial court judgment in favor of defendant corel corporation corel.corel offered consumers rebates for purchasing its software.bivens filed an action against corel claiming that corel imposed conditions not disclosed in the rebate offers and that corel never intended to satisfy customer requests for the rebates.the trial court granted summary judgment in favor of corel.bivens contends that the trial court erred in granting corel motion for summary judgment,arguing that there remain material facts in dispute.we conclude that no triable issue of material fact exists and that corel is entitled to summary judgment on bivens claims.
while bivens appeal was pending,the voters of california passed proposition,a measure that amended certain provisions of california unfair competition law ucl,set forth at business and professions code section et.in view of passage,we requested that the parties submit supplemental briefs addressing whether or not applies to this case and,if so,what impact,if any,amendments to the ucl have on this case.we conclude that amendment of section see,as amended by,as approved by voters.does apply to this case,and requires that we affirm the trial court judgment in favor of corel on the additional ground that bivens no longer has standing to prosecute the claims he raises in the complaint.

bivens complaint and allegations 
bivens,who had neither purchased the corel software nor applied for a rebate,initiated this lawsuit against corel on december,by filing a complaint on behalf of the general public pursuant to sections and.bivens alleged that corel conduct in advertising a rebate offer on the outside of packages of corel and corel with the words details inside,and providing the material terms of the offer on a rebate form contained inside the corel and corel packages violated sections,and.bivens sought a declaration that corel failure to fulfill every rebate request made by a purchaser was unlawful and unfair,constituted a breach of contract with consumers,and provided corel with an unfair competitive advantage over its competitors.bivens further sought an accounting to determine the dollar amount of the rebate requests that were allegedly unlawfully not paid,disgorgement and restitution of such funds to purchasers,escheatment of disgorged profits belonging to unidentified victims to the state of california pursuant to civil code section,preliminary and permanent injunctive relief,and attorney fees and costs of suit.
trial court proceedings 
motion for summary judgment 
corel filed a motion for summary judgment on june.a hearing on the motion was scheduled for september.on july,bivens served corel with requests for discovery,including form and special interrogatories,requests for admissions,and a request for production of documents.prior to serving these discovery requests,bivens had not conducted any discovery in this case since filing the complaint on december.
through a series of motions and ex parte applications,bivens requested an extension of time to file an opposition to corel motion for summary judgment and requested that the hearing on the motion be continued so that bivens could obtain responses to the discovery he propounded on july.the trial court eventually granted bivens a extension to file his opposition.however,the court denied his requests to continue the hearing date.on september,bivens counsel filed his opposition to corel summary judgment motion and also filed a document entitled renewal of motion for continuance.
attorney mcmillan declaration regarding his rebate requests 
in support of his opposition to corel motion for summary judgment,bivens submitted the declaration of his counsel,scott mcmillan.according to the declaration,attorney mcmillan personally purchased two corel packages from office depot in a single transaction on august.one package was for himself and one was for his law corporation.mcmillan submitted rebate request forms for the two corel purchases.corel did not send mcmillan the rebates he requested.mcmillan admitted that the corel packages he purchased were on sale at the time he bought them and that he had used coupons in making the purchase.
mcmillan also purchased corel from.in addition to submitting a corel rebate request form to tca,mcmillan applied for and received a rebate on his corel purchase directly from.according to mcmillan declaration,the corel rebate request he submitted to tca was initially denied.when he did not receive the rebate from corel,he placed a telephone call to tca regarding his corel rebate request.in response to mcmillan call,tca sent him a rebate check in the amount of.
summary judgment hearing and disposition 
the trial court heard bivens renewed motion for a continuance and corel summary judgment motion on september.the court took both matters under submission.
on september,the court denied bivens request to continue the summary judgment motion by minute order,concluding that bivens had failed to establish that responses to the discovery he sought could defeat summary judgment,and also on the ground that bivens had failed to provide sufficient reasons why he could not have obtained the information he believed could defeat summary judgment earlier in the proceedings.the trial court also granted corel motion for summary judgment.in its order,the court addressed a number of other outstanding issues,including evidentiary objections to the declarations the parties had submitted.the court sustained corel objections to the mcmillan declaration,and overruled bivens objections to the declaration of frank giordano,president of tca.
the court entered judgment in favor of corel on november.bivens filed a notice of appeal on december,
discussiona.as an unaffected plaintiff,bivens lacks standing to pursue section claims against corel 
because the question whether the newly amended version of section applies to this case is dispositive,we address it before addressing the merits of the action.
proposition 
on november,california voters approved.became effective the following day,pursuant to article ii,section,subdivision a of the california constitution.
amends certain provisions of the ucl,set forth at section et.see.as is relevant to the instant case,amended section to require that actions filed by private persons pursuant to the ucl be brought only by plaintiffs who have suffered an.prior to passage,section provided in pertinent part 
actions for any relief pursuant to this chapter shall be prosecuted exclusively by or upon the complaint of any board,officer,person,corporation or association or by any person acting for the interests of itself,its members or the general public.italics added.
as amended,section now reads in pertinent part 
actions for any relief pursuant to this chapter shall be prosecuted exclusively by or upon the complaint of any board,officer,person,corporation or association or by any person who has suffered injury in fact and has lost money or property as a result of such unfair competition.italics added.
the statute,as amended,prevents unaffected plaintiffs from being able to file actions on behalf of the general public.under current law,only persons who have been injured by the business practices complained of have standing to bring an action for relief under the ucl.
after the voters approved,we requested that the parties in this case address the following questions 
does proposition apply to cases that were filed before the effective date of the new law 
assuming proposition does apply to pending cases,what is the impact,if any,of the provisions of proposition on this case 
applies to this case,and divests bivens of standing to prosecute this lawsuit 
bivens filed this action against corel in,almost two years before was enacted.although the trial court entered judgment in favor of corel,a judgment does not become final so long as the action in which it is entered remains pending citation and an action remains pending until final determination on appeal citation.county of san bernardino ranger ins.th,d county of san bernardino.therefore we must consider whether the newly amended version of the ucl applies to this case,which was filed prior to approval by the voters but was still pending at the time became effective.
courts generally presume that a newly enacted statute does not have retrospective effect unless there has been some clearly expressed contrary intent.see tapia superior court cal d.however,although courts normally construe statutes to operate prospectively rather than retrospectively,courts also generally hold that when a pending action rests solely on a statutory basis,and when no rights have vested under the statute,a repeal of the statute without a saving clause will terminate all pending actions based thereon.southern service,los angeles county cal d,see also governing board mann cal d,mann krause rarity cal,krause.this is because a court must apply the law in force at the time of the decision when a remedial statute is repealed prior to final judgment being entered in a case.brenton metabolife int l,th,d.
the justification for this rule is that all statutory remedies are pursued with full realization that the l egislature may abolish the right to recover at any time.citation.mann,supra,cal d at,see also,any statute may be repealed at any time,except when vested rights would be impaired.persons acting under any statute act in contemplation of this power of repeal.this is because a party rights and remedies under a statute may be enforced after repeal only where such rights have vested before repeal county of san bernardino,supra,th at,d,and unlike a common law right,a statutory remedy does not vest until final judgment south coast regional com.gordon d.if the statutory right to recover has not vested through the entry of final judgment by the time of the repeal,the right remains inchoate,incomplete,or unperfected,and the repeal operates to extinguish the right at the time the repeal is enacted.people v.one buick cal d,one buick.
bivens right to state a claim against corel was not based on common law rights,but,rather,depended wholly upon provisions of the ucl.effectively repealed the portion of the ucl that granted standing to bivens and to other private persons who had not themselves suffered injury as a result of the allegedly unfair,unlawful or fraudulent business practices complained of in the lawsuit.see.although did not act to entirely repeal any of the ucl causes of action its repeal of unaffected plaintiff standing is sufficient to completely extinguish bivens right to bring his claims.we reach this conclusion because insofar as completely eliminates the right of uninjured individuals to pursue a remedy under the ucl,its amendment of section entirely repeals a statutory right previously held by one class of individuals.further,contains no savings clause to exclude from its reach cases filed prior to its effective date.without a savings clause,repeal of unaffected plaintiffs statutory authorization to pursue ucl claims is effective immediately.
we recognize that in californians for disability rights mervyn,llc th,d californians for disability rights,the court of appeal held that does not apply to cases filed prior to the effective date of the new law.in rejecting the argument that the statutory repeal doctrine rendered applicable to pending cases,the californians for disability rights court relied on the california supreme court decision in evangelatos superior court cal d,evangelatos.californians for disability rights,supra,th at,d wl,citing evangelatos,supra,cal d at.in our view,evangelatos is inapposite to the question whether to apply to pending cases because the proposition at issue in that case did not repeal a statutory right,as did,but rather modified a common law right.
in evangelatos,the supreme court held that proposition,which modified the traditional,common law joint and several liability doctrine,did not apply to causes of action that had accrued before the effective date of the new law.evangelatos,supra,cal d at,italics added.however,the evangelatos court did not address,much less overrule,any of the numerous cases in which the supreme court held that a repeal of a statutory right applies to pending cases,mann,supra,cal d at.further,courts in many cases decided both before and after evangelatos,have repeatedly emphasized that a statute that repeals a statutory right,unlike a statute that modifies a common law right,applies to pending cases,one buick,supra,cal d at,physicians committee for responsible medicine tyson foods,th,d applying the statutory repeal doctrine and distinguishing evangelatos on this ground.accordingly,evangelatos is not on point and,for the reasons set forth above,we decline to follow californians for disability rights.
there is now no statutory authorization granting bivens standing to prosecute the ucl claims raised in this case.the requirement of standing must be satisfied throughout the entire action,not just upon the filing of an action.see common cause of california board of supervisors cal d.because lack of standing is considered a jurisdictional defect that may not be waived,bivens lack of standing requires that the action be dismissed unless the complaint can be amended by substituting a party who has standing to sue for bivens see cloud northrop grumman th,d code of civil procedure section must be liberally construed to permit amendment to substitute plaintiff with standing for one who is not real party in interest see also klopstock superior court of san francisco cal d,amendment to substitute real party in interest as plaintiff entitled to effect so long as cause of action against defendant is not factually changed such that wholly different cause of action is introduced.thus,even if bivens action was meritorious,which we conclude it is not see part b,post,bivens could not pursue it because he lacks standing.
because effectively repealed one portion of a remedial statute,the application of the newly amended provision of section to this pending case does not implicate concerns about retroactive or prospective application of the law.bivens statutory right to pursue this case had not yet vested at the time repealed that right,and because bivens standing was an inchoate,incomplete,or unperfected right,the repeal operated to extinguish his standing as soon as it was enacted.see one buick,supra,cal d at.thus,we must apply the requirements of the law as it stands today to the case before us.beckman thompson th,d i f the judgment is not yet final because it is on appeal,the appellate court has a duty to apply the law as it exists when the appellate court renders its decision.because the statute,as it stands today,does not allow an uninjured individual to pursue ucl claims against a defendant on behalf of the general public,as of today bivens lacks standing to pursue the claims he asserts in this lawsuit.see branick downey savings loan.app th,d.lexis,accord,benson kwikset.app th,d,wl.lexis.
corel is entitled to summary judgment on the merits of this case 
even if bivens had standing to pursue this action,we conclude that the trial court properly granted corel motion for summary judgment because bivens has not met his burden of establishing that any triable issue of material fact exists 
standards governing summary judgment 
summary judgment is proper when all the papers submitted show there is no triable issue as to any material fact such that the moving party is entitled to judgment as a matter of law.code civ,subd.c.a defendant moving for summary judgment must establish that he has met his burden of showing that a cause of action can not be established.aguilar atlantic richfield cal th,d.
in evaluating the correctness of a ruling under code of civil procedure section,we must independently review the record before the trial court.because the grant or denial of a motion under code of civil procedure section involves pure questions of law,we are required to reassess the legal significance and effect of the papers presented by the parties in connection with the motion.citation.citation.ranchwood communities limited partnership jim beat construction th,d.
the parties agree that on review of the trial court order,this court must apply the same analysis that the trial court applied in determining the merits of corel motion for summary judgment.in reviewing an order on a summary judgment,the reviewing court employs the same process as the trial court in determining whether,as a matter of law,summary judgment was appropriate.saldana d.
corel made a prima facie showing that it was entitled to summary judgment 
bivens contends that the trial court judgment must be reversed because corel failed to make a prima facie showing that it was entitled to summary judgment.for the following reasons,we disagree.
corel established that its rebate offers did not violate sections or in the manner alleged in bivens complaint 
bivens alleges that the rebate offers printed on the front of the corel and corel packages stating get cash back were false and misleading,thus violating sections and.specifically,bivens maintains that the rebate offers were misleading because they failed to disclose all of the material terms of the rebate offers.
section prohibits anyone from making statements that are untrue or misleading,and that are known,or by the exercise of reasonable care should be known,to be untrue or misleading,in order to induce consumers into purchasing property or services section prohibits any unlawful,unfair,or fraudulent business acts or practices,including deceptive or misleading advertising prohibited pursuant to section 
in order to prevail on any claim under these statutory provisions,bivens would have to show that corel rebate offer was untrue or misleading.thus,in order to prevail on its motion for summary judgment,corel had to make a prima facie showing that its rebate offer was neither untrue nor misleading.corel met its burden.we conclude that corel rebate offers for corel and corel were neither false nor misleading in that corel disclosed the material terms of the offers on the rebate forms inside the packages,and it imposed only those terms in processing rebate requests.
i corel made a prima facie showing that its rebate offers were not false 
bivens contends that corel rebate offers for cash back were untrue misleading because not all purchasers of corel and corel actually received cash back.bivens claims that while corel advertised that it would send rebate payments to consumers who purchased its product,corel would actually send rebate payments only to those consumers who purchased its products and were eligible to receive the rebate as a result of complying with the terms of the offer.in making this argument,bivens fails to acknowledge that corel did not make a blanket offer that anyone who purchased corel or corel could get cash back.rather,corel rebate offer included certain that were detailed,as the product package indicated,on a document contained inside the package.
on the rebate forms enclosed within the corel and corel packages,corel disclosed to purchasers that they would have to meet a number of requirements in order to be eligible to receive the advertised rebate.those purchasers who did not meet the requirements would not receive a rebate.thus,corel rebate offer was not simply get cash back,but,rather,encompassed all of the following the statement get cash back the statement see inside for details and the terms and restrictions outlined on the rebate form.
bivens also alleged that corel did not intend to fulfill its promises to pay the specified rebates because it impos ed additional undisclosed restrictions on the consumers that allowed it to avoid satisfying the rebate claims from otherwise eligible consumers.specifically,bivens complained that corel failed to inform consumers that multiple purchases evidenced on the same receipt would not be eligible for the rebate.bivens complained 
the fact that the responding consumer would not receive the rebate if another responding consumer also purchased corel and paid for the product during the same transaction and submitted the same receipt,is a material term,and as such should have been disclosed in the advertisement and the rebate offer.
in response to these allegations,corel was required to make a prima facie showing in its motion for summary judgment that it did not impose additional undisclosed restrictions that were not set forth on the outside of the package or on the rebate form contained inside the package.in support of its motion,corel submitted the declaration of frank giordano,tca president giordano declaration giordano confirmed that tca processes rebate requests for corel,and that in processing the requests,tca verifies that the consumer has complied with the terms and conditions of the rebate offer as set forth on the rebate form enclosed in each corel and corel package.if the consumer has complied with the terms and conditions of the promotion,then the rebate request is processed and the consumer is issued a rebate check.the trial court admitted the giordano declaration in evidence.the declaration constitutes sufficient evidence to support the trial court determination that corel imposes the conditions set forth on the rebate form and does not impose additional undisclosed conditions.
ii corel established that its rebate offers were not misleading 
bivens suggests that by failing to list all of the material terms of the rebate offers on the front of the packages,and instead using only the statement get cash back corel has misled consumers into thinking that they would automatically receive a cash back rebate upon purchasing corel or corel.we disagree.
by their breadth,sections and encompass not only those advertisements which have deceived or misled because they are untrue,but also those which may be accurate on some level,but will nonetheless tend to mislead or deceive a perfectly true statement couched in such a manner that it is likely to mislead or deceive the consumer,such as by failure to disclose other relevant information,is actionable under these sections.day v.at t th,d.whether conduct or advertising is misleading under these statutory provisions is determined by applying a reasonable consumer standard.lavie procter gamble th,d lavie.
the parties do not dispute the facts pertaining to corel advertising the wording of the rebate offers and the terms and restrictions listed on the rebate forms is not in question.therefore,whether corel rebate offer is likely to mislead reasonable consumers is a question of law.see chern bank of america cal d,see also lavie,supra,th at,d.
printed immediately under the rebate offers of cash back were the words see inside for details.thus,potential purchasers were,at the very least,on notice that the rebate offers were not unconditional.it was clear to any potential purchaser that he or she would have to purchase the product and open it in order to learn the details of the rebate offer the phrase see inside for details indicates that some conditions will apply to the rebate offer 
bivens also claims that corel rebate offers constituted bait advertising,a form of advertising he contends is explicitly prohibited by section.again,we disagree.corel offered consumers a software package for sale for a certain price.those consumers received what they paid for.corel also offered eligible consumers the opportunity to receive some amount of the purchase price back in the form of a rebate.those consumers who met the requirements of the rebate offer,as detailed on the rebate form contained inside the software package,received a rebate.those consumers who did not meet the specified requirements did not receive a rebate.there is no evidence that corel rebate offer constituted a bait and switch scheme.
finally,bivens contends that the trial court improperly required him to present survey evidence demonstrating that the rebate offers were likely to mislead the public.however,there is nothing in the trial court minute order to suggest that the court imposed this requirement on bivens.the court noted that even if it had considered the mcmillan declaration,the declaration would have been insufficient to establish that the rebate offers were likely to mislead the public,citing freeman time cir freeman,and lavie,supra,th,d.neither of these cases requires that the plaintiff present survey evidence.rather,they stand for the proposition that the reasonable consumer standard applies to the question whether particular conduct is likely to mislead the public.see freeman,supra,at lavie,supra,th at,d.the reasonable consumer standard is the proper standard to apply in determining whether corel rebate offers were likely to mislead the public.however,even if the trial court had required bivens to present survey evidence showing that the rebate offers were likely to mislead the public,summary judgment would still have been appropriate because bivens failed to provide any evidence demonstrating that corel rebate offers were likely to mislead the public 
corel made a prima facie showing that the rebate offers did not violate section 
bivens maintains corel failed to make a prima facie showing that it was entitled to summary judgment on his claims that corel rebate offers violate section.
section provides in relevant part 
a it is unlawful for any person to offer a coupon that is in any manner untrue or misleading.
b it is unlawful for any person to offer a coupon described as free or as a gift,prize,or other similar term if the recipient of the coupon is required to pay money or buy any goods or services to obtain or use the coupon,and the person offering the coupon or anyone honoring the coupon made the majority of his or her sales in the preceding year in connection with one or more free,gift,prize,or similarly described coupons.
c for purposes of this section 
coupon includes any coupon,certificate,document,discount,or similar matter that purports to entitle the user of the coupon to obtain goods or services for free or for a special or reduced price.
bivens alleges that corel rebate offers violate both subdivisions a and b of section because they are false misleading and because they require that a consumer purchase the corel product in order to receive cash back.
subdivision a prohibition against untrue or misleading coupons corresponds with the ucl prohibition against false or misleading advertising.we have already determined that the rebate offers were neither false nor misleading under the ucl.for the same reasons,corel rebate offers do not violate subdivision a of section.
with regard to subdivision b of section,we conclude that a rebate offer of the kind made by corel for purchases of corel and corel does not constitute an offer of a coupon described as free or as a gift,prize,or other similar term.corel rebate offers were never described to consumers as free or as constituting a gift or prize.rather,it was clear that a consumer would be eligible to receive a rebate only after purchasing a corel or corel software package.there was no offer of a free rebate coupon.a rebate consists of a return of part of a payment,serving as a discount or reduction.black law dictionary ed.a rebate,by its very terms,is based on the existence of a previous purchase.thus,a rebate could not be offered as free.rebate offers such as those involved in this case do not fall within the scope of section,subdivision b.of alcoholic beverage control miller brewing th,d rebate is not the same as a gift or free goods.
bivens failed to demonstrate the existence of any triable issue of material fact 
because corel made a prima facie showing that its rebate offers did not violate sections,or,the burden shifted to bivens to demonstrate the existence of a triable issue of material fact.see aguilar,supra,cal th at,d.he failed to meet this burden.
bivens raised no issue of fact that remained unresolved after corel established that consumers were provided with the material terms of the rebate offers,including the conditions that the consumer must purchase the product within a certain time period the consumer must complete and send in the rebate form together with the original upc code and an original or legible copy of the receipt by a date certain the consumer was limited to one rebate per name or household and the consumer could not combine the rebate with any other promotions.rather,the only facts bivens submitted to the trial court were undisputed and served to further demonstrate the reasons corel denied mcmillan rebate requests.
mcmillan receipt for his purchase of two packages of corel showed that both packages were bought by a single purchaser using the same mastercard on a single occasion.this submission violated the restriction allowing only
