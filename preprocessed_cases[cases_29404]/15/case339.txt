plaintiff iq products brought suit against defendants pandora manufacturing,formerly known as snap products,and pennzoil products,alleging that defendants falsely advertised their competing tire inflator product,in violation of the lanham act.the district court granted summary judgment in favor of defendants.for the reasons given below,we affirm.
this case involves competing tire inflator products.plaintiff iq products iq manufactures tire inflators under the brand names repair safe,airup,and primis.defendant pandora manufacturing,formerly known as snap products,and later defendant pennzoil products pennzoil manufactures a competing tire inflator called iq alleges that from early to february,the defendants failed to label the product as flammable and falsely advertised as in violation of the lanham act.accordingly,iq argues that it is entitled to lost profits,disgorgement of defendants profits,and attorneys fees.
a tire inflator is a can of chemicals under pressure that a motorist uses to repair a leak in an automobile tire until a more permanent repair or replacement can be made.a motorist uses a tire inflator to inject pressurized gas into a tire to inflate it and also to patch the leak with a liquid sealant.tire inflators may be dangerous if their formula is flammable or explosive because repairmen making permanent repairs to damaged tires use metal tools and occasionally weld wheel rims while working on damaged tires.these activities may create sparks,which can cause a fire or explosion.
snap products began manufacturing and marketing in.in early,snap introduced a new formula of,which is at issue in this lawsuit.iq contends that this generation of was both flammable and explosive.on november,snap sold and its snap trade name to pennzoil pennzoil continued to sell snap formula of until january,when pennzoil slightly modified the formula.both parties agree that this slight change did not significantly alter the flammability or explosiveness of the product for purposes of this lawsuit.pennzoil continued to sell this slightly modified version of until february,when it recalled the product and began selling a new formula of.
iq argues that from early to february,the formula was flammable and explosive nevertheless,iq alleges that the defendants failed to label properly as flammable or extremely flammable as required by federal law.iq also maintains that the defendants falsely advertised that was.
iq brought suit against snap in june,alleging that the defendants false advertising violated the lanham act.pandora snap new corporate name filed an answer and counterclaim against iq.in august,pennzoil intervened and filed a complaint against iq.iq then counterclaimed against pennzoil.
the district court granted the defendants motion for partial summary judgment on march.the district court concluded that iq claims that the defendants falsely advertised as were limited to the defendants alleged failure to label properly as flammable and so construed,iq flammability claims did not survive summary judgment.on july,the district court granted final summary judgment for the defendants on the remaining issues.iq now appeals.
iq first argues that the district court erred by granting summary judgment for the defendants on iq claims that the defendants falsely advertised as in violation of the lanham act.we review the district court grant of summary judgment de novo 
as an initial matter,we must resolve whether the district court properly limited iq claims to the defendants failure to label cans as flammable.iq maintains that its complaint should not be so narrowly construed,but should be read to allege that the defendants also affirmatively advertised as.
the district court rejected this argument in its march,order granting partial summary judgment to the defendants and later clarified its holding in its july,order.the district court reasoned that 
iq never pled any claims related to flammability under the lanham act other than the failure to label the can.iq never amended its pleading to expand its claim to include other affirmative representations of.discovery has long been closed,trial is imminent,and the time has passed when such an amendment would not be severely prejudicial to defendants 
after reviewing the record,we agree.iq complaint nowhere alleges that the defendants affirmatively misrepresented as.on the contrary,the complaint states,in relevant part,that 
these misrepresentations have occurred because i snap has required by federal its as flammable,thereby falsely representing that is when,indeed,it is not and ii snap has falsely represented as containing a formula.
admitting that it never expressly alleged that the defendants affirmatively represented that was,iq urges this court to interpret the term,as used in the complaint,to include within its scope the term.this argument is unpersuasive.throughout its complaint,iq consistently treats its claims that the defendants failed to label as flammable and that they affirmatively advertised the product as as two distinct concepts.moreover,while the two terms are related,they are not mutually exclusive significantly,according to the ordinary understanding of the terms,material may be is,tend to not being explosive given the lack of any assertion in the complaint that the defendants made affirmative misrepresentations that was and iq failure to amend its complaint in a timely fashion,we conclude that the district court correctly limited iq flammability claims to the defendant alleged failure to label the cans as flammable.
iq next argues that the district court improperly granted summary judgment for the defendants on its claims that the defendants failed to properly label as flammable or extremely flammable as required by federal law.iq asserts that the omission of the word flammable from label misled consumers into believing that the product had passed the flame extension test required under c vii.
the lanham act imposes liability on a ny person who uses in commerce any false or misleading description of fact,or false or misleading representation of fact,which in commercial advertising or promotion,misrepresents the nature,characteristics,qualities,or geographic origin of his or her or another person goods,services,or commercial activities.as explained more fully below,the district court granted summary judgment for the defendants on iq failure to label claims primarily because it reasoned that iq was attempting to use the lanham act to circumvent the federal hazardous substances act fhsa a brief overview of federal regulation of hazardous substances is therefore appropriate.
the fhsa establishes a comprehensive scheme of product regulation and labeling the consumer product safety commission cpsc is responsible for enforcing the fhsa and promulgating,interpreting,and enforcing regulations under the fsha the cpsc has the discretion to exempt substances from the fhsa full requirements and to determine whether to prosecute fhsa violations the fhsa does not authorize a private cause of action.
since,iq has complained about to the federal trade commission ftc and the cpsc.the ftc referred iq complaint to the national highway traffic safety administration,which declined to take any regulatory action.likewise,the cpsc investigated and refused to take further action.
the district court granted partial summary judgment for the defendants on iq failure to label claims in its march,order.the district court explained that by bringing a lanham act claim against defendants for failing to properly label,iq is impermissibly attempting to circumvent the fhsa by converting the lanham act into a vehicle to enforce the fhsa,which bars private actions,and to usurp the regulatory function of the cpsc here.in reaching this conclusion,the district court relied on three cases,which we discuss below.
first,in mylan laboratories,matkari the plaintiff drug manufacturer brought a lanham act claim against a competing drug manufacturer and its officers,alleging that the defendants use of package inserts,brochures,and advertisements violated the lanham act because these materials falsely represented or implied that the drugs
