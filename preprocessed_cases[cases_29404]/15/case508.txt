siegfried lifanda purchased a dodge caravan from elmhurst dodge on july,which he financed by entering into a retail installment contract.as part of the vehicle purchase,elmhurst dodge also sold lifanda auto theft registration protection atr,which was an etching identification program that promised to pay lifanda the lesser of or the amount paid by his insurance company,if his vehicle was stolen within three years from the date of purchase.the atr was issued by defendant united security systems,for and was underwritten by an insurance company.lifanda complains that the atr is a form of property insurance protecting against theft of the vehicle,and that the defendants violated the truth in lending act tila,et,by failing to include the atr charge as part of the finance charge.
the district court granted elmhurst dodge motion to dismiss the tila claim,and declined to exercise jurisdiction over the remaining state law claims.the court noted that the tila requires lenders to clearly and accurately disclose the finance charges that customers will bear in credit transactions,citing a,and that tila includes insurance premiums in its definition of finance charges.tila provides that 
charges or premiums for insurance,written in connection with any consumer credit transaction,against loss of or damage to property shall be included in the finance charge unless a clear and specific statement in writing is furnished by the creditor to the person to whom the credit is extended,setting forth the cost of the insurance if obtained from or through the creditor,and stating that the person to whom the credit is extended may choose the person through which the insurance is to be obtained.
c.the regulation implementing that provision,referred to as regulation z,largely tracks that language,stating that premiums for insurance against loss or damage may be excluded from the disclosure requirements if the consumer is informed that the insurance coverage may be obtained from a person of the consumer choice and,for insurance obtained through the creditor,the consumer is notified of the amount of the premium,and the term of the insurance.d.the district court held that the disclosures made by the defendants satisfied those requirements,and thus granted the motion to dismiss.
on appeal,lifanda asserts that the court erred in holding that the disclosures made by the defendants satisfied the tila requirements as a matter of law.specifically,regulation z mandates that the tila disclosures be made clearly and conspicuously,and lifanda argues that the court could not properly find as a matter of law that the alleged disclosures were clear and conspicuous here.as an initial matter,we note that although the motion in this case was brought pursuant to rule b,we have made it clear that rule b is not the appropriate vehicle for such a dismissal.smith of illinois,cir walker national recovery,cir.as in,allegations that disclosures are not clear and conspicuous state a claim upon which relief may be granted.id.the possibility that the allegation is that attachments to the complaint demonstrate its not mean that the complaint fails to state a claim.instead the attachments authorize the district court to grant judgment on the pleadings under rule c,or to convert the motion to dismiss into a motion for summary judgment and to grant that relief a possibility raised by rule b itself,at.therefore,the motion should have been converted into one for judgment on the pleadings or for summary judgment.in any event,we review the court decision de novo,examining all facts alleged in the complaint and any inferences reasonably drawn therefrom in the light most favorable to the plaintiff.flenner sheahan,cir autry northwest premium services,cir.we will uphold dismissal of a complaint only if the plaintiff can prove no set of facts in support of his claim that would entitle him to relief.id.
we view the sufficiency of disclosures from the standpoint of an ordinary consumer,not the perspective of a federal reserve board member,federal judge,or english professor.smith cash store management,cir,quoting cemail viking dodge.therefore,our task is to determine whether,taking the facts in the light most favorable to lifanda,the tila disclosures were clear and conspicuous to an ordinary consumer as a matter of law.the defendants in fact rely upon three different documents to satisfy the tila disclosures here,which are reproduced in relevant part in the appendix to this opinion according to the defendants,the retail installment contract informed lifanda that he could obtain atr insurance elsewhere,the purchase order revealed the premium for the atr protection,and the atr form set forth the term of the atr protection.
we turn first to the retail installment contract,which provides in pertinent part 
liability insurance coverage for bodily injury and property damage caused to others is not included in this contract.you may obtain vehicle insurance from a person of your choice.
credit life,credit disability,guaranteed automotive protection coverage,and other optional insurance are not required to obtain credit and will not be provided unless you sign and agree to pay the premium.
immediately below those clauses,the contract contains four boxes,with a space to be checked if that box is applicable.three of the boxes are respectively labeled,credit life,credit disability,and mechanical breakdown,with the fourth being generically labeled type.within each box,there are spaces for the following information to be provided a term,b premium,and c insurer.each box also contains a line for the consumer to sign if she wants to purchase that optional insurance.none of the boxes are checked which indicates that no insurance is being provided under the contract,and next to each space premium,insurer,is typed for not applicable.
the defendants maintain that the above section clearly and conspicuously informs lifanda of his right to obtain atr insurance elsewhere.that argument,however,is problematic on a number of levels.first,the sentences must be read in context rather than in isolation.the first sentence of the initial sentence paragraph informs the purchaser that certain types of injury and property damage caused to not included in the contract.immediately following that sentence is the statement that you may obtain vehicle insurance from a person of your choice.an ordinary construction of that paragraph would lead the reader to conclude that liability coverage for bodily injury or property damage caused to others is not included in the contract,but may be obtained from other persons.it says nothing about insurance that is provided in the contract.we simply can not conclude as a matter of law that the statement provides clear and conspicuous notice that atr protection included in the contract may be obtained elsewhere.
our concerns are magnified by another problem,which is the failure of any document to identify atr protection as a form of insurance.in fact,although they concede the point solely for the purpose of the motion to dismiss,the defendants otherwise maintain that atr protection is not insurance.given that even the defendants are not certain that atr protection should be considered insurance,and that the documents do not identify it as such,it is particularly unconvincing for the defendants to argue that a sentence informing lifanda of the right to obtain vehicle insurance elsewhere is clear and conspicuous notice that he can obtain atr protection from others.
finally,this potential for confusion is further heightened by the section that follows the one quoted above.as is set forth above,the subsequent text provides that credit life,credit disability,guaranteed automotive protection,and other optional insurance are not required and will not be provided unless the buyer signs and agrees to pay the premium.four boxes following that text set forth those categories,with the last box generically labeled type,presumably to include the category of other optional insurance.like the other boxes,however,that box is not checked and is marked for not applicable.that indicates that no optional insurance is being provided under
