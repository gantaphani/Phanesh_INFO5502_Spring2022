we must decide whether a potential home buyer has established a prima facie claim for discrimination against the seller listing agents,under various federal and state statutes,for a rejected offer where she and they were of different races.
pamela mcdonald,an,sought to buy a house in the,california area for herself and her children in.her real estate agent kanya coleman,also an,contacted first shasta real estate first shasta,a franchisee of coldwell banker real estate coldwell,and spoke with first shasta agent tom gallagher,a caucasian,over the phone.they planned to meet to view homes for sale.prior to the meeting with gallagher,coleman prepared a letter on her stationery confirming that mcdonald qualified for a real estate loan of up to.the approval was subject to an acceptable appraisal at or above the purchase price mcdonald monthly income was approximately and she had cash on hand in the amount of.
on august,coleman and mcdonald met with gallagher for the first time.according to both coleman and mcdonald,gallagher did not express the same enthusiasm he had when speaking to coleman on the phone.gallagher showed mcdonald a number of listings,including the galaxy way property at issue in this case.after viewing that house,coleman and mcdonald claim that gallagher offered to show them additional properties that he believed might be more suitable for mcdonald and her family,but the properties were less upscale.however,it is undisputed that coleman,alone,picked out the houses mcdonald looked at.
mcdonald particularly liked the galaxy way property,which had been listed for sale at for over six weeks and coleman drew up an offer.coleman told gallagher and his broker,richard mattioli,also caucasian,that her client needed to finance one hundred percent of the purchase price,but in return she was willing to offer more money than the seller was asking.mcdonald tendered a good faith deposit.
while coleman was drafting the offer mcdonald claims that gallagher,noting her use of a walking cane,inquired about how she became disabled and the demographics of where she lived.
mcdonald initial offer on the property was for a purchase price of,of which would be paid directly to moore funded by a loan and a deposit by mcdonald and would be carried by moore secured by a second deed of trust.the offer provided that mcdonald would receive a credit at closing.gallagher and mattioli experienced doubts about the proposal.they had not done seller carrybacks for years and felt it was not necessary in their market they decided to talk it over with the seller agent,david woodfill,a caucasian,to see if he thought the offer was worth presenting to his client,glenn moore,a caucasian,the owner and seller of the galaxy way property.woodfill said moore wanted all cash and was not interested in carrying paper.both woodfill and moore were also concerned that the mcdonald offer would not close escrow because the property would not appraise for more than ten percent above the listing price.woodfill told gallagher and mattioli that the mcdonald offer would be unacceptable to moore,so they did not present it to woodfill or moore in written form.in any event,coleman faxed the offer to woodfill without modification,despite having been told that moore would not accept the carryback provision.a few days later,moore accepted another offer,with no carryback and no refund of closing costs,at slightly less than the asking price.the ultimate buyer,john randall donoghue,was caucasian.
mcdonald filed a complaint against gallagher,mattioli,shasta and coldwell banker collectively listing agents,but not against woodfill or moore himself,with the california department of fair employment and housing dfeh,which found no evidence of discrimination.its letter of july stated 
based on the evidence obtained during the investigation,the dfeh has determined that reasonable cause does not exist to believe that a discriminatory housing practice has occurred.
the department of housing and urban development hud through its office of fair housing and equal opportunity,adopted the decision of the dfeh and notified mcdonald that under the provisions of the federal fair housing act,she had two years after the occurrence or termination of the alleged discriminatory housing practice to file suit in federal court.this time limit was tolled during hud investigation.
mcdonald filed her federal lawsuit against the listing agents for housing discrimination on the basis of race and disability she asserted claims under california fair employment and housing act feha,california unruh act unruh act,and the federal fair housing act fha.coleman,as mcdonald real estate agent,sued the listing agents under california business and professions code,for the commission she lost as a result of the lost sale of the property.
the district court granted summary judgment in favor of the listing agents on all the claims.
a prima facie case is established under the feha where the plaintiff shows that she is a member of a protected class,that she applied and was qualified for a housing accommodation,was denied such housing accommodation,and that similarly situated individuals not in a protected class applied for and obtained housing,or if she provide s other circumstantial evidence of discriminatory motive in refusing her the housing accommodation.dep t of fair employment and hous.superior court,th,d citing gamble city of escondido,cir.a qualified purchaser is one who meets the terms of the seller.see mitchell shane,cir.
in mitchell,the potential buyer made an offer that required percent financing,which the seller rejected,expressing a desire to have at most percent financing.id.at.in response,the potential buyer dropped the financing to percent.therefore,because the potential buyer met the terms of the seller,the buyer was qualified.id.
here,the undisputed fact is that the seller refused to engage in a seller carryback provision.indeed,the basis of this refusal was communicated to coleman,who nevertheless transmitted the offer in writing,unchanged,to the seller agent,woodfill.because neither coleman nor mcdonald attempted to meet the terms of the seller,they can not be considered qualified for purposes of establishing a prima facie case.moreover,because the mcdonald offer included a seller carryback provision notwithstanding a purchase price ten percent above the list price,she can not say that she was similarly situated to the person who eventually purchased the house for just under the list price amount.in other words,coleman and mcdonald have not produced any evidence to create a genuine issue of material fact regarding whether or not they met the terms of the seller or whether the terms were similar to those met by the ultimate buyer 
despite not being similarly situated to the ultimate buyer,mcdonald could also try to establish that there is circumstantial evidence of discriminatory motive in refusing her the housing accommodation.dep t of fair employment and,th at,d.a discriminatory motive under the feha has been defined as something that moves the will and induces action.caldwell paramount unified sch,th,d.
however,despite allegations of awkwardness or lack of enthusiasm,neither coleman nor mcdonald has produced any evidence that gallagher or mattioli disparaged coleman or mcdonald on account of their race or that gallagher or mattioli treated only or disabled individuals the way they treated mcdonald.most significantly,there has been no evidence presented by either coleman or mcdonald that the ultimate buyer in this case was aided by or was a customer of gallagher or mattioli.in other words,there is no evidence that any of the listing agents acted with the intent to secure the purchase of the house by a person who is of a different race than mcdonald 
because coleman and mcdonald have failed to produce any evidence establishing that mcdonald was qualified,similarly situated or that gallagher or mattioli had a discriminatory motive they can not establish a prima facie case under feha based on either race or disability 
with respect to the fha claim,the standard of proof and analysis applied in a disparate treatment case are the same as those applied in a feha case see gamble,at.the plaintiff must first establish a prima facie case by showing she is a member of a protected class she applied for a house and was qualified to buy it the home sale was denied despite her being qualified and defendant approved a home sale for a similarly situated party during a period relatively near the time plaintiff was denied the house.id.
for the reasons discussed in the feha claim analysis mcdonald was not a qualified buyer within the meaning of the fha and mcdonald was not similarly situated to the party who purchased the home.thus,mcdonald failed to establish a prima facie fha claim.
coleman unfair competition claim is based on california business and professions code,which states that unfair competition shall mean and include any unlawful,unfair or fraudulent business act or practice cal.bus.because neither coleman nor mcdonald has produced any evidence of fraud or illegal activity,in order to prevail,coleman must establish that gallagher and mattioli acted unfairly towards her or mcdonald.
an unfair business practice is one that either offends an established public policy or is immoral,unethical,oppressive,unscrupulous or substantially injurious to consumers.people casa blanca convalescent homes,d,abrogated on other grounds commc ns,los angeles cellular,cal th,d.
coleman mainly rests her claim on alleged discrimination by gallagher and mattioli however,as mentioned above,there is no evidence which would allow a reasonable jury to return a verdict in her favor.see anderson liberty lobby,d.furthermore,despite coleman and mcdonald characterization of the listing agents actions,they offer no factual evidence upon which a reasonable jury could return a verdict for them finding that a failure physically to convey mcdonald offer was immoral,unethical,oppressive or unscrupulous.casa blanca convalescent homes,d at.
finally,we turn to the question of whether coldwell banker can be held liable under a theory.
generally,a finding of vicarious liability is determined by traditional common law principles.meyer holley,d.because there is no evidence of illegal conduct on the part of gallagher,mattioli or first shasta,there is no conduct for which coldwell could be held vicariously liable.
the district court grant of summary judgment in favor of the listing agents on all claims is 
pamela mcdonald mcdonald,an woman seeking to relocate to a predominately white community in another city,asks kanya coleman coleman,her real estate agent,to present an offer on a residential property for sale in that community.coleman testified,and defendants do not suggest otherwise,that mcdonald was for financing.indeed,mcdonald had a steady income of per month,in addition to in additional funds on hand.working through a real estate agency in the community where the property is located,they present an offer.the offer is above the asking price,but contains a condition common to residential real estate transactions that the bulk of the purchase price be funded with a mortgage and the remainder with a comparatively small loan from the seller to the buyer.
the seller,apparently thinking that the condition requires him to pay the buyer money,declines the offer.the local agents never explain to the seller or his agent that the is in fact additional money to be paid to him over time,with market rate interest and secured by the property itself.instead,without ever consulting mcdonald or coleman,they withdraw the offer.later,the property is sold to a buyer for a price less than the mcdonald fact,less than that offer even excluding the.when the terms of the mcdonald offer are presented to the seller at his deposition,he finds it acceptable and reasonable and testified he would have followed up on it.when coleman described the offer to the seller agent,he was puzzled why the he considers a good one was not submitted to the seller for his consideration.
the majority looks at these facts and concludes it was appropriate to award the local agents summary judgment on the grounds that mcdonald was not a qualified buyer because she refused to meet the seller terms.while my reading of the record is quite different with respect to such matters as the actual terms of mcdonald offer,the seller terms,and mcdonald efforts to adjust her offer,these are fact intensive questions that are wholly inappropriate for resolution on summary judgment.mcdonald is entitled to a jury trial to determine whether the actions of the local agents were the result of discriminatory motives or mere bumbling miscommunication.
in reviewing a summary judgment grant,our task is to view the evidence in the light most favorable to the party and draw all reasonable inferences in favor of that party,bank of new york fremont general,cir,and then decide whether a genuine issue as to any material fact precludes summary judgment.porter california dep t of,cir.contrary to this duty,the majority has drawn numerous inferences in favor of the defendants,and has recast disputed material facts as undisputed.
the majority first fails to recognize that mcdonald offer is at least equivalent to the ultimate purchase price.in fact,her offer amounted to at least,minus only the closing costs donoghue,the ultimate buyer,prepared an initial offer of,minus of the closing costs.donoghue ultimately purchased the property for again,minus the seller share of the closing costs.however one slices it,mcdonald offer surpassed donoghue first offer and was at least equivalent to the ultimate selling price.the alleged defect in the mcdonald offer is that the offer included an additional amount over the a carryback of,which mcdonald proposed would be carried by the seller and secured by a second deed of trust but even if we assume that the seller was completely unwilling to do any financing,mcdonald offer was still equivalent to the ultimate selling price.
after ignoring the actual terms of the mcdonald offer,the majority states that the seller refused to engage in a seller carryback provision and that neither coleman nor mcdonald attempted to meet the terms of the seller.by my reading,these statements are flatly contradicted by the record.
in concluding that the seller refused to engage in a seller carryback provision,the majority contradicts the seller own testimony.in fact,the seller refusal to accept a carryback was based on his misunderstanding of what was on the table.the seller apparently believed that the carryback was to be deducted from the rather than added to it,and he was not interested in doing that 
my understanding was,that we got a full asking price,and had to be carried back out of that amount.i was not told and out of that so i do know what that going to do to the case,but mean i not stupid.if i get my money,plus in payments i remember full price,carry back.that all he said,and i said no.i ca afford to take back.
in response to a deposition question describing the essentials of the mcdonald offer the seller testified that he would have considered such an offer both reasonable and acceptable,and would have wanted to follow up on it.coleman stated that when she called the seller agent and described the mcdonald offer,he was puzzled why such a good offer was not submitted to the seller.
viewing this evidence,as we must,in the light most favorable to mcdonald and coleman,the seller did not refuse to engage in a seller carryback provision,but rather was simply confused as to its meaning.the evidence suggests that,had the seller understood that the carryback was above and beyond the cash portion of the offer,he would have considered the offer.
even if the seller did have some aversion to receiving an additional through a carryback,there is no evidence that coleman and mcdonald failed to attempt to meet such a term.in fact,coleman testified that she tried to speak to local agent mattioli about submitting a revised offer but he became hostile.
in addition,woodfill,the seller agent,testified that he does recall local agent gallagher going over the terms of mcdonald offer with him,but received a call from first shasta gallagher and mattioli office that the offer had been withdrawn.co
