this appeal arises from a credit card solicitation that plaintiff raquel rubio received from defendant capital one bank.the solicitation disclosed a fixed annual percentage rate of on purchases and balance transfers and named three conditions under which that rate could increase.about three and a half years after rubio applied for and received capital one credit card,the interest rate on purchases and balance transfers increased to,even though none of the three triggering conditions occurred.rubio filed suit,alleging violations of the truth in lending act tila,the california unfair competition law ucl,and a breach of contract.the district court dismissed each of these claims under federal rule of civil procedure b,and rubio appealed.we reverse in part,affirm in part,and remand.
rubio first amended complaint alleged that in or about february,she received a credit card solicitation in the mail from capital one,informing rubio in an opening letter that she had been for a capital one platinum mastercard featuring a low fixed apr on balance transfers and purchases.in the solicitation schumer box,a table required by federal law,the credit card apr for purchases was described as a fixed rate of,with the words in type and the number printed in large,bold type.next to the schumer box prominent heading,annual percentage rate apr for purchases,was an asterisk linked to a paragraph printed just below the schumer box.that paragraph stated in type 
all your annual percentage rates aprs are subject to increase if any of the following conditions conditions occur i you fail to make a payment to us when due ii your account is overlimit iii or your payment is returned for any reason.all aprs will change with the beginning of the billing period after the period in which the condition occurred.the first time any of the conditions occur sic,your purchase and special transfer aprs if applicable may be increased to a rate of annual percentage rate daily periodic rate.if any of the conditions occur sic twice within any period,all of your aprs may be increased to a rate of annual percentage rate daily periodic rate.
outside the schumer box,but farther down on the same page,there was a heading that read terms of offer.under that heading,printed in type,the solicitation provided,as part of the terms i will receive the capital one customer agreement and am bound by its terms and future revisions thereof.my agreement terms for example,rates and fees are subject to change.
rubio applied for the capital one mastercard,and received it,along with a cardholder agreement,in march.in the agreement,capital one reserved the right to amend or change any part of your agreement,including periodic rates and other charges,or add or remove requirements at any time.
according to the first amended complaint,the capital one mastercard provided rubio with a apr on all balance transfers and purchases from march to august.rubio never submitted a late payment,exceeded her credit limit,or had her payment returned.on august,however,rubio received written notification from capital one that her apr of would increase to.rubio could avoid the increase only by closing her credit card account and paying off the balance on the card by september.neither of rubio two complaints alleges whether rubio chose to retain or to close her account.
rubio first amended complaint included claims for breach of contract and violation of the ucl,and attached the capital one mastercard solicitation as an exhibit.after briefing,the district court dismissed the breach of contract claim.
rubio then filed a second amended complaint that made very slight changes in factual allegations and added a tila claim to the existing ucl claim.like the first amended complaint,it attached capital one solicitation as an exhibit.capital one moved to dismiss rubio tila and ucl claims,and the district court granted the motion.
in reviewing de novo the district court rule b dismissal,we,like the district court,consider the credit card solicitation,see parks sch.of,symington,cir,as well as the cardholder agreement,which capital one submitted but whose contents are alleged in the complaint and whose authenticity no party questions,branch tunnell,cir,overruled on other grounds by galbraith county of santa clara,cir.
credit card solicitations are among the credit disclosures that tila regulates.tila requires that all such solicitations disclose,among other information,e ach annual percentage rate applicable to extensions of credit under the credit card agreement.c a i i.this apr disclosure must be made clearly and conspicuously,id.a,and in the form of a table,id.c a.this table is popularly called the schumer box.
tila also delegates to the federal reserve board of governors the duty to implement tila disclosure requirements.id.a.under that delegation,the board has promulgated regulation z,pt,to which provisions we defer unless demonstrably irrational.ford motor credit milhollin.to implement tila mandate that a schumer box disclose credit card aprs,regulation z requires a schumer box to disclose e ach periodic rate that may be used to compute the finance charge on an outstanding balance,expressed as an annual percentage rate.a b.regulation z provides that this apr disclosure,like other disclosures,must reflect the terms of the legal obligation between creditor and consumer.id.c.
in applying tila and its implementing regulations,we require absolute compliance by creditors,hauk jp morgan chase bank usa,cir,and e ven technical or minor violations of the tila impose liability on the creditor,jackson grant,cir.
in her only unwaived tila claim,rubio contends that the schumer box in capital one solicitation misleadingly disclosed the aprs that could be charged under the cardholder agreement.according to rubio,by describing the apr as fixed at and listing only three conditions under which the apr could be changed,the schumer box misled her into believing that rate could increase only if one of the three specified events occurred.in doing so,rubio argues,capital one disclosure did not accurately reflect the terms of the cardholder agreement,which reserved the right to change the rate for any reason at all.
capital one first argues that its disclosure was literally true,because the rate could change under any of the three events in the paragraph linked by asterisk to the schumer box.it relies on our decision in hauk,which it interprets to reject the notion that tila prohibits not only literal falsities,but also misleading statements.at quoting rossman fleet bank,cir.we disagree with this reading of hauk.
by parting ways from the third circuit expansive reading of regulation z,hauk did not condone misleading disclosures.it simply rejected the argument that tila liability could be based on disclosures that were misleading about anything at it called misleading in the abstract.id.it did not hold that a creditor was allowed to mislead consumers about information that tila specifically requires be disclosed.hauk held that a creditor does not violate tila merely by offering a promotional apr to a consumer who the creditor knows is ineligible for the promotional apr,as long as the conditions for imposing the higher nonpromotional apr are properly disclosed.an undeclared intent to impose the higher apr is not included in the information tila and regulation z require to be disclosed.see id.at.
by contrast,tila and regulation z do require a schumer box to disclose credit card aprs.c a i i a b.this disclosure must be clear and conspicuous,u.a a,which,for purposes of credit card solicitations,is defined in the official staff commentary to regulation z as in a reasonably understandable form and readily noticeable to the consumer.pt.supp.i,para.a,cmt.see also barrer chase bank usa,cir noting that the official staff commentary is owed deference.thus,regulation z prohibits a schumer box from making misleading apr disclosures,where misleading means a disclosure that a reasonable consumer will either not understand or not readily notice.see barrer,at adopting reasonable cardholder standard.put differently,an apr disclosure that is not clear and conspicuous is ipso facto misleading.
the schumer box and the paragraph linked to it by an asterisk described the apr as fixed and listed only three events under which the apr could increase.we conclude that capital one can not show that,as a matter of law,this disclosure is clear and conspicuous.
although clarity and conspicuousness is a question of law,see barrer,at rossman,at,empirical evidence is helpful in determining what a reasonable consumer will understand and readily notice.fortunately,evidence on how a reasonable consumer will understand the term fixed rate is available from the federal reserve board of governors,the very agency tasked with implementing tila.the board has relied on that evidence in promulgating a new regulation that generally prohibits creditors from using the term fixed.see united states woods,cir noting that under,the federal register must be judicially noticed.where such persuasive and directly relevant evidence is available,armchair empiricism is comparatively unhelpful in determining how a reasonable consumer will read a solicitation.
in,the board retained a research firm to conduct consumer testing and design improved credit card disclosures based on the results of the testing.see macro int l,design and testing of effective truth in lending disclosures,available at.the firm prepared model credit card disclosures and conducted several rounds of interviews of credit cardholders.those recruited to participate in the study were intended to represent the full range of demographic characteristics and financial experience in the cardholding public.id.at,see also id.app.
in the early rounds of interviews,the study found that participants frequently assume that a rate that is labeled fixed can not be changed for any reason.id.at see also id.at when asked to define what a fixed rate was,most participants said that it was a rate that would not change.id.at when asked what it meant if a rate was labeled fixed,most participants responded that these rates would not change for any reason.so pervasive was this assumption that the term fixed was removed from models in later rounds.id.at.
based on this research as well as later research by the same firm,the federal reserve board promulgated revisions to regulation z that became effective july.see truth in lending.based on the research,the revisions specify that in the schumer box apr disclosure,
the term fixed,or a similar term,may not be used to describe the annual percentage rate unless the creditor also specifies a time period that the rate will be fixed and the rate will not increase during that period,or if no such time period is provided,the rate will not increase while the plan is open.
id.at to be codified at a iii.under this regulation,a creditor may do what capital one an apr as fixed,without specifying a period during which the apr will remain the if the rate is unchangeable for the life of the card.in explaining the regulation,the board categorized the term fixed as m isleading and stated that it had found through consumer testing that consumers generally believe a fixed rate does not change a lthough creditors often use the term fixed to describe an apr that is not tied to an index,consumers do not understand the term in this manner.id.at cited by id.at.
the new regulation did not become effective until after the events giving rise to this litigation,and thus does not bind us.the form of regulation z that governs this case,however,does prohibit disclosures that a reasonable consumer will not understand.pt.supp.i,para.a,cmt.the new regulation was adopted because the agency that implements tila,relying on empirical evidence,concluded that describing an apr as fixed is misleading to reasonable consumers.what was misleading in and,when the consumer studies were conducted,was also misleading in,when rubio received capital one solicitation.the new regulation and the empirical studies it relies on are therefore relevant and informative for this case.for even where not binding,an agency interpretation of a statute certainly may influence courts facing questions the agenc y ha s already answered.tualatin valley builders supply,united states,cir citation and quotation marks omitted.
here,the board has concluded that fixed is generally interpreted to mean that the rate will not be changed and that the creditor has not reserved the right to change it at a later date.at.we need not go so far as to decide how fixed is generally interpreted.but the board conclusion and the study on which it relies certainly persuade us that fixed can reasonably be interpreted to mean unchangeable.for that reason,it is not clear and conspicuous to describe an apr as fixed when the creditor has reserved the right to change the apr for any reason.
our decision does not make the board new regulation retroactive.the board promulgated its new regulation because,after surveying consumers,it concluded fixed was misleading.that is why the new regulation is relevant and helpful tila has always prohibited misleading apr disclosures.our holding is simply a concrete application of that prohibition.
it is argued that this appeal should be remanded for factual development because fixed can also reasonably be interpreted to mean not tied to an index.see concurrence and dissent at.but it is precisely because reasonable consumers can interpret an ambiguous disclosure in more than one way that such a disclosure can not be clear and conspicuous.see,lifanda elmhurst dodge,cir.furthermore,because tila is liberally construed in favor of the consumer and strictly enforced against the creditor,jackson,at,any misleading disclosure that a reasonable person could read to mean something that is not accurate should be resolved in favor of the consumer.rossman,at.
as a final argument that the term fixed can not be misleading,capital one also relies on the official staff commentary to regulation z,which appears to use fixed to mean not tied to an index rather than unchangeable.see pt.supp.i,para.b,cmt.we find this contention unpersuasive.the staff commentary to regulation z is intended to guide regulated firms and the courts.see id.pt.supp.i,intro.cmt.there is nothing in the staff commentary to indicate that its internal use of variable and fixed defines how a reasonable consumer would interpret the words.as the board has concluded,the best evidence on that question comes from the consumer studies indicating that many reasonable consumers do interpret the term fixed as unchangeable.
capital one,however,argues that it cleared up any misunderstanding the term fixed may have produced by explicitly listing three conditions under which the apr could change and by adding the statement,m y agreement terms for example,rates and fees are subject to change.we do not agree that this statement made capital one disclosure clear and conspicuous as a matter of law.
in the minds of a significant number of consumers,the term fixed means unchangeable.when reading capital one schumer box against that meaning,reasonable consumers could conclude that the apr was unchangeable except for the three exceptions.they could conclude that capital one explicitly mentioned the three conditions precisely because they were the only reasons that the apr could change.our analysis on this point comports with the third circuit decision in roberts fleet bank,cir.
unlike the three triggering conditions,the statement,m y agreement terms for example,rates and fees are subject to change,was placed outside the schumer box and was not linked to it by asterisk.we assume for the sake of argument that in deciding whether a schumer box disclosure was clear and conspicuous,we can take into account statements outside the schumer box and not linked to it by an asterisk even under this assumption,capital one argument fails.there was nothing in the statement,m y agreement terms are subject to change,to indicate that the apr was subject to change for reasons other than the three reasons the schumer box discloses.a reasonable consumer,having concluded from reading the schumer box that the apr could change only for the three reasons expressly enumerated,could have interpreted the statement to mean that the apr was subject to change exclusively for those three reasons.in so holding,we again follow the third circuit.roberts,at.
at issue in this case is not capital one obligation to disclose the provision,but its obligation to disclose the apr clearly and conspicuously.id.at.rubio has stated a tila claim not because capital one failed to disclose its unqualified right to change the terms of the cardholder agreement,but rather because capital one has failed to show as a matter of law that it made its apr disclosure in a reasonably understandable form and readily noticeable to the consumer.pt.supp.i,para.a,cmt.we therefore reverse the district court dismissal of rubio tila claim.
rubio alleges that capital one solicitation also violated the ucl,which prohibits unfair competition,defined as any unlawful,unfair or fraudulent business act or practice and unfair,deceptive,untrue or misleading advertising.cal.bus.west.a business act or practice may violate the ucl if it is either unlawful,unfair,or fraudulent.each of these three adjectives captures a separate and distinct theory of liability.kearns ford motor,cir citing bay chevrolet motors acceptance,d.according to rubio,the solicitation she received violated the ucl under all of these theories of liability.capital one responds that rubio lacks standing to assert a ucl claim,and even if she had standing,her claim fails on its merits.
to assert a ucl claim,a private plaintiff needs to have suffered injury in fact and lost money or property as a result of the unfair competition.cal.bus.this provision requires rubio to show that she has lost money or property sufficient to constitute an injury in fact under article iii of the constitution see birdsong apple,cir,and also requires a causal connection between capital one alleged ucl violation and her injury in fact,hall time,d.
rubio has alleged a loss of money or property.when capital one increased the apr from to,it gave rubio a choice either to close the account and pay off the outstanding balance,or to keep the account open and accept the increased.rubio does not allege which choice she accepted,though either would cause a loss of money or property.if she closed the account,she would have suffered a monetary loss by losing the credit that capital one extended.white trans union,llc,d,ruling that damage to credit was loss of money or property.if she kept her account open,she would have accepted a higher apr and thus also lost money.see troyk farmers group,d,holding that payment of extra money as a result of the defendant action was sufficient for standing.this actual economic injury is enough to create standing under the ucl.aron of,d,birdsong,at holding that hypothetical injury was insufficient for standing.
rubio has also alleged a causal connection between capital one solicitation and the hobson choice she faced.because rubio alleges that she entered into a credit card agreement with capital one due to the solicitation promise of a fixed apr,the choice she faced in august,when she learned of the apr increase,was a result of capital one alleged ucl violation.
rubio has standing to assert her ucl claim.we now consider the merits of the claim under the unlawful,fraudulent,and unfair prongs of the ucl.
by properly alleging a tila violation,rubio has also alleged a ucl violation under the prong of the ucl that prohibits unlawful business acts or practices.see velazquez gmac mortgage,d,troyk,d at.
rubio has also alleged a violation of the fraudulent prong of the ucl.as in tila,this prong of the ucl is governed by the reasonable consumer test a plaintiff may demonstrate a violation by show ing that reasonable members of the public are likely to be deceived.williams gerber prods,cir citations and quotation marks omitted.this deception need not be intended.see in re tobacco ii cases,cal.as we have explained above,a reasonable consumer was indeed likely to be deceived by capital one solicitation.
finally,rubio has stated a claim under ucl unfair prong.california appellate courts disagree on how to define an unfair act or practice in the context of a ucl consumer action.see generally lozano v.at t wireless,cir.under the balancing test to which some courts adhere,rubio may be able to prove facts showing that the harm to the consumer from capital one solicitation outweighed the solicitation utility.id.at.she may,for example,be able to show that removing the term fixed,an action that would have cost capital one nothing,could have prevented consumer confusion.under the alternative test,which requires a plaintiff to show that a practice violates public policy as declared by specific constitutional,statutory or regulatory provisions,gregory albertson,d,rubio has stated a claim by successfully alleging a tila violation.
we therefore reverse the district court dismissal of rubio ucl claim.
the district court also dismissed rubio claim for breach of contract.she alleges that by stating that the credit card apr was fixed at,but later increasing the apr to,capital one breached its contract with her.rubio legal theory is that capital one solicitation was an offer and her application an acceptance.
rubio has not stated a claim.under california law,which according to rubio controls,a binding offer is the manifestation of willingness to enter into a bargain,so made as to justify another person in understanding that his assent to that bargain is invited and will conclude it.donovan rrl corp,cal emphasis added,citation and quotation marks omitted.there is a binding offer only if it is reasonable to conclude,based on all the surrounding circumstances,that acceptance will leave nothing further to negotiate or do before the contract is effective.id.
it would have been unreasonable to believe that capital one solicitation was a binding contractual offer.as the district court noted,the solicitation was generally described as an invitation or application,and it listed a number of contingencies under which her application could be rejected.the solicitation did include a heading entitled terms of offer,but the language of that section made it clear that sending in the application,by itself,did not consummate the contract i hereby apply to capital one bank for a credit card account i will receive the capital one customer agreement and am bound by its terms and future revisions thereof.in lopez charles schwab,the plaintiff had filled out an application form to open an account,which contained the similar statement,i hereby request that schwab open a brokerage account i agree to read and be bound by the terms of the applicable account agreement.d.the court of appeal concluded that t his language indicates lopez did not expect that filling out the application would conclude her bargain with schwab id.the solicitation and application do not constitute an enforceable contract.the language in capital one solicitation is indistinguishable in all relevant aspects from the language in lopez and did not constitute a binding offer.
rubio also argues that the cardholder agreement was unconscionable.under california law,however,unconscionability is an affirmative defense,dean witter reynolds,superior court,not a cause of action,cal.grocers ass bank of,d.rubio as plaintiff can not assert unconscionability as an independent claim for relief.we affirm the district court dismissal of rubio claim for breach of contract.
we affirm the district court dismissal of rubio claim but reverse its dismissal of her claims under tila and the ucl.we remand for further proceedings consistent with this opinion.the parties shall bear their own costs.
reversed in part,affirmed in part,and remanded.
i respectfully concur in and dissent in part.
the district court dismissed this case on the pleadings,reasoning that the required disclosure sufficed as a matter of law.the majority holds that the disclosure is inadequate as a matter of law.in my view,the clarity of the disclosure should be considered an issue of fact for the trier of fact.while a finder of fact could conclude,as the majority does,that the disclosure was unclear,for the reasons explained below i think that a finder of fact also could conclude that the disclosure was clear.
defendant capital one bank told plaintiff raquel rubio that she could apply for a credit card at a fixed rate of.approximately three and a half years after plaintiff obtained a capital one credit card carrying the rate,defendant raised the annual percentage rate apr to.defendant increased the apr because market interest rates had risen,rather than because of any irregularities in plaintiff payments or her use of the account.was there a clear and conspicuous disclosure of the potential for raising the apr,for the purposes of the truth in lending act tila,when the solicitation advertised a fixed rate of but stated on the same page that the rates and fees were subject to change in my view,there was.
in,defendant mailed plaintiff a solicitation to open a credit card account.the solicitation began 
you have been for this offer for a capital one platinum mastercard featuring a low fixed apr on balance transfers and purchases,a credit line up to and no annual membership fee.this is not an introductory rate 
the solicitation repeatedly referred to the apr as fixed.the schumer box,an informative table required by federal regulations,described the annual percentage rate apr for purchases as a fixed rate of.the asterisk directed the reader lower on the page,where the solicitation stated 
all your annual percentage rates aprs are subject to increase if any of the following conditions conditions occur i you fail to make a payment to us when due ii your account is overlimit iii or your payment is returned for any reason.all aprs will change with the beginning of the billing period after the period in which the condition occurred.the first time any of the conditions occur,your purchase and special transfer aprs if applicable may be increased to a rate of annual percentage rate daily periodic rate.if any of the conditions occur twice within any period,all of your aprs may be increased to a rate of annual percentage rate daily periodic rate.
farther down on the same page,the terms of offer included this provision i will receive the capital one customer agreement and am bound by its terms and future revisions thereof.my agreement terms for example,rates and fees are subject to change.
plaintiff responded to the credit card solicitation and,in march,she received a cardholder agreement from defendant.the agreement similarly provided that defendant reserved the right to amend or change any part of your agreement,including periodic rates and other charges,or add or remove requirements at any time.in august,defendant mailed plaintiff a notification that the apr on her credit card was about to increase to unless she halted her use of the card and made no further charges on it.the notice explained the change in the future lending rate as simply a response to changing market interest rates.in light of rising interest rates over the past few years and the rate currently applied to your account balance,the aprs on your account are about to increase.
we have construed tila and regulation z to prohibit disclosures that are either inconspicuous or opaque to a reasonable consumer.clear and conspicuous disclosures are disclosures that a reasonable cardholder would notice and understand.barrer chase bank usa,cir emphasis added.our inquiry is not whether additional disclosure would be useful to consumers but,rather,whether the disclosures that were made complied with the requirements of tila and regulation hauk jp morgan chase bank usa,cir.
in other words,here,is the disclosure accurate and clear in my view,a reasonable trier of fact could find that it is.the term fixed accurately describes an interest rate that is not linked to an external index and is not designed to expire or reset automatically at any particular point in time.the commentary to regulation z distinguishes between a account and a account.see pt.supp.i,para.b,cmt.contrasting disclosures required for the different types of accounts.a account is one in which rate changes are part of the plan and are tied to an index or formula.id.at cmt.by implication,then,a account is one that does not share those characteristics.the account advertised by defendant here did not feature rate changes tied to an index or formula as a part of the credit plan.that is,it was a account.the disclosure was accurate in describing the rate as fixed.
nor did defendant general reservation of provision stating that rates and fees were subject to the accurate term fixed into an inaccurate disclosure.pt,supp.i,para.a,cmt.the account still did not involve rate changes,even if defendant retained the right to adjust the rate later in response to general market conditions the disclosure was accurate.
the crux of this dispute,then,is the clarity of the disclosure.would a reasonable consumer understand that defendant may alter the fixed apr because market conditions change in my view,this should be a question of fact.moreover,i conclude that a reasonably could find that the answer to the question is yes because,on the same page as the statement of the fixed rate,the solicitation informed the consumer that agreement terms for example,rates and fees are subject to change.that is to say,a factfinder permissibly could find that a reasonable consumer would understand from the disclosure here that the fixed apr might go up or down in the future.
an average consumer might well understand that a fixed rate on a credit card does not mean that the rate is permanent or forever when the issuer expressly and simultaneously reserves its right to change its rates later.reasonable consumers know that interest rates time no reasonable consumer expects that borrowing rates will remain static forever.reasonable consumers might well understand that,as market conditions change,the apr available from a credit card company that has explicitly reserved its right to adjust rates prospectively may change as well 
plaintiff contends that a reasonable consumer,even if aware that the fixed rate was not guaranteed permanently,would be confused by the solicitation list of three conditions that would trigger a higher.plaintiff argues that the customer reasonably might think that those three conditions are the only ones that permit a rate increase.a reasonable trier of fact could find this argument unpersuasive.
first,the statement that the apr is subject to change if any of the following conditions conditions occur notably lacks a qualifying term such as only,exclusively,or solely.an average consumer might well understand the difference between saying that her rate will increase if she misses a payment and saying that her rate will increase only if she misses a payment.
but more importantly,a reasonable consumer would not necessarily believe that a fixed apr on a credit card whose issuer has reserved its right to change rates is a promise to keep the same interest rate forever so long as the cardholder behaves well.the warning that specific undesirable acts by the cardholder will lead to a higher interest rate does not necessarily suggest that the account will otherwise be shielded from global economic conditions.
what,then,should the result be when the majority proposed understanding of the disclosure clarity is not the only reasonable understanding in my view,the better answer to that question is to remand the case for.
there seems to be a circuit split regarding the question whether the clarity of a disclosure is a question of law or fact.the seventh circuit holds that this is a question of law.hamm ameriquest mortgage,cir by contrast,the third circuit,in a case on which the majority relies heavily in other respects,appears to treat the clarity of a disclosure as a question of fact 
in roberts fleet bank national ass n,cir,a consumer received a solicitation advertising a fixed apr,which stated that the apr was not an introductory rate and that i t wo go up in just a few short months.there,the issuer raised the cardholder rate after months.id.at.as in this case,the roberts solicitation listed two specific circumstances in which the fixed rate would to meet payment requirements and closure of the neither of those events had occurred.id.at.
