background 
gridley,a resident of louisiana,filed suit as representative of a class of all persons in the united states who purchased an automobile which was previously declared a total loss by state farm,and for which state farm failed to obtain a salvage title.gridley alleged that state farm had a practice of obtaining clean titles on vehicles that it had previously declared total losses and that it marketed those vehicles at automobile auctions with clean titles.gridley alleged that state farm practice violated the consumer fraud act because state farm was required by state titling laws to obtain salvage titles on the vehicles of gridley and the other class members but instead obtained clean titles and marketed the vehicles at auction at higher prices.state farm concealed from gridley and the other class members that it had previously declared the vehicles total losses.state farm violated state law by putting those vehicles back into the chain of commerce with clean titles rather than salvage titles.gridley also alleged that state farm was unjustly enriched by the excess monies it received for the sale of clean titled vehicles which should have been salvage titled vehicles.
state farm moved to dismiss the class action complaint or,in the alternative,to transfer venue pursuant to the doctrine of forum non conveniens.state farm argued that illinois was not the most convenient forum because gridley,the only named plaintiff,was a resident of louisiana,the events giving rise to the complaint were alleged to have occurred in louisiana,and gridley alleged a violation of louisiana title law.in addition,state farm argued that the illinois consumer fraud act could not apply to an act that took place in another state.state farm maintained that louisiana was the better venue for gridley complaint.
in the alternative,state farm asked the court to transfer the cause to mclean county,where state farm has its corporate offices.state farm noted that the mclean county courts were considerably less congested than the madison county courts.further,because gridley was not a resident of illinois or madison county,and because the incidents at issue took place entirely in louisiana,gridley choice of forum was not entitled to any significant deference.assuming any illinois county was more convenient than a louisiana court,state farm contended that mclean county was a more convenient forum for the action than madison county.
the circuit court denied state farm motion in its entirety.the circuit court held that illinois had a significant interest in the litigation because state farm was headquartered here and because gridley sought recovery under illinois substantive law.the circuit court also held that it was proper to consider the size and location of the putative class in ruling on a forum non conveniens motion.the circuit court concluded that because the putative class would likely include residents of several states,an illinois court would be as capable as a louisiana court of assigning subclasses for each state.
the circuit court also held that state farm had failed to satisfy its burden of proof in support of its alternative request to transfer the cause from madison county to mclean county.the circuit court found that its calendar was not congested,and further stated that state farm had failed to identify a single witness or document located within mclean county that was important to the case.consequently,the circuit court held that state farm failed to establish that the public and private interest factors strongly favored transfer of the cause from madison county to mclean county.
as noted,the appellate court remanded the cause to the circuit court.the appellate court held that the trial court did not have sufficient facts to make an informed decision on state farm forum non conveniens motion.citing this court decision in first american bank guerine,the appellate court held that in interstate as well as intrastate forum non conveniens evaluations,the balance of factors must strongly favor transfer of a case before a plaintiff can be deprived of his chosen forum.d at.however,because the record in the circuit court lacked competent information regarding the location of documents,witnesses or sources of proof regarding state farm alleged misconduct,the appellate court remanded the cause for further discovery on the forum non conveniens issue and for reconsideration in light of the appellate court decision and this court decision in guerine.
before we can address whether the circuit court properly denied state farm motion to dismiss based upon forum non conveniens,we must first consider whether the appellate court properly remanded this cause to the circuit court for further discovery on the forum non conveniens issue.both state farm and gridley agree that the appellate court erred in remanding the cause for further discovery,although the parties disagree concerning why the appellate court order was erroneous.state farm maintains that the appellate court placed undue reliance on the putative class allegations.state farm argues that the appellate court order invites burdensome discovery and reliance on speculative matters.moreover,the appellate court order effectively frustrates the purpose of forum non conveniens.in contrast,gridley argues that the appellate court erred in remanding the cause for further discovery because it is clear that madison county is the proper forum for this action.
upon review,we agree with state farm that the appellate court improperly focused on the putative class allegations in remanding the cause for further discovery.in remanding the cause to the trial court for further discovery,the appellate court stated 
in this case,the putative class has not been certified.the record provides no competent evidence regarding the number,identity,and location of potential class members.when considering a forum non conveniens motion in a class action,whether certified or uncertified,the court should consider the relevant factors in light of the identity,number and location of potential class members,rather than limit the inquiry to the named class representatives.similarly,the location and availability of documentary and physical evidence on a basis should be considered.the reason the inquiry must extend beyond the named class representative is that a significant portion of the proof at the trial witnesses,documents,and other tangible items may well be located in a place different from the representative place of residence.moreover,if the class is certified,members of the class may be widely disbursed throughout the state or nation.making a forum non conveniens decision based solely upon the residence of the class representatives may result in the case being heard in a decidedly inconvenient forum for the rest of the class members.d at.
as state farm has argued,the appellate court improperly focused on the putative class members and improperly directed discovery into the identity,number and location of potential class members for purposes of state farm forum non conveniens motion.the appellate court order places too much emphasis on the claims of those who have not yet been,and may not be,certified as a class.indeed,at this point,it is unlikely that a nationwide class will be certified in this case.one of the allegations in gridley complaint is that state farm nationwide practices concerning salvage vehicles violated the illinois consumer fraud act.this court,however,recently held that the illinois consumer fraud act does not apply to fraudulent transactions which take place outside the state of illinois.avery state farm.in avery,this court explained that a plaintiff may pursue a private cause of action if the circumstances that relate to the disputed transaction occur primarily and substantially in illinois.avery,at.
this court in avery concluded that the overwhelming majority of circumstances relating to the named plaintiffs claims concerning automobile replacement parts occurred outside illinois.avery,at.for example,plaintiff avery was a resident of louisiana,he garaged his car in louisiana,and his accident occurred in louisiana.avery,at.avery estimate for repairs to his car was written in louisiana and the alleged failure to disclose the inferiority of in louisiana.avery car was repaired in louisiana and his contact with defendant state farm was through a louisiana agent,a louisiana claims representative and a louisiana adjuster.because the circumstances relating to the disputed transactions occurred primarily and substantially in louisiana,avery did not have a cognizable cause of action under the illinois consumer fraud act.avery,at.
in this case,discovery for purposes of the forum non conveniens motion revealed that state farm handles compliance with salvage laws on a basis,rather than from state farm headquarters in bloomington,illinois,given the variation in each state salvage laws.like the plaintiff in avery,gridley is a resident of louisiana.gridley purchased his car in louisiana and obtained automobile insurance in louisiana.gridley was involved in an accident in louisiana and took his car to a repair center in louisiana.state farm alleged obtaining a clean title rather than a salvage title on the vehicle sold to in louisiana.in addition,the prior undisclosed damage to gridley vehicle was the result of two previous accidents in louisiana.as in avery,the majority of circumstances relating to the sale of the salvage vehicle in this case occurred primarily and substantially in louisiana,so that gridley does not have a cognizable cause of action under the illinois consumer fraud act.it follows that the failure of gridley illinois consumer fraud act claim necessarily defeats his class action claims based upon the illinois consumer fraud act.avery,at,a class action can not be certified unless the named plaintiffs have a cause of action.gridley only remaining claim,then,alleges unjust enrichment.the likelihood that a nationwide class will be certified in this case on the remaining claim is too speculative to justify the imposition of extensive discovery concerning putative class members.
we also note that the appellate court order is contrary to the nature and purpose of a class action,which is intended to allow a representative party to pursue the claims of a large number of persons with like claims and which does not contemplate or necessitate the appearance of absent parties.miner gillette.indeed,it is the named plaintiffs in a class action that have the burden of establishing the statutory prerequisites to bringing a class action,and those prerequisites must be met before the court can sanction the maintenance of the suit as a class action.wheatley board of education of township high school district.thus,a class action suit is predicated on the inability of the court to entertain the actual appearance of all members of the class as well as the impracticality of having each member prosecute his individual claim.miner,at.given that the nature of a class action is to allow a named representative to act on behalf of any absent class members,it would be antithetical to nonetheless require a court to conduct detailed discovery into the claims of absent class members prior to deciding a forum non conveniens motion,particularly where the class has not been certified.
further,as the united states supreme court has recognized,requiring extensive investigation prior to deciding a forum non conveniens motion would defeat the purpose of the forum non conveniens motion.piper aircraft reyno,d.in piper,the court stated 
the court of appeals suggested that defendants seeking forum non conveniens dismissal must submit affidavits identifying the witnesses they would call and the testimony these witnesses would provide if the trial were held in the alternative forum.such detail is not necessary.defendants have moved for dismissal precisely because many crucial witnesses are located beyond the reach of compulsory process,and thus are difficult to identify or interview.requiring extensive investigation would defeat the purpose of defendants motion.of course,defendants must provide enough information to enable the district court to balance the parties interests.our examination of the record convinces us that sufficient information was provided here.piper aircraft,at.at,d at.
likewise,in this case,our examination of the record convinces us that sufficient information was provided here for the circuit court to decide state farm forum non conveniens motion without conducting any additional discovery.
in holding that the appellate court erred in remanding this cause for further discovery concerning the putative class,we emphasize that we do not hold that a court can never consider the identity,number and location of potential class members in deciding a forum non conveniens motion.every request for transfer based upon forum non conveniens must be decided pursuant to an individualized,consideration of convenience and fairness.van dusen barrack,d.thus,in a derivative action what forum is appropriate for such a task may require consideration of its relation to the whole group of members and stockholders whom plaintiff volunteers to represent as well as to the nominal plaintiff himself.koster american lumbermens mutual casualty.this is because a plaintiff in a derivative action might be a mere phantom plaintiff with interest enough to enable him to institute the action and little more.koster,at.at.at.in this case,however,where it is uncertain whether the putative class will in fact be certified,we find that the appellate court erred in remanding the cause for further discovery concerning the putative class.
having found that the appellate court erred in remanding this cause for further discovery on the issue of forum non conveniens,we must next determine whether the trial court properly denied state farm motion to dismiss or transfer based upon forum non conveniens.because gridley can not state a claim under the consumer fraud act,our review of the trial court forum non conveniens ruling is limited to the remaining claim.a trial court decision on a forum non conveniens motion will be reversed only if it can be shown that the trial court abused its discretion in balancing the various factors at issue.dawdy union pacific.an abuse of discretion will be found where no reasonable person would take the view adopted by the trial court.dawdy,
