lynwood walker and violet walker the walkers appeal from the trial court grant of summary judgment in favor of countrywide home loans,countrywide.countrywide appeals from the court denial of its motion for attorney fees.
when a borrower is in default on a loan secured by real property,countrywide conducts inspections of the property,the cost of which countrywide charges to the delinquent borrower.the walkers challenge countrywide practice of passing the cost of conducting property inspections to delinquent borrowers,contending that the practice is unlawful,unfair,and deceptive under business and professions code section the unfair competition law.the walkers argue property inspection fees are unlawful late charges that violate provisions of california civil and financial codes the fees are unfair in that the utility of charging them to consumers is outweighed by the harm to consumers,they are unethical and they are not permitted by the walkers deed of trust and the fees are deceptive because the walkers deed of trust does not authorize them.
in the published portion of this opinion,we hold that countrywide practice of charging delinquent borrowers with the actual cost of performing property inspections does not violate the unfair competition law.we also hold that the trial court properly denied countrywide motion for attorney fees because the walkers action was fundamentally one brought under the unfair competition law,which law does not provide for an attorney fees award to the prevailing party.in the unpublished portion of this opinion,we reject the walkers claim that the trial court erred when it ruled inadmissible the legislative history of civil code section which section governs late charges on delinquent home loans and an expert declaration concerning industry custom and practice in charging property inspection fees to borrowers.
we therefore affirm the judgment and affirm the order denying countrywide motion for attorney fees.
factual background 
the walkers property inspection fees 
to purchase their los angeles home,the walkers borrowed from bayside first mortgage bayside in june.that loan was evidenced by a note and secured by a deed of trust on the property,both of which bayside assigned to countrywide.the deed of trust required the walkers not to destroy,damage or impair the property,allow the property to deteriorate,or commit waste on the property.if the walkers defaulted under the terms of their note,then pursuant to the deed of trust,lender may do and pay for whatever is necessary to protect the value of the property and the lender rights in the property.lender actions may include appearing in court,paying reasonable attorneys fees and entering on the property to make repairs any amounts disbursed by lender under this paragraph shall become additional debt of borrower secured by this security instrument.the deed of trust also provided,lender or its agent may make reasonable entries upon and inspections of the property.lender shall give borrower notice at the time of or prior to an inspection specifying reasonable cause for the inspection.
the walkers defaulted on their loan in november.countrywide asserts that,in accordance with its usual practice,it gave the walkers written warnings and collection calls urging them to reinstate the loan,but that countrywide efforts were unavailing.thereafter,countrywide ordered an inspection of the walkers property in january for which it charged the walkers.thereafter,countrywide ordered an additional property inspections that were performed approximately every days and charged the walkers for the inspections as follows march,april,may,june,july,july,august,october,october,december,december,and february.the inspections showed that the walkers continued to occupy and maintain the property.
on at least two occasions,no one was home at the time of the inspections,but the inspector left a calling card.violet walker testified that the first time she recalled learning that countrywide had charged for property inspections was during the bankruptcy refinance period,which date is not in the record.lynwood walker testified that until february the walkers had been unaware that there were inspections of their property.
by january,the walkers had not cured their default.therefore,countrywide noticed a foreclosure sale of the walkers home.in february,the day before the foreclosure sale date,the walkers paid off their loan,although the record does not specify in what manner they did so.the walkers also paid the charge for the property inspections.
countrywide property inspection practice 
countrywide enters into and buys home mortgage loan contracts secured by real property and sells the loans to secondary market investors.after selling the loans,countrywide continues to administer or service them on the investors behalf.federal national mortgage association fannie mae,federal home loan mortgage corporation freddie mac,and government national mortgage association ginnie mae own the majority of loans countrywide services.
freddie mac and fannie mae publish guidelines concerning when loan servicers,such as countrywide,should conduct property inspections.freddie mac requires a loan servicer within to days of a loan default to conduct a property inspection and interview with the borrower if no arrangements have been made to bring a delinquent mortgage current.fed.home loan mortgage corporation,guide july,ch.inspections continue every month thereafter until satisfactory repayment arrangements have been made.ibid.similarly,fannie mae servicing guidebook states that a p art of a servicer responsibility for safeguarding the integrity of the properties securing mortgages that fannie mae has purchased or securitized includes making periodic inspections of the property the servicer must inspect a property that secures a delinquent first mortgage before the day of delinquency after the servicer initial inspection and until such time as the mortgage is referred for foreclosure,the servicer should schedule subsequent property inspections for delinquent mortgages as often as it considers necessary to protect our interests.fed.national mortgage association,servicing,ch.once a property has been referred for foreclosure,the servicer must inspect the property at least every days,and days before the foreclosure sale.ibid.
when a default on a loan secured by residential property occurs,countrywide computer program orders property inspections depending on the existence of factors such as the amount of time the loan has been delinquent and whether the property is subject to a foreclosure sale.countrywide orders inspections each month if the default is not cured.beginning in,after the inspections of the walkers property took place,when a borrower defaulted on a loan,before inspecting the property,countrywide sent a written notice to the borrower that countrywide would conduct periodic property inspections so long as the loan remained delinquent and that the borrower would be responsible for paying the cost of those inspections.
countrywide expressed primary purpose in conducting the property inspections is to ascertain whether the home is occupied.to that end,and depending on the particular circumstances of a delinquent loan,countrywide orders one of three types of property inspections an inspection to verify occupancy,which inspection may include an inspector contacting neighbors to determine who,if anyone,is occupying the property in the event the borrower has commenced a bankruptcy proceeding,a bankruptcy inspection by which the investigator verifies occupancy by means other than contacting the property resident and for an unoccupied property,a vacant inspection,which inspection includes examining the property interior and exterior.
a verify occupancy inspection cost countrywide in in and in.a bankruptcy inspection cost in in and in.a vacant walk thru inspection cost in in and in.countrywide charged these costs,without markup,to the delinquent borrower.the costs are included in the borrower monthly bills,and,if they are not paid and there is a foreclosure on the property,countrywide seeks reimbursement of the property inspection costs from the owner of the loan.countrywide charges the borrower only the cost of property inspections performed before a notice of default is recorded.
of about inspections performed per month,approximately percent reveal that the property is vacant.based on the property inspection report,countrywide may change locks and make repairs,protect the property against vandalism,winterize the property,and drain the swimming pool.
since late,countrywide subcontracted performing the inspections to countrywide field services corporation,a company affiliated with countrywide.countrywide paid just over million to perform property inspections from to.it collected from borrowers in inspection fees from march to january.countrywide field services corporation makes about a profit on each property inspection.
the walkers lawsuit 
the walkers filed their complaint on march,claiming to be private attorneys general.seeking declaratory relief,injunctive relief and damages,the walkers alleged countrywide regularly and routinely imposes upon borrowers a property inspection fee upon default that is actually a disguised late fee.
countrywide filed its motion for summary judgment or,in the alternative,summary adjudication of issues.in opposition to the motion,the walkers submitted the expert declaration of a mortgage banking consultant,who stated that in her experience she had not encountered a loan servicing institution such as countrywide that conducted multiple property inspections in connection with a loan default or imposed the fees for such inspections on the borrower.the expert declared that such fees are borne by the loan servicer or mortgagor.the walkers also submitted a request for judicial notice of the legislative history of civil code section,which section sets a ceiling on the amount that may be charged as a late fee on a delinquent home loan installment.countrywide submitted written objections to the expert declaration and the request for judicial notice on the grounds of,among others,relevancy and lack of personal knowledge.after sustaining the objections,the trial court granted summary judgment for countrywide.the court rejected the walkers contentions that charging property inspection fees to the borrower is unlawful,unfair or deceptive.
thereafter,countrywide moved for its attorney fees,citing civil code section and attorney fees clauses in the walkers note and deed of trust.the walkers opposed the motion on the grounds,among others,that it was untimely and that business and professions code section does not provide for an award of attorney fees to the prevailing party.the walkers also argued that if fees were awardable,then fees should be apportioned so that fees the walkers incurred on behalf of the general public were not recoverable.the trial court denied countrywide motion for attorney fees based on its conclusion that fundamentally this case was solely an action to enjoin an allegedly unfair business practice 
the walkers appealed the trial court judgment,and countrywide appealed the court order denying attorney fees.

the major purpose of business and professions code section unfair competition law is the preservation of fair business competition.citation.communications,los angeles cellular telephone cal th,d,communications.as used in this chapter,unfair competition shall mean and include any unlawful,unfair or fraudulent business act or practice bus.the california supreme court confirmed that the test for determining a violation of the unfair competition law is a disjunctive one namely,a plaintiff may show that the acts or practices at issue are either unlawful or unfair or deceptive.communications,supra,at,d.

unlawfulness of the property inspection fee 
the walkers contend countrywide practice of passing the cost of property inspections to borrowers violates civil code section,civil code sections and,and financial code section et.nothing in these sections prohibits countrywide from charging the cost of property inspections to a delinquent borrower.
civil code section 
the walkers contend charging property inspection fees to delinquent borrowers violates statutory restrictions concerning late fees.legislative restrictions on late fees on home loan installment payments originated with garrett coast and southern fed.sav.loan cal d,garrett.at issue in garrett was a charge for late payment of a loan installment.the court held that a charge that is an attempt to coerce timely payment by a forfeiture which is not reasonably calculated to merely compensate the injured lender is void as a penalty.id.at.the court also noted that when actual damages are small and the costs of ascertaining them would be economically impracticable in each instance of a default to require a lender to prove to the satisfaction of the borrower the actual damages by accounting procedures,a negotiated liquidated damages provision may be given effect.id.at.
in response to garrett,the legislature enacted civil code section the provision the walkers invoke as prohibiting countrywide from charging property inspection fees to delinquent borrowers.section limits the amount that may be charged as a late fee on a delinquent home loan to six percent of the installment applicable to the payment of principal and interest on the loan or five dollars,whichever is greater.weber,lipshie christian th,d see also,requiring notice to delinquent borrower prior to imposition of late fee.
the legislative history of civil code section in the record,even if considered,does not show that property inspection fees are,or should be,considered late fees and hence prohibited by that section.see generally assem.com.on finance and insurance,background information relative to the costs associated with the consummation and financing of real property transactions dugald gillies,cal.of realtors statement on costs associated with real property financing transactions.the legislative history suggests that the legislature was concerned about prohibiting late charges from being imposed more than once for the late payment of the same installment and establishing uniformity of such charges.the legislature,in considering how to deal with late charges,did not consider whether property inspection fees are late fees.
the walkers reference to one treatise that suggests,without citing any authority,that property inspection fees are late charges does not establish that inspection fees are,in fact,late charges.miller starr,cal.real estate ed.deeds of trust and mortgages.they are not.as noted in garrett,late charges on delinquent home loans serve two fundamental compensate the lender for administrative expenses and for the cost of money wrongfully withheld,and they encourage timely payment.garrett,supra,cal d at.a property inspection fee does not serve these purposes.it is not designed to encourage timely payment or to compensate the lender for loss of interest on the late payment.rather,the property inspection fee reflects the actual cost the lender incurs to protect its security.property inspection fees also are not triggered merely by a default on a home loan.countrywide orders property inspections only if certain criteria are established,including what type of loan is in default and how long the loan has been delinquent.for example,the walkers defaulted on their loan in november,and countrywide did not order the first inspection of the walkers property until several months later in january.
these characteristics of property inspection fees distinguish them from the disguised late charge at issue in ridgley topa thrift loan cal th,d.in that action,the california supreme court held invalid as a penalty a provision that the borrower owed the lender a prepayment fee at the time of sale only if the borrower had been more than days late with any scheduled interest payment.the court looked to the substance of the provision at issue rather than its form and held that the provision was a disguised penalty because the condition of the provision late payment of was unrelated to the purported function of the charge as compensation for prepayment.id.at,d.the charge provision is,instead,plainly intended as an incentive for prompt payment of interest.ibid.in contrast to the prepayment fee in ridgley,the property inspection fee here is based on a necessary procedure that furthers the legitimate business purpose of protecting a lender security.nothing in civil code section precludes charging property inspection fees to delinquent borrowers in furtherance of that purpose.
civil code sections and 
civil code sections and do not prohibit property inspection fees from being charged to a delinquent borrower.they limit the fees that may be charged if a loan is reinstated or redeemed.civil code section,subdivision a,gives the mortgagor a right to cure a default by paying the amount in default,plus reasonable costs and expenses,thereby reinstating the loan as if the default had not occurred the reasonable costs and expenses to which the mortgagor is limited to recovering are those incurred for recording,mailing,including certified and express mail charges,publishing,and posting notices and a fee for a trustee sale guarantee or,in the event of judicial foreclosure,a litigation guarantee,subd.c.civil code section also contains this limitation on the reasonable costs a lender may charge to a borrower seeking to redeem property after a notice of sale has been recorded 
civil code sections and thus regulate costs that may be charged to a borrower only after notices of default and sale have been recorded.they do not apply to charges incurred before such notices have been recorded.for example,civil code section refers to the payment of the amount due as shown in the notice of default.the notice of default provides notice to the borrower and other interested parties of the specific amount that is owed so that the default can be cured.little harbor pacific mortgage investors d.after the notice of default is recorded,borrowers are responsible only for the amounts stated in the notice of default plus specific costs and expenses delineated by statute.see,see also.
significantly,a notice of default may include such costs as attorney fees incurred prior to the notice recordation.caruso great western savings d.attorney fees incurred in prosecuting a foreclosure are statutorily limited,but other fees relating to protection of the lender deed of trust are not so limited see also bruntz alfaro d.civil code section limits costs and trustee or attorney fees which may be claimed as foreclosure expenses,but does not limit other expenses incurred for other purposes.after a notice of default is recorded,except in certain circumstances,a lender or beneficiary is limited to recovering statutorily limited attorney or trustee fees,subd.d,subd.a.there is no reason why reasonable attorney fees incurred before a notice of default is recorded can be charged to a borrower and reasonable property inspection fees incurred during that same time period can not be charged.both are fees incurred to protect the lender security.here,countrywide agrees that it is not permitted to,and does not,charge to delinquent borrowers property inspection fees incurred after a loan is referred for foreclosure 
financial code section et.
financial code section et prohibits regulated residential mortgage loan servicers,such as countrywide,from charging amounts in excess of those permitted by law.see,subd.g requiring licensed mortgage servicers to comply with applicable california and federal law requirements,subd.i prohibiting a licensee from engaging in acts in violation of business and professions code sections and,penalty for willful violation of code provisions,civil penalties for violation of code provisions,and,subd.a interest recoverable on amounts charged in violation of california residential mortgage lending act.the unfair competition law forbids business practices that violate some other law.farmers ins.exchange superior court,supra,cal th at,d.the financial code other law to which the walkers require loan servicers to comply with applicable law.the financial code sections do not include any law forbidding the charging of property inspection fees to delinquent borrowers.
thus,there is no specific provision in either the financial or civil code barring countrywide from charging defaulting borrowers for property inspection fees incurred prior to the recordation of a notice of default,and accordingly,there is no violation of law that would give rise to a cause of action under the unfair competition law.
unfairness of the property inspection fee 
the walkers argue that charging the fees is unfair for four reasons the harm to the borrower outweighs the utility of charging the fees to the delinquent borrower,and the fees are unethical the walkers deed of trust does not permit the fees to be charged to the borrower the inspections are performed by countrywide affiliated company and the fees are not authorized by federal servicing guidelines.
utility of charging fees to delinquent borrowers 
the issue of utility to determine fairness under the unfair competition law may be determined as a matter of law.see motors,times mirror d.if,as will often be the case,the utility of the conduct clearly justifies the practice,no more than a simple motion for summary judgment would be called for.ibid.
such is the case here.the cost of countrywide property inspection,even of multiple inspections,is insignificant when compared with their utility.compare bondanza peninsula hospital medical center cal d,contract requiring payment of of balance due at time of assignment for collection without regard to the actual cost of collection violated unfair competition law.countrywide submitted evidence showing that before and after a foreclosure sale,about percent of the homes inspected are vacant.about percent of the homes are unoccupied before a foreclosure sale.to protect vacant properties,countrywide may change the locks,cut the grass,and lock windows and gates.
even if an initial inspection reveals that the home continues to be occupied and maintained,a lender has legitimate reasons to reinspect the property every to days thereafter.countrywide charged for a verify occupancy inspection in,and that fee increased to in.for property inspections,countrywide charged to the walkers.this figure is not an unreasonable amount to protect the real estate security from damage or deterioration.this is especially true given that,as discussed above,reasonable attorney fees incurred prior to notice of default to protect the lender security may be charged to the borrower.the status and ability of a borrower unable to make monthly loan payments is uncertain and conceivably could change from month to month.such a borrower might be unable to maintain the property and is less likely to occupy the property than a borrower current on a loan.for example,fannie mae loan servicer guidelines require inspections until the borrower has made repayment arrangements,thereby suggesting that occupancy and the borrower ability to maintain the property are valid reasons for continued inspections.there is nothing unethical about passing a reasonable cost of protecting the security to a defaulting borrower.see people casa blanca convalescent homes,supra,d at.
deed of trust 
the walkers deed of trust,reasonably read,does permit inspection costs to be charged to the delinquent borrower.paragraph of the deed of trust,entitled protection of lender rights in the property,states that if the borrower fails to perform the agreement covenants,then lender may do and pay for whatever is necessary to protect the value of the property and the lender rights in the property.lender actions may include paying any sums secured by a lien which has priority over this security instrument,appearing in court,paying reasonable attorneys fees and entering on the property to make repairs any amounts disbursed by lender under this paragraph shall become additional debt of borrower secured by this security instrument.the deed of trust at paragraph permits the lender to make reasonable inspections of the property upon giving notice at the time of or before an inspection.
an illinois federal court held that similar deed of trust provisions were sufficient to authorize passing the cost of property inspections to the borrower.majchrowski norwest mortgage,d.in majchrowski,plaintiffs brought a class action suit in which they claimed that their mortgage company committed unfair and deceptive practices when the mortgage company filed a proof of claim that requested a property inspection fee in plaintiffs bankruptcy proceeding.id.at.the court held that the deed of trust language unequivocally permitted the lender to take whatever action is necessary to protect the mortgaged property value and the lender rights in the property,including passing the cost of property inspections to its borrowers.id.at.there is no limitation on what the lender may do and pay for except that it must be necessary to protect its rights in or the value of the property.ibid.
the majchrowski court distinguished in re burwell,upon which the walkers rely,because the parties mortgage document in burwell did not contain the broad language in issue in majchrowski.the security instrument in burwell was interpreted by that court as addressing governmental fees that might encumber property.it did not address any sort of fees to discover or remedy conditions extant on the property which could deflate its value as security,which presumably the inspections are performed to uncover.burwell,supra,at.the court in majchrowski did not rely upon burwell and other bankruptcy court decisions because it recognized that the lender may charge fees to the borrowers if authorized by the mortgage contract the differences in the language of the contracts and cases decided in bankruptcy proceedings apply different standards and burdens of proof and are not binding.
just as the majchrowski court concluded,we conclude that the deed of trust unequivocally permits countrywide to charge the walkers with the reasonable cost of the property inspections.the deed of trust put the walkers on notice that inspections could occur in the event of a default.it informed them that the lender,after a default,may take any action necessary to protect the lender rights in the property and the costs of such actions shall become the additional debt of borrower.there is nothing inherently unfair about the provision.the unfairness element of the unfair competition law does not give the courts a general license to review the fairness of contracts.samura kaiser foundation health plan,th,fn,d.inspecting property after a default is an action that reasonably may be necessary to protect a lender security interest.
affiliated company 
that countrywide affiliated company performed the property inspections does not render the practice of charging property inspection fees to the borrower unfair.there is no evidence showing that countrywide use of an affiliated company to perform inspections is unfair or unethical.the record does not show that countrywide disregarded separate corporate identities or charged fees for inspections not performed.using an affiliated company conceivably could reduce transaction costs and increase efficiency,to the consumer benefit.
federal servicing guidelines 
the walkers correctly point out that federal agency servicing guidelines such as those freddie mac and fannie mae promulgate do not require countrywide to impose the cost of property inspections on the borrower.nevertheless,that the guidelines affirm the utility of performing property inspections is persuasive evidence that the fees are fair as a necessary expense incurred by a lender to protect its security.it is not unfair to transfer a necessary,reasonable,and actual expense to the delinquent borrower.
thus,under any of the possible applicable criteria,countrywide imposition of the inspection fee upon the defaulting borrower is not unfair.
deceptive nature of the property inspection fee 
the walkers claim that they were likely to be deceived because the deed of trust they signed was silent on property inspections fees,and at the time the walkers entered into their loan agreement,they were not notified of countrywide practice of imposing property inspection fees.as noted above,the deed of trust contained language that was sufficient to notify the walkers that such fees could be imposed on them.that the deed of trust does not expressly state that property inspection fees may be charged to the borrower after default does not preclude countrywide from doing so when the deed of trust unambiguously permits the lender to charge the delinquent borrower for whatever is necessary to protect the property value,including attorney fees and entering the property to make repairs,and puts the borrower on notice that property inspections may be performed.see federal national mortgage bugna th,d only when a document is ambiguous will it be construed against the drafter.the deed of trust is not deceptive or likely t
