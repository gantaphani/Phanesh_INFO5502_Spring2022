the safe drinking water and toxic enforcement act of health,adopted by vote of the people at the november election as proposition,regulates the discharge of specific toxins into california drinking water.a proposition plaintiff alleging an unlawful discharge bears the burden of proving that a discharge has in fact occurred.regulations adopted pursuant to proposition establish a hierarchy of four tiers of tests that may be used to measure whether a listed toxin has been discharged.the regulations provide that a discharge occurs if the toxin is detectable using a test from the highest available tier.
in this case,plaintiff alleged that plumbing parts distributed by defendants discharge lead into drinking water.on a motion for summary judgment,defendants asserted that a tier test for lead in drinking water exists,the trial court agreed that a tier test exists,and the trial court granted summary judgment because plaintiff had not performed a tier test.we disagree with the trial court conclusion that the test put forward by the defendants is a tier test.consequently,we reverse the judgment for defendants and remand for the trial court to consider whether the tests plaintiffs actually performed qualify under any of the tiers provided by proposition regulations.
factual and procedural 
defendants edmund gray,grinnell corporation,and thrifty supply company collectively plumbing distributors are distributors of galvanized plumbing parts in california.galvanization is a process in which steel is dipped in a hot zinc bath.as the zinc cools,it forms a thin coating.the zinc coating protects against rust and corrosion.however,according to an expert for plaintiff mateel environmental justice foundation mateel,when lead is present in a galvanizing bath,it moves to the surface of the zinc coating as the zinc cools.consequently,the galvanized steel may have small islands of lead on its surface.
mateel sued five plumbing distributors.it contended in its first two causes of action that the distributors had violated the discharge and warning provisions of proposition by selling plumbing parts that discharge lead into drinking water and by failing to warn consumers of this exposure.in a third cause of action,mateel alleged that these proposition violations were unlawful business practices under the unfair competition law ucl bus,et.
the trial court trifurcated the case.the first stage was confined to determining whether mateel could prove that a discharge of lead had occurred.shortly before the trial,the plumbing distributors filed separate motions for summary adjudication of plaintiff various claims.with respect to the two pure proposition claims,the trial court granted summary adjudication after it determined that mateel had failed to serve legally sufficient notices of the alleged violations before filing suit.health.those claims are no longer at issue.the trial court allowed the derivative ucl claim to proceed,concluding that proposition presuit notice requirements did not apply.
with respect to the ucl discharge claim,the plumbing distributors argued that mateel had no evidence their products discharged lead.in particular,they argued that under california code of regulations,title,section regulation,mateel was required to show the existence of lead discharged from defendants products by means of a methodology,if one existed.according to the plumbing distributors,such a test existed the lead and copper rule,tit,et mateel responded by submitting seven tests of its own,each purporting to show that defendants products discharged lead into drinking water.mateel argued that it was not required by regulation to employ a methodology if one existed,that its tests were sufficient to show a discharge,and that,in any event,the lead and copper rule was not a methodology for detecting lead discharged from individual plumbing parts.
the trial court agreed with the plumbing distributors on all issues.it concluded that as a matter of law a methodology had to be employed if one existed,that the lead and copper rule was such a methodology,that mateel failed to submit evidence that lead had been detected using the lead and copper rule,and thus that the plumbing distributors were entitled to summary judgment.
mateel has timely appealed,challenging only the ruling on its ucl discharge claim.on appeal,we granted the attorney general leave to file an amicus curiae brief and appear at oral argument.

summary judgment 
a motion for summary judgment shall be granted if all the papers submitted show that there is no triable issue as to any material fact and that the moving party is entitled to a judgment as a matter of law.code civ,subd.c.a defendant moving for summary adjudication of a cause of action must show either that one or more elements of the cause of action can not be established or that there is a complete defense.a ll that the defendant need do is to show that the plaintiff can not establish at least one element of the cause of action t he defendant need not himself conclusively negate any such element aguilar atlantic richfield cal th,d,fn.omitted.if that burden is met,the burden shifts to the plaintiff to show the existence of a triable issue of fact with respect to that cause of action or defense.code civ,subd.p see consumer cause,smilecare th,d.

ii.proposition 
proposition was designed,in pertinent part,to regulate the discharge or release of chemicals carcinogens and reproductive toxins teratogens into drinking water.health,people ex rel.lungren superior court cal th,d.under section,the discharge prohibition,no person in the course of doing business shall knowingly discharge or release a chemical known to the state to cause cancer or reproductive toxicity into water or onto or into land where such chemical passes or probably will pass into any source of drinking water,notwithstanding any other provision or authorization of law except as provided in section.section requires the state to publish and update annually a list of these known carcinogens and teratogens.lead is a listed carcinogen and teratogen,subd.b,c.it is known to harm sperm formation,impair ovulation,and affect fetal development 
section sets out several affirmative defenses.of relevance here,section shall not apply to any discharge or release that meets both of the following criteria the discharge or release will not cause any significant amount of the discharged or released chemical to enter any source of drinking water the discharge or release is in conformity with all other laws and with every applicable regulation,permit,requirement,and order,subd.b.proposition defines significant amount as any detectable amount except an amount which would meet the exemption test in subdivision c of section if an individual were exposed to such an amount in drinking water,subd.c.the burden for showing this affirmative defense is on the defendant in any action brought to enforce section,the burden of showing that a discharge or release meets the criteria of this subdivision shall be on the defendant.
thus,proposition establishes a series of shifting burdens.in the first instance,a plaintiff must show that a discharge has occurred.once this burden has been met,the defendant may show,inter alia,that the amount of the discharge is not significant.we deal here only with plaintiff initial burden of proving a discharge under section.
iii.the lead and copper rule is not a tier test for lead from sources other than public water systems 
regulation 
a discharge is not defined by proposition,but is defined by the regulations adopted by the california health and welfare agency hwa to implement proposition.those regulations define a discharge thusly for purposes of sections and of the act,no discharge,release or exposure occurs unless a listed chemical is detectable as provided in this section,subd.g,italics added.in turn,subdivision a of regulation provides,for purposes of section,subdivision c of the act,the term any detectable amount means a level detected using a method of analysis referred to in this section.for purposes of this section,method of analysis refers to the method of detection or detection and calculation for a listed chemical in a specific medium,including,but not limited to,water,air,food,or soil,and shall include methods and procedures concerning the number of samples and the frequency and site of sampling that are specific for the listed chemical in question,subd.a.
subdivisions b through e of regulation describe a hierarchy of methods of analysis that are to be used in detection.under subdivision b,tier tests are those that have been adopted or employed by one of a specified list of state and local agencies,including the california department of health services.under subdivision c,tier tests are those that have been adopted or employed by a federal agency.under subdivision d,tier tests are those that are generally accepted in the scientific community,as evidenced by publication in professional journals and compilations.finally,under subdivision e,tier tests are those that are scientifically valid.
mateel,the attorney general,and the plumbing distributors offer three competing interpretations of this regulation.according to mateel,it need only prove that any amount of a listed chemical has been discharged it need not prove that the amount is detectable within the meaning of regulation,subdivision g.it is then defendant burden to prove that the amount involved is not detectable.according to the attorney general,a plaintiff must prove that a detectable is,an amount capable of detection using the applicable tier been discharged,but it may do so by any available evidence,and need not submit a test from the highest tier available.finally,according to the plumbing distributors,a plaintiff must prove that an amount capable of detection using the highest available tier test has been discharged,and if it conducts scientific testing,it may only do so by performing and submitting the results of a test from the highest available tier.as we shall explain,at this stage,we need not resolve which of these competing interpretations of the burden of proof under regulation is correct 
under mateel and the attorney general interpretations,a defendant seeking summary judgment must produce its own test that shows no detected amount of the toxin.this is the traditional anderson liberty lobby,d approach to a summary judgment,in which the defendant presents evidence on a material issue and puts plaintiff to the test of coming forward with contradictory evidence.the plumbing distributors have not employed this approach they have not submitted their own negative test results as part of their motion for summary judgment.
under the plumbing distributors interpretation,a second approach is available a defendant may show simply that a test from a specific tier exists,and that plaintiff has not produced a positive test from that tier.this approach is a variation on the celotex catrett,d approach,as recently approved in california by aguilar atlantic richfield,supra,cal th at,d,under which a defendant points to an element of plaintiff case and demonstrates that the plaintiff will be unable to come forward with evidence to substantiate that element.see id.at,d.
however,even if the plumbing distributors interpretation of regulation were we expressly do not decide whether this is judgment would only be available once the defendant established that a test from a specific tier within the hierarchy exists.the plumbing distributors have pointed to a specific test,the lead and copper rule,which they contend is a tier test,and have tried to show that mateel tests are not tier tests.we conclude that the lead and copper rule is not a tier test therefore,the plumbing distributors have failed to meet their summary judgment burden even under their own interpretation of regulation.
b.the lead and copper rule 
the lead and copper rule,et was adopted by the california department of health services to monitor and address lead and copper levels in public drinking water distribution systems.it establishes a protocol for monitoring lead and copper levels in public water systems,subd.a see.
under the lead and copper rule,public water distribution systems must identify sampling sites within the distribution system,subd.a.these sampling sites must each contain lead solder or lead pipes or be served by a lead service line,subd.c f.tap and service line water samples must be drawn after letting the water sit in the distribution system for at least six hours,subds.a c.the lead and copper rule specifies the number and frequency of samples to be drawn.subsequent analysis of the samples is to be done in accordance with federal regulations governing the monitoring of contaminants in public water systems,a.
the lead and copper rule establishes a threshold concentration,one microgram per liter,below which the lead level shall be considered zero,subd.c.public water systems must report their test results on a regular basis,and,depending on those results,must take steps to install corrosion control,treat the system source water,remove lead service lines,issue warning notices to residents served by the distribution system.
under regulation,a method of analysis is any method of detection or detection and calculation for a listed chemical in a specific medium,subd.a.a method of analysis is a tier method if the california department of health services or one of several other agencies has adopted or employs the method of analysis for a listed chemical in a specific medium,subd.b.
the plumbing distributors contend that the lead and copper rule is a tier method of analysis that must be employed by plaintiff in order to meet its burden of proving a detectable amount of lead in drinking water.they argue that it is a test for a listed chemical in a specific medium,specifically,lead in water.see,subd.b.the plumbing distributors reason that the lead and copper rule was adopted by the california department of health services,and tests adopted or employed by that agency are tier tests,subd.b a scientific test qualifies as a method of analysis under regulation so long as it specifies the methods and procedures concerning the number of samples and the frequency and site of sampling,and the lead and copper rule does so and the lead and copper rule complies with generally accepted standards and practice for sampling,collection,storage,preparation,chemical analysis,statistical analysis of data,interpretation of results and modeling.see,subds.a,f.thus,according to the plumbing distributors,this makes the lead and copper rule a tier test,and defendants argue that because mateel failed to comply with the exact protocol,summary judgment was proper.
we disagree with this interpretation and application of regulation.the lead and copper rule is a method of analysis,but it is not a tier test for lead from sources other than public water systems.when an agency designs,adopts,or employs a test in a manner that renders it specific to a particular context or environment,that test qualifies as a method of analysis only when applied in the same context or environment.
the lead and copper rule includes detailed sampling procedures.these procedures include the requirement that a water system identify and take samples at between and sites over at l
