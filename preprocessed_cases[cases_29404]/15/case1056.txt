james atkinson hereinafter atkinson appeals from a judgment of nonsuit entered in favor of elk corporation hereinafter elk.for the reasons outlined below we will reverse.
procedural history 
atkinson filed a complaint on december,against elk and lyle thomas doing business as pacific coast roofing hereinafter pacific.the first cause of action alleged breach of express warranty under the consumer warranty act hereinafter,et against elk.the second cause of action alleged breach of implied warranty under against elk.the third cause of action alleged violation of the consumers legal remedies act,et against elk and pacific 
on april,atkinson filed a motion to amend the complaint to add two causes of action under the trade commission improvement act et hereinafter a cause of action for fraud and a cause of action for violations of the unfair practices act bus,et at the same time,he moved to continue the trial.
shortly thereafter,elk filed a combined opposition to atkinson motion to amend and to continue the trial.on may,the court denied both of atkinson motions.
between may and may,both parties filed trial briefs and several motions in limine.relevant here,elk trial brief no was entitled,plaintiff shingles are not consumer goods and,therefore,the provisions of the consumer warranty act are not applicable in this action.additionally,elk filed trial brief,which raised the issue of the timeliness of atkinson second cause of action for breach of the implied warranty of merchantability,subd.c.both parties filed opposition to some of the opposing party motions in limine.
on may,the trial court heard and ruled on the various pending motions.
after considering the argument of counsel,conducting research and,pursuant to the facts as stipulated by both atkinson and elk on its own motion,the trial court ruled that atkinson was not a buyer of consumer goods within the meaning of.as such,he did not have standing to assert his two remaining causes of action thereby entitling elk to nonsuit.
in addition,the trial court took under submission the issue of whether the second cause of action for breach of the implied warranty of merchantability was barred by the provisions of civil code section,subdivision c 
on may,the trial court found in favor of elk and issued a ruling that the second cause of action was.
the trial court entered judgment of nonsuit on august.
atkinson filed a timely notice of appeal.
atkinson raises four issues on appeal.first,he contends that the trial court erred as a matter of law when it granted nonsuit to the defendant.second,the trial court erred in concluding that the second cause of action for breach of the implied warranty of merchantability was.third,the trial court erred in denying his motion to amend the complaint and continue the trial.lastly,the trial court erred in granting elk in limine motions numbers four and five to exclude evidence related to elk knowledge of problems with the shingles.
we will set forth the facts of this case to the extent necessary for a resolution of the issues.
as atkinson concedes,the facts of this case are virtually undisputed.furthermore,as elk points out,they were the subject of a stipulation before the trial court on may.
on august,atkinson contracted with pacific to reroof his family home.atkinson chose prestique i shingles manufactured by elk as the roofing material.the brochure in which the shingles were advertised contained the following language when you upgrade to prestique i high definition,you get the protection and durability to match the beauty.elk limited warranty covers both labor and shingles,plus you get a limited wind warranty.the last page of the brochure contained a comparison chart of elk products,including the applicable limited warranties.the warranty for the prestique i shingles stated that it was years years wind.the brochure,however,did not contain any disclaimers or other limitations and atkinson did not see or receive any other warranty.when atkinson went to the building supply facility where the shingles were purchased,there was no other limited warranty on display,nor was he given one 
based on the written warranty he saw in the brochure,atkinson instructed pacific to use elk prestique i shingles to his home.atkinson paid pacific for the work.included in that price was the cost of the shingles 
in january,while cleaning the gutters in his roof,atkinson noticed cracks in many of shingles.immediately,he contacted pacific.pacific contacted elk.
in february,elk telephoned atkinson requesting a copy of the contract between atkinson and pacific.atkinson faxed the contract that same day.
in march,brian woods from elk called atkinson to set up an appointment to visit atkinson home in order to take a sample of the damaged shingles to be tested and evaluated by elk.the analysis conducted by elk revealed that the shingles were defective and had to be replaced.
in april,atkinson received a letter and check from elk for.atkinson called elk and spoke to kim gutierrez.he asked gutierrez to explain how elk arrived at that number.
in may,atkinson received a letter from gutierrez explaining that the was a prorated amount for materials and labor for the shingles applied to his roof in.
atkinson did not respond to gutierrez letter until november,he wrote to gutierrez to dispute the settlement amount and return the check.he explained that the settlement amount did not cover the actual cost of material and labor in his geographic area.
gutierrez responded on december.included in her letter was the original check that atkinson had returned and a copy of a lengthy document entitled limited warranty.atkinson had never seen this limited warranty before.
between december and april,atkinson sought the aid of a consumer legal advocate from a local television station to help his efforts to resolve this matter with elk.
on april,atkinson left a message for linda frazier,an elk field service representative.on april,bonnie dlabaj,an elk technical administrative assistant,telephoned atkinson and informed him that frazier was out and that the case was closed.atkinson asked that frazier call him the following monday.
on april,frazier called to say she would reevaluate the settlement.she asked atkinson to obtain three bids to reroof his home.she asked that the bids be broken down to include the individual costs for tear off,materials and labor.also,she requested that the roofers not be allowed to see the roof before they bid.atkinson obtained three bids as requested.
on july,atkinson sent a letter to frazier with the three bids,which ranged from a low bid of to a high bid of.
on august,atkinson received a letter from frazier offering the same refund as before.frazier stated that according to the terms of the limited warranty,atkinson was not entitled to the cost associated with tear off of the defective shingles,flashings,nails,stucco work,or any other related costs of replacing the shingles.
this litigation ensued.
discussion 
atkinson argues that the trial court erred as a matter of law when it granted nonsuit to the defendant.
a motion for nonsuit is a procedural device which allows a defendant to challenge the sufficiency of plaintiff evidence to submit the case to the jury.citation.because a grant of the motion serves to take a case from the jury consideration,courts traditionally have taken a very restrictive view of the circumstances under which nonsuit is proper.the rule is that a trial court may not grant a defendant motion for nonsuit if plaintiff evidence would support a jury verdict in plaintiff favor.campbell general motors cal d.in determining whether plaintiff evidence is sufficient,the court may not weigh the evidence or consider the credibility of witnesses.instead,the evidence most favorable to plaintiff must be accepted as true and conflicting evidence must be disregarded.id.at.a nonsuit in a jury case or a directed verdict may be granted only when disregarding conflicting evidence,giving to the plaintiffs evidence all the value to which it is legally entitled,and indulging every legitimate inference which may be drawn from the evidence in plaintiffs favor,it can be said that there is no evidence to support a jury verdict in their favor.elmore american motors cal d.
initially,we note that in,code of civil procedure section was amended by the legislature.formerly,section stated after the plaintiff has completed his opening statement,or the presentation of his evidence in a trial by jury,the defendant,without waiving his right to offer evidence in the event the motion is not granted,may move for a judgment of nonsuit stats,ch.
currently,section states only after,and not before,the plaintiff has completed his or her opening statement,or after the presentation of his or her evidence in a trial by jury,the defendant,without waiving his or her right to offer evidence in the event the motion is not granted,may move for judgment of nonsuit 
in light of the change in the language of section we asked for supplemental briefing on the issue of the propriety of granting a nonsuit before the plaintiff had made an opening statement.
atkinson asserts that the passage of senate bill,which amended section changed the code so that a motion for nonsuit may not be made before completion of the plaintiff opening statement,and specified the intent of the legislature in this regard.we agree.
however,our review of the record reveals that nonsuit was granted on the court own motion here,the court listened to the argument of counsel,conducted independent research,and asked for a stipulation that atkinson had entered into a contract with pacific and that a true and correct copy of that contract was attached as exhibit a to various pleadings submitted to the court by respondent.when the parties entered into the stipulation the court ruled as follows 
i was very troubled by what was trial brief number,as i said and we discussed it earlier.and that is the issue of consumer goods and whether this case qualifies under.and so,as a process,i went to civil code section and read that a few times.i went to and read that a couple of times.i looked at the contract that has just been stipulated as being the correct contract between the plaintiff and the roofing company,pacific coast roofing.and the court finds as follows that under these circumstances,james atkinson does not qualify as a buyer or retail buyer under b.b provides that a buyer or retail buyer means any individual who buys consumer goods from a person engaged in the business of manufacturing or distributing or selling consumer good s at retail the court finds that atkinson did buy consumer goods that pacific coast roofing bought consumer goods based on the contract and the offers of proof that have been made thusfar this morning.
we find that the grant of nonsuit in favor of respondent on the court own motion was irregular in the absence of express statutory authority,a trial court may,under certain circumstances,invoke its limited,inherent discretionary power to dismiss claims with prejudice.citations.lyons wickhorst cal d,see also,subd.m the provisions of,shall not be deemed to be an exclusive enumeration of the court power to dismiss an action or dismiss a complaint as to a defendant.however,the power of the court to dismiss actions with prejudice has in the past been confined to two types of situations the plaintiff has failed to prosecute diligently romero snyder cal.or the complaint has been shown to be fictitious or sham such that the plaintiff has no valid cause of action cunha anglo california nat.bank d.lyons wickhorst,supra,cal d at,fn.omitted.
neither of those situations is present here.however,we will not reverse for this irregular procedure unless we find that atkinson was prejudiced.ford evans d,cal.const.art.vi,no judgment shall be set aside for any error as to any matter of procedure,unless,after an examination of the entire cause,including the evidence,the court shall be of the opinion that the error complained of has resulted in a miscarriage of justice.
accordingly,we turn to the issue of whether atkinson would have survived a motion for nonsuit after an opening statement.
in order for atkinson to prevail in an action under,he must be a buyer of consumer goods,subd.a.accordingly,we must make a inquiry.first,is atkinson a buyer of consumer goods second,are roof shingles consumer goods within the meaning of 
civil code section provides definitions pertinent to.subsection b defines buyer or retail buyer as any individual who buys consumer goods from a person engaged in the business of manufacturing,distributing,or selling consumer goods at retail,subd.b.
atkinson points out that there are no california cases interpreting this term or definition as used in.
thus,we begin with the principle that statutory construction is a question of law.national,foreman th,d.the fundamental rule of statutory construction is that the court should ascertain the intent of the legislature so as to effectuate the purpose of the law.citations.select base materials board of equal.cal d.
however,if the statutory language is clear and unambiguous there is no need for construction,nor is it necessary to resort to indicia of the intent of the legislature lungren deukmejian cal d.
as noted above,a buyer or retail buyer is an individual who buys consumer goods from a person engaged in the business of manufacturing,distributing,or selling consumer goods at retail,subd.b.
black law dictionary ed at page defines retail as t he sale of goods or commodities to ultimate consumers,as opposed to the sale for further distribution or processing.furthermore,collegiate dictionary ed at page defines retail as to sell in small quantities directly to the ultimate consumer.
elk does not sell its products directly to the public.elk sells its product to retail sellers,or contractors who then use the products,along with other products,to fulfill roofing or contracts.thus,unless pacific is a retail seller within the meaning of,atkinson is not a buyer.
retail seller,seller,or retailer means any individual,partnership,corporation,association,or other legal relationship that engages in the business of selling or leasing consumer goods to retail buyers,subd.l.
atkinson argues that application of the rules of statutory construction lead to the inevitable conclusion that pacific is a seller within the meaning of civil code section.
elk asserts,pacific,as a roofer,does not sell shingles as its product.instead,the product a roofing contractor sells is a roofing system,of which the shingles,just like the sheet metal flashing,roof gutters,plywood sheathing and felt underlayment,are but one component.
in the context of it is not clear if this distinction is dispositive.the legislative history of senate bill reg.sess,the bill that introduced,indicates that alfred song,one of the sponsors of,considered the distinction.in a letter to then governor ronald reagan,senator song wrote as follows first,the bill deals only with the retail sale of consumer goods,a term which is rather narrowly defined.sales of consumer goods,retail sales of goods,and all commercial transactions will continue to be regulated by the commercial code and would not be affected by sb.song,sponsor of bill reg.sess,letter to governor.
furthermore,in reply to a concern expressed by the executive secretary of california council of airconditioning and refrigeration contractors associations,senator song wrote the following while there may be some borderline cases,my bill applies to situations in which a consumer purchases a product from a retail seller this bill,unlike our of last year,does not involve relationships between contractors,subcontractors,song,sponsor of bill reg.sess,letter to henry ely,california council of airconditioning and refrigeration contractors associations.
however,when senate bill was finally chaptered no distinction was made between contractors and retail sellers.stats,ch.as we have no way of knowing why this happened,or what senator song meant when he wrote that senate bill did not involve relationships between contractors,subcontrators,we believe that the more sound result is to find that pacific is a retail seller within the meaning of 
accordingly,we turn to the issue of whether roof shingles are consumer goods within the meaning of.
consumer goods means any new product or part thereof that is used,bought,leased for use primarily for personal,family,or household purposes,except for clothing and consumables,subd.a.
elk concedes that t he definition of consumer goods found in civil code section,subdivision a,is admittedly broad,but asserts that the definition clearly encompasses new products bought primarily for household purposes.
elk asserts that the only reasonable interpretation of the definition of the term household purposes include s such things as home appliances,furniture,other things used by the individual in the home.further,he asserts,building materials obtained and used in the complete of a home by a roofing contractor as an addition to the realty clearly were not contemplated to be included in the definition.
elk urges this court to follow two cases from other states that have found that building materials are not consumer goods used for household purposes.
in potomac plaza terraces,qsc products.hereinafter potomac,the plaintiff,a housing corporation,alleged among other things that the defendant had breached an implied warranty of merchantability.the action was based upon the failure of two roofing systems that used a polyurethane coating manufactured by qsc plaintiff argued that defendant product was a consumer good.the court disagreed.the court noted that consumer goods consist of products used or bought for use primarily for personal,family,or household purposes.district of columbia courts had not specifically defined household purposes.however,because elsewhere in the household goods were defined to include furniture,furnishings and personal effects used by the depositor in the dwelling,the court concluded that roofing materials were not furniture,furnishings or personal effects,and thus not consumer goods.id.at 
similarly,in tambur,hiltner ohio app d,hereinafter tambur,the ohio sixth district court of appeal was required to decide whether aluminum siding fell within the requirements of an ohio statute regulating homes sales practices.the court concluded that the aluminum siding was not purchased primarily for personal,family or household purposes.it was a building material,which,like a new roof or window sash,becomes part of the realty a fixture id.at.
elk asserts that both these cases are illustrative of the analysis this court should apply to find that the roofing shingles sold by them are not consumer goods.
atkinson argues that potomac is inapposite because the provision of the upon which the court relied has no parallel in california law.furthermore,the ohio second district court of appeal has declined to follow tambur reasoning as applied to roofing materials 
contrary to atkinson assertion,california uniform commercial code section,subdivision b states in pertinent part household goods means furniture,furnishings and personal effects used by the depositor in a dwelling.we are not convinced,however,that equating household purposes with household goods disposes of the issue in this case.
our colleagues in the fourth district court of appeal were faced with a similar challenge in regard to whether applied to a motor home coach.we quote from their extensive analysis of the history of civil code section.
under the act,as originally enacted in,consumer goods were defined as any motor vehicle,machine,appliance,or like product that is used or bought for use primarily for personal,family,or household purposes.stats,ch.this definition appeared in section,subdivision a.
in,the legislature amended section,subdivision a,to read consumer goods means any new mobilehome,motor vehicle,machine,appliance,like product,or part thereof that is used or bought for use primarily for personal,family or household purposes.consumer goods also means any new good or product,except for soft goods and consumables,the retail sale of which is accompanied by an express warranty to the retail buyer thereof and such product is used or bought for use primarily for personal,family,or household purposes stats,ch.
in,the legislature amended section,subdivision a,to read consumer goods means any new product or part thereof that is used or bought for use primarily for personal,family,or household purposes,except for clothing and consumables.stats,ch.national,foreman th,fn,d hereinafter national.
the national court concluded,t he amendment to section,subdivision a,served to enlarge the definition of consumer goods from an exclusive list of specific products and their like to an list,including any new product except clothing and consumables.stats,ch.this expansion of the definition of consumer goods is reflected in the following legislative committee analysis of the bill that carried the amendment assem.bill the products that fall under the regulations of the act are those products defined as consumer goods.the present definition is restricted to predominantly mechanical type products and excludes such goods as furniture,phonograph records,tapes,picture frames and drapes.due to the manner in which clothing and consumables are handled,it makes some sense to exempt such goods.beyond that,the question must be raised as to why any good should be excluded should not all products sold be required to perform in the manner intended the definition of consumer goods proposed by this piece of legislation would include all goods except clothing and consumables.assem.com.on labor,employment consumer affairs,analysis of assem.bill reg.sess,italics in original.statements in legislative committee reports concerning the statutory objects and purposes which are in accord with a reasonable interpretation of the statute are legitimate aids in determining legislative intent.southern cal.gas public utilities com.cal d,national,supra,th at,d.
atkinson argues,i n enacting the act and amending it over the years,the legislature intent was to eliminate misleading sales gimmicks,and to ameliorate consumer frustration caused by inability to obtain promised repair services.the act is manifestly a remedial measure,intended for the protection of the consumer it should be given a construction calculated to brings its benefits into action.citations.reveles toyota by the bay th,d emph.added.if a manufacturer elects to provide an express warranty for consumer goods,the act protects buyers in a number of ways.jensen bmw of north america,th,d.
we agree that should be given a construction calculated to bring its benefits into action.reveles toyota by the bay,supra,th at,d,disapproved on other grounds in snukal flightways,cal th,d.however,we are mindful that we do not construe statutes in isolation.rather,we should construe every statute with reference to the entire scheme of law of which it is part so that the whole may be harmonized and retain effectiveness.clean air constituency california state air resources bd.cal d.
elk argues that a reading of demonstrates that the statute simply does not contemplate building materials,such as roofing shingles,in the context of a completed product,such as a roofing system,under the facts and circumstances of this case.a reading of as a whole and the remedy portions in particular demonstrate that the roofing shingles at issue here simply do not fit into the scheme contemplated by the legislature when it enacted this consumer protection statute.
we find merit in elk argument.civil code section provides in pertinent part a every manufacturer of consumer goods sold in this state and for which the manufacturer has made an express warranty shall a maintain in this state sufficient service and repair facilities reasonably close to all areas where its consumer goods are sold to carry out the terms of those warranties or designate and authorize in this state as service and repair facilities independent repair or service facilities reasonably close to all areas where its consumer goods are sold to carry out the terms of the warranties.b as a means of complying with this paragraph,a manufacturer may enter into warranty service contracts with independent service and repair facilities.the warranty service contracts may provide for a fixed schedule of rates to be charged for warranty service or warranty repair work.however,the rates fixed by those contracts shall be in conformity with the requirements of subdivision c of section.the rates established pursuant to subdivision c of section,between the manufacturer and the independent service and repair facility,shall not preclude a good faith discount which is reasonably related to reduced credit and general overhead cost factors arising from the manufacturer payment of warranty charges direct to the independent service and repair facility.the warranty service contracts authorized by this paragraph shall not be executed to cover a period of time in excess of one year,and may be renewed only by a separate,new contract or letter of agreement between the manufacturer and the independent service and repair facility.in the event of a failure to comply with paragraph of this subdivision,be subject to section make available to authorized service and repair facilities sufficient service literature and replacement parts to effect repairs during the express warranty period.b where those service and repair facilities are maintained in this state and service or repair of the goods is necessary because they do not conform with the applicable express warranties,service and repair shall be commenced within a reasonable time by the manufacturer or its representative in this state.unless the buyer agrees in writing to the contrary,the goods shall be serviced or repaired so as to conform to the applicable warranties within days.delay caused by conditions beyond the control of the manufacturer or his representatives shall serve to extend this requirement.where delay arises,conforming goods shall be tendered as soon as possible following termination of the condition giving rise to the delay.c the buyer shall deliver nonconforming goods to the manufacturer service and repair facility within this state,unless,due to reasons of size and weight,or method of attachment,or method of installation,or nature of the nonconformity,delivery can not reasonably be accomplished.if the buyer can not return the nonconforming goods for any of these reasons,he or she shall notify the manufacturer or its nearest service and repair facility within the state.written notice of nonconformity to the manufacturer or its service and repair facility shall constitute return of the goods for purposes of this section.upon receipt of that notice of nonconformity,the manufacturer shall,at its option,service or repair the goods at the buyer residence,or pick up the goods for service and repair,or arrange for transporting the goods to its service and repair facility.all reasonable costs of transporting the goods when a buyer can not return them for any of the above reasons shall be at the manufacturer expense.the reasonable costs of transporting nonconforming goods after delivery to the service and repair facility until return of the goods to the buyer shall be at the manufacturer expense.d except as provided in paragraph,if the manufacturer or its representative in this state does not service or repair the goods to conform to the applicable express warranties after a reasonable number of attempts,the manufacturer shall either replace the goods or reimburse the buyer in an amount equal to the purchase price paid by the buyer,less that amount directly attributable to use by the buyer prior to the discovery of the nonconformity.
thus,if the goods can not be returned to the manufacturer because of the method of attachment,the manufacturer has three options.the goods can be serviced or repaired at the buyer residence,or they can be picked up for service and repair,or the manufacturer can arrange for transporting the goods to its service and repair facility.
our final step in statutory construction is to apply reason,practicality and common sense to the language at hand.if possible,the words should be interpreted to make them workable and reasonable citations,in accord with common sense and justice,and to avoid an absurd result citations.citation jensen bmw of north america,supra,th,at,d.
the fact that the manufacturer has three options from which he may choose implies that the goods are at least removable from their location without causing further damage.roofing shingles that are attached to the roof of a structure are not removable,inasmuch as their removal from the roof would cause more damage to them and possibly the roof.furthermore,we doubt whether roofing shingles can be serviced or repaired without impairing the visual appeal of the shingles,something that would leave them defective 
accordingly,we hold that roof shingles are not consumer goods thus,atkinson was not a buyer of consumer goods within the meaning of consequently,atkinson would not have withstood a motion for nonsuit after opening statement as to the causes of action.therefore,he can not show that he was prejudiced by the grant of nonsuit on the court own motion.
since we have concluded that atkinson was not a buyer of consumer goods within the meaning of we need not address atkinson second and fourth contentions as they directly relate to actions under.
the trial court erred in denying atkinson motion to amend the complaint and continue 
as noted above atkinson filed his complaint on september.subsequently,the trial court scheduled the matter for trial to commence on may.
on march,the trial court granted elk motion for summary adjudication as to the third cause of action in the complaint for violation of the consumer legal remedies act.the court ruled that elk had made no promise that the shingles would be free of defects.instead,elk promised only to accept responsibility under the terms of its written limited warranty if defects occurred in its product.
on april,atkinson brought an ex parte motion for an order shortening time to file a first amended complaint,and to continue trial.atkinson sought to amend the complaint by adding four new causes of action proposed third and fourth causes of action alleging breach of written warranty and breach of implied warranty under et a proposed fifth cause of action alleging fraud by concealment and intentional misrepresentation and a proposed sixth cause of action based upon an alleged violation of the unfair business practices act.bus,et.
the trial court set the hearing for may,the friday prior to the monday,may trial date.elk opposed the motion to amend and continue the trial.
on may,the trial court heard and denied atkinson motions.
atkinson argues that the trial court erred in denying his motion to amend the complaint and continue the trial.
when a trial court denies leave to amend,the decision has been upheld on grounds such as the fact that the amendment contained objectionable subject matter or because of the conduct of the moving party or belated presentation of the amendment.see dos pueblos ranch imp.ellis cal d,ross mcdougal d.
section,subdivision a states in pertinent part t he court may,in its discretion after notice to the adverse party,allow,upon any terms as may be just,an amendment to any pleading or proceeding in other particulars this statutory provision giving the courts the power to permit amendments in furtherance of justice has received a very liberal interpretation by the courts of this state.citations.klopstock superior court cal d.this position is clearly in accord with the modern theories of code pleading,which would permit amendment in the discretion of the court unless an attempt is made to present an entirely different set of facts by way of the amendment.citation.ibid.
elk asserts that by attempting to amend the complaint to allege causes of action under,causes of action for common law fraud and misrepresentation,and unfair business practices,atkinson was simply trying to circumvent the trial court clear ruling on summary adjudication that as a matter of law there had been no misrepresentations by elk that its roof shingles were defect free.further,the new causes of action were simply a retooling of the allegations which formed the basis for the former third cause of action based on a violation of the consumer s legal remedies act and upon which summary adjudication was granted to elk on march.
