jesse polansky appeals from a partial final judgment of the united states district court for the eastern district of new york cogan,dismissing his false claims act fca and state analog causes of action.we have appellate jurisdiction by virtue of certification.polansky alleges that in and after his former employer,defendant pfizer,pfizer,improperly marketed lipitor,a popular statin,as appropriate for patients whose risk factors and cholesterol levels fall outside the national cholesterol education program guidelines ncep guidelines or guidelines that the guidelines are incorporated into and made mandatory by the drug label and that pfizer thus induced doctors to prescribe the drug,pharmacists to fill the prescriptions,and federal and state health care programs to pay for prescriptions.judge cogan dismissed the claims because he determined that the fda approval of lipitor was not dependent upon compliance with the guidelines we affirm.
background 
the food,drug and cosmetic act fdca forbids pharmaceutical manufacturers from marketing or selling a drug until the food and drug administration fda has approved it as safe and effective for its intended use or uses the drug indications.see a,d united states caronia,cir see also b b.the exact wording of the drug label must be approved by the fda,and thereafter generally can not be altered without further approval.wyeth levine,d see b f,d b.the label which can be quite lengthy must include,inter alia,the drug indications,limitations of use,use by specific populations,and dosage instructions.
once,prescription drugs can be prescribed by doctors for both and unapproved uses the fda generally does not regulate how physicians use approved drugs.caronia,at see also principle of with the practice of medicine.indeed,courts and the fda have recognized the propriety and potential public value of unapproved or drug use.caronia,at citing cases and fda draft guidance.however,pharmaceutical manufacturers are generally prohibited from promoting uses of their products if the marketing is false or misleading,or if it evidences that a drug is intended for such use and is therefore misbranded.
polansky contends that prescriptions written for uses are generally not reimbursable by federal and state health care programs.federal reimbursement for prescription drugs under medicare and medicaid is generally limited to drugs prescribed for uses or for certain purposes included in any of three drug compendia.see k,id.e.state medicaid programs may exclude or otherwise restrict coverage if a drug is prescribed unless included in any of those compendia.id.d b i.
lipitor atorvastatin calcium is a popular statin,a drug that lowers cholesterol levels by blocking enzymes essential to cholesterol production.broadly speaking,lipitor is approved for treatment of elevated cholesterol,and for prevention of cardiovascular disease.during the time period relevant to this case,lipitor was approved for five indications relating to treatment of elevated cholesterol 
polansky alleges that lipitor approved use is more narrow than these specific indications that it is approved only when the patient risk factors and cholesterol levels fall within a framework outlined in the ncep guidelines,and that any use by a patient outside that framework is unapproved and.he further alleges that pfizer widely marketed lipitor for outside guidelines use causing physicians to write lipitor prescriptions for patients whose risk factors and cholesterol levels fell outside the guidelines framework,and causing those prescriptions to be submitted for reimbursement by federal and state health care programs.because government health care programs generally do not reimburse prescriptions for use,see supra,he contends that these requests for reimbursement impliedly certified falsely that the prescription was for an use,and thus constituted false claims under the fca and state laws.
the guidelines were promulgated in by the national cholesterol education program expert panel on detection,evaluation,and treatment of high blood cholesterol in adults,under the aegis of the national heart,lung,and blood institute of the national institutes of health the guidelines were recommendations for cholesterol testing and management,and cautioned that they were advisory only 
this report should not be viewed as a standard of practice.evidence derived from empirical data can lead to generalities for guiding practice,but such guidance need not hold for individual patients.clinical judgment applied to individuals can always take precedence over general management principles.recommendations thus represent general guidance that can assist in shaping clinical decisions,but they should not override a clinician considered judgment in the management of individuals.
the full guidelines report is nearly pages long.
the guidelines recommended a focus on lowering ldl lipoprotein cholesterol.patients were grouped on the basis of their risk for coronary heart disease events.each of the three risk categories was accorded an ldl cholesterol therapeutic goal an ldl level at which to initiate therapeutic lifestyle changes and an ldl cutpoint at which to consider drug therapy.the particulars are in the margin 
the lipitor label changed somewhat during the time between the guidelines promulgation in and the filing of the operative complaint in but the only difference material to the outcome of this case is one made in june.pre lipitor labels included a table summarizing the recommendations of the ncep guidelines see footnote but this table does not appear anywhere in the label.notwithstanding that change,the label is substantively the same as its pre any substantive modifications had to be specifically disclosed in the new,label,see a no such modifications were listed in the label,which was submitted to and approved by the fda and it was agreed by the parties during district court proceedings that the label did not effect any substantive changes 
pre labels referred to the ncep guidelines in two sections indications and usage and dosage and administration.the indications and usage section enumerated the drug five indications relating to treatment of elevated cholesterol,and then added 
therapy with agents should be a component of intervention in individuals at increased risk for atherosclerotic vascular disease due to hypercholesterolemia.agents should be used in addition to a diet restricted in saturated fat and cholesterol only when the response to diet and other nonpharmacological measures has been inadequate see national cholesterol education program ncep guidelines,summarized in table below.
label.the guidelines summary table followed.
the dosage and administration section of pre labels contained patient subcategories depending on the date in one of these patient subcategories,the labels referenced the guidelines the starting dose and maintenance doses of lipitor should be individualized according to patient characteristics such as goal of therapy and response see ncep guidelines,summarized in table above,label.
in the label,the summary table does not appear.the guidelines are not mentioned at all in the indications and usage section even though that section includes a restriction based on ldl level for patients between the ages of ten and seventeen,as did pre labels.the dosage and administration section retains the same parenthetical reference to the guidelines as did earlier labels.the guidelines appear nowhere else in that label.
the fca is an statute accordingly,polansky must plead fraud with particularity pursuant to federal rule of civil procedure b.see gold morrison knudsen,cir per curiam.judge korman,to whom this case was originally assigned,reviewed the previous version of the complaint,and dismissed the fca and state analog claims for failure to satisfy rule b requirements.united states ex rel.polansky pfizer,cv erk,wl,at may,polansky i.
polansky then filed the operative complaint,seeking to cure the defects judge korman had identified.judge cogan,to whom the case was reassigned,again dismissed these claims,but on the different ground that pfizer had not engaged in marketing as a matter
