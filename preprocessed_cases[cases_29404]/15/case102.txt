plaintiff andrew orlander,a resident and citizen of new york state,appeals from the district court dismissal,under fed.civ.p b for failure to state a claim,of his claims for breach of contract and for violations of new york general business law sections and,which prohibit deception of consumers and false advertising.defendant staples,is a delaware corporation that advertises,distributes,markets,and sells its computer and monitor protection plans to consumers throughout new york state plaintiff purchased both a computer and a,protection plan from staples,and brought suit,individually and on behalf of all others similarly situated,after staples denied plaintiff the services for which he allegedly paid.
plaintiff argues that the district court erred in finding the language of the protection plan brochure the contract to be unambiguous in requiring plaintiff to show a material breach of that contract and in finding that the plaintiff suffered no damages.plaintiff also argues that the district court erred in finding that plaintiff failed to plead an actual injury under gbl sections and.staples responds that the contract terms were unambiguous,that plaintiff failed to allege a breach of the unambiguous contract,and that plaintiff failed to show damages from the alleged breach.defendant also argues that plaintiff failed sufficiently to allege either a materially misleading practice or an actual injury under gbl sections and.
we conclude that plaintiff has adequately alleged both a materially misleading practice and an actual injury under gbl sections and.we also conclude,with respect to the breach of contract claim,that the district court erred in finding the contract to be unambiguous,in requiring plaintiff to allege a material breach,and in finding that plaintiff had failed to adequately allege damages.construing the contract ambiguities in plaintiff favor,he has alleged staples failure to perform in the first year of the contract and damages in the amount of his restitution interest.should plaintiff seek damages beyond his restitution interest,he should amend his complaint as authorized by this opinion.accordingly,we vacate the judgment and remand with instructions to the district court to deny staples motion to dismiss and to allow plaintiff to amend his complaint with respect to contract damages.
background 
on march,plaintiff purchased a hewlett packard computer at a staples store,and also purchased staples protection plan for.he was given a protection plan brochure the contract,as well as verbal assurances from a staples sales representative that t he manufacturer warranty would not be sufficient to address issues that arise with the computer,that pursuant to the manufacturer plan,plaintiff would be required to package his computer and ship it back to the manufacturer,and that,in contrast,the staples protection plan would provide complete coverage so that plaintiff would never need to contact the manufacturer for repairs or replacement.a.
the second page of the contract listed prices for both year and year protection plans on desktop computers.a.prices were pegged to the purchase price of the computer to be protected.plaintiff paid for his computer and for a protection plan.a.
the second page of the contract promised purchasers of protection plans,y ou can count on,inter alia,technical support and customer service,parts and labor coverage,and o replacement or cash settlement if equipment can not be repaired.a.this latter replacement provision alone was starred.the single star referred to a paragraph in small type on the back page of the contract,which reads in pertinent part some restrictions apply.for complete details,including obligor information,see terms and conditions.the plan term is inclusive of manufacturer warranty and store return policy and does not replace the manufacturer warranty.a.the second page of the contract also promised purchasers of protection plans,we will refer you to the nearest authorized repair center for service.a.
on november,after several months of use,plaintiff brought the computer back to staples,reporting issues,and sought an exchange.a staples employee told plaintiff to contact hewlett packard directly and explained that there was no coverage from the protection plan until the manufacturer warranty expired.a emphasis added.plaintiff did not attempt to contact hewlett packard directly,but instead inquired further with staples about the underlying terms and conditions of the protection plan he had purchased,which are mentioned exclusively but are not set forth in the,starred paragraph on the back of the contract.plaintiff was ultimately unable to procure these terms and conditions.
on january,however,plaintiff did receive a letter from a staples sales manager stating 
staples protection plans does not cover the first year,staples protection plans covers the year when the warranty expires from the manufacturer,in andrew orlander sic case hp should cover the repair on the hp desktop,staples will pick up the second year on his replacement plan.
on january,plaintiff brought this putative class action for breach of contract,violations of gbl sections and,breach of express and implied warranties,and unjust enrichment.staples filed a motion to dismiss pursuant to both rules b improper venue and b failure to state a claim.on june,after briefing and a hearing on the motion,the district court issued a memorandum and order granting the motion to dismiss for failure to state a claim.orlander staples,civ.nrb,wl june.the district court rejected the venue argument because the binding arbitration clause on which the motion was grounded was contained only in the terms and conditions of the purchase plan,which the plaintiff allegedly never received,and which the district court accordingly did not consider part of the contract.orlander,wl,at.plaintiff now appeals from the dismissal of his and gbl sections and claims.
breach of contract claim 
to state a claim for breach of contract under new york law,the complaint must allege i the formation of a contract between the parties ii performance by the plaintiff iii failure of defendant to perform and iv damages.johnson nextel commc ns,cir.it is undisputed that prongs i and ii have been met.the content of the contract at issue is set forth in the protection plan brochure which plaintiff received from staples when he purchased a protection plan the district court found the contract unambiguous in denying to plaintiff any and all services from staples that were also covered by the manufacturer warranty.plaintiff challenges the district court finding of no ambiguity,as well as its assessment of the failure to perform and damages prongs of plaintiff contract claim.
ambiguity of the contract 
whether or not a writing is ambiguous is a question of law to be resolved by the courts,giancontieri,see also ja apparel abboud,cir.a contract term is unambiguous if it has a definite and precise meaning,unattended by danger of misconception in the purport of the contract itself,and concerning which there is no reasonable basis for a difference of opinion.olin am.home assur,cir internal quotation marks omitted.furthermore,the ambiguity analysis should be constrained by normal rules of contract interpretation words and phrases should be given their plain meaning and a contract should be construed so as to give full meaning and effect to all of its provisions.shaw grp.triplefine int l,cir.i f a contract is ambiguous as applied to the facts that furnish the basis of the suit,a court has insufficient data to dismiss a int for failure to state a claim.eternity global master fund morgan guar.trust of,cir.

the symbol affixed to the fourth bullet point above refers to a paragraph at the bottom of the back page of the brochure which reads 
some restrictions apply.for complete details,including obligor information,see terms and conditions.the plan term is inclusive of manufacturer warranty and store return policy and does not replace the manufacturer warranty.plan does not cover cracked or broken screens and any failures due to accidental damage.not responsible for lost data.replacement product can be a new,rebuilt or refurbished one of similar features and functionality.replacement or cash settlement fulfills the contract in its entirety,except on flat screen monitors.
the district court relied on the provision that t he plan term is inclusive of manufacturer warranty and does not replace the manufacturer warranty in finding that the contract unambiguously provided that the staples protection plan did not entitle plaintiff to any services during the one year that the manufacturer warranty is in existence.the district court explained 
although the language at issue here plan term is inclusive of manufacturer warranty and does not replace the manufacturer warranty could certainly be clearer we nevertheless conclude that it unambiguously communicates that during the life of the manufacturer warranty,anything covered by that warranty is the responsibility of the manufacturer.
orlander,wl,at emphasis added.
we find the contract ambiguous in several respects relevant to plaintiff claim.first,the starred,paragraph of restrictions,which refers to the manufacturer warranty,facially applies to only one provision in the list of what included in the protection plan.replacement or cash settlement if equipment can not be repaired a is the only provision in the list of services provided by the plan that is apparently affected by the restrictions in the starred paragraph of small print.no such star is affixed to other provisions such as technical support and customer service,parts and labor coverage,coverage against normal mechanical or electrical failures as a result of normal wear and tear,or power surge coverage of up to over the life of the plan.thus,the plan can be reasonably read to provide these latter aspects of protection independent of what is said in the paragraph about the manufacturer warranty.
furthermore,the district court interpretation of the paragraph on the back page as meaning that anything covered by the manufacturer warranty is not covered by the staples plan is far from the only reasonable interpretation.as for the clause that reads the plan term is inclusive of manufacturer warranty and store return policy,it could mean several things.among its ambiguities is whether the term,term,was intended to refer to duration of plan protection or as the district court appears to have interpreted it to a provision of the plain coverage,such as the starred term on the second page of the brochure.and as for the clause that reads,the plan term does not replace the manufacturer warranty,we have no idea what it meant.one permissible interpretation might be that the manufacturer warranty offers dual,alternative coverage,alongside the protections offered by staples.it certainly does not unambiguously communicate that staples plan gives no protection while the manufacturer warranty is in effect,or even that,while the manufacturer warranty is operative,the protection given by the staples plan is limited to coverage not provided by the manufacturer warranty the district court was undoubtedly correct in observing that the language provided by staples in defining the scope of its coverage could certainly be clearer.orlander,wl,at.the ambiguities of the staples plan are numerous and complex.as there are a number of reasonable interpretations of the relevant contract provisions,they are ambiguous as a matter of law.see consarc marine midland bank,cir an ambiguous term is one about which reasonable minds could differ.
defendant failure to perform 
it is notable that,even on its interpretation of the contract as unambiguously communicat ing that during the life of the manufacturer warranty,anything covered by that warranty is the responsibility of the manufacturer,orlander,wl,at,the district court concluded that defendant did breach one of the contract provisions the provision defining service,according to which staples promised,we will refer you to the nearest authorized repair center for service.a.the court,however,dismissed this breach as immaterial and.orlander,wl,at.
neither the district court nor defendant have contended that this provision was negated by the manufacturer warranty restriction on the back page of the contract.yet when plaintiff brought in his malfunctioning computer,defendant did not refer him to the nearest authorized repair center for service.instead,defendant allegedly told plaintiff to contact his manufacturer directly that there was no coverage from the protection plan until the manufacturer warranty expired and that staples protection plans does not cover the first year,staples protection plans covers the year when the warranty expires from the manufacturer the manufacturer should cover the repair on the computer,staples will pick up the second year on plaintiff replacement plan.a.staples accordingly interpreted the plan differently from the district court.while the district court read it as not providing coverage that is provided by the manufacturer warranty,staples read its plan as providing no coverage whatsoever during the period when the manufacturer warranty was in effect,regardless of whether the coverage ordinarily provided on the face of the plan was also provided by the manufacturer.under the district court interpretation of the contract,staples failed to provide plaintiff with the one service it owed him referral to the nearest authorized repair center.
because the contract is ambiguous as a matter of law,its meaning and thus the sufficiency of staples performance may be clarified by extrinsic evidence.see ja apparel,at w here the contract language creates ambiguity,extrinsic evidence as to the parties intent may properly be considered.consarc,at where reasonable minds could be said to differ because the language the parties used in their written contract is susceptible to more than one meaning each as reasonable as the other and where extrinsic evidence of the parties actual intent exists,it should be submitted to the trier of fact.plaintiff alleged extrinsic evidence to the effect that 
when he purchased the computer and protection plan,plaintiff was told by a staples sales representative that the protection plan will provide complete coverage so that plaintiff would never need to contact the manufacturer for repairs or replacement.plaintiff was assured that if he was having problems with his computer,he would only need to bring the computer to his local staples store to have the problems resolved.
a.the trier of fact should be permitted to consider such evidence in determining the meaning of the ambiguous provisions of the plan and whether and to what extent staples failed to perform the contractual obligations it undertook.
materiality 
the district court found defendant failure to provide the promised referral service immaterial,citing vfs financing,falcon fifty llc,d.orlander,wl,at.the issue in falcon fifty,however,was whether an injured party was excused from performing its side of a contract where the other party had breached.d at under new york law,a party performance under a contract is excused where the other party has substantially failed to perform its side of the bargain or,synonymously,where that party has committed a material breach.it appears to have no bearing on this case.plaintiff does not ask to be excu
