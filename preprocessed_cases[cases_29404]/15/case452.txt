nine suits were filed in federal district courts around the country seeking monetary relief under both federal and state law for harms stemming from the enslavement of black people in america.a tenth suit,by the hurdle group of plaintiffs,makes similar claims but was filed in a state court and then removed by the defendants to a federal district court.the multidistrict litigation panel consolidated all the suits in the district court in chicago for pretrial proceedings.once there,the plaintiffs all but the hurdle plaintiffs,about whom more shortly filed a consolidated complaint,and since venue in chicago was proper and in any event not objected to by the parties other than the hurdle group,whose objection we consider later in the opinion,the district court was unquestionably authorized,notwithstanding lexecon milberg weiss bershad hynes lerach,d,to determine the merits of the suit.in re carbon dioxide industry antitrust litigation,cir neirbo bethlehem shipbuilding.
we are also persuaded that a district court to which a case is transferred under section can rule on a motion to dismiss the case even if the plaintiff has not agreed to let the court decide the merits.in re phenylpropanolamine ppa products liability litigation,cir charles wright,arthur miller edward cooper,federal practice and procedure.while it is true that the supreme court held in the lexecon case that a transfer under section does not authorize the district court to retain the case for trial,the court left open the question whether pretrial proceedings,which are the business the exclusive business of the transferee court,include rulings on dispositive pretrial motions,such as motions to dismiss.but the court hinted that they do include them.section a states that each action so transferred by the multidistrict litigation panel shall be remanded by the panel at or before the conclusion of such pretrial proceedings to the district from which it was transferred unless it shall have been previously terminated.concerning this provision of a limiting the panel remand obligation to cases not previously terminated during the pretrial period,the court remarked that this exception to the panel remand obligation indicates that the panel is not meant to issue ceremonial remand orders in cases already concluded by summary judgment,say,or dismissal,at.emphasis added implying that the transferee court can indeed decide the entire case at the pretrial stage.
and rightly so.the duty to conduct the pretrial proceedings in a multidistrict litigation entails the transferee court ruling on a host of pretrial motions,many of which,whether or not formally dispositive,can shape the litigation decisively.there is no reason to exclude from the court authority rulings on motions to a motion to dismiss on the ground that there is no federal jurisdiction.it would be odd to require a court to transfer a case to another federal court when it was apparent that neither court had jurisdiction over the case.
were it not for the hurdle suit,we would have to decide whether the district judge could have dismissed the transferred suits had the parties not agreed,by filing a new complaint,to his retaining them after completion of pretrial proceedings.but the hurdle plaintiffs did not agree,so we can not duck the question.
the suits are a series of mostly identical class actions on behalf of all americans descended from slaves with whom one or more of the defendants or their corporate predecessors may have been directly or indirectly involved.the consolidated complaint the hurdle complaint is similar,so need not be discussed separately alleges the following facts,for which we do not vouch,but merely summarize,the complaint having been dismissed before the truth or falsity of the allegations was determined.
the defendants are companies or the successors to companies that provided services,such as transportation,finance,and insurance,to slaveowners.at least two of the defendants were slaveowners the predecessor of one of the bank defendants once accepted slaves as collateral on loans and ended up owning of them when the borrowers defaulted,and the predecessor of another defendant ended up owning slaves,also as a consequence of a borrower default.even before the thirteenth amendment,slavery was illegal in the northern states,and the complaint charges that the defendants were violating the laws of those states in transacting with slaveowners.it also claims that there were occasional enslavements long after the passage of the thirteenth amendment and that some of the defendants were complicit in those too.by way of relief,the complaint seeks disgorgement to the class members of the profits that the defendants obtained from their dealings with slaveowners.
the legal basis for the plaintiffs federal claim is,which provides that all citizens of the united states shall have the same right,in every state and territory,as is enjoyed by white citizens thereof to inherit,purchase,lease,sell,hold,and convey real and personal property.see city of memphis greene,d jones alfred mayer,d.a claim based on a federal statute invokes the jurisdiction of the federal courts.but since most of the conduct of which the plaintiffs complain occurred prior to the passage of the thirteenth amendment,and indeed prior to the civil war,section does not provide a sturdy basis for the retention of federal jurisdiction over the plaintiffs nonfederal claims.a frivolous federal law claim can not successfully invoke federal jurisdiction.hagans lavine,d,cir crowley cutlery united states,cir lovern edwards,cir.so it can not provide a perch on which to seat nonfederal claims in the name of the federal courts supplemental jurisdiction.and very few of the plaintiffs have a nonfrivolous claim under section.
but with one exception,all the nonfederal claims are within the federal diversity jurisdiction and so do not require a handle.the exception is richard barber,suit for both he and brown brothers,one of the defendants in his suit,are citizens of new jersey.since he thus can not invoke diversity as a basis for federal jurisdiction and does not have a colorable section claim in fact he makes no section claim at all,his suit must be dismissed for want of federal jurisdiction without regard to the other challenges that the defendants mount to federal jurisdiction over these suits.
the district judge ruled that by virtue of both the doctrine and the requirement of standing to sue derived from article iii of the constitution,there was no federal jurisdiction over any of the suits and that in any event they had no merit because the applicable statutes of limitations had lapsed and anyway the complaint failed to state a claim.d.the dismissal was with prejudice.but if the judge was correct that there is no jurisdiction,he should have dismissed the suits without prejudice and thus not decided their merits.
the doctrine bars the federal courts from adjudicating disputes that the constitution has been interpreted to entrust to other branches of the federal government.the earliest and still the best example is luther borden,how.rhode island had not adopted a new constitution after the break with england,but instead continued to govern itself under its colonial charter.restive citizens convened a constitutional convention not authorized by the charter.the convention adopted a new constitution to which the charter government refused to submit,precipitating rebellion and the establishment in of a rival state government.the supreme court refused to decide which of the two competing governments was the legitimate one.it would have been exceedingly difficult to gather and assess,by the methods of litigation,the facts needed for such a decision.id.at.it would have been even more difficult to formulate a legal concept of revolutionary legitimacy to guide the decision.formulating and enforcing a remedy would have presented additional stumbling blocks.the case simply exceeded judicial capabilities.so the court left the matter to the president,to whom congress had delegated the duty of resolving it.id.at see also ohio ex rel.bryant akron metropolitan park district.pacific states telephone telegraph oregon.
a case that sought reparations for the wrong of slavery would encounter similar obstacles,but the plaintiffs have been careful to cast the litigation as a quest for conventional legal relief.all they are asking the federal judiciary to do is to apply state law plus the one federal statute,to the defendants conduct.they face,of course,formidable obstacles,quite apart from the severely limited applicability of section.to name just one of those obstacles,it is highly unlikely that antebellum laws in northern states were intended to confer financial or other benefits on the century descendants of slaves.but the obstacles to the vindication of the plaintiffs legal claims have the form at least of conventional defenses to a lawsuit.if one or more of the defendants violated a state law by transporting slaves in,and the plaintiffs can establish standing to sue,prove the violation despite its antiquity,establish that the law was intended to provide a remedy either directly or by providing the basis for a common law action for conspiracy,conversion,or restitution to lawfully enslaved persons or their descendants,identify their ancestors,quantify damages incurred,and persuade the court to toll the statute of limitations,there would be no further obstacle to the grant of relief.
but we think that the district court was correct,with some exceptions to be noted,in ruling that the plaintiffs lack standing to sue.it would be impossible by the methods of litigation to connect the defendants alleged misconduct with the financial and emotional harm that the plaintiffs claim to have suffered as a result of that conduct.see generally james hackney,the jurisprudence of slavery reparations ideological conflict,african american reparations,tort causation,and the case for social welfare transformation.for example,aetna is alleged to have written several insurance policies on slaves in the in violation of state law applicable to the company,and to have obtained premiums from the we assume exceeded the cost of the insurance to aetna its expenses plus the payment of proceeds if the insured event came to pass.the plaintiffs argue that aetna net income from this insurance was a wrongful profit that the company should be ordered to restore to the plaintiff classes.
if the insurance business was competitive back then and the plaintiffs do not argue that it was not,aetna did not profit in an economic sense from the transactions of which the plaintiffs complain its profit would just be its cost of equity capital,and in any event it would have distributed any profits from the transactions to its shareholders long ago.all that to one side,there is a fatal disconnect between the victims and the plaintiffs.when a person is wronged he can seek redress,and if he wins,his descendants may benefit,but the wrong to the ancestor is not a wrong to the descendants.for if it were,then problems of proof to one side statutes of limitations would be toothless.a person whose ancestor had been wronged a thousand years ago could sue on the ground that it was a continuing wrong and he is one of the victims.
the plaintiffs introduce another claim of injury by asserting that had the defendants refused to violate their own states laws by doing business with slaveowners,there would have been less slavery because the refusal would have been tantamount to subjecting the slaveowners to a partial boycott.that would have raised their costs,and,by making slavery less profitable,might have reduced the amount of it.might,not would,because the higher costs might simply have depressed the price of a slave.and had there been less slavery,the argument continues,some of the ancestors of the members of the plaintiff classes would not have been slaves,but instead free laborers,and they would have had some disposable income part of which they might have saved rather than spent,and left to their heirs.
but this causal chain is too long and has too many weak links for a court to be able to find that the defendants conduct harmed the plaintiffs at all,let alone in an amount that could be estimated without the wildest speculation.it is impossible to determine how much,if any,less slavery there would have been had the defendants not done business with slaveowners,what effect a diminution of slavery would have had on bequests by ancestors of the class members,and how much of the value of those bequests would have trickled down to the class members.
suppose a class member could prove that he was descended from one of the slaves insured by aetna or transported by the union pacific railroad another defendant or bought with money lent to the buyer by the predecessor of the jpmorgan chase bank still another defendant,and that these transactions were illegal and that the descendants of slaves are among the people whom the laws were intended to protect.had he not been insured or transported or bought with a bank loan,how would the financial welfare of his remote descendant be affected would the ancestor have been freed,or perhaps never enslaved in the first place as the plaintiffs stress,slavery was profitable is it conceivable that slaveholders would have been unable to insure,transport,and finance the purchase of slaves if northern companies had been excluded from the provision of these services or had refused to violate their states laws that sought to keep them from providing the services 
even if compliance with those laws would have curtailed slavery and even if it could be shown it could not be that as a result of that hypothetical curtailment a plaintiff remote ancestor would not have been a slave but instead a free laborer,how could the wages that the ancestor would have earned as a free laborer be shown to have influenced the wealth of his remote descendant economists actually study such issues,under the rubric of intergenerational mobility,see,kerwin kofi charles erik hurst,the correlation of wealth across generations,pol.econ.keith hylton,the jurisprudence of slavery reparations slavery and tort law,but these are studies of aggregate effects,not of the effects of particular acts,affecting particular individuals,on the wealth of specific remote descendants.there is no way to determine that a given black american today is worse off by a specific,calculatable sum of money or monetized emotional harm as a result of the conduct of one or more of the defendants.
nor are the problems of measuring and tracing elided by recasting the relief sought as restitution rather than damages.transfer of the wrongdoer gain to his an alternative to damages,the monetization of the victim loss.confold pacific,polaris industries,cir charter communications entertainment i,dst burdulis,cir kerr charles vatterott,cir dan dobbs,dobbs law of remedies,ed.it is a sensible remedy for egregious misconduct because it makes the conduct worthless to the defendant by taking away his profit even if it exceeds the loss to the plaintiff.but it presupposes an is a remedy for a legal there is no way in which to determine what if any injury the defendants inflicted on the members of the plaintiff classes.
and again,if there were a legal wrong,it would not be a wrong to any living persons unless they were somehow the authorized representatives to bring suits on behalf of their enslaved ancestors.with some exceptions to be noted,the plaintiffs are suing to redress harms to third parties their ancestors,without being authorized to sue on behalf of those parties.it is like a suit by a descendant of a union soldier,killed in battle,against a civil war era gun manufacturer still in business that sold guns to the confederacy in violation of federal law.a federal court could not entertain the suit because the plaintiff would be unable to prove a harm to an interest of his such as his bank account that the law protects,raines byrd,d sierra club morton,d.it is possible that had the ancestor not died when he did he would have become a wealthy person and left bequests so immense that his remote descendant,the plaintiff,would have inherited more money from his parents or grandparents than he actually did.but that is too speculative an inqu
