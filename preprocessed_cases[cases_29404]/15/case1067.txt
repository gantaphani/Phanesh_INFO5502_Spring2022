twin laboratories,manufactures and markets nutritional and dietary supplements,some of which contain ma huang,a botanical source of ephedra alkaloids.general nutrition corporation gnc and its franchisees sell these products.
james nagel,on behalf of himself and all others similarly situated collectively nagel,sued twin laboratories,apparently incorrectly named in the complaint as twin lab corporation,gnc,and certain gnc franchisees for violations of california unfair competition laws and the consumer legal remedies act.for ease of reference,we will refer to all defendants collectively as twin labs.both twin labs product labels and its web site state that the ma huang extract in twin labs product ripped fuel is standardized for ephedrine.nagel claims this statement is false and misleading.
twin labs moved to strike the complaint pursuant to code of civil procedure section section,commonly referred to as the strategic lawsuit against public participation statute.the trial court found twin labs labeling and advertising to be speech protected by section,but also found nagel had established a probability he would prevail on the merits of his claims.therefore,the trial court denied the motion to strike.
we affirm.three recent opinions from the california supreme sletten cal th,d,city of cotati cashman cal th,d,and equilon enterprises consumer cause,cal th,d,clarified the scope and application of the statute.a cause of action is subject to a motion to strike if it satisfies both prongs of the,it arises from protected speech or petitioning and lacks even minimal merit.navellier sletten,supra,cal th at,d.
with regard to the first the cause of action arises from protected labs product labels and web site listing of the ingredients of its products are commercial speech,but are not immunized from a false advertising claim by virtue of the statute.the united states supreme court has long held commercial speech receives less protection than noncommercial speech.we conclude the list of a product ingredients does not satisfy the first prong of section.even if the first prong of the statute had been satisfied,nagel provided sufficient admissible evidence to show he had a probability of prevailing on the merits of his claims.
facts and trial court proceedings 
twin labs manufactures and markets dietary supplements containing ephedra alkaloids,which are obtained from the ma huang plant.twin labs markets several different products containing ephedra alkaloids,including ripped fuel.ephedra alkaloids are used as stimulants or diet aids in the weight loss market.ephedra has been allegedly linked to medical conditions causing serious illness and even death.
gnc and its franchisees advertise,market,distribute,and sell ripped fuel and other twin labs products containing ephedra alkaloids.
the labels on the bottles of ripped fuel state the ma huang extract is standardized for ephedrine.twin labs web site also contains this statement.nagel contends the ephedrine in ripped fuel is not standardized,at least not in the popularly understood use of the word.the results of tests conducted on ripped fuel appear to show the amount of ephedrine differs dramatically between lots.
nagel sued twin labs for unfair competition,false advertising,and violation of the consumer legal remedies act clra,contending the statements on the bottle labels and on twin labs web site regarding the amount of standardized ephedrine in ripped fuel were false and misleading.
twin labs filed a special motion to strike under section,contending its product labeling and advertising were protected free speech on a matter of public interest and nagel could not prevail on his claims.nagel opposed the motion,arguing because twin labs advertising was false,it was not entitled to any protection and section therefore did not apply.nagel argued,alternatively,if the list of ingredients was protected by section,he had presented sufficient evidence to show he would prevail on his claims.
the trial court denied the motion to strike,finding twin labs labeling and advertising were protected by section,but nagel had successfully shown he would prevail on his claims.twin labs appealed.code civ,subd.j,subd.a.
discussion 
on appeal,we review de novo whether section protects the subject speech and whether nagel demonstrated a probability he would prevail on his claims.lam ngo th,d.
statutory framework 
section provides,in relevant part a cause of action against a person arising from any act of that person in furtherance of the person right of petition or free speech under the united states or california constitution in connection with a public issue shall be subject to a special motion to strike,unless the court determines that the plaintiff has established that there is a probability that the plaintiff will prevail on the claim,subd.b.as used in this section,act in furtherance of a person right of petition or free speech under the united states or california constitution in connection with a public issue includes any other conduct in furtherance of the exercise of the constitutional right of petition or the constitutional right of free speech in connection with a public issue or an issue of public interest,subd.e.
in analyzing a section motion,the trial court engages in a process.first,the court decides whether the defendant has made a threshold showing that the challenged cause of action is one arising from protected activity.navellier sletten,supra,cal th,d.the defendant meets this burden by showing the act underlying the plaintiff cause of action fits within section.braun chronicle publishing th,d.
if the defendant meets this initial burden,the burden then shifts and the plaintiff must show a probability of prevailing on the claim.navellier sletten,supra,cal th at,d.t he plaintiff must demonstrate that the complaint is both legally sufficient and supported by a sufficient prima facie showing of facts to sustain a favorable judgment if the evidence submitted by the plaintiff is credited.id.at,d.the plaintiff must make a prima facie showing of facts that would,if proven,support a judgment in the plaintiff favor.wilson parker,covert chidester cal th,d,walker kiousis th,d lam ngo,supra,th,d.the plaintiff can not rely on the allegations of the complaint alone,but must present admissible evidence.evans unkow th,d.in ruling on a motion to strike,the trial court does not weigh the evidence or determine questions of credibility instead the court accepts as true all of the evidence favorable to the plaintiff.kashian harriman th,d.
here,the trial court determined twin labs list of ingredients on its product labels and its web site was protected by the statute because t he complaint does allege speech on an issue of public interest at least as defined by the court in dupont merck pharmaceutical superior court th,d.as to the second prong of the analysis,the trial court found nagel had met his burden of showing a probability of prevailing on the claims,stating p laintiff has established a probability that he will prevail in his claim that within the statutory period,defendants products were not standardized as marked and advertised,constituting a violation of the unfair competition law and clra.
does section protect twin labs list of ingredients on its product labels and web site 
is the list of ripped fuel ingredients,found on the product labels and on twin labs web site,speech in furtherance of twin labs right of petition or free speech under the united states or california constitution in connection with a public issue,subd.b within the meaning of section we conclude it is not.
we start our analysis with the recognition that the list of ingredients on twin labs labels and web site constitutes commercial speech only.twin labs agrees,as it must,that the description of the ingredients in its products is commercial speech.
commercial speech is entitled to protection,but the first amendment to the united states constitution accords less protection to commercial speech than to other constitutionally safeguarded forms of expression.bolger youngs drug products,d.there are three reasons for the distinction between the protections given to commercial and noncommercial speech.first,it is easier to verify the truth of commercial speech,so governmental regulation is less likely to chill the dissemination of accurate and nondeceptive speech.pharmacy bd.consumer council,fn,d.second,because commercial speakers act from profit motives,commercial speech is less likely to be abandoned due to governmental regulation.ibid.third,because the government has the authority to regulate commercial transactions to prevent harm to the consumer,it similarly has the authority to regulate the speech connected to those transactions.liquormart,rhode island,d see also illinois ex rel.madigan telemarketing associates,d state attorney general could maintain fraud claim based on misleading representations in charitable fundraising.
we analyze twin labs motion in view of the purpose and language of section.to do so,we also rely on decisions by the united states supreme court,describing the protection afforded to commercial speech.what is the extent of protection under section for twin labs list of ingredients in its products political speech is at one end of the spectrum and is protected under the first amendment and section.national endowment for the arts finley,d.we conclude a list of product ingredients on labels and a web site is at the other end of the spectrum and is not protected speech under section.twin labs has not cited any case to us and we have discovered none in which a product label or other form of commercial speech that does nothing more than list the product ingredients has received the protection of section.
twin labs argues its list of ingredients should be protected under section because it is speech in connection with a public issue,subd.b.this argument fails for two reasons.first,the language in connection with a public issue modifies earlier language in the statute referring to the acts in furtherance of the constitutional right of free speech.the phrase can not be read in isolation.thus,twin labs reliance on an argument that its list of product ingredients is immunized because it pertains to a public health.
second,while matters of health and weight management are undeniably of interest to the public,it does not necessarily follow that all lists of ingredients on labels of food products or on the manufacturers web sites are fully protected from legal challenges by virtue of section.advertisers should not be permitted to immunize false or misleading product information from government regulation simply by including references to public issues.bolger youngs drug products,supra,at.here,the list of ripped fuel ingredients on the bottle labels and on twin labs web site was not participation in the public dialogue on weight management issues the labeling on its face was designed to further twin labs private interest of increasing sales for its products.ericsson ge mobile communications,telecommunications engineers th,d.twin labs commercial speech was not made in connection with a public issue as that phrase is used in section.the statute does not require dismissal of nagel lawsuit.
the california supreme court opinion in kasky nike,cal th,d,nike,summarizes the united states supreme court decisions comparing commercial and noncommercial speech,and analyzes what speech may be subjected to california false advertising laws.nike did not involve the statute.the speech at issue in nike was a public debate over nike labor practices in foreign countries.news agencies reported workers in foreign factories where nike products are manufactured were paid less than the applicable local minimum wage required to work overtime allowed and encouraged to work more overtime hours than applicable local law allowed subjected to physical,verbal,and sexual abuse and exposed to toxic chemicals,noise,heat,and dust without adequate safety equipment,in violation of applicable local occupational health and safety regulations.id.at,d.
to counter the negative publicity generated by these reports,nike issued statements in press releases,in letters to newspapers,in a letter to university presidents and athletic directors,and in other forms of public relations materials.the materials stated the workers in nike foreign factories received a living wage,were paid more than the local minimum wage,received free meals and health care,and worked under conditions that complied with local laws regarding occupational health and safety.nike,supra,cal th at,d.nike also paid for advertisements in major newspapers,detailing the findings of an investigation by former united nations ambassador andrew young,which found no evidence of illegal or unsafe working conditions at nike factories in china,vietnam,and indonesia.id.at,d.
based on these statements and advertisements,kasky sued nike for false advertising and violation of the unfair competition law.the california supreme court,in a vote,found the first amendment did not protect nike speech from a false advertising claim.as we explain below,under either the analysis of the majority or dissenting opinions in nike,twin labs speech at issue in this case is not protected under the first amendment.
the majority in nike determined nike speech about the conditions of and labor practices in its foreign factories consisted of factual statements about how nike makes its products nike,supra,cal th at,d,opn.of kennard,and therefore was commercial speech that may be regulated to prevent consumer deception.id.at,d.under the majority analysis,twin labs statements about the ingredients in its products are commercial speech subject to false advertising challenges.
two dissenting opinions disagreed with the majority conclusion that nike speech was commercial speech only.justice chin,joined by justice baxter,cited united states supreme court decisions identifying commercial speech as speech that does no more than propose a commercial transaction.nike,supra,cal th at,d,dis.opn.of chin,citing.pharmacy bd.consumer council,supra,at.justice chin dissenting opinion concluded nike speech went beyond proposing a commercial transaction it provided information vital to the public debate on international labor rights and reform.nike,supra,cal th at,d,dis.opn.of chin.therefore,the commercial speech and noncommercial speech were at least inextricably intertwined.id.at,d,dis.opn.of chin,quoting riley national federation of blind,d.because the two types of speech were inextricably intertwined,justice chin rejected the majority parsing out of nike commercial speech from its noncommercial speech.nike,supra,cal th at,d,dis.opn.of chin.justice brown agreed the speech at issue was protected because the commercial elements of nike statements are inextricably intertwined with their noncommercial elements.citation.id.at,d,dis.opn.of brown.here,in stark contrast,there are only commercial elements of speech and they are not inextricably intertwined with noncommercial elements.
furthermore,there are additional material differences between nike and this case,namely the purpose and timing of the speech at issue.as justice chin noted,nike used its speech to defend itself from the attacks in the media regarding its labor practices.nike,supra,cal th at,d,dis.opn.of chin.permitting criticism of a commercial enterprise,while denying that enterprise the ability to defend itself because it markets its business in the process,creates an unlevel playing field and ultimately will inhibit rather than promote vigorous and meaningful debate.ibid.here,twin labs was never defending itself from criticism it was only listing the ingredients in its products.
in two cases,this division has addressed issues raised under the first prong of section similar to those discussed in this opinion.first,in dupont merck pharmaceutical superior court th,d dupont,this court ordered the trial court to vacate its order denying the defendant motion to strike.id.at,d.the trial court determined section did not apply to the alleged violations of the unfair competition law and the clra,arising out of the defendant alleged false statements in marketing its drug,coumadin.dupont,supra,at,d.the defendant allegedly made false and misleading statements to the publi
