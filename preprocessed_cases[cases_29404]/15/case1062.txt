in this appeal we determine the applicability and constitutionality of a federal statute that restricts unsolicited facsimile fax advertisements,commonly called junk fax.the federal telephone consumer protection act of tcpa or act,a,stat.prohibits the sending of unsolicited advertisements to fax machines.anyone receiving such a fax may,if otherwise permitted by the laws or rules of court of a state,bring in an appropriate court of that state an action seeking injunctive relief and actual monetary loss or in damages,whichever is greater,plus treble damages for willful or knowing violations.b a c.
the trial court ruled that plaintiffs could not pursue a tcpa claim in state court because the california legislature had not enacted a statute expressly permitting such a claim.the trial court also ruled that the tcpa is constitutional and that tcpa claims may be brought as a class action.we agree with the trial court resolution of the constitutional and class action issues but conclude that a tcpa action may be maintained in state court because the california legislature has not prohibited such suits.we reverse.
background 
we begin with an examination of the tcpa legislative history,followed by the procedural history of the case.
legislative history 
from to,congress considered bills addressing the telemarketing practices made possible by technological innovations,including the transmission of advertisements by fax.in the process,congress held three hearings and produced three committee reports.the final bill combined features of three bills.
in drafting the bills,congress became aware of problems associated with unsolicited fax that were highlighted in several media reports and by legislative initiatives in many states.see telemarketing practices hearing on,and before the subcom.on telecommunications and finance of the house com.on energy and commerce.since businesses had begun to express concern about the interference,interruptions and expenses that junk fax placed upon them,states were taking action to eliminate these telemarketing practices.two states had enacted laws banning the use of facsimile machines for unsolicited advertising.similar bills were pending in the legislatures of about half the states.
state laws had limited effect,however,because states do not have jurisdiction over interstate calls.many states expressed a desire for federal legislation to regulate interstate telemarketing calls to supplement their restrictions on intrastate calls,reprinted in cong.admin.news.b usiness owners were virtually unanimous in their view that they did not want their fax lines tied up by advertisers trying to send messages.telemarketing practices hearing on,and before the subcom.on telecommunications and finance of the house com.on energy and commerce,supra,at,fn.omitted.extensive research revealed no case of a company other than those advertising via fax which oppose d legislation restricting advertising via fax.id.at,fn.as a state legislator from utah put it,you get a message you did want from people you do know on paper they did buy.id.at statement of representative ken jacobsen.
richard kessel,a new york state official,spearheaded the movement to ban unsolicited fax advertisements in his state after he was unable to fax a document to the governor office which,at the time,was processing an incoming advertisement.see telemarketing practices hearing on,and before the subcom.on telecommunications and finance of the house com.on energy and commerce,supra,at.the last thing you want when you trying to meet a deadline,or trying to get a memo to your boss is to be disturbed by someone trying to sell draperies or submarine sandwiches.ibid.
in hearings held in,the cofounder of the center for the study of commercialism,michael jacobson,described the numerous nuisance faxes he had received and complained that they not only use the recipient paper,but also prevent faxes from being sent out and prevent legitimate faxes from coming in.hearing on,and before the subcom.on communications of the com.on commerce,science,and transportation.the director of computer professionals for social responsibility,marc rotenberg,noted that there is widespread opposition to junk faxes.issues hearing on and before the subcom.on telecommunications and finance of the house com.on energy and commerce.
a house subcommittee heard from the chair of the florida public service commission,thomas beard,who was also a member of the national association of regulatory utility commissioners naruc,a,nonprofit organization with members from the governmental agencies of all states who attempt to ensure that telecommunication common carriers establish services and facilities as may be required by public convenience and necessity.beard stated,the junk fax advertiser is a nuisance who wants to print its ad on your paper and seizes your fax machine so that it is not available for calls you want or need.telemarketing privacy issues hearing on and,supra,at.beard also reported at a meeting in washington last year,the naruc reviewed the situation concerning fax advertising and passed a resolution urging congress to enact legislation on the subject.the naruc said that the legislation should restrict the use of facsimile machines for unsolicited advertising and prescribe specific penalties for violations.id.at see id.at text of naruc resolution.
the legislative counsel for the american civil liberties union,janlori goldman,told the house subcommittee,we support the limits on fax machines,in terms of sending unsolicited advertising.we think that because of the burden that is placed on the individual who has to pay for the cost of the communication,that that then justifies a broader ban than that placed on telephone solicitations.issues hearing on and before the subcom.on telecommunications and finance of the house com.on energy and commerce,supra,at.the subcommittee was well aware that a festering problem had arisen from the junk fax.junk fax is more than merely irritating.it represents an unfair shifting of the cost of advertising from the advertiser to the unwitting customer u nsolicited and unwanted faxes can tie up a machine for hours and thwart the receipt of legitimate and important messages.id.at.
congress recognized that,although considered a n office oddity during the mid,the facsimile machine has become a primary tool for business to relay instantaneously written communications and transactions.by,millions of offices in the united states were sending more than billion pages of information via fax each year in an effort to speed communications and cut overnight delivery costs.ibid.but the proliferation of fax machines has been accompanied by explosive growth in unsolicited facsimile advertising,or junk fax,supra.facsimile machines are designed to accept,process,and print all messages the fax advertiser takes advantage of this basic design by sending advertisements to available fax numbers,knowing that they will be received and printed by the recipient machine.this type of telemarketing is problematic for two reasons.first,it shifts some of the costs of advertising from the sender to the recipient.second,it occupies the recipient facsimile machine so that it is unavailable for legitimate business messages while processing and printing the junk fax,supra.w hen a facsimile machine is receiving a fax,it may require several minutes or more to process and print the advertisement.id.at.only the most sophisticated and expensive facsimile machines can process and print more than one message at a time.ibid.
when an advertiser sends marketing material to a potential customer through regular mail,the recipient pays nothing to receive the letter,supra.but the recipient of fax advertisements assumes both the cost associated with the use of the facsimile machine and the cost of the expensive paper used to print out facsimile messages.ibid.t hese costs are borne by the recipient s of the fax advertisement regardless of their interest in the product or service being advertised.see also,reprinted in cong.admin.news,fax messages require the called party to pay for the paper used.it is no wonder that unsolicited fax advertising is sometimes called advertising by theft.see cal.com.on bus.and,analysis of assem.bill reg.sess.
as senator hollings,the sponsor of the tcpa,noted,the act also prohibits unsolicited advertisements sent to fax machines,known as junk fax.advertisements today are sent for cruises,home products,investments,and all kinds of products and services without the consent of the person receiving them these junk fax advertisements can be a severe impediment to carrying out legitimate business practices and ought to be abolished.remarks of hollings,cong.rec.the senator also stated the act contains a private provision that will make it easier for consumers to recover damages from receiving these computerized calls.the provision would allow consumers to bring an action in state court against any entity that violates the bill.the bill does not,because of constitutional constraints,dictate to the states which court in each state shall be the proper venue for such an action,as this is a matter for state legislators to determine.nevertheless,it is my hope that states will make it as easy as possible for consumers to bring such actions,preferably in small claims court 
small claims court or a similar court would allow the consumer to appear before the court without an attorney.the amount of damages in this legislation is set to be fair to both the consumer and the telemarketer.however,it would defeat the purposes of the bill if the attorneys costs to consumers of bringing an action were greater than the potential damages.i thus expect that the states will act reasonably in permitting their citizens to go to court to enforce this bill.remarks of hollings,cong.rec.
congress enacted the tcpa in november.the measure was signed into law on december.section b of the act makes it unlawful to use any telephone facsimile machine,computer,or other device to send an unsolicited advertisement to a telephone facsimile machine.b c.unsolicited advertisement is defined as any material advertising the commercial availability or quality of any property,goods,or services which is transmitted to any person without that person prior express invitation or permission,a see also,a defining telephone facsimile machine.
procedural history 
in two separate superior court cases,kaufman acs systems,super.county,no.kaufman and amkraut,super.county,no.amkraut,plaintiffs brought class actions under the tcpa against companies that had faxed unsolicited advertisements to them.
in kaufman,the plaintiffs alleged that defendant acs systems,a software company,had used the telemarketing services of defendant datamart information services corporation to send unsolicited faxes to recipients in and.in amkraut,plaintiffs alleged that two telemarketers,defendants,and cynet,had sent unsolicited fax advertisements to businesses and consumers in southern california in june.in both cases,defendants asserted that plaintiffs had no private right of action under the tcpa,if such a right existed,it would violate the united states constitution,and claims under the tcpa can not be brought as class actions.
in light of the similarities between the kaufman and amkraut cases,they were informally coordinated in the trial court with respect to law and motion matters.through a combination of demurrers and motions for summary judgment and summary adjudication,the trial court ruled that the tcpa did not violate the constitution and that claims under the tcpa could be brought as class actions,but that plaintiffs did not have a private right of action in state court.judgment was entered in favor of defendants.plaintiffs filed timely appeals.we ordered the appeals consolidated for purposes of briefing and oral argument 
discussion 
on review of a judgment entered after the sustaining of a demurrer without leave to amend or the granting of motions for summary judgment and summary adjudication,we review the trial court decision de novo.blank kirwan cal d,jackson county of los angeles th,d.independent review is also appropriate in this case because we apply statutory and constitutional provisions to undisputed facts.see state farm mut.auto.ins.department of motor vehicles th,d rubin city of burbank th,d.
with the agreement of the parties,the trial court considered three questions that it found dispositive of the cases.on appeal,we dispose of those questions as follows.
first,do plaintiffs have a private right of action allowing them to file a tcpa action in state court we answer that question in the affirmative because the tcpa permits the states to prohibit private tcpa actions in their courts,and the california legislature has not done so.
second,if a private right of action exists,may plaintiffs prosecute the claim as a class action the answer is yes,if there is an ascertainable class and a community of interest among the purported class members.
and,third,does the tcpa violate defendants first amendment right to engage in commercial speech,amend.no.in addition,the tcpa is not void for vagueness under the due process clause,amends.nor does it impose excessive damages in violation of the due process clause.ibid.
private right of action 
in determining whether plaintiffs have a private right of action,we examine the language of the tcpa,judicial interpretations of the act,and the regulation of junk fax under california law.
tcpa claims as permitted by state law 
the act authorizes actions by states whenever the attorney general of a state,or an official or agency designated by a state,has reason to believe that any person has engaged or is engaging in a pattern or practice of telephone calls or other transmissions to residents of that state in violation of this act or the regulations prescribed under this act,the state may bring a civil action on behalf of its residents to enjoin such calls,an action to recover for actual monetary loss or receive in damages for each violation,or both such actions.f.federal district courts have exclusive jurisdiction over actions brought by state officials,f.the federal communications commission fcc has the right to intervene in the action,f.in addition,the fcc has the power to prosecute civil actions and conduct administrative proceedings under the tcpa,regardless of enforcement by private litigants and state authorities.see,in the matter of,wl lexis in the matter of notary,wl lexis f.
the tcpa also creates a conditional private right of action,stating a person or entity may,if otherwise permitted by the laws or rules of court of a state,bring in an appropriate court of that state a an action based on a violation of this act or the regulations promulgated by the fcc to enjoin such violation,b an action to recover for actual monetary loss from such a violation,or to receive in damages for each such violation,whichever is greater,or c both such actions.b a c.the court may impose treble damages for willful or knowing violations,b.
t he legislative history and purpose of the tcpa support the view that congress intended to confer exclusive jurisdiction on state courts over private rights of action although over forty state legislatures had enacted measures restricting unsolicited telemarketing,these measures had limited effect because states do not have jurisdiction over interstate calls.foxhall realty law offices,telecom.prem.serv.cir,citation omitted.
t he tcpa is unusual in that it gives state courts exclusive jurisdiction over private rights of action conferred by federal law and limits f ederal court jurisdiction to civil actions to enforce the tcpa brought by state attorneys general or the federal communications commission.schulman chase manhattan bank,citations omitted.at least six federal circuit courts have reached the somewhat unusual conclusion that state courts have exclusive jurisdiction over a private cause of action created by a federal statute,the tcpa.murphey lanier cir.
the clause in the tcpa if otherwise permitted by the laws or rules of court of a state does not condition the substantive right to be free from unsolicited faxes on state approval.indeed,that substantive right is enforceable by state attorneys general or the federal communications commission irrespective of the availability of a private action in state court.rather,the clause recognizes that states may refuse to exercise the jurisdiction authorized by the tcpa.thus,a state could decide to prevent its courts from hearing private actions to enforce the tcpa substantive rights.
i t is readily apparent from the congressional findings contained in the tcpa itself that congress considered the effect that a newly created private right of action would have on judicial administration.specifically finding that million telemarketing calls are made daily,congress understandably avoided opening federal courts to the millions of potential private tcpa claims by authorizing private actions only in state courts,presumably in the small claims courts.similarly concerned over the potential impact of private actions on the administration of state courts,congress included a provision to allow the states to prohibit private tcpa actions in their courts.we have no doubt that congress has a legitimate interest in not overburdening state and federal courts.nor can it be doubted that congress has a legitimate interest in respecting the states judgments about when their courts are overburdened.with those interests in mind and recognizing that other enforcement mechanisms are available in the tcpa,namely,enforcement by the fcc or state attorneys general,congress acted rationally in allowing states to close their courts to the millions of private actions that could be filed if only a small portion of each year billion telemarketing transmissions were illegal under the tcpa.
apparently recognizing that the exclusivity of state court jurisdiction could create a problem,congress avoided any constitutional issue by refusing to coerce states to hear private tcpa actions,providing instead that a person or entity may,if otherwise permitted by the laws or rules of court of a state,bring a tcpa action in an appropriate court of that state states thus retain the ultimate decision of whether private tcpa actions will be cognizable in their courts.intern.science tech.institute inacom comm.cir,italics added.s tates have been given,subject to their consent,exclusive subject matter jurisdiction over private actions authorized by the telephone consumer protection act of id.at,italics added accord,foxhall realty law offices,telecom.prem,supra,at murphey lanier,supra,at.
although actual monetary losses from telemarketing abuses are likely to be minimal,this private enforcement provision puts teeth into the statute by providing for statutory damages and by allowing consumers to bring actions on their own.consumers who are harassed by telemarketing abuses can seek damages themselves,rather than waiting for federal or state agencies to prosecute violations.although the statute does authorize states to bring actions on their citizens behalf,the sheer number of calls made each than make it impossible for government entities alone to completely or effectively supervise this activity.erienet,velocity net,cir.
state permission 
in deciding whether a state permits private suits under the tcpa,all but one state court have held that a state permission does not require any affirmative conduct on the part of the state legislature,nor the enactment of court rules.put another way,a person may file a tcpa action in state court as long as the state has not prohibited it.
in one of the early cases to address the issue of state permission,the appellate division of the new york supreme court stated in the absence of a state statute declining to exercise the jurisdiction authorized by the tcpa,a state court has jurisdiction over tcpa claims new york has not refused to exercise such jurisdiction,and thus the lower court should not have dismissed the claim.kaplan democrat and chronicle,accord,schulman chase manhattan bank,supra,at,at.
the missouri supreme court concluded that the tcpa does not condition the right to bring a private cause of action on a state adoption of specific legislation permitting such suits.suit may be brought unless a state does not otherwise permit such a suit.missouri law does not prohibit the filing of an action under the tcpa.reynolds diamond foods poultry.
the georgia court of appeals reached the same conclusion,stating w e will not construe the tcpa in a manner which leaves georgia citizens without a remedy.we construe the tcpa as creating a private right of action and conferring jurisdiction upon state courts.the trial court correctly determined that georgia law does not expressly prohibit private tcpa actions for the transmission of unsolicited facsimile advertisements.hooters of augusta,nicholson,fn.omitted.the courts of new jersey and pennsylvania are in agreement.see zelma market,aronson.lexis,pp.
the lone departure from this line of state cases is a decision by the texas court of appeals.that court concluded,in cursory analysis,that congress intended the states to pass legislation or promulgate court rules consenting to state court actions based on the tcpa,before such suits under the tcpa may be brought in state courts.autoflex leasing mfrs.auto leasing,autoflex.in other words,a state must affirmatively act of the legislature or adoption of court filing of private tcpa actions in state court.
as one commentator has noted,the court in autoflex,supra,cited several of the federal court tcpa decisions in error and held in a short and poorly reasoned opinion that congress intended the states to pass legislation or promulgate court rules consenting to state court actions based on the tcpa.in addition to being specifically rejected by these courts,no appellate federal court has ever supported the affirmative approval argument.biggerstaff,state court and the telephone consumer protections act of must states can states.
regulation of junk fax by california 
california appellate courts have not decided whether a private right of action exists under the tcpa.to answer that question,we consider the state legislative attempts to curb unsolicited fax advertisements.
in september,the california legislature passed a junk fax bill bill reg.sess,but the governor vetoed the measure bill,vetoed by governor,final hist.reg.sess.instead,the governor signed a bill that required the california public utilities commission puc to study the issue and prepare a report documenting any evidence that unsolicited fax advertisements were a problem.bill reg.sess.stats,ch,governor veto message to on bill,reg.sess.
in its december,report,the puc stated i t appears that unsolicited telefacsimile telecommunications are not currently a significant problem in california.however,california fax owners do not like unsolicited faxes,almost irrespective of their source,and believe that the problem will get worse in the next few years.the current cost of junk fax incurred by fax machine users in california is estimated to be over million a year.there is strong support for a variety of possible legislative actions to limit unsolicited faxes.to the legislature unsolicited telefacsimile marketing communications per sb.
in conjunction with the puc report,a random survey was conducted of respondents,consisting of businesses,government employees,and individuals who worked out of their homes.to the legislature unsolicited telefacsimile marketing communications per sb,supra,appen.the survey indicated that fax machine users attributed several problems to junk fax,including wasted time,wasted paper,costs,tying up the fax machine,and interference with operations.to the legislature unsolicited telefacsimile marketing communications per sb,supra,at.percent of the businesses,percent of the government offices,and percent of the home fax users favored some form of legislation restricting unsolicited faxes.id.at.
in,the california legislature passed a bill that prohibited the sending of unsolicited fax advertisements unless the faxed document contained a telephone number and an address that the recipient could use to stop further advertisements assem.bill reg.sess.the bill added section to the business and professions code.a violation of the statute constituted an infraction authorizing a fine per transmission.the new statute provided 
a no person or entity conducting business in this state shall fax or cause to be faxed documents consisting of unsolicited advertising material for the lease,sale,rental,gift offer,or other disposition of any realty,goods,services,or extension of credit unless that person or entity establishes a telephone number which a recipient of the unsolicited faxed documents may call to notify the sender not to fax the recipient any further unsolicited documents.
b all unsolicited faxed documents subject to this section shall include a statement,in at least type,informing the recipient of the telephone number the recipient may call,and an address the recipient may write to,notifying the sender not to fax the recipient any further unsolicited documents to the fax number,or numbers,specified by the recipient.
c upon notification by a recipient of his or her request not to receive any further unsolicited faxed documents,no person or entity conducting business in this state shall fax or cause to be faxed any unsolicited documents to that recipient.
d any violation of subdivision c is an infraction punishable by a fine of five hundred dollars for each and every transmission stats,ch,west ann.cal.bus.ed,all further citations to section are to the business and professions code.
the enrolled bill report for section indicated that by virtue of the statute placement in business and professions code et relating to false and misleading advertising,violations would be subject to civil penalties of up to per violation,injunctive relief and restitution to the injured party.such actions are brought by the attorney general and local prosecutors.cal.of consumer affairs,enrolled bill on assem.bill reg.sess,enrolled bill report.
after noting that congress had enacted the tcpa,the enrolled bill report stated on december,the president signed pl,which among other things prohibits unsolicited fax advertisements.unsolicited is defined in the federal law as without the recipient prior express invitation or permission.the precise meaning of express invitation or permission will have to be addressed in the implementing regulations which will be adopted by the fcc this process could take a couple of years o nce the fcc regulations are in place the federal law and regulations will supersede ab since they will be more protective.but until that time,ab would give california fax machine owners more protection than they currently have against unsolicited fax ads.enrolled bill,supra,at,underscoring in original.
under the heading fiscal impact,the enrolled bill report read none to the department.the bill c reates a crime punishable by an infraction.by virtue of its proposed location in the business and professions code,repeated and willful violations would be subject to the penalties for false and misleading advertising civil penalties of up to per violation redirected in whole or in part to the county or state,depending on who enforces it,injunctive relief,restitution and a misdemeanor penalty.these provisions are enforced locally and by the attorney general.enrolled bill,supra,at.
under argument,the enrolled bill report explained the author office is aware of the federal legislation but is concerned that it may not entirely prohibit unsolicited fax transmissions because the fcc will be adopting regulations to further define the terms in the federal law and because of the time delay in the effective date due to the need to adopt implementing regulations.
we view unsolicited faxed ads as an invasion of privacy and an infringement on personal property.we know of no other advertising situation where the recipient is forced to bear a portion of the advertiser costs.enrolled bill,supra,at,underscoring in original.
in,the legislature amended section to include restrictions on unsolicited advertising through electronic mail.the amended statute prohibited solicitations unless the sender established a telephone number or return address that the recipient could use to notify the sender not to any further solicitations.see stats,ch,west ann.cal.bus.supp.
during the legislative session,the legislature took another look at section.this time,the legislature decided to repeal the restrictions on unsolicited fax advertisements.assembly bill was introduced for that purpose.see assem.bill reg.sess.stats,ch,historical and statutory notes,west ann.cal.bus.supp.
the legislative analysis of assembly bill,as reported by the senate committee on business and professions,was as follows 
state and professions code section.in,the legislature passed and the governor signed ab,the bill that restricted unsolicited fax advertisements.section prohibits unsolicited faxes unless the sender meets certain requirements,such as providing an number so that the recipient can call to have name removed.
the author of the current bill argues that the legislation was established for the purpose of protecting californians during the estimated interim between the passage of the federal ban and the time when the fcc regulations implementing the federal ban would become effective.evidence to support the author view can be found in letters from the department of consumer affairs dca for example,in dca enrolled bill report,they note that the federal law which would prohibit unsolicited faxes altogether goes into effect on december,but the prohibition will have no effect until the implementing regulations are in place,which could take a couple of years.the enrolled bill report also states that assuming that any definitions the fcc adopts do not undermine the prohibition,once the fcc regulations are in place the federal law and regulations will supersede section since they will be more protective.but until that time,section would give california fax machine owners more protection than they currently have against unsolicited faxes.
federal tcpa.on december,the congress enacted the tcpa.the tcpa mandated that the fcc implement regulations to protect the privacy rights of citizens by restricting the use of the telephone network for unsolicited advertising.on september,the fcc adopted a report and order which established rules governing unwanted telephone solicitations and regulated the use of automatic telephone dialing systems,prerecorded or artificial voice messages,and telephone facsimile machines.among other things,these restrictions prohibit the transmission of unsolicited advertisements by telephone facsimile machines.
the tcpa provides consumers with several options to enforce limitations against unsolicited telemarketing contacts.absent state law to the contrary,the tcpa permits consumers to file suit in state court if an entity violates the tcpa prohibitions on the use of facsimile machines consumers may also bring their complaints regarding tcpa violations to the attention of the state attorney general or an official designated by the state.this state entity may bring a civil action on behalf of its residents to enjoin a person or entity engaged in a pattern of telephone calls or other transmissions in violation of the tcpa.additionally,a consumer may request that the fcc take enforcement actions regarding violations of the tcpa and the regulations adopted to enforce it.com.on bus.and,analysis of assem.bill reg.sess,supra,boldface added.
the legislature passed assembly bill in august,and the governor approved it on september.under the bill,section restrictions on unsolicited fax advertisements were repealed effective january.see historical and statutory notes,west ann.cal.bus.supp,cal,art.iv,subd.c.meanwhile,on september,the fcc adopted regulations implementing the tcpa.see in the matter of rules and regulations implementing the telephone consumer protection act of,and order adopted,released,appen.b,wl lexis,pp,codified at.
interplay between state and federal law 
in,the california legislature enacted section as a stopgap measure to protect california residents from unsolicited fax advertisements until the fcc adopted regulations implementing the tcpa.the legislature intended that once the fcc regulations are in place the federal law and regulations will supersede section since they will be more protective.enrolled bill,supra,at.the legislature reiterated that intent when it repealed the fax restrictions in.see com.on bus.and,analysis of assem.bill reg.sess,supra.
the legislative history shows that section was never intended to prohibit a tcpa action in california courts.rather,section was meant to provide california residents with some degree of protection until the fcc regulations took effect.the fcc adopted regulations on september,which it released on october.defendants alleged unlawful conduct occurred in,and,long after the regulations were promulgated.
defendants offer a different,but incorrect,reading of the legislative history of section.they assert that the statute was intended to displace the california did not consent to private tcpa actions in state court.defendants emphasize that,in,when the legislature amended section to prohibit unsolicited email advertisements,the fax provisions were left intact notwithstanding that the fcc had adopted regulations in.this,defendants argue,means that the fax restrictions were not a measure but were intended to last several years.but defendants read too much into the amendments.the unmistakable purpose of section was to provide temporary relief for unsolicited fax advertisements,as made clear in the legislative history materials accompanying the statute passage in and repeal in.the amendments do not prove otherwise.w e take cognizance of subsequent declarations of legislative intent if the declaration is consistent with the original intent.in re michael th,d.
in the same vein,we reject defendants argument that compliance with section precludes liability for violations of the tcpa.we acknowledge that i f the state legislature has permitted certain conduct or considered a situation and concluded no action should lie,courts may not override that determination.communications,los angeles cellular telephone cal th,d,accord,olszewski scripps health cal th,d.but,once again,section legislative history is defendants undoing.
by enacting section,the legislature intended to provide a remedy that would eventually give way to the more protective statute.see enrolled bill,supra,at.the legislature has therefore considered certain sending of unsolicited fax concluded that an action should lie,namely,an action under the tcpa in state court.
thus,assuming for the sake of discussion that defendants have always complied with section,they are not thereby rendered immune under the tcpa.in hooters of augusta,nicholson,supra.at pages,at,texas american blastfax,d at page,and van bergen state of cir at page,the courts held that the defendants had to comply with the tcpa regardless of the applicability of state statutes governing unsolicited fax advertisements.
as stated in texas american blastfax,supra,d at page simply because a party complies with one law does not preclude it from violating another.further,as one court has noted,the case law interpreting the tcpa does not stand for the proposition that a state statute can give permission to violate a federal statute.sunbelt communs.mktg.dist,civ.dist.lexis.the fcc agrees t he applicability of state law is not relevant to questions of compliance with federal law here.regardless of what state law does or does not require,the fax advertiser had an independent obligation to comply with the tcpa and the commission associated rules.in the matter of notary,supra,at,wl lexis at.and t he fcc is due substantial deference in its implementation of the act,and even greater deference when interpreting its own rules and regulations.global naps.
for their part,plaintiffs contend that compliance with section does not affect defendants liability under the tcpa because,among other reasons,the tcpa preempts section.we do not reach that question given our conclusion that the california legislature has not prohibited private tcpa actions in state court,and the tcpa permits the states to make that choice.
constitutional challenges 
defendants contend that the tcpa is unconstitutional because it violates the first amendment,amend,the vagueness doctrine under the due process clause,amends,and the limitation on excessive damages under the due process clause,amends.
first amendment 
for over years,the united states supreme court has recognized that commercial speech fall s within the purview of the first amendment t he court has afforded commercial speech a measure of first amendment protection commensurate with its position in relation to other constitutionally guaranteed expression.lorillard tobacco reilly,d.the high court has recogni zed a distinction between speech proposing a commercial transaction,which occurs in an area traditionally subject to government regulation,and other varieties of speech,id.at.t he constitution accords less protection to commercial speech than to other constitutionally safeguarded forms of expression.posadas de puerto rico tourism,d.
t he party seeking to uphold a restriction on commercial speech carries the burden of justifying it.this burden is not satisfied by mere speculation or conjecture rather,a governmental body seeking to sustain a restriction on commercial speech must demonstrate that the harms it recites are real and that its restriction will in fact alleviate them to a material degree.edenfield fane,d,citations omitted accord,greater new orleans broadcasting,united states,d.
in reviewing the constitutionality of a statute,courts must accord substantial deference to the predictive judgments of congress.our sole obligation is to assure that,in formulating its judgments,congress has drawn reasonable inferences based on substantial evidence.this principle has special significance in cases,like this one,involving congressional judgments concerning regulatory schemes of inherent complexity and assessments about the likely interaction of industries undergoing rapid economic and technological change though different in degree,the deference to congress is akin to deference owed to administrative agencies because of their expertise this is not the sum of the matter,however.we owe congress findings an additional measure of deference out of respect for its authority to exercise the legislative power.even in the realm of first amendment questions where congress must base its conclusions upon substantial evidence,deference must be accorded to its findings as to the harm to be avoided and to the remedial measures adopted for that end,lest we infringe on traditional legislative authority to make predictive judgments when enacting nationwide regulatory policy.turner broadcasting system,fcc,d,citations omitted.
it is a matter of public interest that economic decisions,in the aggregate,be intelligent and.to this end,the free flow of commercial information is indispensable.indeed,a particular consumer interest in the free flow of commercial information may be as keen,if not keener by far,than his interest in the day most urgent political debate.the commercial marketplace,like other spheres of our social and cultural life,provides a forum where ideas and information flourish.some of the ideas and information are vital,some of slight worth.but the general rule is that the speaker and the audience,not the government,assess the value of the information presented.thus,even a communication that does no more than propose a commercial transaction is entitled to the coverage of the first amendment.
although commercial speech is protected by the first amendment,not all regulation of such speech is unconstitutional in central hudson gas public serv.comm,d central hudson,the united states supreme court articulated a test for determining whether a particular commercial speech regulation is constitutionally permissible.under that test we ask as a threshold matter whether the commercial speech concerns unlawful activity or is misleading.if so,then the speech is not protected by the first amendment.if the speech concerns lawful activity and is not misleading,however,we next ask whether the asserted governmental interest is substantial.if it is,then we determine whether the regulation directly and materially advances the governmental interest asserted,and,finally,whether it is not more extensive than is necessary to serve that interest.each of these latter three inquiries must be answered in the affirmative for the regulation to be found constitutional.thompson western states medical center,d,citations omitted see edenfield fane,supra,at.if the first amendment means anything,it means that regulating speech must be a.thompson western states medical center,supra,at.

the government has the obligation to demonstrate that it is regulating speech in order to address what is in fact a serious problem edenfield fane,supra,at.broad prophylactic rules in the area of free expression are suspect.precision of regulation must be the touchstone in an area so closely touching our most precious freedoms.even under the first amendment somewhat more forgiving standards for restrictions on commercial speech,a state may not curb protected expression without advancing a substantial governmental interest.id.at,citation omitted.the government may justify restrictions on commercial speech through anecdotes,history,consensus,and simple common sense.florida bar went for it,d florida bar.empirical data is not necessary.see id.at.missouri ex rel.nixon american blast fax,cir.in contrast,a total ban on truthful,nonmisleading commercial speech about a lawful product or service requires something more than anecdotes and common sense.see.pharmacy bd.consumer council,fn,d liquormart,rhode island,d liquormart lead opn.of stevens,id.at.conc.opn.of oconnor.
in resolving defendants first amendment claim,it is necessary at the outset to examine the way in which the tcpa restricts the use of unsolicited fax advertisements.on september,the fcc adopted regulations implementing the tcpa.the regulations state in part,no person may u se a telephone facsimile machine,computer,or other device to send an unsolicited advertisement to a telephone facsimile machine.in the matter of rules and regulations implementing the telephone consumer protection act of,supra,appen.b,wl lexis,at pp,codified at a,italics added.
the regulations define telephone facsimile machine as equipment which has the capacity to transcribe text or images,or both,from paper into an electronic signal and to transmit that signal over a regular telephone line,or to transcribe text or images or both from an electronic signal received over a regular telephone line onto paper.in the matter of rules and regulations implementing the telephone consumer protection act of,supra,appen.b,wl lexis,at,codified at f.unsolicited advertisement means any material advertising the commercial availability or quality of any property,goods,or services which is transmitted to any person without that person prior express invitation or permission.in the matter of rules and regulations implementing the telephone consumer protection act of,supra,appen.b,wl lexis,at pp,codified at f.
in a report accompanying the fcc regulations,the commission distinguished between the potential liability of fax broadcasters entities or persons whose facilities are used to send a the potential liability of the author or originator of the fax.the fcc explained parties commenting on the facsimile requirements for senders of facsimile messages urge the commission to clarify that carriers who simply provide transmission facilities that are used to transmit others unsolicited facsimile advertisements may not be held liable for any violations of the regulations.we concur with these comment s.in the absence of a high degree of involvement or actual notice of an illegal use and failure to take steps to prevent such transmissions,common carriers will not be held liable for the transmission of a prohibited facsimile message.in the matter of rules and regulations implementing the telephone consumer protection act of,supra,at,wl lexis,at pp,fn.omitted.
the fcc report also stated in banning telephone facsimile advertisements,the tcpa leaves the commission without discretion to create exemptions from or limit the effects of the prohibition thus,such transmissions are banned in our rules as they are in the tcpa we note,however,that facsimile transmission from persons or entities who have an established business relationship with the recipient can be deemed to be invited or permitted by the recipient.in the matter of rules and regulations implementing the telephone consumer protection act of,supra,at,fn,wl lexis,at,fn,citations omitted,italics added see id.at,wl lexis,at pp.
the term established business relationship means a prior or existing relationship formed by a voluntary communication between a person or entity and a residential subscriber with or without an exchange of consideration,on the basis of an inquiry,application,purchase or transaction by the residential subscriber regarding products or services offered by such person or entity,which relationship has not been previously terminated by either party.f.
in,the fcc again addressed the liability of fax broadcasters,stating some petitioners request clarification of whether responsibility for compliance with the ban on unsolicited facsimile advertising lies with the entity or entities on whose behalf such messages are sent or with service providers fax broadcasters.generally these commentators are fax broadcasters who disseminate facsimile messages for their clients.they favor excluding any fax broadcaster,whether or not a common carrier,from responsibility for compliance with the rules,and assigning ultimate responsibility to the author or originator of the facsimile message.the commentators contend that the original regulations indicate only that carriers would not be held liable,and did not indicate whether service providers who are not carriers would also be exempt from such requirements.
we clarify that the entity or entities on whose behalf facsimiles are transmitted are ultimately liable for compliance with the rule banning unsolicited facsimile advertisements,and that fax broadcasters are not liable for compliance with this rule.this interpretation is consistent with the tcpa legislative history,and with our finding in the report and order that carriers will not be held liable for the transmission of a prohibited message.in the matter of rules and regulations implementing the telephone consumer protection act of,mem.opn.and order adopted july,released,wl lexis,pp,fns.omitted,reconsideration granted on another point in in the matter of rules and regulations implementing the telephone consumer protection act of,order on further reconsideration adopted april,released april,wl lexis.
more recently,the fcc issued a notice of apparent liability for forfeiture to a fax broadcaster,indicating that broadcasters may be held liable under the tcpa,depending on the circumstances.the fcc notice stated in part a lthough entities that merely transmit facsimile messages on behalf of others are not liable for compliance with the prohibition on faxing unsolicited advertisements,the exemption from liability does not exist when a fax transmitter has a high degree of involvement or actual notice of an illegal use and has fail ed to take steps to prevent such transmissions.accordingly,fax transmitters do not enjoy an absolute exemption from liability under the tcpa and the commission rules.
the record here clearly establishes that the broadcaster uses its own extensive distribution list of telephone facsimile numbers to send its clients advertisements,and that it knowingly sends advertisements to such numbers without regard to whether the facsimile machine owner or responsible party either granted permission to send the advertisement or had an established business relationship with the advertiser or the broadcaster.in addition,the broadcaster apparently reviews the text of its clients advertisements,not only to assist with graphic design,but also to assess content.such conduct is clear evidence of the broadcaster high degree of involvement in the unlawful activity.in the matter of,supra,at,wl lexis,at pp.fns.omitted.
thus,the tcpa does not act as a total ban on fax advertising.missouri ex rel.nixon american blast fax,supra,at.a fax broadcaster may send advertisements to those with whom it or the advertiser has an established business relationship.fax broadcasters and advertisers may also obtain consent for their faxes through mailings,telephone calls made in accordance with telemarketing regulations,and interaction with customers at their places of business.van bergen state of,supra,at moser cir.advertisers remain free to publicize their products through any legal means they simply can not do so through an unsolicited fax.missouri ex rel.nixon american blast fax,supra,at,italics added.in short,defendants are incorrect in asserting that the tcpa constitutes a total or blanket ban on fax advertisements.
we conclude,after examining the restrictions imposed by the tcpa and the evidence supporting the act passage,that the government has a substantial interest in regulating unsolicited fax advertisements.we need not repeat here the tcpa legislative history,which contains substantial evidence of the serious problems caused by junk fax.suffice it to say that a festering problem had arisen from the junk fax.junk fax represents an unfair shifting of the cost of advertising from the advertiser to the unwitting customer and u nsolicited faxes can tie up a machine for hours and thwart the receipt of legitimate and important messages.issues hearing on and before the subcom.on telecommunications and finance of the house com.on energy and commerce,supra,at.
in,at the time of the tcpa passage,approximately half of the states were considering legislation to restrict unsolicited fax advertisements.that fact alone indicates the existence of a serious problem.in california,for example,unsolicited fax advertisements were costing recipients over million per year.but regulation at the state level was not enough.congress recognized that state regulation of telemarketing activity was ineffective because it could be avoided by interstate operations.federal legislation was necessary in order to prevent telemarketers from evading state restrictions.murphey lanier,supra,at accord,intern.science tech.institute inacom,supra,at.
defendants counter that even if a substantial governmental interest existed when the tcpa was enacted,sweeping changes in fax technology have subsequently reduced the cost of receiving an unsolicited advertisement.today,numerous fax machines are on the market that print a fax for less than cents a page.some newer models also come with several features that benefit the fax recipient toner saver,blocking,volume control,and mail capabilities.many fax machines now have dual access memory,which stores a document so that it can be sent after an incoming or outgoing fax is processed.and,over the years,the price of a fax machine has steadily dropped.
this is all well and good.but defendants description of today fax machines says nothing about the number or percentage of fax owners who have them.defendants have made no showing as to the usage or market share of fax machines.quite the opposite,the record contains a declaration from an entrepreneur who has used the same fax machine for the last years and pays around cents per page for unsolicited advertisements.and fax advertisements sent to the latest generation of fax machines,like those sent in,still impose costs on the recipient for printing and business disruptions.
although a fax machine manufactured in may have more features than a model,the united states court of appeals for the ninth circuit has stated that t he possibility of future technological advances allowing simultaneous transmission and eliminating the need for paper does not alter the conclusion that unsolicited fax advertisements shift significant advertising costs to consumers.we look at the problem as it existed when congress enacted the statute,rather than speculate upon what solutions may turn up in the future.destination ventures,cir,united states playboy entertainment group,d future availability of software mentioned by court in striking down overbroad restriction on noncommercial speech greater new orleans broadcasting,united states,supra,at.invalidating statute that prohibited advertising of lawful casino gambling,noting that w hatever its character in when the statute was adopted,the federal policy of discouraging gambling in general,and casino gambling in particular,is now decidedly equivocal.
even if we consider advances in technology,the improvements made in fax machines over the past decade have not rendered the tcpa constitutionally obsolete.in,the california legislature repealed the state restrictions on unsolicited fax advertisements,not because the problem had gone away,but because the tcpa provided adequate remedies for an ongoing problem.as explained in an august,report by the california senate committee on business and professions,unsolicited fax advertisements were still a major concern 
the letter of support from the office of the california attorney general states that in light of the costs and inconvenience of unsolicited faxed advertisements to consumers and businesses alike,it makes sense to repeal california junk fax law and rely solely on the federal law which will provide greater protection for california consumers and businesses.
in their letter of support,food for humans a retail grocer states that their corporation relies heavily on their fax machines for ordering,product information and correspondence.daily,their tasks are interrupted by unknowns pushing their products and services through faxes.sometimes food for human communications are completely broken by these inconsiderate intruders.they feel that it is as though strangers invade their office and take control,and in a sense that is exactly what on a daily basis.they recently conducted a yearend cost analysis and it was reported that they spent well over on fax toner cartridges alone.and,without a doubt,the vast majority of this resource not to mention paper was devoured by junk faxes.
in their letter of support,the privacy rights clearinghouse indicates that they have received numerous complaints from individuals and from business owners who are forced to pay for the toner,paper,and wear and tear on their fax machines.their phone lines are tied up when receiving these solicitations the privacy rights clearinghouse states that they have been contacted by individuals complaining about junk faxes who have tried to contact the numbers on the advertisements but have found these numbers to be virtually useless.these numbers are apparently busy,or no one answers.com.on bus.and,analysis of assem.bill reg.sess,supra.
the california senate committee also noted u nlike billboard,radio,tv,newspaper,magazine,or even direct the advertiser pays for the faxes force each and every recipient to foot the bill by paying for the paper and toner used to print the ad on their fax machine.what more,small businesses and people with limited resources and few telephone lines to their offices are also forced to bear the cost of having their business interrupted while their fax line is occupied receiving unsolicited fax advertisements.companies that try to get off of junk fax lists face further productivity losses,as employees spend time calling junk fax senders in an attempt to get removed from junk fax lists.com.on bus.and,analysis of assem.bill reg.sess,supra.
today,as in,the country faces a serious problem posed by unsolicited fax advertisements.congress has addressed the problem by enacting the tcpa,which can be enforced by the fcc,state attorneys general,and,in california,private citizens.the act continues to serve a substantial governmental interest in maintaining the free flow of commercial information.
we therefore decide,as have other courts,that,under central hudson,a substantial governmental interest supports the tcpa.see missouri ex rel.nixon american blast fax,supra,at destination ventures,affd.cir texas american blastfax,supra,d at.
direct and material advancement 
we further conclude that the tcpa directly and materially advances the stated governmental interests,namely,preventing cost shifting and permitting fax machine owners to control the operation of their machines.
defendants contend the tcpa does not sufficiently serve any governmental interest because noncommercial that tell jokes,convey political messages,or list job not restricted and thus freely allowed.defendants point out that noncommercial faxes,like fax advertisements,result in cost shifting to the recipient and interfere with the operation of the fax machine.
but the reason for this distinction is quite simple when congress addressed the issue of unsolicited faxes,the evidence indicated that the source of the problem was advertisements that offered all kinds of products and services.remarks of hollings,supra,cong.rec,italics added.at the time,faxes advertised a wide range of things cruises,home products,draperies,submarine sandwiches,and investment opportunities,just to name a few.see telemarketing practices hearing on,and before the subcom.on telecommunications and finance of the house com.on energy and commerce,supra,at.the legislative history is replete with references to fax advertising as the culprit.
the ninth circuit has explained that b ecause congress goal was to prevent the shifting of advertising costs,limiting its regulation to faxes containing advertising was justified.the ban is,in that it applies to commercial solicitation by any organization,be it a multinational corporation or the girl scouts.destination ventures,supra,at,italics added see no exemption for nonprofit organizations with respect to unsolicited faxes.
the eighth circuit reached the same conclusion,finding that the tcpa distinction between prohibited advertising and permitted noncommercial faxes is relevant to the goal of reducing the costs and interference associated with unwanted faxes.missouri ex rel.nixon american blast fax,supra,at,italics in original.the court upheld the tcpa based in part on its conclusion that fax advertisements likely constitute the bulk of all unsolicited faxes.see id.at.
because congress has addressed a substantial interest in protecting consumers from the economic harms inflicted through unsolicited advertisement faxes,the subsequent restriction of those unsolicited faxes directly and materially advances that interest.destination ventures,supra.at accord,texas american blastfax,supra,d at.
narrowly tailored restriction 
as the united states supreme court has instructed t he least restrictive means test has no role in the commercial speech context what our decisions require,is a fit between the legislature ends and the means chosen to accomplish those ends,a fit that is not necessarily perfect,but reasonable that represents not necessarily the single best disposition but one whose scope is in proportion to the interest served,that employs not necessarily the least restrictive means but a means narrowly tailored to achieve the desired objective.florida bar,supra,at,citation omitted accord,lorillard tobacco reilly,supra,at.if alternative channels permit communication of the restricted speech,the regulation is more likely to be considered reasonable.see florida bar,supra,at.liquormart,supra,at.conc.opn.of.
at least six federal courts,including the eighth and ninth circuits,have addressed whether the tcpas fax restrictions violate the first amendment and have concluded that,under central hudson,the act is narrowly tailored to achieve the governments interests missouri ex rel.nixon american blast fax,supra,at destination ventures,supra,at destination ventures,supra.at texas american blastfax,supra,d at kenro,fax daily,kenro minnesota sunbelt communs,supra,dist.lexis,at pp.
the parties briefs focus in large part on the federal district court decision in missouri ex rel.nixon american blast fax,d,which held that the tcpa violates the first amendment.on march,after the parties had filed their briefs,the eighth circuit reversed the district court missouri ex rel.nixon american blast fax,supra,concluding that the tcpa is valid under the central hudson test.
on a similar point,we note that various parties in the present case have relied on the record in missouri ex rel.nixon american blast fax,supra,d.but the trial court here ruled that such evidence was inadmissible,and there has been no showing on appeal that the court abused its discretion.see dart industries,commercial union ins.cal th,d,trial court evidentiary rulings reviewed for abuse of discretion.we therefore do not consider the proffered evidence.
defendants suggest several alternatives to the tcpas restrictions on unsolicited fax advertisements permit the sending of advertisements during nonbusiness hours only,create and maintain a nationwide or statewide do not fax list,restrict the length or frequency of fax advertisements,require that an unsolicited fax advertisement contain a telephone number that the recipient could use to avoid further faxes,and allow faxes to all consumers unless they contact the particular advertiser and object.
as one court has explained a properly tailored restriction focuses on the source of the evils the government seeks to eliminate and eliminates them without at the same time banning or significantly restricting a substantial quantity of speech that does not create the same evils the tcpa is not an unqualified prohibition on the transmission of commercial speech via fax machine advertisers are only prohibited from using fax machines to transmit advertising material to other fax machines when the recipient has neither invited nor given permission for such transmission 
the defendants comparison of unsolicited fax advertisements to mail,television and newspaper advertisements is unavailing for the simple reason that the latter forms of advertising impose no costs on unwitting consumers.television and newspaper ads are never unsolicited,since television viewers and newspaper readers must voluntarily turn on the television or read the newspaper in order to receive the advertisements,and a recipient of direct mail advertising,unlike recipients of unsolicited fax advertisements,is not forced to assume any of the costs of producing those advertisements,nor does the use of his mailbox interfere with receipt of legitimate business mail.
furthermore,the mere existence of some imaginable alternative that might be less burdensome on speech does not mean that the chosen restriction is not narrowly tailored for purposes of first amendment analysis the requirement that a regulation be narrowly tailored to the governments asserted substantial interest does not mean that the regulation employ the least restrictive means available 
t he tcpa is narrowly tailored to the governments asserted interest in protecting consumers from the unfair shifting of advertising costs and from interruption of their use of their own fax machines kenro,supra.at,citation and fn.omitted.
while it is true that the effect of the tcpa will be that some consumers will not receive unsolicited advertisements they might have appreciated,under the approach advocated by defendants there would always be individuals suffering costs and interference from unwanted advertisements.it was not unconstitutional for congress to choose a system that protects those who would otherwise be forced to bear unwanted burdens over those who wish to send and receive unsolicited fax advertising.given the cost shifting and interference imposed by unsolicited commercial faxes and the many alternatives left available to advertisers,the tcpas approach is in proportion to the interest served and is narrowly tailored to achieve the desired objective.missouri ex rel.nixon american blast fax,supra,at.
defendants reliance on cincinnati discovery network,d discovery network is misplaced.there,the city allowed the distribution of commercial and noncommercial publications through freestanding newsracks located on public property but decided to end the distribution of commercial publications.the city decision was motivated by its interest in the safety and attractiveness of its streets and sidewalks.the effect of the city action was to remove newsracks,leaving approximately to in place.
the supreme court,applying the central hudson test,held that the city action violated the first amendment.as the court explained the city argues that there is a close fit between its ban on newsracks dispensing commercial material and its interests in safety and esthetics because every decrease in the number of such dispensing devices necessarily effects an increase in safety and an improvement in the attractiveness of the cityscape.in the city view,the prohibition is thus entirely related to its legitimate interests in safety and esthetics.
we accept the validity of the city proposition,but consider it an insufficient justification for the discrimination against the commercial publishers use of newsracks that are no more harmful than the permitted newsracks,and have only a minimal impact on the overall number of newsracks on the city sidewalks 
not only does cincinnati categorical ban on commercial newsracks place too much importance on the distinction between commercial and noncommercial speech,but in this case,the distinction bears no relationship whatsoever to the particular interests that the city has asserted.it is therefore an impermissible means of responding to the city admittedly legitimate interests.discovery network,supra,at,italics in original.
unlike the government action in discovery network,which did not sufficiently further the city interests,the tcpa rests on a reasonable fit between the governments ends and means the governmental interests in preventing the unfair shifting of advertising costs to unwitting consumers and in permitting consumers to control their fax machines are accomplished by prohibiting the sending of fax advertisements to consumers without their consent.see destination ventures,supra.at kenro,supra.at.
nor do defendants fare any better under liquormart,supra,d.in that case,rhode island had prohibited the advertising of the retail price of alcoholic beverages to the customer except at the place of sale.the purpose of the prohibition was to promote temperance by increasing the cost of alcoholic beverages.the court unanimously declared the statute unconstitutional.
justice stevens wrote,a lternative forms of regulation that would not involve any restriction on speech would be more likely to achieve the state goal of promoting temperance h igher prices can be maintained either by direct regulation or by increased taxation per capita purchases could be limited as is the case with prescription drugs.even educational campaigns might prove to be more effective.liquormart,supra,at.lead opn.of stevens,with whom kennedy,souter,and ginsburg,joined,citation omitted.justice made similar observations.id.at.conc.opn.of,with whom rehnquist,souter and breyer,joined.
unlike the loose connection between the governments ends and means in liquormart,the suggested alternatives in this case fail to establish that the legislation congress enacted is improperly tailored for its targeted goal.kenro,supra.at.in addition,the tcpa does not prevent advertisers from marketing their goods and services in a myriad of ways television,radio,newspapers,magazines,billboards,mailings,the yellow pages,the internet,and telephone calls as permitted by law,and faxes to consenting consumers.as stated,if alternative channels permit communication of the restricted speech,the regulation is more likely to be considered reasonable.liquormart,supra,at.conc.opn.of,citing florida bar,supra,at.
in a closely related argument,defendants contend the tcpa is invalid under the first amendment doctrine of overbreadth.the showing that a law punishes a substantial amount of protected free speech,judged in relation to the statutes plainly legitimate sweep,suffices to invalidate all enforcement of that law,until and unless a limiting construction or partial invalidation so narrows it as to remove the seeming threat or deterrence to constitutionally protected expression.
many persons,rather than undertake the considerable burden and sometimes risk of vindicating their rights through litigation,will choose simply to abstain from protected speech harming not only themselves but society as a whole,which is deprived of an uninhibited marketplace of ideas.overbreadth adjudication,by suspending all enforcement of an overinclusive law,reduces these social costs caused by the withholding of protected speech.
h owever,there comes a point at which the chilling effect of an overbroad law,significant though it may be,can not justify prohibiting all enforcement of that a law that reflects legitimate state interests in maintaining comprehensive controls over harmful,constitutionally unprotected conduct for there are substantial social costs created by the overbreadth doctrine when it blocks application of a law to constitutionally unprotected speech,or especially to constitutionally unprotected conduct.to ensure that these costs do not swallow the social benefits of declaring a law overbroad,we have insisted that a laws application to protected speech be substantial,not only in an absolute sense,but also relative to the scope of the law plainly legitimate applications before applying the strong medicine of overbreadth invalidation virginia hicks,d,citations omitted.
we conclude that the overbreadth doctrine does not apply.the tcpa does not punish a substantial amount of protected speech.it does not punish protected speech in any amount.nor is there a basis for invalidating all enforcement of the tcpa restrictions on unsolicited fax advertisements.no one will choose to abstain from protected speech if this litigation is allowed to go forward,even if it results in a plaintiff verdict.the uninhibited marketplace of ideas will remain unaffected.and the social costs of declaring the tcpa overbroad would greatly exceed its plainly legitimate applications.see van bergen state of,supra,at.
defendants argue that,on its face,the tcpa is void for vagueness.in particular,they attack the following italicized words that appear in the statutory definition of unsolicited advertisement any material advertising the commercial availability or quality of any property,goods,or services which is transmitted to any person without that person prior express invitation or permission.a,italics added.defendants thus focus on the meaning of advertisement.
a law fails to meet the requirements of the due process clause if it is so vague and standardless that it leaves the public uncertain as to the conduct it prohibits chicago morales,d.objections to vagueness under the due process clause rest on the lack of notice,and hence may be overcome in any specific case where reasonable persons would know that their conduct is at risk.maynard cartwright,d.
the doctrine reflects the principle that a statute which either forbids or requires the doing of an act in terms so vague that persons of common intelligence must necessarily guess at its meaning and differ as to its application,violates the first essential of due process of law.the requirement that government articulate its aims with a reasonable degree of clarity ensures that state power will be exercised only on behalf of policies reflecting an authoritative choice among competing social values,reduces the danger of caprice and discrimination in the administration of the laws,enables individuals to conform their conduct to the requirements of law,and permits meaningful judicial review.roberts united states jaycees,d,citation omitted.
defendants must demonstrate that the act provisions inevitably pose a present total and fatal conflict with applicable constitutional prohibitions.they must demonstrate that no set of circumstances exists under which the statute would be valid.our supreme court has put it even more plainly a claim that a law is unconstitutionally vague can succeed only where the litigant demonstrates that the law is impermissibly vague in all of its applications.a facial challenge must fail if courts can conceive of a single situation in which the legislative enactment can be const
