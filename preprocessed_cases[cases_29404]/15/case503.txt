backgrounda.facts 
randazzo,a customer of harris,entered into three agreements with the bank in april that established a million revolving credit line for the fpr trust.the line was secured by randazzo stock in america online aol,cisco systems,and sun microsystems.harris required randazzo to sign blank stock powers for those securities,giving harris the authority to sell them.
randazzo did not read any of the loan documents that established the credit line.in fact,he indicated in his deposition that in the past years he had not read any of the paperwork accompanying his various loans.see,def.ex,randazzo dep.at i never read any loan documents or any other documents ever put in front of me by a bank.see id.at why would i read them then if i had read them for the previous years.randazzo explained that john callahan,the harris loan officer servicing the credit line,explained the key economic terms of the credit line to him.
between april,and august,randazzo and callahan never spoke concerning the harris loan or its underlying collateral.on august,however,callahan reviewed the credit line and,using the bank ratio,determined that randazzo had insufficient collateral to secure the loan because the value of the aol stock had declined in the previous fifteen months.callahan thus telephoned randazzo and requested that he either reduce the loan balance or provide additional collateral.callahan told randazzo that harris was making a margin call and that the bank would sell the stock if randazzo did not comply.randazzo responded that he was willing and able to satisfy the request for more collateral and offered a second lien on his florida residence.he also requested that callahan delay any action to permit randazzo to supply harris with an updated financial statement.
on august,after reviewing the updated financial statement that randazzo supplied and meeting with harris bank president thomas maccarthy,callahan again telephoned randazzo.in that conversation,callahan told randazzo that harris would not accept the additional collateral or the second lien on randazzo home.callahan also informed him that harris would sell the existing collateral to pay off the loan if randazzo did not reduce the loan balance by or provide other,acceptable collateral.
randazzo was upset by harris actions.in his deposition,he recounted the ensuing conversation with callahan as follows 
i said,john,how in the hell can you sell me out when i been a customer of your bank for over years,never been late on one payment this is when i did get offended never late in years,paid you millions of dollars i have collateral that i willing to give you 
he callahan just says that,frank,you either going to sell out he says,let me remind you that we got the stock we got the stock power.i says,john,i says,i ca believe you doing this to me.i kept repeating it because i literally could not believe it.
callahan then presented randazzo with a choice he told him that either he had to sell the stock or that the bank would do so.because randazzo remembered that harris parent company once had charged him what he considered an exorbitant commission to sell stock,he asked callahan what harris would charge him for the sale.callahan replied that he did not know.randazzo then found a broker willing to sell the shares for less than.randazzo called callahan callahan told him that he had not obtained commission fee information from any brokers.randazzo then elected to sell the stock himself.he later explained that he saw no alternative and wanted,at a minimum,to avoid the inflated commission that he expected harris would have charged for the sale of his securities.randazzo never questioned harris purported right to sell the existing collateral and pay off the loan.according to randazzo,i never argue with a banker w hatever bankers want is what i give them all the time.id.at.he explained that,if he had read the document beforehand,i would have told callahan to stick it right up.id.at.
the sale proceeds were wired to harris and deposited to close out randazzo credit line.three days later,on august,randazzo faxed callahan to inform him that the stocks that randazzo had sold had increased in value during the period.he claimed that,as a result of the sale,he had lost over.
district court proceedings 
randazzo filed this diversity action against harris in september,alleging breach of contract and violations of the illinois consumer fraud and deceptive business practices act,ilcs et.consumer fraud act or the act.in essence,randazzo alleged that harris forced him to sell the stock although it had no right to do so because he was not in default under his agreement with the bank.harris moved for summary judgment,and the district court granted the motion.
in the district court view,the voluntary payment doctrine was dispositive of randazzo claims.under this doctrine,a plaintiff who voluntarily pays money in reply to an incorrect or illegal claim of right can not recover that payment unless he can show fraud,coercion,or mistake of fact.see smith prime cable of chicago,d,jursich arlington heights fed.sav.loan ass n,d.the district court determined that this doctrine applied here harris claimed that the loan agreement gave it the right to sell randazzo stock held as collateral,and,because of that representation,randazzo paid the bank.
the district court refused to permit randazzo to escape the strictures of the voluntary payment doctrine by claiming fraud or mistake of fact.although these factors can provide protection from the application of the doctrine,neither is available when a party to a contract relies on the interpretation of another party as to the meaning of the terms of the contract.this is true,the district court explained,because a party who has access to a written instrument can not reasonably rely on representations of other contracting parties respecting the effect of the written instrument.at.consequently,the court held,randazzo can not assert fraud or mistake of fact because he chose to rely on harris representations regarding the contract rather than reading the loan documents himself.
the district court also recognized that coercion can render the voluntary payment doctrine inoperative.under illinois law,a payment is considered coerced when it is made to avoid the loss of a necessity or to prevent an injury to a person,business,or property that is different from and disproportionately greater than the unlawful demand.in the district court view,there was no coercion because the sale of randazzo stock did not involve the loss of a necessity.moreover,randazzo did not produce any evidence that the loss that he claimed he suffered from his sale of the stock was legally different from or disproportionately greater than what the loss would have been under harris allegedly unlawful demand.in the end,the district court held that this case was controlled by the fundamental principle that a mistake of law does not excuse a voluntary payment.randazzo did not read the loan documents and instead relied on harris statement that it had a legal right under the contract to sell the collateral.this mistake of law,the court concluded,prevented randazzo from recovering the monies paid.
the court also held that randazzo failed to state a claim under the illinois consumer fraud act for two reasons.first,harris did not make a misrepresentation of fact,as is required under the act.also,randazzo failed to produce evidence of a deceptive practice,another requirement.
