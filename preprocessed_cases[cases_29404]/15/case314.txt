the united states,by and through attorney general michael mukasey,appeals the decision of the united states district court for the northern district of texas holding a recently enacted provision of the bankruptcy code,a,facially unconstitutional.see hersh united states,susan hersh,the district court holding that attorneys qualify as debt relief agencies under,and that b does not violate the first amendment.for the reasons stated below,we affirm the district court holdings that attorneys qualify as debt relief agencies and that b is constitutional,but reverse the court judgment as far as it holds a facially unconstitutional.
facts and proceedings below 
in,congress enacted the bankruptcy abuse prevention and consumer protection act the bapcpa,stat.the bapcpa is a comprehensive package of reform measures designed to improve bankruptcy law and practice by restoring personal responsibility and integrity in the bankruptcy system and to ensure that the system is fair for both debtors and creditors.i,cong.sess.pt,at,reprinted in vol.at,hereinafter house report.the act contains provisions that apply to debt relief agencies defined,as we hold,to include attorneys that counsel consumer debtors,and regulate the manner in which they provide services to their clients.see.
hersh is an attorney who represents consumer debtors in bankruptcy proceedings.for nineteen years,she has counseled her clients for a fee regarding their eligibility for filing for bankruptcy,the acquisition and disposition of property,and other legal rights and responsibilities relating to financial difficulties.soon after the bapcpa took effect,on november,hersh filed this suit against the united states,then united states attorney general alberto gonzales the state of texas,and texas attorney general greg abbot.the state of texas and greg abbott did not in any way appear and were not served with process and accordingly were dismissed from the case by the district court,so the only named defendants below who are parties to this appeal are the united states and united states attorney general michael mukasey collectively,the government 
in her original complaint,hersh sought declaratory and injunctive relief to prohibit the government from enforcing,and.she then amended her complaint to allege that attorneys do not qualify as debt relief agencies under the bankruptcy code.hersh argued that sections a and b violate the first amendment right to free speech and her clients fifth amendment right to counsel in a civil case in this appeal,hersh challenges the applicability of the bapcpa to bankruptcy attorneys by arguing that attorneys do not qualify as debt relief agencies as that term is defined in the act.she also argues that a and b are unconstitutional in violation of the first amendment.
sections a and b govern the conduct of debt relief agencies.hersh argues that these statutes should not apply to her because,as an attorney,she does not qualify as a debt relief agency.debt relief agency is defined in the bapcpa as any person who provides any bankruptcy assistance to an assisted person in return for the payment of money or other valuable consideration,or who is a bankruptcy petition preparer under section.an assisted person is any person whose debts consist primarily of consumer debts and the value of whose nonexempt property is less than.id.
in enacting the bapcpa,congress responded to evidence that attorneys and other bankruptcy professionals often played a role in abusing the bankruptcy system.see house report at.section a is meant to curb this abuse by prohibiting debt relief agencies from advising assisted persons to incur debt in contemplation of bankruptcy or to incur debt to pay attorney or bankruptcy petition preparer fees.hersh contends that section a is facially unconstitutional in violation of the first amendment because it impairs her right to provide legal advice to her clients,and chills and punishes speech that is fundamental to the relationship.she asserts that she intends to engage in speech that violates this statute by advising her clients to incur debt in contemplation of bankruptcy when doing so would be in good faith and not abusive of the bankruptcy system.
section b was enacted with the intention of providing debtors who are thinking about filing for bankruptcy with certain basic information about the bankruptcy system.it requires debt relief agencies to disclose specific basic information about bankruptcy to assisted persons whom they are counseling through the bankruptcy process.hersh argues on appeal that section b violates the first amendment by compelling her to provide factual information to her clients that is false and misleading,even when it is not pertinent to her client.
hersh does not claim that the government or any individual debtor or any other person or organization whatever has threatened to enforce either section or against her on any occasion.she does not assert that the government or any official has issued any bulletin or statement or made any threat to anyone indicating that it will in any way punish or take any adverse action against her or any other debt relief agency in her position if she or they take the actions that she alleges she plans to take in her legal practice.she simply conclusorily asserts that if she violates section a,she faces a threat of civil punishment for advising her client to take legitimate actions that are prohibited by the statute,and that the statute of itself has a chilling effect on her communications with her clients.she also contends that the civil penalties for violating sections a and b deter or chill the exercise of free speech rights and cause continuing harm or a real and immediate threat of future injury.see sec y of state joseph munson,d w hen there is a danger of chilling free speech,the concern that constitutional adjudication be avoided whenever possible may be outweighed by society interest in having the statute challenged.
after hersh filed suit against the government on november,the government responded to hersh complaints by filing a motion to dismiss all of hersh claims under federal rule of civil procedure b on february.on july,the district court issued a memorandum opinion and order in response to the government motion to dismiss hersh claim.hersh.it held that section a is facially unconstitutional in violation of the first amendment,but granted the government motion to dismiss for all of hersh other claims.id.at.it dismissed hersh claim that attorneys advising clients on bankruptcy issues are not debt relief agencies as defined in because the plain meaning of the statute indicates that the term includes bankruptcy attorneys.id.at.it held that section a violates the first amendment because it imposes limitations on speech beyond what is narrow and necessary,and invited hersh to move for summary judgment on that claim once she amended her complaint to assert it explicitly.id.at,see also note,supra.it dismissed hersh challenge to section b because the statute advances a sufficiently compelling government interest and does not unduly burden either the relationship or the ability of a client to seek bankruptcy.hersh,at.finally,the district court held that hersh does not have standing to assert her fifth amendment claims.id.at.
after the district court issued this opinion,hersh filed a motion for summary judgment regarding her section a claim,which the district court granted on december.it ordered that hersh have declaratory judgment that a violates the first amendment.it also ordered that defendant united states,its agents,and all people acting in active concert with it are permanently enjoined from enforcement of a.
the government timely appealed the district court judgment that section a violates the first amendment,and hersh thereafter timely the court holdings that attorneys qualify as debt relief agencies under section and that section b does not violate the first amendment.
discussion 
we limit our discussion to the issues raised on appeal whether attorneys qualify as debt relief agencies under whether a is wholly invalid as a facially unconstitutional violation of the first amendment and whether b unconstitutionally compels speech in violation of the first amendment.for the reasons stated below,we affirm the judgment of the district court insofar as far as it holds that attorneys are debt relief agencies and that section b does not violate the first amendment.we reverse the judgment of the district court on hersh section a claim,and hold that section a is not facially unconstitutional.
whether attorneys are debt relief agencies under 
hersh argues that the district court erred in holding that attorneys may qualify as debt relief agencies under.this is important because a debt relief agency must comply with the terms of certain provisions of the bankruptcy code such as those here at issue,sections and.the district court granted the government motion to dismiss hersh claim that the term debt relief agency does not include bankruptcy attorneys.hersh,at.
the only federal court of appeals to have addressed that issue,namely the eighth circuit in its september,decision in milavetz,gallop milavetz,et united states,cir hereafter milavetz,has held that attorneys that provide bankruptcy assistance to assisted persons are debt relief agencies as that term is defined by the code.id.at we agree with that holding 
debt relief agency is defined by as any person who provides any bankruptcy assistance to an assisted person in return for the payment of money or other valuable consideration,or who is a bankruptcy petition preparer under section bankruptcy assistance is defined as 
any goods or services sold or otherwise provided to an assisted person with the express or implied purpose of providing information,advice,counsel,document preparation,or filing,or attendance at a creditors meeting or appearing in a case or proceeding on behalf of another or providing legal representation with respect to a case or proceeding under this title.emphasis added.
the district court correctly concluded that under the plain language of,attorneys qualify as debt relief agencies.although the definition does not explicitly include attorneys,it also does not exclude them in the list of exclusions provided after the definition.see note,supra.more importantly,debt relief agency is broadly defined as any person who provides any bankruptcy assistance to an assisted person.bankruptcy assistance is defined to include providing legal representation with respect to a case or proceeding under the bankruptcy code.id.emphasis added.thus,a debt relief agency includes any person who provides legal representation in a bankruptcy proceeding to an assisted person.as only attorneys can provide legal representation,they are necessarily included in the definition of debt relief agency.
furthermore,as the district court observed,the legislative history of the bapcpa indicates that congress intended the act to apply to attorneys as the house report for the bapcpa refers to attorneys multiple times.see,house report at a civil enforcement initiative has consistently identified such problems as debtor misconduct and abuse,misconduct by attorneys and other professionals.therefore,the district court properly granted the government motion to dismiss hersh motion for declaratory judgment on this issue.
hersh argues that this court should apply the doctrine of constitutional avoidance to eliminate the need to determine the constitutionality of a and b in this case by holding that the term debt relief agency does not apply to attorneys.however,hersh arguments do not overcome the referenced evident congressional intent and the plain language of the statute.
first,hersh suggests that because the definition of debt relief agency does not explicitly include attorneys,they are necessarily excluded from the term.however,because the definition,when read in conjunction with the definition of bankruptcy assistance,clearly and affirmatively includes attorneys,an exclusion for attorneys should not be implied.this is especially so because the section definition is simply a general definition without any specific inclusions,but with five specific exclusions none of which mentions or is claimed to embrace attorneys.
next,hersh argues that section b requires debt relief agencies to inform assisted persons that they have the right to hire an attorney or represent themselves,which would not be necessary if an attorney was a debt relief agency.however,debt relief agencies are not limited to attorneys and section b specifically indicates that this advice is only necessary to the extent applicable.thus,an attorney acting as a debt relief agency would not be required to provide her clients with this advice.
third,hersh notes that her clients include creditors and others who qualify as assisted persons,but seek legal advice for matters unrelated to their own bankruptcy filings.she suggests that if attorneys are not omitted from the definition of debt relief agency,they must abide by the provisions that apply to debt relief agencies even when they are not advising debtors.the definition of assisted person under the bapcpa does not explicitly indicate that only those seeking to file for or inquire about entering bankruptcy qualify as assisted persons.see an assisted person is any person whose debts consist primarily of consumer debts and the value of whose nonexempt property is less than.however,if hersh is counseling a client who is a creditor or any other client who qualifies as an assisted person but who is not seeking legal advice related to the client own bankruptcy,hersh would not be in danger of violating section a as she would not advise that client to incur more debt in contemplation of bankruptcy precluded by section a because that client would not be filing for bankruptcy.she also would not need to provide that client with the information required by section b because that information only must be provided to the extent applicable,and would only apply to debtors contemplating their own bankruptcy.thus,hersh has not shown that attorneys must abide by the bapcpa even when they are not counseling debtors.furthermore,she does not explain why this argument does not apply to any debt relief agency,so it does not seem to support her position that attorneys should be excluded from the definition.
finally,hersh suggests that because the bapcpa regulates the conduct of debt relief agencies,if attorneys are held to be debt relief agencies,states would be deprived of their ability to determine and enforce qualifications for legal practice,which would infringe on the states roll in regulating attorneys.in support of this argument,she cites d a,which states that nothing in section,and shall be deemed to limit or curtail the authority or ability of a state or subdivision or instrumentality thereof,to determine and enforce qualifications for the practice of law under the laws of that state.treating attorneys as debt relief agencies will not deprive states of the ability to regulate their own lawyers.it is clear that congress can regulate the conduct of attorneys practicing in federal courts and in bankruptcy proceedings without impinging on states rights.see,rule,fed.civ,and rule,fed.
for the reasons stated,we agree with the eighth circuit unanimous opinion in milavetz on this issue and we hold that the district court properly concluded that,under the plain language of the section definition,an attorney providing,in return for the payment of money or other valuable consideration,bankruptcy assistance,as defined in section,to an assisted person,as defined in section,is a debt relief agency for purposes of the bapcpa.
ii.whether a is facially unconstitutional in violation of the first amendment 
the government argues that the district court erred in holding that section a is wholly invalid as a facially unconstitutional violation of the first amendment.
section a provides that 
a a debt relief agency shall not 
advise an assisted person or prospective assisted person to incur more debt in contemplation of such person filing a case under this title or to pay an attorney or bankruptcy petition preparer fee or charge for services performed as part of preparing for or representing a debtor in a case under this title.
as above noted,the only federal appellate court to have addressed section a is the eighth circuit in milavetz where the panel majority held that a is substantially overbroad,and unconstitutional as applied to attorneys who provide bankruptcy assistance to assisted persons,as those terms are defined in the code.at footnote omitted.the panel majority there reasoned that a prohibits attorneys from advising any assisted person to incur any additional debt in contemplation of bankruptcy this prohibition would include advice constituting prudent bankruptcy planning that is not an attempt to circumvent,abuse,or undermine the bankruptcy laws,and that thus s ection a,as written,prevents attorneys from fulfilling their duty to clients to give them appropriate and beneficial advice not otherwise prohibited id.at judge colloton dissented,on the ground that the court,under authorities such as boos barry,d,should have adopted a narrowing construction of in contemplation of bankruptcy in section a to mean with the intent to abuse the protections of the bankruptcy system,and that as so construed section a was not overbroad.milavetz,at colloton,dissenting.
the district court here held that section a unconstitutionally restricts hersh speech.hersh,at.in proceedings below,the parties disputed whether strict scrutiny or a more lenient standard set forth in gentile state bar of nevada,d should apply in determining the statute constitutionality.hersh,at.because the district court held that section a does not survive scrutiny under the more lenient standard,it did not decide which level of scrutiny should apply.id.however,in a footnote,the court held in the alternative that because section a does not purport to be an ethical standard,which the district court concluded would render it subject to the more lenient gentile test,strict scrutiny should apply.id.at.it noted that the statute fails under the strict scrutiny test for the same reasons that it fails the more lenient test.id.
the district court noted that section a was meant to end manipulation of the bankruptcy system,but that it did not close loopholes or penalize people who take on debt before filing for bankruptcy.id.at.it suggested that taking on additional debt in contemplation of bankruptcy is not necessarily abusive of the bankruptcy system.id.in some cases taking on additional debt will be the most financially prudent option for the debtor,such as when a debtor refinanc es at a lower rate to reduce payments and forestall or even prevent entering bankruptcy,or tak es on secured debt such as a loan on an automobile that would survive bankruptcy and also enable the debtor to continue to get to work and make payments.id thus,the court concluded the statute is over inclusive.id.at.therefore,the court held that the statute is facially unconstitutional on overbreadth grounds,and,thus,completely invalidated the law.id.
doctrine of constitutional avoidance 
the parties dispute whether the district court properly interpreted section a to prohibit attorneys from advising clients to incur debt on the eve of bankruptcy when doing so would be legal,not abusive of the bankruptcy system,and the best option for the debtor.we hold the doctrine of constitutional avoidance should be applied to section a to avoid any of the potential constitutional problems with this statute that have been raised by hersh.
under the doctrine of constitutional avoidance,w here an otherwise acceptable construction of a statute would raise serious constitutional problems,the court will construe the statute to avoid such problems unless such construction is plainly contrary to the intent of congress.edward debartolo.gulf coast constr.trades council,d.see also zadvydas davis,d i t is a cardinal principle of statutory interpretation that when an act of congress raises a serious doubt as to its constitutionality,this court will first ascertain whether a construction of the statute is fairly possible by which the question may be avoided.quoting crowell benson.constitutional avoidance is a cardinal principal of constitutional law that has for so long been applied by the supreme court that is it beyond debate.debartolo.at.
the government argues that under the doctrine of constitutional avoidance,the portion of section a that states that a debt relief agency shall not advise an assisted person or prospective assisted person to incur more debt in contemplation of such person filing a case under this title should be interpreted narrowly to apply only to situations in which incurring debt just before bankruptcy would be an abuse of the bankruptcy system.however,hersh,on the other hand,argues that the plain language of the statute clearly prohibits attorneys from advising clients in any situation to incur any debt for any purpose when intending,or considering whether to,file bankruptcy,even when doing so would not be an abuse of the bankruptcy system.
if interpreted literally and broadly,section a would raise serious constitutional problems because,as hersh suggests,it would restrict some speech that is protected by the first amendment.the statute does not expressly qualify its restriction on advice to situations in which incurring more debt would be an abuse of the bankruptcy system.thus,if interpreted literally,section a creates a blanket restriction on attorneys advising clients to incur any debt when intending,or contemplating whether to,file for bankruptcy under any circumstances.it would prohibit some attorney advice that would not be abusive to the bankruptcy system,harmful to creditors,or harmful to debtors thus,if interpreted literally,section a may apply to speech that is protected by the first amendment.
however,hersh does not dispute that section a,even when read literally,does prohibit some speech that congress can regulate without violating the first amendment.the principal purpose of the bankruptcy code is to grant a fresh start to the honest but unfortunate debtor.marrama citizens bank of massachusetts,d internal citation omitted.by incurring debt before bankruptcy without intending to repay the debt,a debtor can cost creditors significant amounts of money.a debtor may also disqualify himself from obtaining bankruptcy relief.see id.at holding that a debtor can not automatically convert his bankruptcy from chapter to chapter under section a if he acts in bad faith.thus,congress has an interest in preventing abuse of the bankruptcy system by both the debtors who incur debts just before filing for bankruptcy and by the people who advise them to do so.a debtor who incurs debt before bankruptcy in order to abuse the system is not one of the honest but unfortunate debtors that the bankruptcy system is designed to protect.id.at.
furthermore,when a debtor incurs debt in contemplation of bankruptcy with no intention of repaying his debts or with the intention to otherwise manipulate the bankruptcy system,he may well be committing a fraudulent act that may violate federal law.see a a person who knowingly and fraudulently makes a false oath or account in or in relation to any case under title shall be fined under this title,imprisoned not more than years,or both.id.at see also attorney grievance comm of maryland culver,b y advising his client to obtain loans with the intention of having the debts discharged in bankruptcy,the defendant counseled his client to commit a fraudulent act,which violated the maryland rules of professional conduct.taking out loans without intending to repay them may also be considered theft under state law.see henke state,christi affirming a grain hauler conviction of felony theft because he took grain under a contract knowing that he would not be able to pay for it.the government may regulate or ban speech in which a person proposes an illegal transaction.village of hoffman estates flipside,hoffman estates,d.
moreover,the supreme court has upheld other regulations on attorney speech that are aimed at preventing abusive behavior.in gentile,the supreme court discussed aba model rule of professional conduct,which prohibits attorneys from making extrajudicial statements that a reasonable person would expect to be spread through public communication if the lawyer knows or should know that making the statement was substantially likely to materially prejudice an adjudicative proceeding.at.the court indicated that this regulation of attorney speech,as adopted by nevada,was permissible as it can be i nterpreted in a proper and narrow manner so as to punish only speech that creates a danger of imminent and substantial harm.id.thus,it suggested that restrictions on attorney speech are proper in certain situations.it indicated that attorneys are subject to ethical restrictions on speech to which an ordinary citizen would not be,and that a state may demand some adherence to the precepts of its legal system in regulating attorney speech as well as attorney conduct.id.at.the court also held that speech of lawyers representing clients in pending cases may be regulated under a less demanding standard than that established for regulation of the press.id.at.thus,the supreme court has held that attorney speech may be subject to diminished first amendment protection when it is regulated in furtherance of a substantial governmental interest.id.at.
the ability of the government to regulate the speech of attorneys is also made evident by other model rules of professional conduct.for example,rule d prohibits attorneys from advising clients to commit fraudulent or criminal acts this ethical rule states 
a lawyer shall not counsel a client to engage,or assist a client,in conduct that the lawyer knows is illegal or fraudulent,but a lawyer may discuss the legal consequences of any proposed course of conduct with a client and may counsel or assist a client to make a effort to determine the validity,scope,meaning,or application of the law.
the parties do not cite and this court could not find any case in which this rule,as adopted by a state,has been challenged as a violation of the first amendment right to freedom of speech.nor does hersh argue that this type of regulation unconstitutionally restricts attorney speech.as incurring debt in contemplation of bankruptcy,where doing so constitutes an abusive practice,is akin to committing a fraudulent act,it is clear that congress can constitutionally prevent attorneys or other debt relief agencies from advising their clients to do so.
to avoid potential constitutional questions regarding section a restrictions on speech,this court construes the statute to prevent only a debt relief agency advice to a debtor to incur debt in contemplation of bankruptcy when doing so would be an abuse of the bankruptcy system.in so interpreting the statute,we avoid the constitutionality questions raised by hersh and those relied on by the milavetz majority,and conclude that the statute only affects unprotected speech.
while we recognize that the doctrine of constitutional avoidance is not a license for the judiciary to rewrite language enacted by the legislature,united states albertini,d,it is nevertheless the fact that the supreme court has on several occasions applied to acts of congress a restrictive meaning for what appear to be plain words where such a restrictive meaning must be given if a broader meaning would generate constitutional doubts.united states witkovich,d.thus,in witkovich the wording of the challenged statutory section read in isolation and literally conferred on the attorney general authority to require whatever information he deems desirable of aliens whose deportation has not been effected within six months after it has been commanded.id.but the court,rejecting the tyranny of literalness,and relying instead on the doctrine of constitutional avoidance,held that the appropriate construction was to limit the statute to authorizing all questions reasonably calculated to keep the attorney general advised regarding the continued availability for departure of aliens whose deportation is overdue.id.at.
in zadvydas,the court addressed a statute authorizing the attorney general,after the ninety day removal period,to detain without any stated durational limitation,certain aliens subject to final orders of deportation pending effectuation of their deportation.at the court held that the statute must be construed,in light of the constitution demands to be limited to detention for a reasonable time,id.at,which the court decreed to be presumptively six months a period nowhere mentioned in the statute after the ninety day removal period but which could extend past the six months until it has been determined that there is no significant likelihood of removal in the reasonably foreseeable future.id.at.in this connection,zadvydas expressly relied on witkovich,stating 
we have read significant limitations into other immigration statutes in order to avoid their constitutional invalidation.see united states witkovich,d construing a grant of authority to the attorney general to ask aliens whatever questions he deem s fit and proper as limited to questions reasonably calculated to keep the attorney general advised regarding the continued availability for departure of aliens whose deportation is overdue.for similar reasons,we read an implicit limitation into the statute before us.at.
another example of the court adoption of a limiting construction of a facially unrestricted statutory provision,to avoid a serious constitutional problem,is afforded by boos barry,d.there the court faced,inter alia,a first amendment challenge to the federal statute,applicable to any building or premises within the district of columbia used or occupied by any foreign government as an embassy,legation,consulate,or for other official purposes,which provided that i t shall be unlawful among other things to congregate within feet of any such building or premises,and refuse to disperse after having been ordered so to do by the police authorities of said district.id.at.
the court stated 
standing alone,this text is problematic both because it applies to any congregation within feet of an embassy for any reason and because it appears to place no limits at all on the dispersal authority of the police.the court of appeals,however,has provided a narrowing construction that alleviates both of these difficulties.
t he court of appeals concluded that the statute permits the dispersal only of congregations that are directed at an embassy it does not grant police the power to disperse for reasons having nothing to do with the nearby embassy.t he court of appeals further circumscribed police discretion by holding that the statute permits dispersal only when the police reasonably believe that a threat to the security or peace of the embassy is present.id.at.
the court proceeded to reject the protest that the court of appeals was without authority to narrow the statute,stating 
it is well settled that federal courts have the power to adopt narrowing constructions of federal legislation indeed the federal courts have the duty to avoid constitutional difficulties by doing so if such a construction is fairly possible w e see no barrier to the court of appeals adoption of a narrowing construction.id.at 
the court then held that s o narrowed,the congregation clause withstands first amendment overbreadth scrutiny.it does not reach a substantial amount of constitutionally protected conduct id.thus,the boos court approved a limiting construction of the statute adding a requirement,nowhere expressed in the statute,of reasonable belief of a present threat to the security or peace of a targeted embassy to save the statute from being invalidated on first amendment overbreadth grounds.
many factors demonstrate that section a can and should be interpreted in an analogous way.
first,the fact that section a utilizes the phrase in contemplation of bankruptcy suggests that the statute is directed at situations in which a debtor intends to abuse the bankruptcy system.the phrase contemplation of bankruptcy has been defined as the thought of declaring bankruptcy because of the inability to continue current financial operations,often coupled with action designed to thwart the distribution of assets in a bankruptcy proceeding.black law dictionary ed.the fact that the thought of bankruptcy under this definition is often coupled with an intent to abuse the system suggests that when enacting this statute congress focus was on instances of bankruptcy abuse to be prohibited.furthermore,courts have employed the in contemplation phrase in a manner suggestive of an intent to defraud the bankruptcy system.see,in re mercer,cir en banc describing loading up on debt,a practice which is abusive of the bankruptcy system,as the practice of incurring card debt in contemplation of bankruptcy in re charles,it is settled law that a debtor good faith should be questioned if the debtor makes purchases in contemplation of a bankruptcy case.other opinions reflecting a similar understanding of in contemplation of bankruptcy are discussed in judge colloton dissenting opinion in milavetz,at 
the remedies for violations of section a,which are only civil,also reflect that the focus of that section is to preclude attorneys from advising clients to incur debt in order to abuse the bankruptcy system.the primary remedy for a violation of section a is a civil action by the debtor or state attorney general to recover actual damages for the debtor.c.actual damages,as well as restitution for any fees paid the violator by the debtor,and attorneys fees can be recovered by a debtor when a debt relief agency intentionally or negligently fails to comply with section,or.id.c a.furthermore,if the state has reason to believe that a debt relief agency has violated section,it may bring an action to enjoin the violation,bring an action on behalf of its residents to recover actual damages for debtors arising out of the violation,and can recover costs and attorneys fees from the debt relief agency if it is successful.id.c a c under section c,a bankruptcy court may impose an appropriate civil penalty or enjoin a violation if it finds intentional violations of the provisions or a clear and consistent practice of violations.id.c.congress emphasis on actual damages for violations of section a strongly suggests that congress viewed that section as aimed at advice to debtors which if followed would have a significant risk of harming the debtor.this suggests that congress only intended to prevent debt relief agencies from advising clients to incur debt before bankruptcy when doing so would be abusive,and thus have significant potential negative repercussions for the debtor such as dismissal of a petition or denial of discharge.
in enacting the bapcpa,congress was attempting to address common abuses of the bankruptcy system.congress concluded that there was a pervasive abuse of the bankruptcy system by debtors who incur debt before bankruptcy with the intention of having their debt discharged.see house report at referring to the abusive practices by consumer debtors who knowingly load up with credit card purchases or recklessly obtain cash advances and then file for bankruptcy relief.this congressional intent is made evident by the changes that the bapcpa made to section a c i i to make the rules regarding debt for spending more stringent.this provision made a debt incurred for luxury goods if over and incurred within ninety days of filing for bankruptcy as opposed to the previous rule,which made a debt for luxury goods if over of debt was incurred within sixty days of bankruptcy,historical and statutory notes.it appears that congress enacted section a as a means of combating such abuse.
in enacting the bapcpa,congress also expanded the bankruptcy courts authority to dismiss petitions for abuse of the bankruptcy system,which likewise reflects congressional intent to curb bankruptcy abuse through the new act.under the former version of section b,a bankruptcy court could dismiss a petition for substantial abuse,such as when a debtor accumulated debt in contemplation of bankruptcy with the intention of having the debt discharged.now a bankruptcy petition may be dismissed for mere abuse instead of substantial abuse,and the statutory assumption in favor of granting the relief sought by the debtor has been repealed.b moreover,under new section b c an attorney signature on a petition,pleading or motion certifies that after reasonable investigation the attorney has determined that it does not constitute an abuse under paragraph.this demonstrates that congress intended to curb abuse with the new provisions of the bapcpa,and suggests that as part of this plan,section a is only meant to curb abusive practices.
in the bapcpa,congress also introduced means testing to restrict debtors who can repay at least a portion of their debts from obtaining complete discharge under chapter.see house report at the heart of the bapcpa consumer bankruptcy reforms consists of the implementation of an screening mechanism bankruptcy relief or means testing,which is intended to ensure that debtors repay creditors the maximum they can afford.under this provision,the debtor petition for relief under chapter is presumed to be abusive if the debtor income exceeds the unsecured debts by a specified ratio b a.thus,a debtor who is able to repay a certain amount of his debts must file under chapter or,both of which allow for a structured repayment plan,or have his case dismissed.however,such means testing gives debtors an incentive to load up on debt because a higher debt ratio can allow a debtor to avoid a chapter repayment plan and obtain discharge under chapter by manipulating the formula under which bankruptcy abuse is presumed.this incentive structure likely raised concern that attorneys and others would advise clients to take on more debt before filing for bankruptcy in order to have their debts discharged and to avoid a chapter repayment plan.this also suggests that congress intended section a restriction on advice to incur more debt in contemplation of bankruptcy to prevent that sort of abuse of the bankruptcy system.
the placement of section a among three provisions meant to curb abuse of the bankruptcy system by debt relief agencies likewise suggests that the statute was only intended to curb abuse.section a contains three other rules of professional conduct designed to protect debtors from abusive practices of debt relief agencies.section a requires debt relief agencies to perform all services promised,section a prohibits them from advising an assisted person to make untrue or misleading statements when seeking bankruptcy relief,and section a precludes debt relief agencies from misrepresenting the services they will provide or the costs or benefits of filing for bankruptcy relief.this suggests that congress did not enact a as a sweeping prohibition on good faith,lawful,and ethical advice.
for the reasons stated above,we hold that under the doctrine of constitutional avoidance,the language of section a can and should be interpreted only to prohibit attorneys from advising clients to incur debt in contemplation of bankruptcy when doing so would be an abuse or improper manipulation of the bankruptcy system.thus,section a has no application to good faith advice to engage in conduct that is consistent with a debtor interest and does not abuse or improperly manipulate the bankruptcy system.
overbreadth 
hersh argues that the district court correctly concluded that section a is facially unconstitutional the government challenges this holding.hersh does not suggest that the statute is invalid as applied to her or that if this court does not hold section a facially invalid,it should invalidate the statute on more narrow grounds thus,we will only address whether the district court correctly concluded that section a is unconstitutional on its face.
a court can hold a statute to be facially unconstitutional,as opposed to unconstitutional as applied,if it is excessively vague or substantially overbroad.see john nowak ronald rotunda,constitutional law ed.the district court held section a facially unconstitutional on overbreadth grounds.hersh,at according to our first amendment overbreadth doctrine,a statute is facially invalid if it prohibits a substantial amount of protected speech.united states williams,d.such facial challenges can succeed only when this overbreadth is substantial in relation to the statute legitimate reach.id.there must be a significant imbalance between the protected speech the statute should not punish and the unprotected speech it legitimately reaches.shackelford shirley,cir.the party challenging the statute must demonstrate a realistic danger that the statute itself will significantly compromise recognized first amendment protections of parties not before the c ourt before a statute will be struck down as facially overbroad.id.alterations in original quoting city council of los angeles taxpayers for vincent,d.
the fact that a court can hypothesize situations in which the statute will impact protected speech is not alone sufficient.taxpayers for vincent.at shackelford,at.facial challenges to the constitutionality of statutes should be granted sparingly,and only as a last resort,so challenges are preferred.broadrick oklahoma,d.facial challenges often rest on speculation because they do not involve specific applications of a statute,but rather hypothetical applications.washington state grange.at.they also threaten to short circuit the democratic process by preventing laws embodying the will of the people from being implemented in a manner consistent with the constitution.id.invalidating a law that is perfectly constitutional in some applications has obvious harmful effects.williams.at.
the first step in overbreadth analysis is to construe the challenged statute it is impossible to determine whether a statute reaches too far without first knowing what the statute covers.williams.at.although,as described above,hersh and the district court noted several examples in which advice to a client to incur debt in contemplation of bankruptcy should be protected by the first amendment,as described above,this court has construed the statute so that it does not apply to these situations.as so construed,the statute does not restrict the speech that hersh argues is protected by the first amendment.thus,there is no significant imbalance between any protected speech the statute restricts and the speech that the statute legitimately restricts.
moreover,as the government notes,the district court did not address,and hersh did not discuss in her motion for summary judgment,the final portion of section a,which prohibits debt relief agencies from advising clients to incur debt in order to pay their fees in her brief in this court,hersh states that this prohibition also violates the first amendment and separation of powers principles.hersh argues that it creates an unconstitutional restriction on speech because it inhibits advice to hire a lawyer,and if incurring debt to pay fees for services is the only way that a person of few means in financial distress may obtain a lawyer,congress may not prevent an attorney from advising a client to do it.
however,hersh raised her arguments regarding this provision of section a only on appeal.this court generally does not address an argument raised for the first time on appeal.see,leverette louisville ladder,cir.furthermore,hersh does not argue and has never alleged that she plans to violate or has ever violated this provision by advising her clients to incur debt to pay her fees nor does anything in the record so suggest.moreover,hersh does not cite authority for the proposition that preventing a debt relief agency from abusing its position by seeking preferential treatment in the bankruptcy process violates the constitution.even if hersh arguments are correct,and the attorneys fees provision of section a would unconstitutionally restrict some speech,there is no indication and she does not argue,that this restriction would be substantial in comparison to the legitimate reach of the statute 
under this court construction of section a,it is clear that the potential for the statute to prohibit protected speech is not by any means substantial in relation to the statute legitimate reach.therefore,we hold that the district court erred in holding section a unconstitutional on its face and we reverse the judgment of the district court on this issue we also reverse and dissolve the injunction imposed by the district court preventing the enforcement of this statute.
iii.whether b violates the first 
hersh also argues that the district court erred in holding that b does not violate the first amendment section b requires attorneys to provide assisted persons with written notice of certain basic information regarding bankruptcy proceedings.it states 
a debt relief agency providing bankruptcy assistance to an assisted person shall provide each assisted person at the same time as the notices required under subsection a the following statement,to the extent applicable,or one substantially similar.the statement shall be clear and conspicuous and shall be in a single document separate from other documents or notices provided to the assisted person.b.
the statement set forth in the statute provides basic factual information regarding bankruptcy proceedings the statement that a debt relief agency provides to its client need not be identical to the one provided in the statute as long as it is substantially similar.id.furthermore,section b states that a debt relief agency only needs to provide the information to the extent applicable.id.the statement should be provided to the debtor within three days of the commencement of representation.id.
the district court held that section does not violate the first amendment because it advances a sufficiently compelling government interest and does not unduly burden either the relationship or the ability of a client to seek bankruptcy.hersh,at the court concluded that t he factual,statement required by the statute provides a sufficiently benign and narrow means of ensuring that clients are aware of certain general information regarding bankruptcy.id.thus,it granted the government motion to dismiss hersh claim that section b violates the first amendment.id.this court reviews a district court disposition of a b motion to dismiss de novo.equal access for el paso,hawkins,at cir.
hersh argues that the district court erred in holding that section b is constitutional because the disclosures required by the statute are false,misleading,and not narrowly drawn to further a compelling government interest.
the first amendment protects compelled speech as well as compelled silence.thus,it protects an attorney right not to provide her client with certain factual information.riley fed of the blind of north carolina,d stating that in the context of protected speech,the difference between compelled speech and compelled silence is without constitutional significance,and that compelled statements of fact as well as compelled statements of opinion burden protected speech.however,the supreme court has acknowledged that the government may,under certain circumstances,restrict or compel the speech of professionals.see,zauderer office of the disciplinary counsel of the supreme court of ohio,d recognizing that unjustified or unduly burdensome disclosure requirements might offend the first amendment,but holding that an rights are adequately protected under a state statute requiring certain disclosures in advertisements as long as disclosure requirements are reasonably related to the state interest in preventing deception of consumers.
the supreme court addressed a compelled speech case in riley,d.there,the court applied strict scrutiny to invalidate a north carolina law that required professional fundraisers to disclose to solicited potential donors the percentage of charitable contributions that the fundraiser collected during the past year that were actually given to the charities represented.id.at.strict scrutiny was held appropriate because the court determined that the statute implemented a regulation on speech.id.at.the riley court held that the state interest in informing charitable donors how the money they contribute is spent was not as weighty as the state assert ed.riley.at.it also held that the requirement was unduly burdensome and not narrowly tailored,and would hamper charitable fundraising and necessarily discriminates against small and unpopular charities.id.at.it listed multiple more benign and narrowly tailored options that were available.id.thus,the court held that the statute was unconstitutional in violation of the first amendment.id.at.
in planned parenthood of southeastern pennsylvania casey,d,a plurality of the supreme court upheld a pennsylvania law requiring doctors to provide women seeking abortions with certain information about the procedure,the health risks,conditions surrounding the pregnancy,and availability of information.the court determined that the state had a legitimate goal of protecting the life of an unborn child and making sure that women make mature and informed decisions regarding abortions.id.at.it further reasoned that the requirement that the doctors provide the women seeking abortions with certain information was not a substantial obstacle to obtaining an abortion,and therefore,not an undue burden on the woman.id.
the district court properly concluded that the government interest sought to be furthered by section b was substantially compelling for first amendment purposes.the government interest to be furthered by section b is in ensuring that debtors who are contemplating filing for bankruptcy have some basic knowledge about the process.the amount of debt discharged in bankruptcy is immense,so the government has a compelling interest in ensuring that those who enter bankruptcy know what it entails.house report at indicating that in,it was estimated that more than billion of debt was discharged by debtors who filed for bankruptcy.furthermore,section b requires debt relief agencies to provide information to assisted persons,who are consumer debtors with a limited amount of property.congress could have determined that these consumer debtors often lack basic knowledge about the bankruptcy system in comparison both to creditors and to their advisors who are advising them in return for the payment of money or other valuable consideration,which puts the debtors at a disadvantage.the government has an interest in having the bankruptcy system explained in plain english to such debtors contemplating filing for bankruptcy.
the district court also correctly concluded that section b is narrowly tailored to promote this government interest,and creates a reasonable burden on attorneys and other debt relief agencies.the statute merely sets forth a list of information about bankruptcy proceedings that a debt relief agency acting in return for the payment of money or other valuable consideration must provide to its clients who are assisted persons.it does not limit the amount of information that the debt relief agency can provide,so the debt relief agency is free to expand upon,clarify,or even express disagreement with any of the provisions in the required statement.furthermore,because section b provides that the statement should be given to the client to the extent applicable,if the debt relief agency feels that some of the provisions of the statement are not relevant to its client,it can omit the irrelevant information.this language also provides great leeway for debt relief agencies deciding whether it is necessary to provide a client with the statement at all.if,for example,hersh represents a creditor who qualifies as an assisted person,section b only requires her to present the creditor with the statement if it is applicable to that client.furthermore,although it may be a burden for a debt relief agency to determine whether a prospective client is an assisted person in three days,it would not be unduly burdensome to simply provide the person with the section b statement,and explain that it may not be necessary.section b is narrowly tailored to congress interest in educating debtors about the bankruptcy system because it does not inhibit clients from obtaining relief,nor does it significantly interfere with the relationship between the debt relief agency and its client.as a debt relief agency,hersh can provide her clients with all of the information she desires,she simply must also provide them the basic information required by section b,but only when and to the extent that information is relevant to the client situation and she is free to add any appropriate explanation desired.
furthermore,contrary to hersh arguments,section b does not require hersh or other debt relief agencies to make false and misleading statements.most of the statements that hersh cites as examples of false and misleading material are simply generalizations that she is free to expand upon and clarify for her clients.for example,hersh complains that the assertion in the statute that her client will have to pay a filing fee to the bankruptcy court is misleading because the fee can be deferred under federal rule of bankruptcy procedure b.hersh is completely free to explain to her client the deferral options.she can clarify for her client other provisions in the section b statement that she claims are false and misleading,or even express disagreement with them.for example,she can explain to her client that the bankruptcy trustee is not literally a court official,and that chapter cases do not have a three year minimum requirement for certain repayment plans as the statement suggests.furthermore,contrary to hersh arguments,the fact that the section b statement does not mention that only attorneys can give advice regarding whether to reaffirm debts and prepare a chapter plan,and that only attorneys can help with confirmation hearings,does not mean that she is required to provide her clients with false and misleading information.again,she is free to explain every detail of the bankruptcy process as it applies to her client.she may even alter the language of the statement to fit her preferences as long as the content remains substantially similar.
we note that the court in milavetz unanimously upheld a and b,rejecting challenges thereto which are essentially parallel to those raised by hersh as to section b.see milavetz,at.this reasoning in milavetz supports our holding as to section b.
for the reasons stated above,we hold that the district court properly concluded that section b does not violate hersh first amendment rights because it does not unduly burden her or her clients,and is narrowly tailored to promote the government compelling interest in ensuring that consumer debtors are aware of basic bankruptcy information.
conclusion 
the judgment of the district court is affirmed insofar as it holds that an attorney providing,in return for the payment of money or other valuable consideration,bankruptcy assistance as defined in section of the code,to an assisted person as defined in section of the code,is a debt relief agency as defined in section of the code,for purposes of the bapcpa,and is,
affirmed and insofar as it holds that section b of the code is not invalid as violative of the first amendment,and is,
reversed insofar as it holds that section a of the code is facially unconstitutional in violation of the first amendment,and is reversed insofar as it enjoins the enforcement of section a,and,
judgment is here rendered dissolving the injunction issued by the district court and,
judgment is further here rendered that hersh take nothing by her suit.
michael mukasey became attorney general on november.under federal rule of appellate procedure c,when a public officer party to an appeal in an official capacity ceases to hold office,his successor is automatically substituted as a party.proceedings that follow the substitution are made in the name of the substituted party,here michael mukasey.
in its final judgment of december,the district court stated that unless plaintiff hersh shows good cause within thirty days of the date of this order for her failure to effect service on defendant state of texas,the court will dismiss her claims against that defendant without prejudice.there is no indication in the record or briefs that hersh ever submitted such a statement of good cause.thus,we presume that hersh claims against the state of texas and the attorney general have been dismissed,and neither is a party to this appeal.
though hersh original and first amended complaints do not mention,both hersh and the government argued the constitutionality of section extensively in proceedings below.see hersh,at.thus,the district court addressed the constitutionality of section a in its memorandum opinion and order of july,and granted hersh leave to amend her complaint to include an express claim for relief that section a violates the first amendment.hersh then asserted in her second amended complaint claims pertaining to a.after this,she filed a motion for summary judgment on the issue of the constitutionality of a on october,which the district court granted in an order dated december.
she also made claims regarding the constitutionality of,which were dismissed by the district court and have not been raised on appeal.hersh,at.
this issue also has been addressed by a handful of federal district courts,and there has been no consensus regarding whether attorneys should be considered debt relief agencies.see olsen gonzales,aff on reconsideration,i t is the plain language of the act that leads to the conclusion that attorneys are to be included in the definition of debt relief agency.in re reyes,t he court does not believe congress intended the scope of to include attorneys.in re attorneys at law and debt relief agencies,holding that attorneys who are members of the bar of the bankruptcy court for the southern district of georgia and those admitted pro hac vice are not debt relief agencies under bapcpa as long as their activities consist of practicing law,and do not constitute a separate commercial enterprise.
the milavetz panel was unanimous on that issue and also in its upholding of a and b,which sections are not at issue on this appeal,see note,supra.the milavetz panel was divided on the issue of the constitutionality of a as to that issue we agree with judge colloton dissenting opinion,as explained below.
the statute goes on to list five exceptions but does not include to the definition of debt relief agency a any person who is an officer,director,employee,or agent of a person who provides such assistance or of the bankruptcy petition preparer b a nonprofit organization that is exempt from taxation under section c of the internal revenue code of c a creditor of such assisted person,to the extent that the creditor is assisting such assisted person to restructure any debt owed by such assisted person to the creditor d a depository institution as defined in section of the federal deposit insurance act or any federal credit union or state credit union as those terms are defined in section of the federal credit union act,or any affiliate or subsidiary of such depository institution or credit union or e an author,publisher,distributor,or seller of works subject to copyright protection under title,when acting in such capacity.
several district courts that have addressed the constitutionality of a have also determined that the statute violates the first amendment.see zelotes adams,because a is not sufficiently narrowly tailored to achieve the desired objective,it is unconstitutional as applied to bankruptcy attorneys.in re reyes,at this court holds,and are unconstitutional as applied to attorneys.olsen,at following the reasoning of hersh to hold that a is unconstitutional in violation of the first amendment.
these are essentially the same examples as those cited by the milavetz majority.at.the government argues that a does not reach these nonabusive situations.
hersh provides some examples of when her clients assertedly should be encouraged to incur new secured debt before filing for bankruptcy.first,a client may be able to obtain better secured loan terms prior to filing.it may be appropriate to incur debt such as a home equity based line of credit before filing for bankruptcy because the terms of the credit may not be available at all after a bankruptcy filing.furthermore,it might be advisable for a client to finance a new vehicle while his credit ratings are intact before filing for bankruptcy so that he will be able to commute to work to pay off his debts.it may also be advisable for a couple planning to divorce to have one spouse accelerate efforts to secure a mortgage or lease before filing for bankruptcy if the mortgage or lease would not be available immediately after bankruptcy is filed.finally,it might be advisable for a person to finance education through educational loans before filing for bankruptcy if she could not do so after filing.the government generally takes the position that in nonabusive situations of this kind a does not preclude advice to incur the debt.
a states a a discharge under section,a,b,or b of this title does not discharge an individual debtor from any debt for money,property,services,or an extension,renewal,or refinancing of credit,to the extent obtained by a false pretenses,a false representation,or actual fraud,other than a statement respecting the debtor or an insider financial condition.
states a person who,having devised or intending to devise a scheme or artifice to defraud and for the purpose of executing or concealing such a scheme or artifice or attempting to do so files a petition under title,including a fraudulent involuntary bankruptcy petition under section of such title files a document in a proceeding under title,including a fraudulent involuntary bankruptcy petition under section of such title or makes a false or fraudulent representation,claim,or promise concerning or in relation to a proceeding under title,including a fraudulent involuntary bankruptcy petition under section of such title,at any time before or after the filing of the petition,or in relation to a proceeding falsely asserted to be pending under such title,shall be fined under this title,imprisoned not more than years,or both.
this regulation on attorney speech,like the language of gentile,also reveals how congress can regulate debt relief agencies other than attorneys.all debt relief agencies,including,have a similar relationship to their because they are all advising their clients in or concerning the bankruptcy process.thus,the assumed constitutionality of rule d demonstrates that congress can prevent all debt relief agencies,not just attorneys who are debt relief agencies,from advising their clients to incur debt before bankruptcy when doing so would be an abuse of the bankruptcy system.
the statutory section there in question former d provided that the attorney general could require aliens who had been under a deportation order for more than six months but had not been actually deported to give information under oath as to his nationality,circumstances,habits,associations,and activities,and such other information,whether or not related to the foregoing,as the attorney general may deem fit and proper.witkovich.at.
the removal period referred to the statutory day period,beginning when the deportation order became final,within which the attorney general is required to detain the alien and affectuate his removal.zadvydas.at.
the court likewise rejected the notion that a narrowing construction of this statute could not properly be adopted unless such a construction is reasonable and readily apparent.boos.at.
see the following from judge colloton dissenting opinion american and english authorities construing the bankruptcy laws also support the proposition that the words in contemplation of may be understood to require an intent to abuse the bankruptcy laws.in re pearce,cas,concluding that an act was done in contemplation of bankruptcy if it was done in anticipation of breaking or failing in his business,of committing an act of bankruptcy,or of being declared bankrupt at his own instance,on the ground of inability to pay his debts,and intending to defeat the general distribution of effects,which takes place under a proceeding in bankruptcy.emphasis added morgan brundrett,barn.ad,eng,parke,interpreting in contemplation of bankruptcy to mean that the payment or delivery must be with intent to defeat the general distribution of effects which takes place under a commission of bankruptcy.fidgeon sharpe,taunt,eng,gibbs,an act made in contemplation of bankruptcy must be intended in fraud of the bankrupt laws.buckingham mclean,how.id.at relying on english bankruptcy decisions as instructive authority on meaning of the former bankrupt act
