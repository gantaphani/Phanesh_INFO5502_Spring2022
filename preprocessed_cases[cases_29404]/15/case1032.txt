introduction 
pursuant to the order of the supreme court of california,we vacated our opinion filed may.we hereby issue the following opinion which considers californians for disability rights mervyn,llc cal th,d,and branick downey savings loan cal th,d.
three of the four consolidated appeals require us to apply health and safety code section and california code of regulations,title,section section to review the notice served by consumer advocacy group cag on hundreds of hotels and retail establishments.in its notice,cag alleged that respondents violated proposition by exposing individuals to secondhand smoke,tobacco,and tobacco products without providing a reasonable warning.respondents persuaded the trial court that cag notices were overbroad and therefore invalid.as a result,the court dismissed cag numerous complaints.
we hold that notice,for purposes of proposition,must be specific and must inform the targeted hotels and retail establishments and the public prosecutor of the nature of the alleged violation.the inclusion of superfluous material in the notice does not invalidate an otherwise lawful notice.however,notice that is so broad it renders the specific violation impossible to discern fails to achieve its function.it neither affords the hotels and retail establishments an opportunity to cure a violation nor provides the public prosecutor the means to meaningfully investigate the alleged violations.
in addition to alleging violations of proposition,cag also alleged respondents violated business and professions code section et,also known as the unfair competition law ucl.we reject cag argument that it may pursue its ucl are based on the identical allegations as its proposition of the validity of the notice required by proposition.we conclude that proposition,which amended the requirements for standing to bring a ucl action,applies to cag,even though the case was pending prior to the passage of proposition.
we affirm the judgment of dismissal in favor of the respondents upon which cag served invalid notice.we reverse the judgment of dismissal in favor of those respondents upon which cag served valid notice.
factual and procedural background i cag appeals 
cag describes itself as an organization acting in the public interest to enforce the proposition warning requirements.center for biological diversity is amicus curiae in support of cag.respondents in the three cag appeals are numerous hotels and retail establishments.
the subject of these appeals are cag proposition notices alleging consumer product,environmental and occupational exposures to tobacco smoke and tobacco products.a consumer product exposure is an exposure which results from a person acquisition,purchase,storage,consumption,or other reasonably foreseeable use of a consumer good,or any exposure that results from receiving a consumer service,tit,subd.b.an occupational exposure is an exposure,in the workplace of the employer causing the exposure,to any employee,tit,subd.c.an environmental exposure is an exposure which may foreseeably occur as the result of contact with an environmental medium,including,but not limited to,ambient air,indoor air,drinking water,standing water,running water,soil,vegetation,or manmade or natural substances,either through inhalation,ingestion,skin contact or otherwise,tit,subd.d.
cag served its first set of notices alleging violations of proposition in august.yeroushalmi miramar sheraton th,d miramar.that first set of notices was held invalid by division four of this court in miramar.id.at,d.while that appeal was pending,cag served a second set of notices.the trial court initially found the allegations of consumer product exposures in cag second set of notices were sufficient.yet it found the claims of occupational and environmental exposures were overbroad and therefore invalid.
cag then served a third set of notices on many,but not all,of the same respondents.respondents served with the third set of notices,like those served with the second set of notices,moved for judgment on the pleadings or filed demurrers.a new judge considered cag second and third set of notices.this time,the judge found that both sets were invalid in their entirety primarily because the allegations were too general.subsequently,the court entered several judgments of dismissal,dismissing cag complaints.cag filed three notices of appeal from the judgments,some of which concern the same respondents 
in addition to dismissing the case,the court granted a motion for sanctions brought by comfort inn santa monica,motels,kings inn,r r hotel group,ramada inn,sterling hotels,and vasona management company.the court found,plaintiff offered no evidence of any investigation or documentation supporting claims asserted in the notices or in the complaints.it refused to consider an untimely declaration.counsel was ordered to pay sanctions of.cag did not appeal from the order awarding sanctions 
discussion i cag appeals 
whether proposition notice complies with the statutory requirements is reviewed de novo.miramar,supra,th at,d.we begin with background information regarding proposition.we then consider respondents argument that cag notice is invalid due to overbreadth.finding that the notice is invalid only where the overbreadth renders it impossible to discern the specific violation,we consider exemplar notices to apply this rule.we then discuss issues raised by a subset of respondents including the severability of those san jose located respondents due to cag failure to serve the san jose city attorney the effect of the postjudgment sanctions award and the statute of limitations as applied to good nite inn.finally,we consider the viability of cag causes of action under business and professions code section et.
background 
in,voters passed proposition,which was designed to warn the public of harmful exposures to chemicals.ballot,analysis of proposition by the legislative analyst.the resulting health and safety code section provides in pertinent part n o person in the course of doing business shall knowingly and intentionally expose any individual to a chemical known to the state to cause cancer or reproductive toxicity without first giving clear and reasonable warning to such individual.the statute may be enforced by the attorney general and certain city attorneys or,if specified conditions are satisfied,by a citizen.
when this litigation began,section describes the prerequisites for citizen enforcement of proposition actions pursuant to this section may be brought by any person in the public interest if the action is commenced more than sixty days after the person has given notice of the violation which is the subject of the action to the attorney general and the district attorney and any city attorney in whose jurisdiction the violation is alleged to occur and to the alleged violator,and neither the attorney general nor any district attorney nor any city attorney or prosecutor has commenced and is diligently prosecuting an action against such violation.former,subd.d.
notice,the key to due process and the crux of the present appeal,is required before property interests may be disturbed or penalties assessed.lambert california,d.notice is a mandatory precondition to a lawsuit brought by a citizen to enforce proposition,the outcome of which may result in severe penalties,subd.b,tit,see also off.of environ.health hazard assessment,final statement of reasons,adopting section,notices of violation s uch influence over whether or not penalties will be collected for the public treasury is not to be taken lightly.as a condition precedent to establishing a citizen right to proceed in the public interest on that matter,and to collect funds for the public treasury,the notice requirement should not be dismissed as a mere technicality.notice serves dual purposes.it provides the public prosecutor the means to assess whether to intervene on behalf of the public.it further affords the accused an opportunity to forestall litigation by settling with the plaintiff or by curing any violation.miramar,supra,th at,d.
the requirements of proposition notice are further described in section.general requirements must be included regardless of the type of violation and specific requirements for consumer product,environmental and occupational violations are also described.these requirements shall not be interpreted to require more than reasonably clear information,expressed in terms of common usage and understanding,on each of the indicated topics,subd.b c.subdivision b lists the general requirements a specified attachment summarizing proposition description of the violation the name of the noticing entity the name of the alleged violator the approximate time period for the violation the name of each chemical involved in the alleged violation and the route of exposure.
for notices involving consumer product exposures,the notice must include the specific type of consumer product or services that caused the violation,with sufficient specificity to inform the recipients of the nature of the items allegedly sold in violation of the law and to distinguish those products or services from others sold or offered by the alleged violator for which no violation is alleged,subd.b d.notices involving occupational exposures must include the general geographic location of the exposure to employees,or if many locations,a description of the occupation or type of task performed by the exposed persons.citation.miramar,supra,th at,d.and,n otices involving environmental exposures must identify the location of the source of the exposure,or where numerous sources of the exposure are alleged,a description of the common characteristics that result in the exposure,in a manner sufficient to distinguish those facilities or sources from others for which no violation is alleged,subd.b f.the notice must also state whether the environmental exposure is occurring beyond the property owned or controlled by the alleged violators.citation.miramar,supra,at,d.
the california code of regulations,title,section requirements were applied in miramar,supra,th,d,which involved several of the same respondents.division four of this court found cag first set of notices were invalid.miramar unequivocally held that a notice which merely alleges that there was tobacco smoke or a cigar somewhere on or off one or more of the alleged violator business premises,exposing the public and all classes of employees in a given city to toxins sometime during a period,gives no notice at all.id.at,d.the court faulted cag consumer product notice for containing no allegation in the notice of any of the enumerated activities.id.at,d.notice naming only the harmful substance and alleging that exposure occurred through inhalation,ingestion,and dermal contact failed to give sufficient information to discern the violation.ibid.neither settlement nor an official investigation is likely to result from a pro forma notice that the citizen intends to sue in days for any violation relating to tobacco smoke or cigars that discovery might turn up.id.at,d.
in,the legislature amended section to require a citizen who brings a lawsuit to include a certificate of merit executed by the attorney for the noticing party the certificate of merit shall state that the person executing the certificate has consulted with one or more persons with relevant and appropriate experience or expertise who has reviewed facts,studies,or other data regarding the exposure to the listed chemical that is the subject of the action,and that,based on that information,the person executing the certificate believes there is a reasonable and meritorious case for the private action,subd.d.at the conclusion of the lawsuit,the court may review the basis for the certificate of merit and,if it is frivolous,may award sanctions in favor of the defendant,subd.h.
the effective date of the certificate of merit requirement was january.dipirro american isuzu motors,th,fn,d.no argument is made that cag failed to provide a certificate of merit before commencing litigation once the amendment was effective.therefore,in discussing the adequacy of cag notice,we need not further consider this requirement.
ii.overbreadth 
respondents overarching argument is that the overbreadth of cag notices invalidates them.according to respondents,just as in miramar,the notices in this case give no notice.cag can not reasonably dispute respondents claim that its notices are overbroad because none is narrowly tailored to a specific respondent.as a result,a hotel having no swimming pool,chauffeur or internal hallways may have received notice that smoking was occurring in these locations without an adequate warning.in addition,as in miramar,many notices state that the route of exposure is through inhalation,ingestion,and dermal contact.
standing alone,overbreadth,even where substantial,does not demonstrate that the notices are invalid.instead,the key queries are whether the requirements of section are satisfied whether the notice is sufficiently specific to permit the attorney general and the accused a meaningful opportunity to investigate and whether the notice is sufficiently specific to permit the accused a meaningful opportunity to cure.while broad language arguably may increase the burden on both the public prosecutor and the accused,that result is not automatic.for example,a hotel lacking a pool incurs no additional burden when it receives notice it failed to provide reasonable warnings in a pool area.the hotel is justified in concluding that it is not required to take any action with respect to a nonexistent pool.thus,where an alleged violation is clear and specific,the existence of extra,inapplicable violations does not,without more,render the notice invalid.
in contrast,notice that identifies possible but unclear and general violations makes it impossible for the recipient to understand the specific violation.for example,the miramar court explained that alleging exposure through inhalation,ingestion,and dermal contact,in nearly the exact words of the regulation suggest s that the violation consisted of contact,but state s no facts describing how the contact occurred,and neither the dates of exposure a period of years nor the description of persons exposed every general class of employee respondents might have provide any clarification.miramar,supra,th at,d,italics omitted.the failure of the notice to identify the route of exposure led the court to speculate that cag intended to allege that the route of exposure was through contact.however,cag third set of notices indicates the route of exposure is through inhalation.the court,like the miramar respondents and the public prosecutor,was unable to understand the overly broad notice.
just as overbreadth does not per se invalidate the notice,overbreadth does not necessarily demonstrate a failure to investigate as respondents imply cag generic notice does not reveal the lack or existence of an investigation.a plaintiff may conduct an investigation and provide deficient notice,or may conduct no investigation but clearly describe a specific violation.the adequacy of the notice and of the investigation are separate issues.conflating the two issues undermines the purpose of each.specific notice may overshadow the requirement that a pleading must be certified to have evidentiary support bockrath aldrich chemical cal th,d,or a poorly drafted notice may hide a investigation.
iii.second set of notices served on hotels 
we discuss separately the sufficiency of the notice of environmental,occupational,and consumer product exposures.then we consider respondents arguments that cag failed to satisfy some of the general requirements.
environmental exposures 
in the notice served on amerihost properties,cag alleged that,over a period,the violator has been and is knowingly and intentionally exposing its customers and the public to tobacco smoke and other chemicals listed below and designated by the state of california to cause cancer and reproductive toxicity without first giving clear and reasonable warning of that fact to the exposed persons health safety code section.the sources of exposures are tobacco smoke and other chemicals listed below.the locations of the exposures are inside limousines and cars the hotels provide as complimentary or charged,also the lobbies,corridors and hallways of floors where guest rooms designated for smokers are located,areas adjacent to pools and entrances,smoking rooms,and guest rooms designated for smoking at the locations in the attached exhibit boldface and italics omitted.
respondents argue that the notice lists broad categories of locations in which exposures could take place,without differentiating among the hotel facilities designated on the list of locations attached to the notice.according to respondents,b ased on cag notices,one must unrealistically assume that each of the hotel locations has each of the areas listed in the notice,and that smoking is actually permitted in these areas.
in contrast to the notices in miramar,where cag stated only that the exposures occurred on and beyond property owned and controlled by the violators,here cag specified multiple locations of exposure.miramar,supra,th at,d.respondents principal argument is not that the locations are unintelligible but that they are inapplicable to each respondent property for a different reason.contrary to respondents contention,there is no need to assume that each hotel location has the areas listed and permits smoking in those areas.instead,the relevant question is how the notice applies to each respondent,which alleged violations are applicable and which should be excised.
the problem with this notice of environmental exposures,however,is that just as in miramar,cag failed to specify the route of exposure.like in miramar,cag stated only that t he route of exposure for occupational exposures and environmental exposures to the chemicals listed below has been inhalation,ingestion and dermal contact.cag broad statement,which essentially parrots the regulation,makes it difficult to discern the specific violation.thus,while respondents argument goes too far in claiming that the notice is invalid because not all of the alleged violations are applicable,there is merit to respondents argument that the failure to specify a route of exposure makes it difficult to understand the specific violation and,for that reason,invalidates cag notice of environmental exposures.
occupational exposures 
in its notice served on amerihost properties,under the heading occupational exposures,cag alleges while in the course of doing business over a period,the violator has been and is knowingly and intentionally exposing employees of the violator to tobacco smoke and other chemicals listed below and designated by the state of california to cause cancer and reproductive toxicity without first giving clear and reasonable warning of that fact to the exposed person health safety code section.the sources of exposure include tobacco smoke and other chemicals listed below at the locations in the attached exhibit the employees exposed to said chemicals include but are not limited to bartenders,cashiers,waiters,waitresses,cooks,security personnel,maintenance workers,service personnel,entertainment providers,limousine drivers and chauffeurs.such exposures took place inside limousines and cars provided by the hotels as complimentary or charged,in the lobbies,smoking rooms,guest rooms designated for smoking,and hallways of the floors where rooms designated for smoking are located at the following locations the locations in the attached exhibit boldface and italics omitted.
respondents argue cag merely provide s a laundry list of virtually every conceivable kind of hotel occupational category,without regard to whether each of the over noticed locations,many of which are motor lodges with limited facilities,employ all of the classes of employees listed above.nor do they provide any information regarding which classes of employees were being exposed at each of the noticed locations.respondents argue miramar found similar notices were inadequate.
miramar focused primarily on the problems with cag allegations of consumer product exposure and,in a footnote,noted that cag also alleged occupational and environmental exposures.miramar,supra,th at,fn,d.miramar did not hold that listing multiple employees necessarily results in invalidity of the notice,but rather where every class of employee is identified,it may cause difficulty in understanding the nature of the violation.in the miramar case,it made it impossible to understand the nature of the violation.id.at,d.
the mere claim that the notices are overbroad is insufficient to demonstrate their invalidity.the statement that the exposures occurred inside vehicles provided by the hotels,lobbies,smoking rooms,and certain hallways suffices to identify the general geographic location of the unlawful exposure to employees as required by section,subdivision e.cag use of phrases,such as including,but not limited to and regardless of occupation,can not extend the parameters of notice because the phrases identify no occupation.while such broad language is not helpful,it does not invalidate cag notice in its entirety.however,just as with its allegations of environmental exposure,the problem with cag allegations of occupational exposure lies in its description of the route of exposure through inhalation,ingestion,and dermal contact.
consumer product exposure 
in the notice served on doubletree hotels,embassy suites,hampton inn,red lion,club hotel,and promus hotels corporation,cag stated that,over a period,the violators have been and are knowingly and intentionally manufacturing cigars and selling cigars and smokeless tobacco in the gift shops,restaurants and bars and concessionaires at the locations in the attached exhibit and sic exposing consumers and the public to tobacco smoke and tobacco and other chemicals designated by the state of california to cause cancer and reproductive toxicity without first giving clear and reasonable warning the sources of exposures are tobacco smoke,and cigars and smokeless tobacco sold at the locations set forth in the above the sale,purchase,consumption and the reasonably foreseeable use of cigars and smokeless tobacco result in exposures through inhalation,ingestion,and dermal contact to the chemicals listed below.purchasers of the violators cigars lit them,smoked them and inhaled the chemicals listed below at the consumers place of residence,work,and leisure.consumers also smoked cigars purchased from the violators and inhaled the chemicals listed below off the violator premises and inside the rooms designated for smokers,inside limousines and cars the hotels provide as complimentary or charged,also areas adjacent to pools and entrances,smoking rooms,and guest rooms designated for smoking at the locations in the attached exhibit boldface and italics omitted.
with respect to cigars,cag alleges sufficient information to understand the violation and the route of exposure with the following language the purchasers lit the cigars,smoked them,and inhaled the chemicals in specified locations.however,with respect to smokeless tobacco,no information describes the specific violation.thus,cag has given sufficient notice of a consumer product violation based on cigars.the recipient of the notice may distinguish cigars from other products it sold as required by section,subdivision b d.
in the notice served on shilo inns,cag states that p urchasers of the violator tobacco products lit them,smoked them,inhaled,or otherwise were exposed to the chemicals listed below consumers also smoked tobacco products purchased from the violator and inhaled the chemicals listed below the use of the term tobacco products is unclear.the term does not permit the recipient of notice to understand the nature of the items allegedly sold in violation of the law and to distinguish those products or services from others sold or offered by the alleged violator for which no violation is alleged as required by section,subdivision b d.the term tobacco products encompasses a wide variety of products and therefore does not give the hotel sufficient notice because it is impossible to discern which product cag alleges was sold in violation of the required warnings.
res judicata 
in their joint brief,respondents argue that a s a result of previous legal proceedings involving proposition requirements applicable to the sale of cigars,it is particularly important that cag specifically identify the brands of cigars for which violations are alleged.the record includes a stipulated judgment requiring placement of warnings on certain cigars and an order of the federal trade commission requiring cigar warnings 
respondents argument is not persuasive.the requirements for notice in sections and are not dependent on the existence of other judgments.stated otherwise,cag burden with respect to notice is not altered due to a stipulated judgment or federal trade commission order.cag is not required to anticipate every possible defense in its notice.section,subdivision b d expressly provides that f or products,the upc number,sku number,model or design number or stock number or other more specific identification of products is not required.to the extent respondents argument may be understood to mean that the term cigar is too broad because some cigars contained warnings,the overbreadth does not make the notice so unclear as to invalidate it.
stores,sam club,circle k stores,and tosco argue the stipulated judgment is res judicata and bars the present litigation against them.the obvious problem with the argument is that the stipulated judgment was limited to the parties in that case.the judgment expressly provides this judgment,however,does not affect the people rights against any retailer or other person or entity not a party to this judgment,or concerning the sale of products other than tobacco products.the judgment included the following retail establishments,none of which are parties to this case albertson,alpha beta,lucky stores,raley,ralphs grocery,safeway stores,thrifty drug and discount stores,and vons grocery.
duty to warn 
stores,sam club,circle k stores,and tosco also argue they have no duty to warn of exposures beyond their control.the sole legal support they cite is section,which provides in pertinent part i n order to minimize the burden on retail sellers of consumer products including foods,regulations implementing section shall to the extent practicable place the obligation to provide any warning materials such as labels on the producer or packager rather than on the retail seller,except where the retail seller itself is responsible for introducing a chemical known to the state to cause cancer or reproductive toxicity into the consumer product in question,subd.f.the statute does not indicate that a retail defendant is always shielded from liability as these respondents argue.because these respondents provide no additional argument on this issue and this potential defense does not concern the adequacy of cag notice,we do not further consider it in the context of this appeal.
general requirements 
in addition to specific requirements for each violation,proposition notices must also satisfy general requirements codified in section.
identification of noticing individual and of alleged violator 
first,the notice must identify the noticing party,and the satisfaction of this requirement is not disputed.second,the notice must identify the violator and,with the exception of the circle k entities,this requirement is not disputed.
circle k stores,was erroneously sued as circle k,and circle citing no legal authority,it argues that the notice was insufficient because it was incorrectly named.circle k stores,appeared in this action,and filed a demurrer,which eventually resulted in a dismissal.in doing so,it forfeited the argument that the notice was not sufficient because the wrong entity was named.this is analogous to a defendant who has actual knowledge of an action and submits to the authority of the court.that defendant can not assert a violation in the service of summons,the purpose of which is to provide the defendant with knowledge of the lawsuit.fireman fund ins.sparks construction,th,d.an appearance for contesting personal jurisdiction is purely a dilatory plea,and when a defendant seeks to avail himself of it,he must stand upon his naked legal right and seek nothing further from the court than the enforcement of that right,quoting raps raps cal d.by seeking a dismissal on grounds other than personal jurisdiction,circle k stores,forfeited its right to contest the notice on the ground that it was improperly named.
identification of each chemical involved in the alleged violation 
the notices must identify the chemicals that are the subject of the violation,subd.b a.respondents point out that some of the notices identify smokeless tobacco and cigars,but do not differentiate the chemicals in each product.cag responds that the chemicals are the same,and neither side provides us with sufficient information to determine this issue.cag may proceed only with respect to those chemicals contained in the notice.to the extent they are the same,no need exists to list them twice.
identification of the approximate time period 
respondents more significant argument is that the time period does not adequately identify the approximate time period during which the violation is alleged to have occurred as required by section,subdivision b a.in the context of this lawsuit,the nondelineated time period is sufficient to describe the approximate time period.while every exposure without a reasonable warning is a separate wrong under the statute,it is impossible to precisely identify the time of each exposure.
this conclusion is similar to that reached by federal circuit courts applying the clean water act,which also requires notice before a citizen initiated lawsuit.in san francisco baykeeper,tosco cir,notice stating that the defendant was responsible for illegal discharges on each day when the wind has been sufficiently strong to blow coke from the piles into the slough was sufficient to identify the time period.id.at.the court reasoned that the language of the notice was sufficiently specific to inform the defendant of what it was doing wrong and to allow it to cure the violation.ibid.similarly,in public interest research group hercules,cir,the third circuit rejected an argument that the plaintiff alleging a violation of the clean water act must allege the date of each violation in the notice.while there is no doubt that such detailed information is helpful to the recipient of a notice letter in identifying the basis for the citizen suit,such specificity is not mandated by the regulation.the regulation does not require that the citizen identify every detail of a violation.id.at.by a parity of reasoning,section requires only the approximate time period.respondents do not require additional information to cure the violation.
attachment of information prepared by lead agency 
finally,the last relevant general requirement is contained in section,subdivision b,which provides each notice shall include as an attachment a copy of the safe drinking water and toxic enforcement act of proposition a summary this attachment need not be included in the copies of notices sent to public enforcement agencies.shilo management corporation points out that the notice served on it did not include a copy of the safe drinking water and toxic enforcement act of proposition a summary.cag was required to serve that attachment along with the notice,subd.b.its failure to follow this requirement renders the notice served on shilo management corporation invalid because the notice fails to satisfy a mandatory prerequisite to a citizen lawsuit.
iv.third set of notices on hotels 
as we explain,cag third set of notices,alleging occupational and environmental exposures,rectify the problems in its second set of notices and are valid.
environmental exposures 
with respect to environmental exposures,cag alleged that the violators are exposing the public to tobacco smoke without the required warning.the following people are exposed customers,room guests,and visitors in areas and rooms designated for smoking in the lobbies,hallways,and corridors that are adjacent or nearby or on the floors where rooms or areas designated for smoking where smoking has been permitted by the violators are geographically located at the location of the source of the exposure on the attached exhibit a.the persons exposed to the said chemicals at the said location s include,but are not limited to,the reasonably foreseeable persons corresponding to the following type of persons exposed at common characteristics of facilities or sources of exposure certain persons entering guest rooms designated for smoking areas designated for smoking,where smoking has been or is occurring by smokers certain persons entering or passing through lobbies,hallway,and corridors,where such areas are affected by smoke that permeates,migrates,and travels from nearby or adjacent areas and rooms designated for smoking boldface and italics omitted.cag stated that the route of exposure was through inhalation.
the notice adequately complies with section,subdivision f.it identifies the location of the source of exposure by providing a reasonably clear list of the locations in the hotels where exposure allegedly occurred.in the notice,cag sufficiently describes the route of exposure as follows the route of exposure for occupational exposures to the chemicals listed below,by the exposed employees described above,have been and are from tobacco smoke in the smoke designated and affected areas as describe d above through inhalation,meaning that tobacco smoke has been and is being breathed in via the ambient air by the exposed persons causing inhalation contact with their mouths,throats,bronchi,esophagi,and lungs.boldface and italics omitted.
occupational exposures 
with respect to occupational exposures,cag alleged for a period in locations specified in exhibit a the violators have been and are knowingly and intentionally exposing certain employees of the violators to tobacco smoke and its constituent chemicals as listed below and designated by the state of california to cause cancer and reproductive toxicity without first giving clear and reasonable warning of that fact to the exposed employee health safety code section.the source of exposure includes tobacco smoke and its constituent chemicals as listed below at the location of the source of the exposure on the attached exhibit t he exposure took place in the following areas in areas and rooms designated for smoking in the lobbies,hallways,and corridors that are adjacent or nearby or on the floors where rooms or areas designated for smoking are geographically located at the location of the source of the exposure on the attached exhibit boldface and italics omitted.the employees include those who have to enter rooms designated for smoking such as cleaning personnel,bell boys,room service,sic personnel,personnel and any employees,regardless of the employees occupation and job task who have been and are entering or passing through other designated for smoking including,but not limited to,outdoor entrances,outdoor corridors,other areas,where smoking is permitted by the violators,and where smoking has been and is occurring.italics omitted.
cag also included the following employees reasonably foreseeable employees who pass through or enter lobbies,hallways,and corridors that are nearby or adjacent to or on the floor where areas or rooms designated for smoking are located,and where such areas are affected by the tobacco smoke that originates from rooms and areas designated for smoking which permeates,migrates,and travels through the openings of doors and windows and through other structural openings of the designated for smoking into the said lobbies,hallways,and corridors.boldface and italics omitted.cag stated that the route of exposure was through inhalation.
respondents argue that the third set of notices provide no notice at all about occupational exposures because they contain no facts about specific violations related to specific employees and specific hotels such as would certainly be revealed in an investigation by cag of the facts underlying the notice.respondents argue that the third wave of notices specifically refers to a smaller list of exposed employees than the second wave of notices the limited categories of employees specifically identified is eviscerated by a much more generic listing of any employee,regardless of occupation,who pass through or enter lobbies,hallways and corridors that are located nearby or adjacent to or on the floor where areas or rooms designated for smoking are located.
while the broad language identified by respondents is not useful,it does not undermine the valid portions of cag notice as respondents argue.this notice complies with the requirement of section,subdivision e.it adequately states the general geographic location and the description of the occupation performed by the exposed persons.in this notice,cag sufficiently describes the route of exposure in the same manner as it described the route of exposure for environmental exposures.
notice on retail stores and gas stations 
most of the notices served on the retail establishments include only a consumer product exposure.however,a few notices also include environmental and occupational exposures.respondents argue that r ather than providing sufficient specificity about the nature of the exposures alleged at the locations,the notice simply parroted the statutory language and,like the notices to hotel defendants,set forth broad categories of potential exposures without any detail.
consumer product exposure 
the notice served on atlantic richfield arco and related entities provides,under the heading consumer product exposure over a period the violators have been and are knowingly and intentionally selling cigars and smokeless tobacco at the locations set forth in exhibit a and exposing consumers and the public to tobacco smoke and other chemicals designated by the state of california to cause cancer and reproductive toxicity without first giving clear and reasonable warning of that fact to such persons the sources of exposures are cigars and smokeless tobacco the sale,purchase,consumption and the reasonably foreseeable use of cigars and smokeless tobacco result in exposures through inhalation,absorption,ingestion,and dermal contact to the chemicals listed below.purchasers of the violators cigars lit them,smoked them,and inhaled the chemicals listed below while the purchasers of violator smokeless tobacco chewed them and absorbed the juices through the linings inside their mouths and stomachs.
the notice of consumer product exposure is sufficient to state a violation based on both cigars and smokeless tobacco.it sufficiently identifies the routes of exposure as inhalation for cigars and absorption in the mouth and stomach for smokeless tobacco.it also sufficiently identifies the consumer products as cigars and smokeless tobacco.and,although it does not distinguish the chemicals in cigars and smokeless tobacco,it identifies the chemicals alleged in the violations.section does not require any more.
not all of the notices cag served on the retail defendants cover both cigars and smokeless tobacco.for example,the notice served on circle k stores,covers only cigars.in the notice served on rite aid and related entities,cag attempts to assert a violation based on the sale of both cigars and smokeless tobacco.however,the only exposure specified is to tobacco smoke rendering the allegations with respect to smokeless tobacco unintelligible.to provide sufficient notice,cag must allege the specific product,the exposure,and the route of exposure,in a manner that makes the violation clear and understandable.
environmental exposures 
in the notice served on sam club,cag alleges the following environmental exposures while in the course of doing business,at the locations in the attached exhibit a from through,the violators have been and are knowingly and intentionally exposing their customers and the public to tobacco and tobacco smoke and other chemicals listed below and designated by the state of california to cause cancer and reproductive toxicity without first giving clear and reasonable warning of that fact to the exposed persons health safety code section.the locations of the exposures are where any third party is exposed to tobacco smoke arising from cigars and pipe tobacco sold by the violators.the route of exposure for consumer product exposures and environmental expo
