the principal issue in this writ proceeding is whether the trial court erred in granting real party in interest summary adjudication,terminating a cause of action brought under the unfair competition law ucl the cause of action asserts that a bank was responsible for false and misleading advertising in promoting a credit program as when it was not.the trial court granted summary adjudication because it concluded this cause of action was not suitable as a representative action.the court reasoned that since there were many separate advertisements for the program in question,which was marketed in california through hundreds of merchants,it would have to hear evidence about thousands of transactions in order to rule on the merits.
petitioner and amicus curiae,the attorney general of california,argue that no such individualized inquiry is required in order to find a violation of section.we agree with this position,and conclude that the trial court abused its discretion in ruling that the action should not be brought as a representative action under the ucl.for this and other reasons,which we shall discuss,we grant the petition for writ of mandate.
factual and procedural summary 
petitioner robert prata claims that a credit card financing plan marketed and advertised by real party in interest bank one,na bank one,which promised financing for consumer purchases,violates the ucl.in october,petitioner purchased stereo equipment,with installation,from a retail store in los angeles county.the store representative told him about a special promotion offered by bank one.this program was described as one in which the borrower was required to make no payments for based on an ad in the store and statements of the store representative,petitioner bought the equipment on the credit plan and applied for a credit card offered by bank one.petitioner understood that he would incur no finance charges or interest if he paid the full amount of the purchase before the end of the day period.he did not receive any documents describing the details of the plan at the time of purchase,or later in the mail.
in fact,the program required two monthly payments during the period.if either payment was not made by the time and in the amount required,interest was charged from that point forward,and a fee was imposed.if both payments were made in full at the times specified,and the full debt was discharged by the end of the days,there were no charges except that bank one had the use of the money received in the two periodic payments.in the ad seen by petitioner,and in at least two others,the borrower was directed to ask for details.the detailed provisions of the fine in program documents given or available to the borrower.
it is undisputed that bank one advertised its program in california,using different advertisements.it also is undisputed that three of these advertisements including the one seen by petitioner did not advise the consumer that minimum monthly payments would be required.instead,these three advertisements offered various terms,or months on a basis and stated that the consumer should ask for details.the ad seen by petitioner stated instant credit for our preferred customers days same as cash ask for details today 
petitioner paid the full purchase price within days.despite this,bank one billed him for interest and fees because he had not made the two minimum monthly payments during the period.petitioner disputed these charges and bank one reported him to third party collection agencies.
petitioner filed his original complaint in june.the second amended complaint,the charging pleading,is brought under section on behalf of petitioner and all other consumers similarly situated within the general public.petitioner alleges causes of action for fraud,breach of contract,breach of the implied covenant of good faith and fair dealing,violation of the ucl,and defamation.
bank one moved for summary adjudication of issues on the fourth cause of action,which is based on the ucl.it argued that petitioner was an inadequate representative to bring a representative action under the ucl because his experience with the program was not typical,and because individual issues of proof predominated on the claim for restitution.petitioner opposed the motion,arguing that he was a proper plaintiff in a representative action under the ucl.
a sales guide provided to some california merchants who offered the program was inconsistent on the subject of minimum monthly payments the guide had a section on answering common questions likely to be posed by consumers considering the program.one example given reads customer how does the program work response you are not required to make the minimum monthly payments for the first two months and if you pay off your purchase by the due date shown on your third statement after your purchase,you will not have to pay any interest.
bank one responds that other pages in the same sales guide discuss low monthly payments under the program and provide a table for calculating minimum monthly payments.bank one cites the sales guide,which states plan monthly payments,interest deferred.no finance charge for term selected if balance paid during the deferred period.payments or,whichever is greater.but this paragraph is preceded by another which describes plan.no monthly payment,interest deferred.interest accrues from date of transaction,if balance is not paid during deferred period.
while these may have been separate credit programs,the language of the manual is,at best,inconsistent,confusing,and potentially misleading.thus patrick kelly,who had been a manager in the cardholder operations division for bank one,submitted a declaration in support of the summary adjudication motion in which he said this question should have read how does the no payment deferred interest program work the fact that it stated same as cash instead of no payment deferred interest was a mistake.bank one did not intend to mislead merchants or consumers about the terms of the same as cash finance plan.kelly added that he had not heard from any merchant who was misled or confused about whether the plan required monthly minimum payments.
in its ruling granting summary adjudication the trial court said in the case at bench,plaintiff is seeking to bring a representative action against defendant for unfair competition pursuant to business and professions code section et based upon its use and implementation of the same as cash plan.the evidence further discloses that defendant uses nineteen separate advertisements for the same as cash plan in this state and uses many merchants throughout this state.however,plaintiff alleges he was the victim of a misrepresentation based upon a specific advertisement and false statements made to him by an employee of the store where he purchased stereo equipment.the false statements are an integral part of the contention in the complaint and would require this court to hear evidence about different merchants in different locales under different advertisements.in kraus trinity management services,supra,cal th,d,the court stated that a action is an action in equity and the trial court may decline to hear a representative action if the plaintiff is not a proper plaintiff.here,the court would have to hear evidence about hundreds of transactions before it could issue a ruling.this is hardly the speedy procedure envisioned by the legislature.the motion for summary adjudication as to the cause of action is granted.
petitioner sought a writ of mandate from this court.we issued an alternative writ.the attorney general has filed a brief as amicus curiae,as authorized by section.in it he supports writ relief by this court.bank one has filed a responding letter brief.
discussion 
the first issue is the appropriate standard of review.petitioner and bank one each argue that we must review the trial court ruling for abuse of discretion.amicus argues the proper standard is de novo review.
amicus is correct that the general rule for review of a ruling on a motion for summary judgment or summary adjudication is de novo review.buss superior court cal th,d.but in the limited and exceptional circumstances where a trial court is required to exercise its discretion in passing on a code of civil procedure section motion for summary judgment,and grants or denies such a motion on the basis of its equitable determination of a question as to which the exercise of judicial discretion is proper,the standard of review on appeal necessarily is whether the trial court decision amounted to an abuse of discretion.citations.centennial ins.united states fire ins.th,d krieger nick alexander imports,d,fn.
the claim that the ucl cause of action is not a proper representative action under that statute calls for an equitable determination,for which exercise of judicial discretion is proper.b ecause a ucl action is one in equity,in any case in which a defendant can demonstrate a potential for harm or show that the action is not one brought by a competent plaintiff for the benefit of injured parties,the court may decline to entertain the action as a representative suit.citation.kraus trinity management services,supra,cal th,d.
a trial court abuses its discretion when it applies the wrong legal standards applicable to the issue at hand.citations.paterno state of california th,d.adams aerojet general th,d.we therefore review the ruling under the abuse of discretion standard.
the ucl was recently and thoroughly reviewed by our supreme court in bank of the west superior court,supra,cal th,d.the court began its review with the language of section,which defines unfair competition to include any unlawful,unfair or fraudulent business act or practice and unfair,deceptive,untrue or misleading advertising and any act prohibited by chapter commencing with section of part of division of the business and professions code.
the court explained the legislature intended this sweeping language to include anything that can properly be called a business practice and that at the same time is forbidden by law.citation.in drafting the act,the legislature deliberately traded the attributes of tort law for speed and administrative simplicity.as a result,to state a claim under the act one need not plead and prove the elements of a tort.instead,one need only show that members of the public are likely to be deceived.chern bank of america cal d,see also committee on children television general foods cal d.bank of the west superior court,supra,cal th at,d,italics added.
the court next examined remedies available under the ucl.section,which incorporates the broad,statutory definition of unfair competition,permits any court of competent jurisdiction to enjoin a ny person performing or proposing to perform an act of unfair competition.the section also authorizes courts to make such orders as may be necessary to restore to any person in interest any money or property,real or personal,which may have been acquired by means of such unfair competition.citation.the purpose of such orders is to deter future violations of the unfair trade practice statute and to foreclose retention by the violator of its gains.fletcher security pacific national bank cal d,interpreting the nearly identical language of section see also people superior court jayhill cal d,fn.the legislature considered this purpose so important that it authorized courts to order restitution without individualized proof of deception,reliance and injury if necessary to prevent the use or employment of an unfair practice.committee on children television general foods,supra,cal d at,see also fletcher security pacific national bank,supra,cal d at.bank of the west superior court,supra,cal th at,d,italics added.
section is not confined to anticompetitive business practices,but is also directed toward the public right to protection from fraud,deceit,and unlawful conduct.citation.thus,california courts have consistently interpreted the language of section broadly.citation.the statute imposes strict liability.it is not necessary to show that the defendant intended to injure anyone.hewlett squaw valley ski th,d,citing state farm fire casualty superior court th,d.south bay chevrolet general motors acceptance,supra,th,d.because section definition is disjunctive,the statute is violated where a defendant act or practice is unlawful,unfair,fraudulent or in violation of section.state farm fire casualty superior court,supra,th at,d.id.at,d.
by their breadth,sections and encompass not only those advertisements which have deceived or misled because they are untrue,but also those which may be accurate on some level,but will nonetheless tend to mislead or deceive a perfectly true statement couched in such a manner that it is likely to mislead or deceive the consumer,such as by failure to disclose other relevant information,is actionable under these sections.day v.at t th,d.
under section,an action under the ucl may be brought by any person acting for the interests of itself or the general public.bank one and the trial court rely on language in kraus trinity management services,supra,cal th,d,reiterating the authority of the trial court to decide that a particular case is not a proper representative action under the ucl.b ecause a ucl action is one in equity,in any case in which a defendant can demonstrate a potential for harm or show that the action is not one brought by a competent plaintiff for the benefit of injured parties,the court may decline to entertain the action as a representative suit.citation.id.at,d.with this background,we turn to the arguments of the parties.
petitioner argues first that summary adjudication on the fourth cause of action for violation of the ucl was improper because the trial court focused its ruling entirely on the restitution theory of recovery,and ignored the claim for injunctive relief.in fact,petitioner also sought injunctive relief authorized by the ucl.
the trial court statement did not explicitly address the injunctive remedy.but it focused on proof of liability,which affects both restitution and injunctive relief.as we have discussed,the trial court stated that a action is one in equity,that it could decline to hear a representative action if the plaintiff is not a proper plaintiff,and that in this case it would have to hear evidence about hundreds of transactions before it could issue a ruling.
thus,the trial court ruled that it would not allow the representative action to go forward,either for the remedy of restitution or injunctive relief.petitioner claim that the court ignored the claim for injunctive relief is not supported by the record.
petitioner also argues that since he sought relief in his own right under the ucl cause of action,the trial court could not properly award summary adjudication for the entire fourth cause of action.we agree.section provides that the court may make such orders or judgments as may be necessary to restore to any person in interest any money or property,real or personal,which may have been acquired by means of such unfair competition.in addition,individuals are expressly granted a right of action under section of the ucl actions for any relief pursuant to this chapter shall be prosecuted exclusively in a court of competent jurisdiction by any person acting for the interests of itself,its members or the general public.the term person is defined in section to include natural persons 
thus,petitioner had a right to seek restitution of the finance and interest charges if any were incurred by him.but the record reflects that he refused to pay these charges.therefore,he is not entitled to individual restitution.damages are not available under the ucl.bank of the west superior court,supra,cal th at,d.nevertheless,under sections and,he was entitled to pursue a claim for injunctive relief for a violation of the ucl.
in its return to the petition for writ of mandate,bank one argues that the issue of injunctive relief is moot because it transferred its finance plan to a third party,ge capital consumer credit card company,in december,and is no longer servicing its former accounts.this argument was not raised in the trial court,and,of course,was not ruled upon by that court.it may not properly be raised for the first time here.
we conclude that on the record presented,and independent of the representative action issue,the trial court erred in granting summary adjudication on the entire fourth cause of action for violation of the ucl because petitioner still had an individual cause of action.we now turn to the merits of its ruling on the representative action.
resolution of the representative action issue is complicated by a wide variance in the parties characterization of the nature of the ucl claim.petitioner argues the program itself was a violation of the ucl,regardless of any particular advertisement or document from bank one.he argues the trial court erred because individual issues as to liability and remedy do not predominate.instead,the single common denominator involved in all of the deceptive practices in bank one advertisements was it lured customers into its financing plan by promising them and then bank one treated the financing different than cash during this period.that is the core misleading and deceptive nature of the program.all of the advertisements set forth by bank one state that the financing is.bank one has admitted that it always intended to require monthly payments during the first day period.in some cases bank one buried the phrase monthly payments required in small print.in other cases it simply did not mention anything about monthly payments.the common factor is that bank one promised one thing,the bait,and then assessed finance charges and late fees for failing to make monthly payments during the day period the switch,even when the accountholder paid the full amount of the qualifying purchase within.
petitioner argues there are two ways in which the program is likely to deceive,and so constitute a violation of section.the first is that bank one documents including advertisements,training manuals,billing statements,disclosure statements,and credit card agreements are inconsistent and confusing about whether minimum monthly payments are required during the period.the second is that if minimum monthly payments are required,the promotions are likely to deceive consumers.that is so,he argues,because requiring consumers to make minimum payments before the end of the promotional period is not the same as paying cash.as petitioner explains,every time bank one requires a monthly payment,or assesses finance charges or late fees for failing to make monthly payments,it is no longer treating the financing as its advertisements state.
the approach of amicus is similar.but it focuses on the advertisement which petitioner saw in the store.this advertisement was one of three used in california by bank one which said nothing about the requirement of minimum monthly payments.instead,it directed the consumer to ask for details today amicus argues t his statement has the capacity to mislead members of the public into believing that payment in days is the same as payment in cash today,and thus,no financing charges would be imposed within the interval.the phrase same as cash explicitly represents that bank one financial plan is something entirely different than what it actually revolving credit account requiring minimum monthly payments.if a consumer waits days to make full payment,the consumer incurs finance charges.the only way to avoid finance charges during the period is to make certain minimum monthly payments during that interval.every time bank one requires a monthly payment or assesses interest or late charges,the finance plan can no longer be considered same as cash.the bank one plan,as evidenced by prata,simply does not enable a consumer to defer payment for days and have that deferred payment be treated the same as a cash payment at the outset of the transaction.
bank one focuses on petitioner particular transaction.it points out that according to the complaint,petitioner relied on a single advertisement in a single store,and on a representation of a single employee of the merchant,and on his failure to receive any of the disclosures or agreements which were to be given to consumers participating in the credit program.according to bank one,in order to determine whether there is a violation of the ucl,the trial court would have to examine each advertisement were used in california each consumer transaction consumers and determine whether the consumer received the program agreement and disclosures.the trial court agreed with this characterization of the action,and based its summary adjudication on the resulting conclusion that individual issues predominated over common issues,rendering a representative action inappropriate.
bank one cites several cases to support its argument that the trial court properly exercised its discretion in refusing to allow petitioner to proceed on the basis of a representative action.the first is bronco wine frank logoluso farms d.in that case,a grape grower sued a winery operator for breach of contract and violation of the ucl,based on payments made by the winery for the grape crop.the trial court found for the grower on both causes of action.it awarded restitution to the grower under section.it also awarded restitution to nonparty growers.the court of appeal reversed the restitution award to the nonparty growers.only one nonparty grower had testified at trial,and the contracts of only growers were introduced into evidence.the situation was complicated by the winery efforts during and after trial to obtain releases from a number of the nonparty growers.the court of appeal concluded that there were serious fundamental due process problems in rendering a judgment in favor of a nonparty in the section case before it and reversed the judgment in favor of the nonparty growers.id.at.
the supreme court recently addressed these due process concerns in kraus trinity management services,supra cal th.the holding in kraus is that disgorgement to a fluid recovery fund is not permitted under the ucl.the court observed that allowing fluid recovery in representative ucl actions might implicate the due process concerns raised by defendants in that case,and noted by the court of appeal in bronco wine frank logoluso farms,supra,d at page.but it found no due process problem in a representative action seeking restitution under the ucl.instead,the court suggested procedures to be implemented by the trial court to ensure restitution of any gains by a defendant who has violated the ucl.
the kraus court held the judgment of the trial court for disgorgement of sums collected to secure liquidated damages may be enforced only to the extent that it compels restitution to those former tenants who timely appear to collect restitution.this does not mean,as the dissent asserts,that defendants may retain the funds improperly taken from their former tenants as liquidated damages.on remand the trial court should order defendants to identify,locate,and repay to each former tenant charged liquidated damages the full amount of funds improperly acquired from that tenant,retaining the power to supervise defendants efforts,to ensure that all reasonable means are used to comply with the court directives.kraus trinity management services,supra,cal th at,d.
in footnote,the supreme court described the claim procedure to be used for a representative action under the ucl because an order to disgorge into a fluid recovery fund is not authorized in such representative ucl actions,the trial court may order the defendant to notify the absent persons on whose behalf the action is prosecuted of their right to make a claim for restitution,establish a reasonable time within which such claims must be made to the defendant,and retain jurisdiction to adjudicate any disputes over entitlement to and the amount of restitution to be paid.kraus trinity management services,supra,cal th at,fn,d,italics added.
we are confident that the procedures suggested by the supreme court in kraus will obviate the due process concerns raised by the court in bronco wine frank logoluso farms,supra,d at page.and cited by bank one here.
bank one also cites south bay chevrolet general motors acceptance,supra,th,d as a case in which a representative action under the ucl was rejected because the claims were not sufficiently uniform.general motors accepta
