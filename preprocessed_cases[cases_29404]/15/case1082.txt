introduction 
this appeal arises out of appellant challenge to allegedly deceptive television commercials supporting the launch of aleve,a pain relief product developed,manufactured and marketed by respondents.zion lavie appeals from the judgment against him and in favor of procter gamble procter gamble,syntex health products,syntex,health products company,and others following a court trial upon appellant action challenging television advertising supporting the launch of pain reliever aleve in the.among other claims,appellant alleged the television advertising promoting aleve violated the california unfair competition law bus,ucl and this state false advertising law bus,because the explicit claim of the ads that aleve is gentler to the stomach lining than aspirin was false likely to mislead members of the public and because the advertisements contained an implicit and false message that aleve was gentle to the stomach and would not cause stomach upset.at the end of a bench trial,the trial court found in favor of respondents on all counts,including finding that respondents did not engage in unlawful,unfair or fraudulent business practices or unfair,deceptive or misleading advertising within the meaning of section or.the court found the substantial weight of the evidence supported the conclusion that the phrase aleve is gentler to your stomach lining than aspirin was a true statement and that the challenged ads were not likely to deceive reasonable consumers.the court also found that the ads did not target particularly gullible consumers and that the evidence did not show that a substantial number of consumers were deceived into thinking aleve would not cause gastrointestinal side effects.
appellant contends the judgment must be reversed as the court erred in employing the wrong methodology in determining what messages were conveyed by the commercial,relying upon its own intuition rather than viewing the ads from the vantage point of a reasonable consumer by disregarding evidence showing the messages were misleading and unsupported by the medical data and by disregarding evidence that these messages were impressed upon a significant number of consumers and were therefore likely to deceive the public.appellant also contends that the evidence established defendants conscious decision to communicate implied messages they knew would mislead many california consumers,and that such was an unfair business practice under section.finally,he argues that if the matter is reversed,the trial court on remand has discretion to enter restitution relief.
the attorney general has filed an amicus curiae brief in this appeal,contending the likelihood of deception under the ucl must be measured by the standard of the least sophisticated consumer and that the trial court erred in using a reasonable consumer standard to determine whether the advertisements were likely to deceive the public.
we shall affirm the judgment.

ii.reasonable consumer versus least sophisticated consumer standard.
amicus brief raising issue of the standard.
in an amicus brief filed in this appeal,the attorney general argues that the trial court committed reversible error in failing to use a least sophisticated consumer standard rather than a reasonable consumer standard to determine whether the advertisements were likely to mislead or deceive the public.it is analytically necessary to address this issue first,for if we agreed with the attorney general,the additional issues raised on this appeal likely would be rendered moot.
both parties and the trial court agreed below that the reasonable consumer standard applied and appellant did not raise this claim of error on appeal.ordinarily,a micus curiae must take the case as they find it.california for safety education brown th,d accord eisenberg et,cal.prac.guide civil appeals writs the rutter group.a n appellate court will consider only those questions properly raised by the appealing parties.amicus curiae must accept the issues made and propositions urged by the appealing parties,and any additional questions presented in a brief filed by an amicus curiae will not be considered citations.younger state of california d.see fisher city of berkeley cal d,fn,conc.opn.of bird,white,city of huntington beach cal d.
however,the rule is not absolute.an appellate court has discretion to consider new issues raised by an amicus.see fisher city of berkeley,supra,cal d,supreme court considered argument for invalidating rent control ordinance raised by amicus white,city of huntington beach,supra,cal d,eisenberg et,cal.prac.guide civil appeals writs,supra.although we do not depart lightly from the general rule,we are persuaded that this case is one in which it is not only permissible,but also appropriate to do so.the supreme court has justified consideration of a new issue on appeal for the first time when the issue posed is purely a question of law based on undisputed facts,and involves important questions of public policy.citations.fisher city of berkeley,supra,at,fn.
the standard to be used in evaluating whether an advertisement is deceptive under the ucl is purely a question of law and certainly has important public policy implications for california consumers and businesses.moreover,the attorney general has a particular interest in the interpretation of sections and,as these sections are the basic tools of the attorney general and the district attorneys in combating consumer fraud.people superior court olson d,fn.see also,manufacturers life ins.superior court cal th,fn,d.the attorney general and district attorneys have an independent role in the enforcement of this state false advertising laws.they are authorized to prosecute violations of the ucl criminally see and may also seek redress through the bringing of civil law enforcement cases seeking equitable relief and civil penalties beyond those available to private parties see.the possibility that a published decision could contain a misstatement of law as to a fundamental provision of these statutes is a cause of particular concern to the attorney general.the legislature has recognized the importance of amicus participation by the attorney general in these appeals by requiring that the attorney general and the district attorney of the county in which the proceeding occurred receive notice and copies of the briefs in any appeal in which sections and are at issue,california rules of court,rule e.
finally,the question of the standard to be applied in determining whether the advertisements here violated the ucl is inherent in this case.if,as the attorney general argues,the parties and the trial court applied an erroneous standard,a rule of decision relying upon that incorrect standard could have profound precedential impact on the operation and enforcement of the ucl.for all of these reasons,we exercise our discretion to consider the question raised by the attorney general 
reasonable consumer or least sophisticated consumer.
the attorney general contends that the trial court must apply a least sophisticated consumer standard in determining whether an advertisement was likely to mislead the public.in a lengthy discussion of the origins of the ucl,he argues that california deceptive advertising law has always prohibited advertising that has the capacity or tendency to mislead members of the public,including the unwary,unsophisticated,and the gullible.asserting that an advertisement violates the law if it is false or if it has the capacity to mislead unwary,unsophisticated or the most gullible consumers,the attorney general maintains,the trial court failure to apply the least sophisticated consumer standard as the measure of deception and the court imposition of responsibility on consumers to investigate the merits of advertising claims were error.
we disagree.california and federal courts applying the ucl have never applied a least sophisticated consumer standard,absent evidence that the ad targeted particularly vulnerable customers.rather,they have consistently applied a standard closer to an ordinary or reasonable consumer standard to evaluate unfair advertising claims.nor do we view the court application of the reasonable consumer standard as requiring consumers to investigate the merits of advertising claims.
as a necessary corollary to his argument,the attorney general urges that we reject freeman time,cir freeman and haskell time.haskell,as well as other federal decisions which have concluded that california employs the reasonable person or reasonable consumer standard in evaluating deceptive advertising.in freeman,the ninth circuit agreed with the district court in haskell that the reasonable consumer standard was the appropriate test for a violation of the ucl.recognizing that to state a claim under the ucl one need only show that members of the public are likely to be deceived bank of the west superior court,supra,cal th.at,d,quoting chern bank of america cal d,freeman rejected the contention that to so demonstrate,the plaintiff need show only that some members of the public,such as the elderly,minors or the mentally disadvantaged are likely to be deceived.id.at.rather,the court adopted the reasonable person standard championed in haskell and variants thereof applied in other cases,also citing state bd.of funeral directors mortuary in westminster memorial park d.what a person of ordinary intelligence would imply from ads in a false advertising case audio fidelity,high fidelity recordings,cir,applying the eye of the ordinary purchaser standard to interpretation of california unfair competition and misleading advertising law with respect to a similarly designed package claim.freeman reasoned that the ordinary person standard was consistent with the standard articulated in bank of the west superior court,members of the public are likely to be deceived.freeman,supra,at.
both freeman and haskell pointed out that the reasonable person standard was the common standard in the law in a number of contexts involving claims of deception and that it is the standard the federal trade commission ftc uses in interpreting section of the federal trade commission act a,which contains similar provisions.
as haskell observed,t he reasonable person standard is well ensconced in the law in a variety of legal contexts in which a claim of deception is brought.it is the standard for false advertising and unfair competition under the lanham act,citations for securities fraud citation,for deceit and misrepresentation citations and for common law unfair competition citation.this list no doubt could be much expanded.section of the business and professions code,on which plaintiff proceeds,in no way expressly departs from the reasonable person standard so well rooted in the law indeed,by explicitly imposing a reasonable care standard on advertisers,impliedly adopts such a standard for consumers as well unless particularly gullible consumers are targeted,a reasonable person may expect others to behave reasonably well.citation.id.at accord freeman,supra,at.
haskell also relied upon the ftc interpretation of the federal trade commission act because of the relationship between the ucl and the federal act.t he unfair business practices act is one of the little ftc acts of the,enacted by many states in the wake of amendments to the federal trade commission act enlarging the commission regulatory jurisdiction to include unfair business practices that harmed,not merely the interests of business competitors,but of the general public as well.rubin green cal th,d,see bank of the west superior court,supra,cal th,d,because of this relationship between the ucl and the federal trade commission act,judicial interpretations of the federal act have persuasive force.citations.since the ftc has interpreted deception in section of the federal trade commission act to require a showing of potential deception of consumers acting reasonably in the circumstances,not just any consumers.southwest sunsites,cir relying on in the matter of cliffdale associates,cch trade.haskell,supra,at.
we agree with the haskell court that a reasonable consumer may be unwary or trusting.where advertising is aimed at a particularly susceptible audience,such as the preschool children targeted by the advertisements in committee on children television,general foods,supra,cal d,its truthfulness must be measured by the impact it will likely have on members of that group,not others to whom it was not primarily directed.see id.at,in the matter of kirchner ftc lexis.we also recognize that an advertisement may be designed to appeal to specific groups of consumers,although it is ostensibly directed to the public at large.where the plaintiff contends that a more vulnerable subgroup is the true target of such an advertisement,a question of fact is presented,which the trial court must resolve.
however,unless the advertisement targets a particular disadvantaged or vulnerable group,it is judged by the effect it would have on a reasonable consumer.haskell,supra,at.as noted by the ftc many years ago perhaps a few misguided souls believe,for example,that all danish pastry is made in denmark.is it,therefore,an actionable deception to advertise danish pastry when it is made in this country of course not.a representation does not become false and deceptive merely because it will be unreasonably misunderstood by an insignificant and unrepresentative segment of the class of persons to whom the representation is addressed.in the matter of kirchner,supra.
federal courts have followed freeman and haskell in adopting the reasonable consumer standard for california ucl claims see southwest sunsites,supra,churchill village,general d,a reasonable consumer standard applies to a false advertising claim under the ucl.cairns franklin mint d,to state a claim under and et,one need only show that members of the public are likely to be deceived.citation.a claim based on false or misleading advertising and unfair business practices must be evaluated from the vantage of a reasonable consumer.citation.
the attorney general contends the ftc reinterpretation of the federal trade commission act should not affect what the attorney general characterizes as the traditional interpretation of the ucl by california courts.we disagree.ftc interpretation of the federal act has always been viewed as more than ordinarily persuasive,communications,los angeles cellular telephone,supra,cal th at,d,bank of the west superior court,supra,cal th at,d,in its construction of the breadth of the protection afforded consumers under the ucl and we see no good reason to depart from that view here.more importantly,we believe that california case law has never embraced a least sophisticated consumer test to determine whether a ucl violation has occurred.
the california supreme court recognized the reasonable consumer standard in quelimane stewart title guaranty cal th,d.there,prospective sellers of real property sued a title insurer who refused to issue title insurance policies on property acquired by plaintiffs at a tax sale,despite the company representation that title insurance would be issued on any property with good title.the supreme court held,among other things,that the plaintiffs had stated a cause of action for unfair competition under the ucl.if plaintiffs are able to establish that a tax deed is good title within the understanding of a reasonable consumer,the advertisement may be conduct prohibited as unfair competition under the section definition as deceptive,untrue or misleading advertising.id.at,d,italics added.
other california cases,while not specifically referring to the reasonableness of the consumer,acknowledge that the standard to be applied in assessing whether the conduct or advertisement violates the ucl is whether it is likely to deceive the consumer.barquis merchants collection,supra,cal d,schnall hertz th,d aicco ins.of north america th,d state farm fire casualty superior court,supra,th,d,disapproved on other grounds in communications,los angeles cellular telephone,supra,cal th at,d,chern bank of america,supra,cal d,day v.at t,supra,th,d.likely to deceive implies more than a mere possibility that the advertisement might conceivably be misunderstood by some few consumers viewing it in an unreasonable manner.rather,the phrase indicates that the ad is such that it is probable that a significant portion of the general consuming public or of targeted consumers,acting reasonably in the circumstances,could be misled.
as haskell noted,the statement in some of the case law to the effect that protects unwary consumers is only descriptive of the effect of and does not set the standard for liability.the reasonable consumer may well be unwary.the use of this language does not suggest that the act protects the unwary,unreasonable consumer.nor do statements that the act protects the public as a whole suggest a different standard from the average or reasonable member of the public.see sunset house distrib.coffee dan,d,the public as a whole,acting as reasonable persons.id.at,fn.
none of the cases cited by the attorney general arising under the ucl or its analog,the federal trade commission act,holds that the unreasonable expectations or perceptions of the least sophisticated consumer or most gullible consumer would be protected.rather,most of the cases cited by the attorney general stand for the proposition that whether an advertisement or business practice violates the ucl is not measured by the perception of the most sophisticated,wary,or expert consumer,but by the likely effect on the normally credulous consumer.the attorney general error is his equating of the rejection of a standard requiring heightened consumer vigilance with the adoption of a least sophisticated consumer standard.the two clearly are not the same.
donaldson read magazine,which did not arise under the federal trade commission act,but which is extensively quoted and relied upon by the attorney general,involved a challenge to an order by the united states postmaster finding plaintiffs had used the mail to further a fraudulent scheme and directing that mail be returned to the senders marked fraudulent,and that postal money order sums be returned.the supreme court articulated a standard more like the reasonable consumer standard than the least sophisticated consumer standard posited by the attorney general,as the court explained that an advertisement may be literally true,but nonetheless misleading to the ordinary reader advertisements as a whole may be completely misleading although every sentence separately considered is literally true.this may be because things are omitted that should be said,or because advertisements are composed or purposefully printed in such way as to mislead.citations.that exceptionally acute and sophisticated readers might have been able by penetrating analysis to have deciphered the true nature of the contest terms is not sufficient to bar findings of fraud by a factfinding tribunal.questions of fraud may be determined in the light of the effect advertisements would most probably produce on ordinary minds.citations.people have a right to assume that fraudulent advertising traps will not be laid to ensnare them.laws are made to protect the trusting as well as the suspicious.id.at,italics added see also,federal trade commission standard education soc.the fact that a false statement may be obviously false to those who are trained and experienced does not change its character,nor take away its power to deceive others less experienced.there is no duty resting upon a citizen to suspect the honesty of those with whom he transacts business.laws are made to protect the trusting as well as the suspicious t he rule of caveat emptor should not be relied upon to reward fraud and deception.
we agree that a reasonable consumer need not be exceptionally acute and sophisticated.id.at.nor need a reasonable consumer necessarily be wary or suspicious of advertising claims.
nor is it the case,as suggested by the attorney general,that california appellate cases predating cliffdale associates,particularly people wahl,d supp.and of agriculture tide oil d,recognized the least sophisticated consumer standard.rather,california courts consistently have looked to the ordinary consumer within the target population.
as stated in people wahl,supra,d supp,the advertisement,although literally true,was nevertheless deceptive and misleading in its implications and this is sufficient to bring it under the ban of the statute the fact that a firestone dealer,or other person who knew the whole truth,would not be led astray by it does not make it lawful.none of the advertising described in the statute,even though utterly false,could harm one who knew the truth,but such laws are passed to protect the general public who read advertisements and are likely to know nothing of the facts,not the dealers who publish them or other experts on their.id.at.
in of agriculture tide oil,supra,d,the appellate court acknowledged that advertising signs which stated,we give cent a gal.cash disc.coupon,or variations of similar phraseology came within the scope of former section,subdivisions b and c prohibiting certain advertising practices by service stations,as the signs could be read to refer to a designated numerical discount per gallon in cash.id.at.while a sophisticated buyer may not attribute such meaning to the advertisement,it is within the regulatory ambit of the legislature to protect the more gullible public.id.at,fn.omitted.the attorney general erroneously construes this sentence to mean that the legislature intended to protect members of the public more gullible than ordinary members of the public.we think the sentence merely embodies the idea that the general public is more gullible than the sophisticated buyer.this interpretation is confirmed by an accompanying footnote,in which the court quoted from the holding in donaldso
