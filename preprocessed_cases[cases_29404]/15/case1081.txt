factual background 
appellant filed her first amended complaint after the trial court sustained a demurrer filed by albertson to the original complaint.as amended,the complaint alleges appellant is an individual citizen and resident of the city of alameda,county of alameda,state of california.ires is the owner of the bridgeside shopping center in alameda,california.in,ires leased to albertson predecessor the larger one of the two major anchor stores in the shopping center,which was specially fitted for the sale of grocery and sundry items by a larger retailer of such items.albertson now holds the leasehold interest under a lease that currently runs through the year,including extension options.
in february,albertson opened a large retail facility at fruitvale station shopping center in oakland.the first amended complaint alleges that albertson determined that this facility should service an area including the same area formerly serviced by its store at bridgeside shopping center and therefore determined to indefinitely warehouse,hold but make no beneficial use of,the leasehold space it formerly used for its facility at the bridgeside shopping center in alameda,in order to continue to hold the legal right of possession for such leasehold for the purpose of preventing any competitor from using such space to compete in the retail sale of groceries.ires has permitted albertson to pursue this business strategy of maintaining the leasehold premises in a permanent state of closure and darkness,vacant and empty,devoid of commercial activity,usefulness,use or purpose,and decaying,deteriorated and blighted,which condition has existed from february,and threatens to continue unchanged for over years into the future.
the first amended complaint alleges that t he maintenance of said leasehold in a permanent state of closure is an unfair business practice by which albertson and ires thwart any effort by competitors of albertson to make any beneficial use of the leasehold premises.the withdrawal of the largest anchor building in a multiple user small commercial center serving a small community creates commercial and residential deterioration and blight,eliminating the economic viability of most of the shopping center space for most users,depressing land values in the vicinity,creating an attractive nuisance,creating visual and unaesthetic decay,reducing and eliminating consumer shopping choices,depriving the local municipality of sales tax revenues,strangling other small retail businesses in the same shopping center and unfairly restraining market competitors and economic competition based on price,service and quality.
appellant seeks an injunction restraining albertson and ires from continuing to withhold the said leasehold space from normal and beneficial economic activity and enjoining and directing defendants actively to market such leasehold for assignment or subletting to business competitors or others,without regard for market competition to defendants albertson.
