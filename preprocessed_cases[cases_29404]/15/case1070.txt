background 
under the rule,which is so often forgotten in the enthusiasm of advocacy,we look to the evidence accepted by the.findleton taylor d.see mchugh cal.
plaintiffs lived in a mobile home park in french gulch,shasta county,and in april they received unlawful detainer summonses they wanted to fight.none had the means to hire a lawyer and they tried to obtain free legal help.
the judicial council form summons for unlawful detainer actions states the recipient has five days to file a response and if you do not know an attorney,you may call an attorney referral service or a legal aid office listed in the phone book.
the judicial council information sheet on waiver of court costs states if you have any questions and can not afford an attorney,you may wish to consult the legal aid office,legal services office,or lawyer referral service in your county listed in the yellow pages under attorneys.
brockey who lived with gayler looked in his local telephone directory under legal aid as instructed on the judicial council form and found a local number which he called.that number was forwarded to moore modesto business.jay told brockey he had to wire money,which gayler did because she was able to drive to town to arrange the wire and faxes.brockey did not tell jay which boxes to check,that he wanted each party to bear its own fees,or that he wanted to raise an affirmative defense by talking to the judge at the time of trial.gayler thought they had contacted a law office that offered services to low income people,maybe on a sliding scale of some sort.she called the number on the instructions to clarify them and moore read the directions to her,rudely ignoring her inquiries.when they filed the papers,the court clerk directed them to the local legal services of northern california lsnc office.
plaintiff pavloff called information to get the number for free legal aid services,which he had used before,and was given moore number by the operator.he was told to wire,which he did.he did not tell jay how to fill out the forms.when he received them he was still unsure what to do so he went to his local lsnc office,and that was the first time that i knew that this meaning,moore business was the legal aid office that i thought it would be.plaintiff word testified to a similar series of events,thinking that legal aid was a government agency.
the form answers moore provided to the plaintiffs each have the general denial box checked and add the following purported affirmative defense will discuss with the judge at the time of trial.each requests that both parties pay their own legal fees.parties is spelled parteis on each form.
the plaintiffs had to sign an agreement disclosure form for the legal aid services processing center in modesto after paying money but before receiving their answers.the form states that t his office is a professional document preparation and typing service only,that it is not a law office and will not provide any legal advice.it suggests clients contact an attorney.the forms themselves show that they are sent after payment of money,as each reflects a zero account balance.for example,plaintiff gayler form states client deposit is with a balance due of for a total of.
claudia nakamura,not a plaintiff herein,testified to a similar set of facts occurring in april.she faced an eviction in salinas.she thought she was calling the entity which had helped her for free in the past,the people that help people that do have the money to pay a regular lawyer.when she asked why she was being charged she was told it was just for the paperwork.she did not see the agreement until after she paid.she did not tell the company how to fill out the form she later received.she was told to attach her own handwritten statement to the answer,but the business did not offer to type it for her.
donna williams,not a plaintiff herein,also testified to a similar set of facts,except that she did not send money after her local telephone call,but instead went to the local lsnc office.she called legal aid because i always known legal aid to be that helps people that are low income.
michele logan,not a plaintiff herein,needed an annulment in december,and called moore business,thinking it was a low income agency after finding the number under legal aid in the modesto telephone directory.after she spent and received the agreement form stating no legal advice was being provided,she felt she had no choice but to sign and return the agreement because it stated her documents were ready and they cashed the check.when she tried to file the legal papers she was sent,the court clerk told her they were incomplete because she needed service paperwork.she called jeff to complain and he offered to arrange for service by publication for her and said he was an attorney.logan never received the promised additional paperwork.
velda crotty,not a plaintiff herein,wanted help with a grandparent visitation issue and in june called a local legal aid number in her redding telephone book.the man who answered listened to her problem and told her to complete some papers and send them back with,that it was a formality and in about days it would be finished and i probably would even have to go to court.a couple of weeks later she received some forms and a statement that no legal services were provided and she called to inquire.a woman angrily told her that the company was only a typing service.
donna pritchard,not a plaintiff herein,needed help with a bankruptcy and had used the real legal aid in the past.she found legal aid in the redding telephone directory,called the local number and spoke with a woman who had answered the telephone legal aid.after paying,she received incorrect papers and ultimately got in touch with lsnc.
moore former employee michael isaac testified he was told not to tell callers where the company was,to use aliases,and not to refer callers to the real legal aid.isaac referred to moore as jay at trial.when isaac worked there in the fall of,the company received from to calls per day.isaac was a poor typist and was hired to answer the telephone.
part of the deposition of moore former employee cynthia pimental was read to the jury.she worked for moore from about december to april.employees were supposed to use aliases.callers inquiring about free legal aid were to be told this is legal aid but we do charge.they were to say they were local or in the area but that the processing center was in modesto.moore called his employees players.
stephen goldberg,a lawyer for northern california lawyers for civil justice,a private nonprofit law firm,heard about moore business and contacted moore website in may.he sent an claiming to be facing an eviction.the reply advised him to call the legal aid processing center for document processing and assistance.goldberg called the number given and jay explained that his office was the local legal aid office mentioned on the judicial council summons.
cathy farrell,the redding office manager for lsnc,made an audio tape of the voice mail system messages she accessed by calling the local number shortly before the trial.lsnc is a nonprofit corporation partly funded by the legal services corporation and grants from government agencies,fund raisers and private charities.at one time the redding office was called legal aid society of shasta county until it merged.
for about seven years melinda brown has been the executive director of people of progress,a shasta county organization providing emergency food,clothing and informational referrals to the impoverished.it serves about people per year.she has frequently heard lsnc referred to as legal aid,and lsnc is listed as legal aid on mailings which are sent monthly to food stamp recipients.in her opinion when low income people refer to legal aid they mean lsnc or free legal services in general.
after partly granting a request for judicial notice,discussed below,the trial court instructed the jury as follows the judicial council is the administrative body which oversees state courts in california.the judicial council issues forms that are used in legal proceedings.when a judicial council form refers to consulting an attorney and makes reference to legal aid or legal services,such as in a summons or the information sheet for waiver of court fees,the reference is to a publicly funded nonprofit law corporation which provides free legal services to low income eligible clients.
brockey called moore as an adverse witness,and the jury and trial court did not believe moore version of events.we will not outline all of the discrepancies and vacillations.
moore was the owner and manager of legal aid and legal aid services and premiere marketing.he was not a lawyer or paralegal,but claimed to have an attorney ernest elledge on staff,though he did not in.if callers ask for legal advice,they are referred to elledge.moore voice mail system directs callers to a number for legal advice,but he claimed he received no income from this service.
moore used the alias jeff simmons at legal aid.he uses the names legal aid services and legal aid in marketing.he claimed he had a modesto business license in the name of legal aid services dash legal aid,but later in trial admitted he only had a license in the name of premiere marketing.still later in trial he claimed he received a business license for legal aid and legal aid services the friday in the middle of trial.he had about listings of local numbers around california,bakersfield,los angeles,napa,redding which would forward calls to his modesto business.he also used a toll free number but claimed he used the numbers to save money rather than to deceive callers into thinking they were calling a local legal aid office.he claimed his business typed what people directed on legal forms.based on the information they provided,moore would check the various boxes.the same is true for affirmative defenses,misspelled words and all.we type their statement,their defense.he does not check the boxes relating to udaa compliance because he considers himself to be an exempt typing service.however,he did not advertise his business as a typing service in the yellow pages,but under legal clinics.he claimed this was up to the telephone company.
moore claimed his website,which offered legal documents,would refer to people to lawyers.he claimed it was under construction and not operating,but conceded people could use it,and when people have done so he referred them to lawyers.although it advertised se habla espanol under a scales of justice symbol he no longer had any employees.even though the website had a copyright notice,he claimed it was just under development and had not been operating that long.when confronted in the second week of trial with hard copies of a different version of the website,he said he had been working on it for months,but put it online the previous saturday.he claimed its function was to link people with attorneys in different specialties.the website did not have any attorneys signed up at this point.however,it does list a number.
among the services offered on the website were bankruptcy services.judge whitney rimel of the united states bankruptcy court for the eastern district of california,fresno division,issued an order in,compelling legal aid services to disgorge money to certain debtors and pay sanctions,which legal aid services failed to do.this order also sanctioned moore for failing to refrain from using the word legal or any similar term in any advertisements pursuant to a federal statute regulating bankruptcy petition preparers.see f.moore identified a bankruptcy court judgment he had agreed to recently before trial,finding he continued to prepare bankruptcy documents using the word legal in his business name and advertising after the prior order.he claimed lsnc called the bankruptcy court and sic sic,sicced them on us.moore admitted his voice on his company voice mail system referred to doing bankruptcies,but he claimed the messages were old and the system was different now.
moore first claimed he had been using his business card since about or,but when brockey counsel pointed out exhibit q listed moore website,moore claimed the card had been changed more recently.
moore denied requiring employees to use aliases.in deposition he could not remember the names of any employees in,claiming he had a lot of volunteers.
moore testified his business was not the legal aid or legal services office or lawyers referral service referred to in judicial council forms.
moore claimed when customers called,a price was agreed upon,the customers were faxed his written agreement,signed it,then the services were performed.he conceded the forms in evidence for the plaintiffs indicated payment had already been made,but denied that that meant money was collected before the agreement was sent or services provided.he did not save any documents relating to customers until recently,when elledge advised him to do so.
moore testified he operated no other businesses,except that several years in the past he had used a business name of certified building maintenance,or cbm.when recalled later in trial he testified he had no position in a company called belmont business corporation,which operated out of the same modesto building as his business.however,he later conceded he accepted rent checks on behalf of that company.he also testified beckwith is kind of a service company that i do research with,but later conceded paychecks for his legal aid employees currently have the name beckwith on them.
the jury was instructed on the following deemed admissions moore was not registered or bonded under the udaa,moore employed no attorneys,and no attorney was responsible for his work.in deposition he testified he destroyed all records,but we start keeping them when we leave here meaning,after the deposition is over.
after the jury began deliberating,the parties put on limited additional evidence regarding injunctive relief.in argument,brockey predicated liability primarily on the udaa and sba which were also before the jury,but also mentioned the ucl and cra the court wanted to await the jury verdicts to try to avoid inconsistent rulings.we observe that it is generally proper for a trial court to await a jury verdict before ruling on overlapping issues being tried to the court.see,hughes dunlap cal,posey leavitt d.
moore was recalled and admitted he was not registered under the udaa and had not posted the required bond.he claimed he sold legal aid to attorney elledge yesterday.he conceded it was an oral agreement at this point but was vague on details.he claimed premiere marketing has no relationship to legal aid and he was retaining that business.however,in his deposition moore had stated he was the owner of legal aid services and a marketing company called premiere marketing was the same thing.
after the verdicts were returned the trial court announced it would issue an injunction because moore has really preyed on a vulnerable section of the population by leading people to believe he was legal aid,that he was legal services,the law service,the law office for the poor.he took advantage of that and had a scheme to continue that belief with people of limited income,dealing with a group of the population that was not likely to challenge his actions because of the relatively low dollar amount of the loss in each case,but dealing in a high volume with respect to the number of clients.the trial court did not specify which statutory violation or violations supported the injunction.
then the parties briefed the scope of the injunction.brockey sought an injunction based on all of the violations of law proven at the jury trial and court trial.the opposition asserted that brockey failure to provide consumer survey evidence on the misleading nature,vel non,of the advertisements precluded injunctive relief.it also asserted moore had transferred his business to elledge,and that in any event the injunction was overbroad.attached to the opposition was elledge declaration,claiming he had acquired the typing service known as legal aid aid from walter moore of modesto,ca.he then hedged and said i am in the process of exercising complete management and control of the business.in reply,brockey emphasized that the trial evidence showed moore business practices were deceptive.
moore does not faithfully recite the facts supporting the verdict and the injunction in his briefs.almost none of the above facts are mentioned.failure to set forth the material evidence on an issue waives a claim of insufficiency of the evidence.foreman clark fallon cal d.moreover,what facts are mentioned are skewed in moore favor.for example,moore asserts that the agreement form disclosed that he offered typing services only and not legal services.however,moore omits to state that this agreement form was sent to clients after they had paid the required fees for an unlawful detainer response,and that moore and his employees,using aliases,routinely induced callers to send money for what was portrayed as legal assistance.
as another example,moore asserts that the clients were provided with unlawful detainer answers,instructions to file the answers and the statement that further help or legal advice required consultation with an attorney.moore omits mention of the evidence that he or his employees typed the answers without instructions from the clients,and the fact the responses chosen by them failed to raise any cognizable affirmative defenses.thus,to the extent moore implies by his brief that he faithfully provided the services set forth in the agreement which,as stated above,did not truly reflect the bargain struck by the clients and moore,the brief misleads.
we deem all of moore evidentiary arguments waived.foreman clark fallon,supra,cal d at.
discussion 
the judgment recites that the jury found moore practiced law without a license,violated the udaa and the cra and acted with fraud,oppression or malice.the annexed injunction prohibits moore in part from using the names legal aid services or legal aid or legal services because these three names signify a law office providing free legal services to persons and families using the term legal except as a paralegal and using local telephone numbers which forward to his modesto business.the injunction also requires moore to change his website,tell customers he is not an attorney,place newspaper advertisements regarding this lawsuit and so forth.
the first argument heading in moore opening brief asserts the evidence was insufficient as a matter of law to support the judgment for violations of the ucl.he reiterates his claims in an argument about the denial of his directed verdict motion.brockey replied by correctly pointing out there were several different unlawful practices proven which could support the ucl claim.in the reply brief moore claims brockey brief is mostly irrelevant because moore only attacked the false advertising theory under business and professions code section.moore misperceives the import of brockey briefing.
the ucl defines unfair competition as any unlawful,unfair or fraudulent business act or practice and unfair,deceptive,untrue or misleading advertising bus.it borrows standards of conduct from other statutes,and a plaintiff need only show the violation of any law.see hewlett squaw valley ski th,d.another statute specifically makes unlawful advertising services by untrue or misleading statements.bus.a violation of the false advertising law is a violation of the ucl.committee on children television,general foods cal d.
violation of the sba,cra and udaa,as found by the jury,and not contested on appeal,demonstrates that moore has engaged in a prolonged pattern of unfair business practices,which supports the injunction as issued under the ucl.part of the instructions on the udaa theory based liability on the making of false or misleading statements see bus,subd.a,and part of the instructions on the cra theory based liability on misrepresentation of the origin,source,affiliation and quality of services advertised,subd.a.thus,the jury findings of liability on those theories overlapped with the trial court finding as to false advertising,regarding the use of legal aid and similar deceptive phrases by moore.therefore,we decline to address moore claims regarding false advertising under the ucl because even if we agreed with him the judgment issuing the injunction would be proper based on the unchallenged verdicts on the udaa and cra theories.wholly apart from advertising,the fact moore was found by the jury to have given legal advice,rather than acting as a clerical typing service,could support an injunction preventing him from continuing to hold himself out as a source for legal aid or legal services and the like.see people landlords professional services d.
in the reply brief moore suggests that if he can eliminate the false advertising prong the case should be remanded for further proceedings,but he does not state what those proceedings would be.for example,he does not point to any portion of the injunction which depends wholly on the false advertising claim,and we will not make such arguments for him.people gidney cal d.
moreover,moore attack on the misleading advertising prong is based on an unfair summary of the evidence,as stated above.brockey had to show moore business practice is such that members of the public are likely to be deceived.bank of the west superior court cal th,d,bank of the west.by their breadth the statutes encompass not only those advertisements which have deceived or misled because they are untrue,but also those which may be accurate on some level,but will nonetheless tend to mislead or deceive.a perfectly true statement couched in such a manner that it is likely to mislead or deceive the consumer,such as by failure to disclose other relevant information,is actionable under these sections.day v.at t th,d.tellingly,a plaintiff need not prove that anybody was misled id.at,d,although here people were misled.
moore contends brockey had to prove via extrinsic evidence that his misstatements would likely deceive a reasonable person not merely a vulnerable person and that what he terms anecdotal evidence,that is,testimony by people that they were in fact misled,is insufficient.he fails to cite a single california case requiring use of survey evidence in unfair business practices cases,only lower federal court cases which are neither binding nor persuasive,to the extent they hold that direct evidence that many people were misled can never show that a reasonable consumer would likely be misled.see,haskell time,plaintiff must demonstrate by extrinsic evidence,such as consumer survey evidence,that the challenged statements tend to mislead consumers.generally,those cases involve a very few persons claiming to be misled and do not hold that anecdotal evidence can never suffice.see,churchill village llc general electric d,two of recipients.the attorney general points out and moore concedes that these cases have imported into
