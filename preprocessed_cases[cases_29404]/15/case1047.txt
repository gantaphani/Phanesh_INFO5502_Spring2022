cynthia baxter brought this action under the unfair competition law bus,ucl to ensure that membership contracts used by defendant salutary sportsclubs,salutary,conform precisely with the requirements of the civil code relating to health studio contracts.after a court trial in which baxter obtained modest relief,she sought attorney fees under code of civil procedure section section,claiming she had enforced an important right affecting the public interest.the trial court disagreed and denied her motion.we agree with the trial court assessment of what this action has accomplished,and affirm.
background 
the scant record on appeal reveals the following facts.salutary owns and operates several health clubs in california.prior to the filing of the complaint on march,abraham camhy,attorney for baxter,initiated an investigation into salutary contractual practices by hiring a private investigator posing as a consumer to join one of salutary facilities,thereby obtaining a copy of its service contract.upon reviewing the contract,baxter discovered it did not comply with the california statute governing health club contracts,the health studio contracts law.baxter,who had a professional relationship with camhy law practice,agreed to come forward on behalf of the general public to correct the alleged violations.
baxter filed her complaint,alleging salutary contracts failed to comply with the health studio contracts law in several ways.first,although the contracts informed customers that they have a right to cancel the contract within three days,they did not point out that sundays and holidays are not included in calculating this time period.second,salutary name and address did not appear on the first page of the contract.third,the contracts failed to inform customers that they need not use specific words to cancel their contracts,but could cancel by using words of similar effect.
baxter alleged four causes of action,labeled declaratory relief on the contracts rescission notice to consumers and for violations of business and professions code,et in her prayer for relief,baxter asked the court to declare void the contracts between salutary and its customers to enjoin salutary from continuing to engage in unfair business practices to award restitution disgorgement to require salutary to engage in a corrective information campaign and to enter various other orders relating to the contracts.baxter also sought prejudgment interest,attorney fees and costs 
although salutary asserted its contracts complied with the spirit if not the letter of the law,after the complaint was filed it modified its membership contracts to conform precisely with the health studio contracts law.nevertheless,the case went forward to a bench trial.after trial,the court issued a statement of decision in which it found,among other things,that before baxter lawsuit was filed,salutary had used membership agreements that did not comply with certain provisions of the health studio contracts law.the court further found that after the lawsuit was filed,salutary had amended its contracts to comply with the relevant statutes.the court went on to note that baxter has absolutely no personal knowledge of the defendant business and held that she had no standing to pursue her first and second causes of action.the court also concluded that the third cause of action for notice to consumrs is not a legally recognized ground for relief.
as to the remaining cause of action for violations of the ucl,the court found there were no damages to any members of salutary health clubs and no evidence that salutary had ever attempted to enforce a contract provision that did not comply with the health studio contracts law.lest its findings be misunderstood,the court went on the court further finds there has been absolutely no showing of any harm to anyone by virtue of the language in the nonconforming contract.nevertheless,the trial court ordered salutary to review all of its contracts and send written notice to those customers who had signed nonconforming contracts that they could a continue under the provisions of the nonconforming contract or b execute a new contract with language which conforms to the health studios law.the court also ordered salutary to post a similar notice in each of its facilities for six months.
baxter then made a motion for attorney fees pursuant to section,arguing that she had achieved a substantial benefit for the general public in this action the trial court disagreed and denied the motion,reasoning that t he relief granted plaintiff was a de minimus change in the defendant contracts that did not result in a significant benefit to the public.baxter timely appealed,challenging only that portion of the order denying her request for attorney fees.
discussion 
ordinarily,an order denying attorney fees under section is reviewed for abuse of discretion.see,flannery california highway patrol th,d hewlett squaw valley ski th,d.baxter urges this court to apply a de novo standard of review.in this case it makes no difference,because under any standard we conclude that the trial court correctly denied attorney fees here.
as relevant to this case,section provides upon motion,a court may award attorneys fees to a successful party against one or more opposing parties in any action which has resulted in the enforcement of an important right affecting the public interest if a a significant benefit,whether pecuniary or nonpecuniary,has been conferred on the general public or a large class of persons,b the necessity and financial burden of private enforcement,or of enforcement by one public entity against another public entity,are such as to make the award appropriate,and c such fees should not in the interest of justice be paid out of the recovery,if any.the fundamental objective of this statute is to encourage suits effectuating a strong public policy by awarding substantial attorney fees to those who successfully bring such suits mandicino maggard d.
the parties focus their arguments on whether this litigation provided a significant benefit on the general public or a large class of persons.baxter suggests that the correction of any statutory violation necessarily provides a significant benefit to the public.she is mistaken.i n enacting section,the legislature did not intend to authorize an award of attorney fees in every case involving a statutory violation.citation.instead,in deciding whether to award attorney fees under the statute,a trial court should determine realistically the significance of the benefit,and the size of the class receiving the benefit,in light of all pertinent circumstances.mandicino maggard,supra,d at.because the public always has a significant interest in seeing that laws are enforced,it always derives some benefit when illegal private or public conduct is rectified.nevertheless,the legislature did not intend to authorize an award of fees under section in every lawsuit enforcing a constitutional or statutory right.citations.the statute specifically provides for an award only when the lawsuit has conferred a significant benefit on the general public or a large class of persons.the trial court must determine the significance of the benefit and the size of the class receiving that benefit by realistically assessing the gains that have resulted in a particular case.flannery california highway patrol,supra,th,d.
the trial court,in considering fee awards to private litigants on the facts and record applicable to each particular case,must carefully walk the line between unreasonably transmuting section into an unwarranted cornucopia of attorney fees for those who intervene in,or initiate litigation against,private parties under the guise of benefiting the public interest while actually performing duplicative,unnecessary,and valueless services,and providing appropriate compensation under that statute in cases where the colitigating private party does render necessary,significant services of value and benefit to the public.committee to defend reproductive rights v.a free pregnancy center d.this case is a textbook example of valueless litigation against a private party under the guise
