background 
brawn markets clothing through its catalogs and over the internet.when a customer places an order,brawn packages it,and holds it at its warehouse,where it is picked up by a common carrier and delivered to the customer,using an address provided by the customer.at all times relevant,the terms of brawn mail order form required the customer to pay the listed price for the goods purchased,plus a delivery fee and a insurance fee.as to the last,the form recited insurance items lost or damaged in transit replaced free.brawn based the insurance fee on the costs to it of replacing any goods lost in transit,and brawn did indeed replace,without further cost to the customer,any goods that had been lost in transit.brawn rarely,if ever,sold its goods to a customer unwilling to pay the insurance fee.
on february,and again on february,plaintiff jacq wilson plaintiff purchased items from brawn catalogue,each time paying the insurance fee.on february,wilson,acting on behalf of himself and all other similarly situated persons,brought suit against brawn,contending that in charging the fee,brawn violated the unfair competition law,business and professions code section et,prohibiting unfair competition,and business and professions code section et,prohibiting false advertising

discussion 
neither party has cited any significant source of law concerning mail order sales or the risk of loss in mail order consumer sales,resting their contentions on provisions of the commercial code as the commercial code,and the cases cited there,typically involve arm length sales between fairly sophisticated parties,the fit is not perfect.nonetheless,there appears to be little legislation or case law specifically concerned with mail order sales or risk of loss in consumer sales contracts,and we,too,turn to the commercial code provisions.
commercial code section sets forth the general rules for determining which party bears the risk of loss of goods in transit when there has been no breach of contract.subdivision of section provides,as relevant where the contract requires or authorizes the seller to ship the goods by carrier a if it does not require him to deliver them at a particular destination,the risk of loss passes to the buyer when the goods are duly delivered to the carrier but b if it does require him to deliver them at a particular destination and the goods are there duly tendered while in the possession of the carrier,the risk of loss passes to the buyer when the goods are there duly so tendered as to enable the buyer to take delivery.
shipment contract or destination contract 
official code comment to uniform commercial code section,concerning the seller manner of tendering delivery,explains u nder this article the shipment contract is regarded as the normal one and the destination contract as the variant type.the seller is not obligated to deliver at a named destination and bear the concurrent risk of loss until arrival,unless he has specifically agreed so to deliver or the commercial understanding of the terms used by the parties contemplates such a delivery.official comments on com.code,deering ann.ed.foll.of course,a seller will have to provide the carrier with shipping instructions.it follows that a contract is not a destination contract simply because the seller places an address label on the package,or directs the carrier to ship to a particular destination.thus a ship to term has no significance in determining whether a contract is a shipment or destination contract for risk of loss purposes.eberhard manufacturing company brown.the point is illustrated in la casse blaustein misc d,where the plaintiff,a student in massachusetts,purchased pocket calculators by telephone from a new york manufacturer.the method of shipment was left to the seller,but the plaintiff wrote a check to cover postage,and directed the seller to ship the goods to the plaintiff residence.the court held under the uniform commercial code,the sales contract which provides for delivery to a carrier is considered the usual one and delivery to a particular destination to a buyer the variant or unusual one.citations.in view of the foregoing,the request of the plaintiff letter to ship to his residence is insufficient to convert the contract into one requiring delivery to a destination rather than one to a carrier.the request was nothing more than a shipping instruction and not of sufficient weight and solemnity as to convert the agreement into a destination contract.id.at.similarly,in california state electronics zeos internat.th,d,one of the few california cases discussing the issue,the court held the evidence showed that zeos sales operation consists of telephone orders which are shipped at the buyer expense via an overnight express service.the paperwork zeos prepares and sends to the buyer,with the goods or shortly after their shipment,contains no provision requiring zeos to deliver the goods to the buyer.these facts plainly mark zeos terms as shipment contracts,which is the presumptive form.id.at,d.
in addition,although the risk of loss does not necessarily pass at the same time title to the goods passes,commercial code section,subdivision a,provides that i f the contract requires or authorizes the seller to send the goods to the buyer but does not require him to deliver them at a destination,title passes to the buyer at the time and place of shipment.this section,therefore,also distinguishes between the seller obligation to deliver goods to a carrier,and the seller obligation to deliver goods to the buyer.
it is not at all uncommon for a contract to shift the risk of loss to the buyer at the point at which the seller delivers the goods to a common carrier,while calling for the seller to pay for delivery and insurance.the commercial code recognizes this type of contract in its provisions pertaining to the term the term means that the price includes in a lump sum the cost of the goods and the insurance and freight to the named destination,subd.official comment to the section explains that t he contract is not a destination but a shipment contract with risk of subsequent loss or damage to the goods passing to the buyer upon shipment if the seller has properly performed all his obligations with respect to the goods.delivery to the carrier is delivery to the buyer for purposes of risk and title.official code comment to uniform code section,similarly,explains that a term requiring the seller to pay the freight or the cost of delivery is not to be interpreted as the equivalent of a term requiring
