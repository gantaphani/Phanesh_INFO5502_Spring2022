plaintiffs contend the court erred in ruling they lack standing to pursue the ucl claim because proposition applies retroactively and eliminates the ability of individuals who have suffered no injury or monetary loss from pursuing ucl claims.they also contend the court erred in ruling that individual issues predominate so this is an inappropriate case for a class action under the ucl or clra and in granting summary adjudication on some causes of action.we affirm the orders.
factual and procedural background 
the proposed class is composed of smokers who were residents of california between june,and april,and who were exposed to defendants marketing and advertising activities in california.plaintiffs sought to recover economic losses resulting from purchasing cigarettes.
the complaint was originally filed in and amended many times.in january,brown,who was then the only named plaintiff,filed a motion seeking class certification of all claims in his fifth amended complaint,which included both common law claims and a clra claim.the trial court denied certification concluding,inter alia,individual issues of causation and injury predominate over common issues.in october,brown sought certification of a clra claim in his sixth amended complaint,but subsequently filed a seventh amended complaint adding claims under the ucl and the false advertising law fal and also sought class treatment of these additional claims.
in april,the court denied brown second clra class action motion because it was an improper motion to reconsider the denial and found that individual issues relating to causation,injury,reliance,materiality,exposure to the alleged misstatements,statutes of limitations,and choice of law predominate.the trial court,however,granted class certification as to the ucl and fal claims because these statutes do not require individualized determinations as to reliance.
in,the trial court granted summary adjudication in favor of defendants as to ucl and fal claims involving defendants use of the terms lights,low tar,all natural,and no additives.the court found all the claims are preempted by the federal cigarette labeling and advertising act et,and further that plaintiffs had failed to present adequate evidence to establish the falsity of the all natural and no additives claims.the trial court permitted plaintiffs to proceed with a class action as to other ucl claims that the tobacco companies had made false and misleading statements denying or disputing the health hazards and addictiveness of cigarette smoking and their targeting of minors.
after the standing requirements for ucl lawsuits by private individuals were changed by the passage of proposition in the general election of november,defendants successfully moved to decertify the class.the trial court ruled that to establish standing the individual plaintiffs and all class members were now required to show injury in fact consisting of lost money or property caused by the unfair competition.the trial court found the requirement of individual reliance meant the individual issues predominate over the common issues thus making the case unsuitable for a class action.
discussion 
iapplicability of proposition 
brown contends the trial court erred in ruling the changed standing requirements of proposition apply to this case,which was pending when the measure was adopted in november.
before proposition was adopted,both public attorneys,such as the attorney general,and private citizens could bring lawsuits under the ucl on behalf of the general public without a showing that anyone had actually been harmed by an unfair business practice.proposition continues to grant standing to public attorneys to bring lawsuits on behalf of the general public without a showing of harm but significantly restricts the standing of private citizens to bring ucl lawsuits.after proposition,a private citizen has standing to bring a ucl lawsuit only if he or she has suffered injury in fact and has lost money or property as a result of such unfair competition.
this issue has now been resolved by the california supreme court.in californians for disability rights mervyn,llc cal th,d,the court held proposition new standing requirements apply to pending cases.we are bound by this decision.auto equity sales,superior court cal d.accordingly,we uphold the trial court ruling that proposition standing requirements apply to this case.
class decertification was proper 
after finding proposition applies to this lawsuit,the court decertified the class.the court noted there are significant questions that undermin e the purported commonality among the class members,such as whether each class member was exposed to d efendants alleged false statements and whether each member purchased cigarettes as a result of the false statements.clearly,here,as in p laintiffs clra case,individual issues predominate,making class treatment unmanageable and inefficient.further,it appears from the record that not even p laintiffs named class representatives satisfy prop standing requirement.
the court decision denying certification for the clra cause of action more fully detailed the court determination that common issues do not predominate.among other things,the court noted there were differing representations associated with a multitude of products,altered over the course of the many years at issue the court noted,the sheer plethora of misrepresentations alleged by p laintiff is but one example of the divergent possible scenarios surrounding each putative class member claim.further,the court observed,whether the information by d efendants over the vast span of years at issue was the causative factor of each class member smoking and presumptive resulting addiction is fact specific to each putative member of the class depending upon their then knowledge and behavioral activity.the court observed there are statute of limitation issues as to when each putative class member discovered or should have discovered injury was sustained as a consequence of the wrongful acts allegedly committed by the d efendants and questioned whether brown was an adequate class representative since he admitted he was not in fact deceived by the host of alleged misrepresentations asserted by the putative class endemic to successful assertion of a cause of action under the clra 
an individual bringing a class action ucl lawsuit must meet the standing requirements of section,that is,an individual must have suffered injury in fact and have lost money or property as a result of such unfair competition and meet the class action requirements of code of civil procedure section.bus.
section of the code of civil procedure authorizes class suits in california when the question is one of a common or general interest,of many persons,or when the parties are numerous,and it is impracticable to bring them all before the court the class action statute is a procedural device for collectively litigating substantive claims.madrid perot systems th,d corbett superior court th,d.the definition of a class can not be so broad as to include individuals who are without standing to maintain the action on their own behalf.each class member must have standing to bring the suit in his or her own right.collins safeway stores,d.c lass action status does not alter the parties underlying substantive rights.citations.if a specific form of relief is foreclosed to claimants as individuals,it remains unavailable to them even if they congregate into a class.feitelberg credit suisse first boston,llc th,d.proposition forecloses relief to a private plaintiff who has not suffered an injury in fact and lost money or property as a result of an unfair business practice.thus,the named plaintiff as well as class members must have suffered an injury in fact and lost money or property.only the attorney general,district attorneys,county counsels,city attorneys,and city prosecutors are exempted from the ucl and class action standing requirements and may pursue a class action on behalf of the general public without a showing of an injury in fact.
the burden is on the party seeking certification to establish the existence of both an ascertainable class and a community of interest among the class members.lockheed martin superior court cal th,d.the community of interest requirement embodies three factors predominant common questions of law or fact class representatives with claims or defenses typical of the class and class representatives who can adequately represent the class.drug stores,superior court cal th,d.a trial court ruling on a certification motion determines whether the issues which may be jointly tried,when compared with those requiring separate adjudication,are so numerous or substantial that the maintenance of a class action would be advantageous to the judicial process and to the litigants.ibid.the trial court must carefully weigh respective benefits and burdens and allow maintenance of the class action only where substantial benefits accrue both to litigants and the courts.in re cipro cases i ii th,d.

here,the proposed class consists of smokers who were residents of california between june,and april,and who were exposed to defendants marketing and advertising activities in california.plaintiffs sought restitution,that is,the cost of purchasing cigarettes.plaintiffs theory of liability is that the class members became smokers and purchased defendants cigarettes as a result of defendants misrepresentations about the health risks and addictiveness of smoking.therefore,the class excludes persons who were unaware of defendants advertising and marketing campaign or did not believe their representations as to the health risks and addictiveness of smoking.
the lawsuit is not based on a single misrepresentation but a general marketing and advertising campaign.plaintiffs contend defendants marketing programs were intended to create a general,cultural understanding on the part of the target and potential cigarettes are safe and.having achieved their goal,defendants are bound by it.smokers bought cigarettes because of their general from defendants own unfair they could safely smoke.plaintiffs explain,t he question for class certification is not whether each class member saw or relied on a specific advertisement,but whether a reasonable person would,in light of defendants campaign of misrepresentations,continue to.plaintiffs argue the fact a class member continued to smoke after becoming fully aware of the health risks is irrelevant since at that point the class member had already become addicted.under plaintiffs theory,the key misrepresentations occurred before an individual class member began to smoke.
the marketing and advertising campaign consisted of a myriad of representations occurring over a long period,indeed,over more than half a century.the complaint alleges the tobacco companies were aware cigarette smoking was harmful in the and by the were fully aware nicotine was addictive.in the and,the tobacco companies ran advertisements suggesting cigarettes had no harmful effects,could protect against colds,and claimed filters were effective in removing tar and nicotine.in the,the tobacco institute ran advertisements suggesting there was continuing scientific debate about the connection between smoking and lung cancer.in,tobacco company executives,during hearings by the congressional subcommittee on health and environment on the potential regulation of products,claimed nicotine was not addictive.
over this period,changes occurred in the dissemination of information about the health hazards of smoking and in cigarette marketing.for example,in the,congress enacted the federal cigarette labeling and advertising act requiring health warnings on cigarettes.et the act was amended in and and currently requires all cigarette packages,billboards and other advertising to display one of four different rotating warnings.plaintiffs expert,marvin goldberg,noted there were only a small number of articles through,thus people who smoked before were exposed to fewer messages than those who started smoking after.while lawsuits by smokers were generally unsuccessful during the through the,in the litigation was renewed and different strategies used resulting in the disclosure of internal memoranda from the tobacco companies revealing that the tobacco companies had known about but concealed the harmful effects of smoking.scott,the continuing tobacco war state and local tobacco control in washington seattle.excerpts from these documents are contained in the complaint.restrictions on the marketing,advertising and promotion of cigarette advertising occurred in as a result of the four major tobacco companies entering into a master settlement agreement msa with the attorneys general of states,the district of columbia and five united states territories.patel,the tobacco litigation did the msa make it stop depaul health care.
because of the number of misrepresentations and the lengthy period involved,this case is unlike those cases where the courts have essentially presumed misrepresentations detrimentally affected all class members on an equal basis.it is evident that not all class members here were exposed to the same or even similar misrepresentations.
for example,some of the class members were not born until decades after the initial misrepresentations were made.further,because of the long period,changing representations and changing dissemination of information about the harmful effects of smoking,not all class members would have been affected by the misrepresentations to the same degree.while the supreme court has recognized that in some situations,a misrepresentation may be so material that it can be inferred or presumed that all class members relied on the misrepresentation see vasquez superior court cal d,vasquez,this is not such a case.in vasquez,the court reasoned that proof as to the representative plaintiffs will supply the proof as to all.id.at,see also occidental land,superior court cal d,massachusetts mutual life ins.superior court th,d.in vasquez,it was alleged defendant salesmen used a common sales pitch from a manual,made the same representations to all class members and the falsity was common to all class members.vasquez,supra,at.in that situation,the supreme court indicated it could be presumed that material representations were relied upon by all class members.id.at.however,the supreme court in vasquez also recognized that if the alleged misrepresentations vary too much among the class members,then certification of a class action may not be based on presumed or inferred reliance.id.at.
here,the record makes it clear that proof as to the representative plaintiffs will not supply proof as to all class members.as we pointed out above,merely as a function of the lengthy time covered by the complaint,different class members would have heard different statements by defendants and would have had differing degrees of other sources of information available to them to assess the health risks and addictiveness of smoking.
not even the representative plaintiffs were exposed to all the misrepresentations nor believed them for example,brown began to smoke sometime before the.he was n
