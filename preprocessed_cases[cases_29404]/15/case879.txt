this case involves claims by the buyer of an allegedly defective motor home against a lender to whom the installment sale contract was assigned by the dealer.at the heart of the controversy is a question that has divided courts in several jurisdictions what is the meaning of the contract provision required by title,section,of the code of federal regulations commonly referred to as the holder rule,it is required by the federal trade commission ftc for every consumer installment sale contract that is assigned to a lender.the holder rule requires the following language in point or larger and bold typeface notice any holder of this consumer credit contract is subject to all claims and defenses which the debtor could assert against the seller of goods or services obtained pursuant hereto or with the proceeds hereof.recovery hereunder by the debtor shall not exceed amounts paid by the debtor hereunder.
here,patrick and mary lafferty the laffertys bought a motor home from geweke auto rv group geweke that was financed with an installment contract.shortly after the sale,geweke assigned the contract to wells fargo bank wells fargo in accordance with the terms of a separate dealer agreement.the laffertys allege the motor home was defective from the start.after months passed without the demanded repairs being made,the laffertys disclaimed their ownership interest in the vehicle and sued geweke.the laffertys also sued wells fargo on the ground the holder rule allows them to assert all claims against the lender they otherwise had against the dealer.
the trial court concluded the holder rule did not allow the laffertys to assert claims against a lender that pertained only to the responsibilities of the seller.finding no other consumer laws supported the laffertys claims against wells fargo,the trial court entered judgment in favor of wells fargo.the trial court also awarded attorney fees to wells fargo.
on appeal,the laffertys contend the holder rule allows them to assert any claims against wells fargo they might otherwise have against geweke,their breach of contract action for a defective motor home lies against wells fargo both as a party to the contract and as a third party beneficiary of the dealer agreement,federal law does not preempt their causes of action for negligence and negligent defamation of credit,wells fargo violated the consumer legal remedies act clra,et the song beverly consumer warranty act,et the tanner consumer protection act,and engaged in unfair business practices and wells fargo was not entitled to attorney fees.
we hold that the plain meaning of the holder rule allows the laffertys to assert all claims against wells fargo they might otherwise have against geweke.under the holder rule,however,the laffertys may recover no more than what they actually paid toward the installment contract.although the holder rule allows the same claims against a lender that might be brought against the seller,it does not create any causes of action.thus,we examine whether the laffertys have causes of action against wells fargo that arise from other sources.we conclude the laffertys operative complaint states causes of action against wells fargo under the clra and for negligence.however,the laffertys claim of negligent defamation of credit is preempted by federal law.as to their cause of action for declaratory and injunctive relief,the laffertys lack standing to assert the claim.
we find the laffertys have forfeited their causes of action for breach of warranty,breach of contract,breach of the covenant of good faith and fair dealing,violation of the song beverly act,violation of the tanner consumer protection act,and unfair business practices.since we reverse the judgment,we also reverse the award of attorney fees because wells fargo is no longer necessarily the prevailing party in this action.
background 
purchase of the motor home 
on november,the laffertys bought a motor home manufactured by fleetwood motor homes fleetwood from geweke.pursuant to the terms of the installment contract,the laffertys agreed to pay a total of for the motor home over the course of months the laffertys also paid to geweke for a separate extended service contract with phoenix american warranty company,phoenix american 
geweke assigned the installment contract to wells fargo in accordance with the terms of a dealer agreement entered into between wells fargo and geweke.
problems with the motor home 
after taking possession of the motor home,the laffertys immediately took the vehicle for a trip.upon their return,they brought the motor home to geweke complaining of electrical failures and cosmetic issues.no repairs were performed for more than two weeks.because the laffertys had a thanksgiving trip planned,they took the unrepaired motor home from november through december,and then returned the vehicle to geweke for completion of the original repairs and for resolution of additional electrical and mechanical failures that occurred during the second trip.
on december,geweke called the laffertys and informed them they would be required to authorize for a failure analysis to determine whether some of the problems were caused by operator error.the laffertys declined to authorize the payment.on january,they wrote to fleetwood describing the situation,quoting a provision of fleetwood warranty statement,and stating the rv is and has been at the dealership for the last days.due to the nature of the failures,principally electrical in nature the rv is considered an unsafe vehicle and may fall under california lemon laws.on february,the laffertys informed wells fargo they would stop making payments until the motor home was repaired.
on april,the laffertys attorney wrote to fleetwood explaining,the laffertys relinquished their ownership interest in the motor home,t he finality of the return is not under discussion,and t he remaining question is how much money they will receive in compensation for their unfortunate experience.without discussing the merits of any potential claims,counsel identified four possible defendants,fleetwood,geweke,wells fargo,and phoenix american.the letter concluded it may be that you better than anyone else,can coordinate a resolution among the concerned parties.if so,i invite you to proceed.however,when and if it becomes clear that rapid progress towards resolution is not occurring,i intend to pursue the remedies necessary to conclude the matter favorably.
in june,geweke informed the laffertys the motor home was repaired.apparently,this was not the case.the laffertys declined to pick up the motor home and stopped making payments.wells fargo took possession of the motor home in accordance with the terms of the installment contract,but took no action to collect any amount of money from the laffertys.wells fargo did report to various consumer credit reporting agencies that the laffertys had defaulted on their agreement to pay for the motor home.
the lawsuit 
in november,the laffertys sued fleetwood,geweke,wells fargo,and phoenix american,alleging seven causes of action for breach of warranty,breach of contract,breach of the covenant of good faith and fair dealing,violation of the clra,violation of the song beverly act,violation of the tanner consumer protection act,and negligence.the original complaint was amended twice.the operative second amended complaint added five causes of action for insurance bad faith,unfair business practices,fraud,negligent credit defamation,and declaratory and injunctive relief.wells fargo was named as a defendant in all but the insurance bad faith and fraud causes of action.
as against wells fargo,the causes of action for breach of warranty,breach of contract,breach of the covenant of good faith and fair dealing,violation of the clra,violation of the song beverly act,violation of the tanner consumer protection act,and unfair business practices were premised on the fact that wells fargo was the assignee of the installment contract entered into between the laffertys and geweke.according to the complaint,the ftc holder rule and california state law mak e such a holder assignee financer subject to any claims or defenses that might be asserted against the seller manufacturer of the motor home.
with respect to the negligence cause of action,the laffertys alleged defendants owed a duty to diligently,competently and timely complete repairs to the motor home in a workmanlike manner,and failed to do so.the laffertys further alleged they notified defendants fleetwood,geweke and wells fargo of their breach of warranty in january sic.they notified defendants again on april,that they had elected to return the motor home.citation.the defendants and each of them,have refused to accept return of the motor home and to act accordingly in conformity to law.the laffertys also alleged that wells fargo falsely reported to various credit rating agencies that they had defaulted in their obligation,and failed to report that payment of the amounts that wells fargo claimed were due,were in fact legitimately disputed in relation to a breach of warranty.this conduct,alleged the laffertys,violated wells fargo fiduciary relationship with and breached its duty of care to them.
with respect to the negligent credit defamation cause of action,the laffertys alleged that wells fargo falsely reported to various credit rating agencies that they had defaulted in their obligations,failing to report that payment of the amounts which wells fargo claimed were due,were in fact legitimately disputed in relation to a breach of warranty.this conduct,alleged the laffertys,wrongfully defamed,slandered and libeled their credit rating,impairing and harming it to the extent that,subsequent to communication of the erroneous report published by wells fargo,they have been unable to conduct normal credit related consumer transactions.
finally,with respect to the declaratory and injunctive relief cause of action,the laffertys sought a declaration as to whether the dealer agreement entered into between wells fargo and geweke insulated wells fargo from liability for any claims or defenses the laffertys could assert against fleetwood or geweke under the holder rule.the laffertys also sought a declaration as to whether their revocation of acceptance of their fleetwood motor home,and return of possession of it to the defendant dealer geweke,nullifies any claim to a security interest in the motor home by defendant wells fargo under the installment sales contract which it purchased,and that wells fargo is consequently required to file a release of any notice of security interest s that it may have filed under uniform commercial code article or otherwise.the laffertys further requested an injunctive order prohibit ing further conduct by any defendant to defame or harm their credit rating through the reporting of false or inaccurate information,and prohibit ing unfair competitive practices as described herein,including the misrepresentation of warranties,the fraudulent sale of warranty and service contracts,and the wrongful refusal to discharge manufacturer and seller warranty obligations.
wells fargo demurrer 
in july,wells fargo demurred to the second amended complaint,asserting the laffertys failed to allege facts sufficient to state causes of action for violation of the clra,negligence,negligent credit defamation,and declaratory and injunctive relief.the laffertys opposed the motion.
on december,the trial court sustained the demurrer without leave to amend.thereafter,wells fargo filed an answer to the six remaining causes of action,generally denying the allegations of the second amended complaint and asserting several affirmative defenses.
wells fargo summary adjudication motion 
on june,wells fargo filed a motion for summary adjudication of the remaining six causes of action breach of warranty breach of contract breach of the implied covenant of good faith and fair dealing violation of the song beverly act violation of the tanner consumer protection act and unfair business practices.wells fargo argued summary adjudication was required based on the correct resolution of a single issue of law common to each of the remaining causes of action,wells fargo can not be affirmatively sued for geweke alleged misconduct simply because the installment contract was assigned to wells fargo.wells fargo also objected to the evidence the laffertys produced to create a factual dispute,pointing out that the laffertys relied wholly on their own interrogatory responses,which regurgitate the allegations in the second amended complaint.wells fargo also objected to purported factual statements that were actually pure argument with no evidence whatsoever.
on october,the trial court sustained all of wells fargo evidentiary objections and entered summary judgment in favor of wells fargo.with respect to each cause of action,the trial court ruled that because the evidence relied upon by the laffertys was in all material respects repetitive of the allegations of their unverified second amended complaint,they were effectively relying on the allegations of their operative complaint to attempt to create a triable issue of material fact.they can not do so.
the trial court also agreed with wells fargo that the holder rule limits claims by buyers against lenders that would otherwise lie only against the seller to cases in which little or no value was received by the buyer.the trial court reasoned that geweke assigned the sales contract to wells fargo does not mean that wells fargo affirmatively agreed that it would repair the motor home when the manufacturer or dealer failed to.the contractual holder language itself states that the debtor recovery shall not exceed amounts paid by the debtor,which means that any affirmative relief the laffertys have under the contract is limited to no more than what they have already paid on the contract.further,the laffertys provide no evidence that wells fargo affirmatively agreed to assume geweke warranty obligations.and such assumption would be contrary to normal commercial practice.wells fargo took a security interest in the motor home.citations.typically,the party who accepts assignment of a contract as collateral security for money loaned does not become a party to the contract or obligate itself to perform the assignor scope of contractual performance.citation.an assignment for security is not an assignment of all rights under the contract and does not serve to delegate the assignor obligations to perform to the assignee.citation.the mere existence of a security interest does not impose contract or tort liability upon the secured party for the debtor acts or omissions.citations.
the trial court rejected the laffertys cause of action for disparagement of their credit on grounds that claims for credit disparagement are preempted by the federal fair credit reporting act usc section,et.
trial against geweke 
following summary adjudication in favor of wells fargo,trial proceeded against geweke geweke did not appear for trial the laffertys presented their case and received a judgment in the amount of.
wells fargo motion for attorney fees 
on november,wells fargo moved for attorney fees under civil code section.the laffertys opposed the motion.the trial court awarded wells fargo in attorney fees.thereafter,judgment was entered in favor of wells fargo.this appeal followed.
discussion 
ithe holder rule 
the laffertys contend the holder rule allows them to assert any claims against wells fargo they might otherwise have against geweke,the dealer who sold them the motor home.we agree,but with a caveat.as we explain,the holder rule limits the laffertys to recovering no more than what they have paid under the installment contract.

the holder rule 
the present case is not the first in which this court has examined the meaning of the language required by the holder rule.in music acceptance lofing th,d music acceptance,this court considered the holder rule in the context of claims regarding a defective grand piano.id.at,d the piano was purchased by lofing from sherman clay and financed by lender,music acceptance.lofing was sued by the lender for breach of contract after he stopped making payments.id.at,d.in turn,lofing counterclaimed based on the express terms of the sales contract as well as on various state and federal consumer protection laws.id.at,d.a jury trial resulted in an award against the piano manufacturer and seller for lofing breach of warranty claims and against lofing for nonpayment to the lender.id.at,d.
on appeal,lofing challenged the award to the lender by arguing that his proof of the breach of warranty should have barred the lender from recovering the unpaid balance on the piano.music acceptance,supra,th at,d.applying the unruh act,et,we agreed and reversed the award against lofing.music acceptance,supra,at,d.we also noted t he same result obtains under federal law due to the language of the holder rule,which was set forth in the contract.id.at,d.
music acceptance noted t he ftc enacted the holder rule because it believed it was an unfair practice for a seller to employ procedures in the course of arranging the financing of a consumer sale which separate d the buyer duty to pay for goods or services from the seller reciprocal duty to perform as promised.statement of basis and purpose.the ftc explained our primary concern has been the distribution or allocation of costs occasioned by seller misconduct in credit sale transactions.these costs arise from breaches of contract,breaches of warranty,misrepresentation,and even fraud.the current commercial system which enables sellers and creditors to divorce a consumer obligation to pay for goods and services from the seller obligation to perform as promised,allocates all of these costs to the.ibid.
in its guidelines on trade regulation rule concerning preservation of consumers claims and defenses,the ftc explained further the dramatic increase in consumer credit over the past thirty years has caused certain problems.evolving doctrines and principles of contract law have not kept pace with changing social needs.one such legal doctrine which has worked to deprive consumers of the protection needed in credit sales is the holder in due course doctrine.under this doctrine,the obligation to pay for goods or services is not conditioned upon the seller corresponding duty to keep his promises.typically,the circumstances are as follows a consumer relying in good faith on what the seller has represented to be a product characteristics,service warranty,makes a purchase on credit terms.the consumer then finds the product unsatisfactory it fails to measure up to the claims made on its behalf by the seller,or the seller refuses to provide promised maintenance.the consumer,therefore,seeks relief from his debt obligations only to find that no relief is possible.his debt obligation,he is told,is not to the seller but to a third party whose claim to payment is legally unrelated to any promises made about the product.the seller may,prior to the sale,have arranged to have the debt instrument held by someone other than himself he may have sold the debt instrument at a discount after the purchase.from the consumer point of view,the timing and means by which the transfer was effected are irrelevant.he has been left without ready recourse.he must pay the full amount of his obligation.he has a product that yields less than its promised value.and he has been robbed of the only realistic leverage he possessed that might have forced the seller to provide satisfaction his power to withhold payment.
as one court noted,before this rule was adopted t he reciprocal duties of the buyer and seller which were mutually dependent under ordinary contract law became independent of one another.thus,the buyer duty to pay the creditor was not excused upon the seller failure to perform.in abrogating the holder in due course rule in consumer credit transactions,the ftc preserved the consumer claims and defenses against the.the ftc rule was therefore designed to reallocate the cost of seller misconduct to the creditor.the commission felt the creditor was in a better position to absorb the loss or recover the cost from the guilty party the seller.home sav.ass guerra.music acceptance,supra,th at,d.
in music acceptance,we further noted the importance of following the plain meaning of the language required by the holder rule as follows i t is irrelevant whether the ftc rule applies.even if such a notice was not required to be given,the fact remains that it was lofing contract included the precise language mandated by the ftc rule.put simply,lofing is in the same position whether we apply the ftc rule,the unruh act,or the language of his particular contract.id.at,d.even though our prior resolution of the meaning of the language required by the holder rule did not constitute the rule of decision in music acceptance,we continue to adhere to the plain meaning of the language required by the holder rule.
the holder rule unambiguously allows the buyer to assert against the holder of a consumer credit contract all claims and defenses which the debtor could assert against the seller of goods or services obtained pursuant hereto or with the proceeds of the financing.italics added.the plain meaning of the phrase all claims and defenses which the debtor could assert against the seller encompasses not only the defensive claims that a buyer might have but also includes causes of action that a buyer might assert against the seller.the clear and unambiguous language of the contractual provision notifies all potential holders that,if they accept an assignment of the contract,they will be stepping into the seller shoes.the will become subject to any claims or defenses the debtor can assert against the seller.the notice does not say that a seller will be liable for the buyer damages only if the buyer received little or nothing of value under the contract.nor does the notice purport to limit a liability in such fashion.oxford finance companies,velez.thus,we agree with the ftc recent explanation that a creditor or assignee of the contract is thus subject to all claims or defenses that the consumer could assert against the seller.the holder rule does not create any new claims or defenses for the consumer it simply protects the consumer existing claims and defenses.federal trade commission advisory opinion may,at.
although the ftc original adoption of the holder rule in was accompanied by statements indicating claims were limited to instances in which the consumer received little or nothing in value for the transaction,we decline to depart from the clear language required by the holder rule.fundamentally,the holder rule language for contracts constitutes a notice to consumers.to ensure the notice is conspicuous,the language must be set forth in a typeface that is at least points in size,bold,and uses all capital letters.it would be antithetical to the language and its typographic emphasis to hold that the holder rule language does not mean what it says.w here the language of a statute is unambiguous,we may only look to its plain meaning unless this would frustrate its apparent purpose or lead to an absurd result.williams superior court th,d souza lauppe th,d.here the language of the statute is plain,a plain reading does not frustrate the apparent purpose of the statute,and no absurdity results.we therefore decline defendant invitation that we engage in a hermeneutic exercise to demonstrate that the statute means something other than what it says.mocek alfa leisure,th,d see also lozada dale baker oldsmobile,d,no basis exists for referring to the commentary to understand the meaning of language that is unambiguous on its face.based on the plain meaning of the holder rule,we reject wells fargo argument that it is limited to the rare situation when the seller breach of contract renders the transaction practically worthless to the consumer.
for the same reason,we decline to follow the reported decisions of other jurisdictions that have departed from the plain meaning of the language required by the holder rule.thus,we reject the approach taken in the case of ford motor credit morgan,ford motor credit.in that case,the court avoided the plain meaning of the holder rule by look ing to the ftc purpose in enacting the rule as a guide to the interpretation of the contract provision.id.at.as ford motor credit notes,the rule was designed to preserve the consumer claims and defenses by cutting off the creditor rights as a holder in due course.ibid.relying on the ftc explanation for the holder rule in the federal regulations,the court noted the agency statement that c onsumers will not be in a position to obtain an affirmative recovery from a creditor,unless they have actually commenced payments and received little or nothing of value from the seller.in a case of,total failure of performance,or the like,we believe the consumer is entitled to a refund of monies paid on account.id.at,quoting ftc statement of basis and purpose.ford motor credit also notes the ftc originally anticipated that the rule would enable the courts to weigh the equities in the underlying sale,and remain the final arbiters of equities between a seller and a consumer.at,quoting fed.reg.at.
cases following ford motor credit similarly resort to the secondary authority of the ftc stated intent in for the holder rule rather than adhering to the plain language employed by the rule.for example,the court in irby greene,d acknowledged that were the plain language of the clause to control,plaintiff would be able to assert any cause of action against lender which she or he might have against the auto dealer,although plaintiff recovery would be limited to the amount actually paid to the dealer.id.at.even so,the irby greene court reasoned,comments published in the federal register by the ftc suggest that the holder rule has certain limits not otherwise present in the clause plain language accord crews altavista motors,d,relying on the ftc statement of basis and purpose mount lasalle bank lake view,same in re hillsborough holdings,same oxford finance companies,velez,supra,at same.our review of case law declining to allow buyers the full panoply of claims and defenses against lenders has not uncovered any decision holding the plain meaning imposes any of the limitations on claims the statement of basis and purpose seems to allow.
wells fargo contends the holder rule language is ambiguous and lenders would be surprised by a construction that deems claims to mean all claims and defenses.we disagree for three reasons.first,the contention contradicts wells fargo admission in the trial court that the terms of the installment contract including the holder rule notice are unambiguous.second,the contention assumes an ambiguity that is at odds with the clear language of the notice required by the holder rule.wells fargo construction of the holder rule renders claims mere surplusage because it endows the term with the same meaning as defenses a term separately used in the holder rule notice.third,it asserts a surprise that is not supported by the development of the case law.
although there is a split of authority over the meaning of the holder rule,reported cases have adhered to the plain meaning of section for more than years.see,lozada dale baker oldsmobile,supra,d at simpson anthony auto sales,d,eachen scott housing systems,hempstead bank babcock misc d,thomas ford motor credit.especially given this court prior construction of the holder rule language in music acceptance,supra,th at pages to,d,our adherence to the plain meaning of the rule should come as no surprise.
we also reject wells fargo assertion the rees levering automobile sales finance act limited the laffertys right to rescission of the installment contract.the rees levering automobile sales finance act,et became effective january.the act replaced the automobile sales act and was designed to provide a more comprehensive protection for the unsophisticated motor vehicle consumer.soon after its enactment,the california supreme court declared the obvious purpose of the statute is to protect purchasers of motor vehicles against excessive charges by requiring full disclosure of all items of cost citation the form and requisites prescribed by the statute are mandatory a contract which does not substantially conform thereto is unenforceable and a buyer who has made payments to the seller under such a contract may recover them stasher harger haldeman cal d,italics in original.hernandez atlantic finance d,fn.omitted.the rees levering act preceded rather than superseded the holder rule.moreover,we perceive nothing in the rees levering act,which was intended to facilitate disclosure to the unsophisticated vehicle purchaser,that undermines the consumer protection conferred by the holder rule.see hernandez,supra,at.
in short,the holder rule allows the laffertys to assert the same claims and defenses against wells fargo that they might otherwise have against geweke.
the limitation on recovery and the need to borrow causes of action 
the laffertys contend they made payments totaling as proved at trial plus fees and taxes of as proved,plus down payment of as proved,plus warranty and insurance of as proved.wells fargo estimates the laffertys have paid only toward the installment contract.on appeal,we do not resolve such contested issues of fact.nonetheless,we hold to the extent the laffertys have causes of action against geweke that are also valid against wells fargo by operation of the holder rule their recovery is limited to the amount they have paid under the installment contract.the holder rule expressly states,recovery hereunder by the debtor shall not exceed amounts paid by the debtor hereunder.italics omitted.
although the holder rule allows claims against sellers to be asserted against lenders,the holder rule does not itself provide a cause of action.more specifically,the laffertys may assert causes of action against wells fargo under the holder rule only to the extent they have separately arising claims against geweke.p rivate actions to vindicate rights asserted under the ftc may not be maintained.holloway bristol myers.thus,the lafferty must borrow a cause of action from another statute or common law source to assert a claim against wells fargo.we examine the laffertys individual causes of action below.
causes of action dismissed by demurrer 
the laffertys contend the trial court erroneously sustained wells fargo demurrer to their causes of action for violation of the clra,negligence,negligent credit defamation,and declaratory and injunctive relief.as to the clra and negligence causes of action,we conclude the trial court erred in sustaining the demurrer.however,we conclude the trial court correctly sustained the demurrer for the causes of action for negligent credit defamation and declaratory and injunctive relief.

violation of the clra 
the laffertys contend their cause of action under the clra was not barred for failure to give the requisite notice to wells fargo.the argument is meritorious.
in demurring to the complaint,wells fargo argued the clra requires that a plaintiff who intends to assert a cause of action for damages under the clra provide the prospective defendants with notice of the alleged violations.the defendants then have days in which to correct the alleged violations.plaintiffs did not comply with the notice and cure requirements of the clra.wells fargo did not advance other grounds for the demurrer to the clra claim.the trial court sustained the demurrer as to the cause of action arising under the clra.
the clra makes unlawful,in civil code section,subdivision a,various unfair methods of competition and unfair or deceptive acts or practices undertaken by any person in a transaction intended to result or which results in the sale or lease of goods or services to any consumer.meyer sprint spectrum cal th,d.it provides that any consumer who suffers damage as a result of an act or practice declared unlawful in the clra may seek to recover actual damages,punitive damages,or injunctive relief.however,the clra includes a prefiling notice requirement on actions seeking damages.at least days before filing a claim for damages under the clra,the consumer must notify the prospective defendant of the alleged violations of the clra and d emand that such person correct,repair,replace or otherwise rectify the goods or services alleged to be in violation thereof,subd.a.if,within this day period,the prospective defendant corrects the alleged wrongs,or indicates that it will make such corrections within a reasonable time,no cause of action for damages will lie kagan gibraltar sav.loan cal d,disapproved on other grounds in meyer sprint spectrum,supra,cal th at,fn,d.morgan v.at t wireless services,th,d.
the laffertys assert the clra notice requirements were satisfied by their january,letter to fleetwood a letter described in and attached to their operative complaint.the january letter informed fleetwood that the laffertys told geweke about problems with the motor home after their first trip in november.they explained the mechanical and electrical failures were never remedied even though geweke repeatedly assured them the problems would be fixed.in response to a request for admission,wells fargo acknowledged it too received the january letter.moreover,the laffertys notified wells fargo directly on february,that they would stop making payments until the motor home was repaired.wells fargo also acknowledged receiving this letter.
the laffertys january and february,letters sufficiently precede the filing of their complaint to satisfy the clra.moreover,even if the historical fact of notice to wells fargo were an issue,it would not have rendered the complaint defective as a matter of law for purposes of demurrer.as this court has previously held,demurrer tests the pleading alone and not the evidence or other extrinsic matters which do not appear on the face of the pleading or can not be properly inferred from the factual allegations of the complaint.executive landscape san vicente country villas iv d.bach mcnelis d,italics added.
here,the face of the pleading describes how the laffertys complied with the clra notice requirement.if their notice was deficient,demurrer is not the procedural vehicle for proving that fact.bach mcnelis,supra,d at.accordingly,the trial court erred in sustaining the demurrer as to the cause of action arising under the clra.
negligence 
the laffertys next argue the trial court erred by sustaining the demurrer to their cause of action for negligence.we agree.
the lafferty operative complaint alleged as its eighth cause of action negligence on grounds that defendants owed a duty to the lafferty s to diligently,competently and timely complete repairs to the motor home in a workmanlike manner,and failed to do so.the laffertys further alleged they notified defendants fleetwood,geweke and wells fargo of their breach of warranty in january sic.they notified defendants again on april,that they had elected to return the motor home.citation.the defendants and each of them,have refused to accept return of the motor home and to act accordingly in conformity to law.as to wells fargo,the laffertys also alleged wells fargo falsely reported to various credit rating agencies that they had defaulted in their obligation,and failed to report that payment of the amounts that wells fargo claimed were due,were in fact legitimately disputed in relation to a breach of warranty.thus,alleged the laffertys,wells fargo violated its fiduciary relationship with and breached its duty of care to them by failing to correctly ascertain the status of their payments,by falsely reporting to various credit reporting agencies the status of their account,and by knowingly negligently reporting false and incorrect credit information.
in response,wells fargo sought dismissal of this cause of action for negligence by contending it is preempted by the federal fair credit reporting act.more specifically,wells fargo argued,the federal fair credit reporting act et preempts all common law causes of action based on alleged injury arising from the reporting of credit information by a furnisher of credit.wells fargo offered no other basis for the demurrer to the eighth cause of action.
both wells fargo argument and the trial court order sustaining the demurrer to the eighth cause of action for negligence seem to have mistaken the claim for negligence for the negligent defamation of credit claim in the eleventh cause of action.the gravamen of the negligence cause of action was the failure to repair the motor home,not the derogatory remarks made on the laffertys credit history.
the federal fair credit reporting act et fcra concerns only issues related to credit reporting.sanai
