james and elizabeth cetto seek to rescind the refinancing of their virginia home based on their claim that the total points and fees charged in the transaction qualified the loan as what is commonly referred to as a mortgage under the truth in lending act tila as amended by the home ownership and equity protection act hoepa,which entitled them to specific disclosures and terms that they were not afforded a mortgage is one in which the points and fees exceed of the total loan amount.see aa b i.to support their claim,the cettos contend that title search and title binder fees charged by the settlement agent at closing,which are usually not includable as points and fees,should be included in the calculation of points and fees in this case because the settlement agent was affiliated with the mortgage broker on the transaction and the mortgage broker in turn was a creditor on the loan,as they claim that term is defined in f.they argue that the mortgage broker was a creditor because the mortgage broker had served as a lender on previous occasions in unrelated transactions,thus falling within their definition of creditor,which is based on their interpretation of the last sentence of f.
it is undisputed by the parties that the settlement agent in this case was affiliated with the mortgage broker and that if the mortgage broker meets the definition of creditor in f and regulation z under it,the fees paid to the settlement agent for the title search and title binder would have to be included as part of the points and fees charged on the transaction,making the loan a mortgage.
we conclude,as did the district court,that the mortgage broker in this case was not a creditor as defined in f,and therefore the title search and title binder fees paid to the settlement agent were not includable as part of the points and fees charged.without the inclusion of the title search and title binder fees,the loan to the cettos was not a mortgage and therefore did not require the additional disclosures and protections of tila and hoepa.accordingly,we affirm the judgment of the district court.
following a solicitation from savings first mortgage,llc,james and elizabeth cetto decided to refinance their home in dale city,virginia,so that they could cash out and have some money to do whatever they needed to do in cetto business and at home.savings first,functioning as a mortgage broker,obtained a adjustable interest rate loan for the cettos from morequity,at an initial interest rate of,subject to adjustments thereafter based on market conditions.savings first charged the cettos for broker and processing fees.
through the refinancing transaction,which closed on april,the cettos borrowed,with which they paid off their previous mortgage and debts recorded against their house,as well as the costs and fees of the refinancing.they then took the balance in cash.with the cash,they fixed up their house,paid some bills,and took a vacation.
settlement of the new loan was conducted by accurate settlement services,an affiliate of savings first,as defined by k.the settlement sheet,which the cettos signed and dated at the closing on april,discloses that from the proceeds of the loan,the cettos paid 
the prior mortgage and other debts recorded against their house in the amount of 
amounts charged by third parties for appraisal,a title search and title binder,insurance,tax stamps,and property taxes,in the total amount of 
prepaid finance charges of including a loan discount,mortgage broker and processing fees,mortgage underwriting and administration fees,flood certification fee,and release fee and 
interest for days,in the amount of.
the balance was paid to the cettos.the settlement sheet discloses,as significant to tila and hoepa,that the total loan amount as defined by statute was and that the points and fees as defined by statute were.the cost of the loan therefore was,rendering the loan not a mortgage because the points and fees were not greater than of the amount financed.see aa b i.
about three months after the refinancing closed,on july,morequity sold the loan and mortgage to lehman brothers as part of a package of loans bundled for investment purposes,denominated as structured asset investment loan series,and lasalle bank national association was appointed the trustee of the bundled asset.for purposes of the cettos claims in this case,lasalle bank stands in the place of morequity,the original lender.see d.
the refinancing increased the cettos monthly payment on their home from per month to per month including real estate taxes and insurance,which the cettos found stressful.cetto said he knew his monthly payment would go up,but he did not know that it would be that much.in addition,after reviewing the closing costs,cetto observed that they were unexpectedly high.as he testified in deposition,after the cancellation period had elapsed when he reviewed the loan papers i noticed,you know,wow,this is high.
by letters dated september and,some months after closing,addressed to the servicing agent for the bundled loans asset,cetto stated that he was rescinding the refinancing transaction,claiming violations of tila,hoepa,and the real estate settlement procedures act,as well as other consumer protection statutes.when his demand for rescission was rejected on the basis that the cettos loan did not qualify for the more generous rescission provision of hoepa,the cettos commenced this action against lasalle bank,as assignee of the loan and mortgage.
in their complaint,the cettos alleged that the refinancing loan was a mortgage,as defined by aa b i,because,according to their calculation,the total points and fees exceeded of the total loan amount.to support their claim that the loan cost them more in points and fees than,they included as points and fees paid to accurate settlement,the settlement agent,for its title search and title binder.they claimed,therefore,that federal law entitles them to disclosures and terms that were not provided.based on these violations,they alleged that they are entitled to rescission,statutory damages and other damages,attorneys fees,and costs.
lasalle bank denied that the settlement agent fees were properly includable as points and fees to determine whether the transaction qualified as a mortgage,and it also filed a for,plus interest,attorneys fees,and costs,alleging that the cettos failed to make payments on the loan since august,and that the loan therefore is in default.
on for summary judgment,the district court denied the cettos motion and granted lasalle bank motion.the court concluded that savings first was not a creditor on the transaction but rather acted only as the mortgage broker in that it did not lend any money to the cettos.therefore the fees paid to accurate settlement,an affiliate of savings first,for its title search and title binder were not points and fees charged by a creditor or one affiliated with a creditor.from the district court judgment dated june,the cettos filed this appeal.
the only issue raised on appeal is whether,under tila and hoepa,the definition of creditor,as set forth in f,includes a person who acted only as a mortgage broker in the particular transaction,but who had acted as a lender in the past for unrelated transactions.this issue,which requires a construction of f,is one of first impression.
in greater particularity,the cettos seek rescission of their refinancing loan and damages because of various violations of tila and hoepa,which require a lender to make certain disclosures and prohibit certain loan terms if the loan qualifies as what is commonly referred to as a mortgage.a loan is a mortgage when the total points and fees payable by the consumer at or before closing exceed percent of the total loan amount.aa b i.the cettos maintain that the points and fees calculation for their loan failed to include paid to accurate settlement for the title search and title binder.when those charges are included as costs,the points and fees paid by the cettos exceed,triggering the additional protections that hoepa added when it amended tila.
the cettos claim,therefore,depends on whether the title search and title binder fees paid to accurate settlement at closing were properly excluded from the calculation of points and fees in determining whether their loan was a mortgage.if those fees were properly excluded,the total points and fees charged were lower than of the total loan amount but if those fees are includable,then the points and fees exceed and the cettos would be entitled to relief.
the facts are not in dispute,and the question reduces to one of statutory interpretation,which we review de novo.see holland pardee coal,cir.
under hoepa,the threshold for the mortgage protections is determined by dividing the total points and fees payable by the consumer by the total loan amount to determine whether that ratio exceeds.total points and fees on a mortgage means 
a all items included in the finance charge,except interest or the differential 
b all compensation paid to mortgage brokers 
c each of the charges listed in section e of this title except an escrow for future payment of taxes,unless 
i the charge is reasonable 
ii the creditor receives no direct or indirect compensation and 
iii the charge is paid to a third party unaffiliated with the creditor and 
d such other charges as the board determines to be appropriate.
aa emphasis added.section e,in turn,lists the following fees 
fees or premiums for title examination,title insurance,or similar purposes.
fees for preparation of documents.
escrows for future payments of taxes and insurance.
fees for notarizing deeds and other documents.
appraisal fees,including fees related to any pest infestation or flood hazard inspections conducted prior to closing.
credit reports.
e emphasis added.accordingly,fees for title searches and title binders are not included in the calculation of points and fees unless they are unreasonable,the creditor receives direct or indirect compensation in respect to them,or the third party to whom the fees are paid is affiliated with the creditor.
in this case,the parties agree that if the in fees paid to accurate settlement are included in the calculation of points and fees payable by the consumer,the cost of the cettos loan would exceed of the total loan amount.the cettos argue that the fees paid to accurate settlement should be included because accurate settlement was affiliated with the creditor,namely savings first.lasalle bank agrees that accurate settlement is affiliated with savings first,but it contends that savings first was not the creditor,as required by the statute.the statute includes title search and binder fees only if accurate settlement was affiliated with the creditor.see aa c iii.
the issue thus reduces to the question of whether savings first was the creditor on the refinancing transaction.if it was,then the cettos properly claim that fees paid to an affiliate of savings first must be included in the points and fees charged to the cettos.
the tila,as amended by hoepa,defines creditor as follows 
the term creditor refers only to a person who both regularly extends,whether in connection with loans,sales of property or services,or otherwise,consumer credit which is payable by agreement in more than four installments or for which the payment of a finance charge is or may be required,and is the person to whom the debt arising from the consumer credit transaction is initially payable on the face of the evidence of indebtedness or,if there is no such evidence of indebtedness,by agreement.notwithstanding the preceding sentence,in the case of an credit plan involving a credit card,the card issuer and any person who honors the credit card and offers a discount which is a finance charge are creditors.for the purpose of the requirements imposed under part d of this subchapter and sections a,a,a,b,b,b,b,and b of this title,the term creditor shall also include card issuers whether or not the amount due is payable by agreement in more than four installments or the payment of a finance charge is or may be required,and the board shall,by regulation,apply these requirements to such card issuers,to the extent appropriate,even though the requirements are by their terms applicable only to creditors offering credit plans.any person who originates or more mortgages referred to in subsection aa of this section in any period or any person who originates or more such mortgages through a mortgage broker shall be considered to be a creditor for purposes of this subchapter.
f emphasis added.it is undisputed that savings first is not a creditor according to f first sentence,because savings first is not the person to whom the debt arising from the loan is initially payable on the face of the loan documents.the transaction documents show that the cettos loan was initially payable to morequity,not savings first.the cettos argue,however,that the last sentence of f provides a alternative definition of creditor,under which savings first qualifies because it originated two or more mortgages in a period,albeit not the mortgage in this case.they maintain that because savings first originated unrelated loans to other borrowers in the past,savings first,even though only acting as the mortgage broker in this transaction,should be considered a creditor for all of its transactions,including this one.
the language of the first sentence of f is unambiguous in defining creditor to refer only to a person who both regularly extends consumer credit and is the person to whom the debt arising from the consumer credit transaction is initially payable on the face of the evidence of indebtedness f emphasis added.the definition given in this sentence is restrictive and precise,referring only to a person who satisfies both requirements.thus,even if an institution were to extend consumer credit regularly might be still would not be a creditor under the first sentence of f unless it was also the one to which the debt was initially payable.because a mortgage broker is not one to whom the initial debt is payable,neither it nor its affiliates are creditors under this definition.fees paid to the mortgage broker affiliates for title search and binders would accordingly not be included in the calculation of total points and fees.see aa id.e.
the last sentence of f,which the cettos contend provides an alternative definition of creditor,refers only to a person who has originated two or more mortgages in a period or one such mortgage if through a mortgage broker.if the cettos are correct in their construction,the last sentence would so extend the class of creditors as effectively to include any participant in a loan transaction who has ever made one or two loans in the past,eliminating the requirement for that person that it be the one to whom the debt in the given transaction is initially payable.such a construction would not only broaden the definition of creditor to unworkable limits,but it would also make an arbitrary distinction between persons,based on irrelevant aspects of their lending history.thus,in any given transaction,a mortgage broker lending no money in the transaction but who had previously made a thousand loans in which the costs were no more than of the loan amount would not be a creditor,but a mortgage broker who had previously made two loans in which the costs were of the loan amount would be a creditor,regardless of whether it was lending any money in the current transaction.but the statutory language does not support the cettos construction.
first,because the first sentence of f requires that both elements of the test be met for determinations of creditor status,we should not automatically construe the last sentence of f to override either part of the first sentence by implication.to avoid this result,the last sentence must be read to provide additional particularization to the first sentence,clarifying when a person extending a mortgage regularly extends credit such that he is considered to be a creditor for purposes of this subchapter.
second,the last sentence can not stand alone from the first because alone,it has no tie to any extension of credit in the current transaction.any person in the current transaction would be a creditor so long as during some period in its business history it extended two mortgages.the only way to give the content of f a coherent meaning is to take the last sentence as dealing with the frequency with which a person extends installment credit to become one who regularly extends credit,as that phrase is used in the first sentence.
third,the last sentence speaks of any person who originates or more mortgages through a mortgage broker,manifesting the clear understanding that a mortgage broker in a transaction is someone distinct from the creditor.see f emphasis added.maintaining this distinction is confirmed elsewhere in the statute as congress included in the points and fees calculation all compensation paid to mortgage brokers,see aa,making no mention of compensation paid to the brokers affiliates,even though it clearly contemplated and included fees paid to affiliates of the creditor.in arguing that the last sentence provides an alternative,definition of creditor that includes mortgage brokers who have in the past extended credit,the cettos have failed to address this language in aa that clearly includes the fees of mortgage brokers and the fees of affiliates of creditors,while making no mention of the fees paid to affiliates of mortgage brokers.had it been congress intent,that section could have included fees paid to mortgage brokers and their affiliates.but it did not.thus,congress continued its distinction between mortgage brokers and creditors and their respective duties and responsibilities based on their roles in the particular transaction.
fourth,the last sentence speaks of any person who originates or more mortgages,emphasis added,again distinguishing from a mortgage broker.the originator of a mortgage is not the mortgage broker in the transaction because congress would not have used different terms to describe a single entity.indeed,the one who originates a mortgage is the same entity to whom the debt is initially payable,as referred to in the first sentence.
fifth,the cettos argument that because the second and third sentences of f create definitions of creditor,the fourth sentence should also be treated as a definition fails to take into account the historical facts.the first three sentences were definitions in the version of tila.hoepa,which added protections in circumstances when the creditor originates a mortgage,added the last sentence of f as a patch to extend the definition of creditor in the context of mortgages to include persons who have originated only two prior mortgages.
when enacting hoepa in as amendments to tila,congress amended the definition of creditor by adding the last sentence of f.home ownership and equity protection act,c,stat.the senate report explained the addition of that sentence as follows 
the current definition of creditor in excludes those who originate four or fewer mortgages per year.for high cost mortgages,the committee has extended coverage to anyone making a high cost mortgage through a broker and anyone who makes more than one high cost mortgage in a twelve month period.the committee seeks to prevent brokers from evading the legislation by matching each borrower with a different private individual acting as a lender.
at as reprinted in.thus,congress was concerned with persons who were evading the law by arranging loans through individual investors who did not regularly extend credit as it was defined in regulation z at the time.these individuals would serve as the lender for only one or two mortgages,and so did not qualify as creditors by the terms of f first sentence and regulation z definition of regularly extend ing credit,which required more than five previous extensions of credit through mortgages.with no creditor in these transactions,tila would not apply at all.the amendment,thus,was designed to reach such persons who arranged for a group of smaller,less frequent investors to serve as lenders for mortgages,thereby avoiding the requirements of tila simply because they did not regularly extend consumer credit as it was then defined.with the new language,the person making a mortgage loan becomes a creditor for future transactions in which he extends credit even if he originated just two loans in months or even a single loan through a mortgage broker.see f.
in light of this history,nothing can be gained from blindly viewing the structure of f alone,as the cettos suggest.
sixth,the cettos structural argument that because the first three sentences are definitions,so must the last sentence be a definition also fails to consider the substance of each of the sentences.the first sentence defines creditor for installment loans involving both personal property and real property.the second and third sentences define creditor in the credit card context to include a merchant who honors the credit card and the issuer of the card.credit card loans,unlike the loans addressed in the first sentence,are not installment loans indeed,many borrowers pay off their debt in one payment.the fourth and last sentence returns to the subject of the first,addressing creditors in the context of installment loans involving property.the first and last sentences thus are linked by their substantive content.
finally,we believe that a less awkward and surely a less problematic reading,indeed the more natural reading of the entire that construes the first and last sentences in harmony with each take the last sentence to define with more particularity when a person who is making a installment loan regularly extends credit,as that phrase appears in the first sentence.
in sum,the universal definition of creditor in the first sentence of f,the substantive and linguistic connections between the first and last sentences,the differential terminology between creditor and mortgage broker,the history of the last sentence enactment,and common sense directs us to conclude that the last sentence is not a definition,as argued by the cettos,but rather a particularizing clarification of the first sentence,which defines creditor in an installment loan as the person to whom the obligation is initially payable.
in addition to the unambiguous statutory language of tila and hoepa,regulation z,promulgated by the federal reserve board to assist in applying f,provides that creditor can not include a mortgage broker who does not extend credit in the transaction and that the last sentence of f explains the first prong of the creditor definition in the first it means to regularly extend circumstances when mortgages are involved.regulation z defines creditor as 
i a person a who regularly extends consumer credit that is subject to a finance charge or is payable by written agreement in more than installments not including a downpayment,and b to whom the obligation is initially payable,either on the face of the note or contract,or by agreement when there is no note or contract.
a person regularly extends consumer credit only if it extended credit other than credit subject to the requirements of mortgages more than times or more than times for transactions secured by a dwelling in the preceding calendar year.if a person did not meet these numerical standards in the preceding calendar year,the numerical standards shall be applied to the current calendar year.a person regularly extends consumer credit if,in any period,the person originates more than one credit extension that is subject to the requirements of mortgages or one or more such credit extensions through a mortgage broker.
a i emphasis added.footnote of regulation z states that the last sentence of f refers to and further defines part of the first sentence as to who regularly extends credit.thus,a person regularly extends credit as used in part of the first sentence of f when he has extended credit through mortgages more than five times in the previous year or when he has made more than one mortgage previously or just one,if through a mortgage broker,as provided in the last sentence of f.
regulation z thus confirms that the last sentence does not operate as a definition.instead,the regulation creates a structure to define a person who regularly extends consumer credit in the mortgage context.on one level it defines regularly as any person who has extended credit through more than f
