a consumer sued her lender,claiming it had furnished incomplete and inaccurate information to several credit reporting agencies.the trial court granted the lender motion for summary judgment,and the consumer appeals.we agree with the consumer that there are triable issues of material fact,reject the lender federal preemption claims,and reverse the judgment.
in,paula and her husband,david head,who is not a party to this appeal purchased a house on sorrel lane in rolling hills estates.borrowed about from world savings and loan association,signed a note,and secured the loan with a deed of trust on the sorrel lane property.in december,sold the property to louie and frances dileva.with world savings consent,the dilevas assumed loan obligations,and world savings released from all liability under the note and deed of trust.
in,the dilevas started having financial problems and did not make all of their loan payments.around the same time,started having problems with various credit reporting agencies,all of which issued reports suggesting was delinquent in her payments to world savings on the loan assumed by the dilevas.in,the dilevas defaulted,and the trustee recorded a notice of default and election to sell under the deed of trust.repeatedly contacted world savings to request correction of the errors,to no avail.
world savings provides monthly consumer credit reports to the three major credit reporting agencies equifax,experian,and trans union pursuant to contractual subscriber agreements.to do this,world savings produces four sets of identical digital tapes by means of automated sweeps of its customer service files,thereby picking up its customers complete credit histories.according to experian compliance manager,david browne,the tapes must be formatted and encoded pursuant to certain protocols,without which the credit reporting agencies can not properly read the tapes and it is the lenders responsibility to see that the tapes are properly formatted.according to browne,world savings should have used an h code to show that loan had been assumed by another party,order to cut the umbilical cord between the original borrowers and the new people world savings should have used a t code to show that loan had been closed or terminated,and made it clear that had a loan balance.
in july,sued world savings,and in her first amended complaint alleged a claim under the california consumer credit reporting agencies act,civil code section et she alleged the facts summarized in part a,ante,and also alleged that world savings had repeatedly furnished false,inaccurate and misleading information to consumer credit reporting agencies,that she had repeatedly asked world savings to correct the problem but nothing had been done and that,knowing the information was wrong,world savings had continued to provide it to the credit reporting agencies.as a result of world savings false reports,credit rating was adversely affected and her applications for credit to lease an automobile and to obtain a new visa card were denied,all of which caused her personal embarrassment and humiliation.world savings answered and discovery ensued.
in august,world savings moved for summary judgment,and in support of its motion submitted a declaration from linda myers,the assistant vice president and department manager of world savings business operations section and the person with the overall responsibility for overseeing world savings reporting of consumer credit information to the three major credit bureaus,trans union,experian and equifax she stated 
world savings only reports consumer credit information to the three major credit bureaus.world savings has never had a reporting relationship with standfacts credit services and did not report or furnish any credit information about to standfacts credit services.after reviewing world savings files on,it is clear that world savings did not report any incomplete or inaccurate consumer credit information concerning to the major credit bureaus.additionally,world savings did not issue the notice of default on the sorrel lane loan,nor did it furnish that information to any credit reporting agency.the issuance of the notice of default is the exclusive responsibility of the trustee,which in this case was golden west savings association service.notices of default are only recorded as a public record with the county recorder office and sent to those persons entitled to receive them by law by the trustee,not world savings.notices of default are not in any way furnished to credit reporting agencies.
based on my review of,understanding,experience and knowledge of the credit reporting industry and world savings procedures regarding credit reporting,it does not appear that world savings was the source of any adverse credit information concerning which apparently shows up on some of her credit reports.
in opposition to world savings motion,presented evidence of the credit reports issued by experian,equifax,and showed they had received inaccurate information from world savings.
a september report from experian describes the sorrel lane loan as a joint account that was obligated to repay and which was past due.a february report on creditworthiness from western data research describes the sorrel lane loan as delinquent.an april report from experian shows world savings loan as the source of information that foreclosure was started on the sorrel lane loan,and that remained liable on that loan joint with louie dileva.a february report on creditworthiness from standfacts credit services lists world savings in a section captioned open derogatory items.an april report from equifax states that was time days late on the sorrel lane loan,and that this item was disputed by the consumer because account assumed by another party.
contended the negative credit information supported a reasonable inference that,notwithstanding myers declaration to the contrary,world savings had furnished false information to the credit reporting creating a triable issue of material fact,or as put it,even if there were not direct documentary evidence that world savings was the source of the information the only reasonable inference,based on the fact that the information was confidential and not public,is that the source was world savings.
in its reply,world savings presented a supplemental declaration from myers in which she explained that world savings sweeps loan information on the of each month.on january,world savings changed the borrowers names and social security numbers in its computer system to reflect the dilevas assumption of the sorrel lane loan.for reasons that are not clear from myers declaration,the january sweep nevertheless reported as associated with the sorrel lane loan,and the dilevas were first shown as the borrowers on the february,sweep.world savings records to the extent they still exist show the dilevas first delinquency occurred in july,and world savings report to the credit reporting agencies reflected the dilevas as the delinquent borrowers,not.according to myers,no negative reports were issued about.
according to evidence,the problem arose out of a coding error on january,world savings generated an h code to show the assumption which,by itself,was insufficient to prevent future reporting on credit reports.world savings failed to use the required t code to show the loan was closed.later at some point before august,world savings report to experian added a b code terminating a joint account relationship and an h code with regard to not as to.in april,world savings prepared a form intended to advise the credit reporting agencies that the status of loan should be changed from adverse to favorable because the loan had been assumed by the dilevas,but again failed to use the required t code.as of september,experian records showed jointly liable with the dilevas it was not until april that world savings told trans union to correct its records,and not until may that world savings told equifax to correct its records.this evidence is uncontroverted.
the trial court granted world savings motion for summary judgment on the ground that t he declaration of linda myers establishes th
