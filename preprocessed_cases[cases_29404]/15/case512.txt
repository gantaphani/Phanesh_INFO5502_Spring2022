background 
farmers cooperative company fcc is an iowa agricultural cooperative that buys and sells grain,feed,fuel and crop inputs.senske son transfer company and jimco enterprises together,senske are north dakota companies located in grand forks,north dakota.among other things,senske runs a used truck business.senske purchased two international harvester semitruck tractors trucks from ruan truck sales ruan,and then resold the trucks to fcc.we refer to the two trucks by the last three digits of their vehicle identification numbers.in april,fcc paid senske for truck.at that point,the truck odometer showed approximately miles.fcc apparently had a positive experience with truck and decided to pursue purchasing another truck from senske.eight months after purchasing the first truck,fcc bought truck for.at the time of purchase,truck odometer showed about miles.
fcc manager bryan korynta and another fcc employee drove to senske grand forks facility to pick up truck on december.korynta planned to drive the truck to sioux falls,south dakota,to have it outfitted to carry a petroleum tank.on the way to sioux falls,korynta noticed that the odometer had stopped working.korynta called senske sales representative,grinde,and reported the problem.grinde assured korynta that he would personally come out and replace the odometer.
fcc received truck from the sioux falls facility in late january.the day after it arrived,an fcc employee found a next service sticker under the driver seat indicating that the truck was scheduled for its next service at miles.according to fcc manager bryan korynta,truck also began leaking and burning excessive amounts of oil within days of placing it into service.
now suspicious about the mileage,korynta had the truck electronic control system that stores the actual mileage.the electronic control module ecm test showed that truck had about more miles than what its odometer showed.korynta testified that he called grinde to confront him about the ecm test results.according to korynta,grinde offered him a thousand dollars to keep his mouth shut,but korynta refused.fcc then had the other truck,truck,tested.truck ecm test showed that its odometer was also about miles behind.
fcc contacted its attorney who sent senske a letter noting demanding a refund for both trucks.in response,senske president,james senske,sent a letter in which he did not deny fcc accusations of odometer tampering,but stated that senske did not guaranty mileage and therefore would not accept return of the trucks.
fcc continued to use truck without incident.truck,on the other hand,was burning and leaking excessive amounts of oil.however,according to fcc,a shortage of replacement trucks forced it to continue using truck for ten months,despite its problems.when fcc did take the truck to be serviced,it learned that the truck engine and transmission needed replacing.fcc had the engine and transmission work done at total cost of.
fcc eventually brought suit under the federal odometer act,et.section provides that a person may not disconnect,reset,alter,or have disconnected,reset,or altered,an odometer of a motor vehicle intending to change the mileage registered on the odometer.section a imposes liability of times the actual damages or,whichever is greater on those who intentionally tamper with a vehicle odometer with an intent to defraud.in addition,section b provides that t he court shall award costs and a reasonable attorney fee to plaintiffs when judgment is entered in their favor.fcc requested trial by jury.
senske filed a complaint against ruan,the party from whom it had bought the trucks.on summary judgment,the district court dismissed senske claims.the court found that the allegations against ruan amounted to nothing more than pure speculation unsupported by the record.farmers coop.senske son transfer,wl,at.
after a trial in april,a jury found that senske had changed the mileage on the odometers with an intent to defraud.the jury concluded that fcc was entitled to in damages attributable senske fraudulent conduct.pursuant to a,the district court trebled the damages.the court next added in prejudgment interest and amended the damages to also include in stipulated costs and for fcc attorney fees.this brought fcc total judgment to 
on april,senske filed a motion for a new trial.the district court denied the motions based on its conclusions that the verdict was supported by substantial evidence and that senske had failed to present any argument to warrant a new trial.farmers coop.senske son transfer,wl,at july.senske timely appealed to this court.we have jurisdiction over the appeal pursuant to.
on appeal,senske argues that the damages awarded by the jury are not supported by the evidence,that the district court abused its discretion by refusing to bifurcate damages from liability,and that the jury instructions and verdict form were insufficient.senske also argues that the district court erred in denying its multiple requests to delay the trial and in conducting the trial in a manner detrimental to senske.last,senske challenges the district court award of attorney fees and prejudgment interest.we affirm the judgment in its entirety.
the jury found senske liable for odometer fraud and determined that fcc actual damages were.the jury verdict form indicated in damages for truck and in damages for truck.as it did in a motion before the district court,senske asserts on appeal that it is entitled to a new trial because the record evidence does not support the jury damages verdict.we will only reverse a district court denial of a motion for a new trial based on the sufficiency of evidence for a clear abuse of discretion.morgan city of marmaduke,cir.
senske objection is twofold.first,senske takes issue with the jury allotment for truck because it includes both the difference between fcc purchase price and the truck actual mileage fair market value fmv,as well as expenses associated with the repairs.senske argues that this amounts to improper double collection on fcc actual damages.according to senske,the difference between the fmv and the sales price fully compensated fcc for truck worn out engine and transmission.second,senske also challenges the jury verdict,charging that fcc failed to show the causal connection between the odometer tampering and the needed repairs.
we reject senske argument that fcc has been unjustly enriched by collecting both its repair costs and the difference between the price fcc paid for truck and the fmv given the truck actual milage.under a,actual damages include the purchase price of the vehicle less its fmv given the vehicle actual mileage,and any expenses shown to be attributable to the defendant wrongful acts.see duval midwest auto city,defining actual damages under the odometer fraud statute to be the meaning commonly applied to fraud cases,the difference between the amount plaintiff paid and the fair market retail value of the vehicle with number of miles actually traveled,plus such outlays as are legitimately attributable to acts of the defendant,but finding that plaintiff had not shown any expenses attributable to the odometer tampering beyond the fmv price difference,affd.cir oettinger lakeview motors,same williams toyota of jefferson,same beachy eagle motors,same gonzales van chevrolet,same.the district court did not err when it permitted fcc to recover,in addition to the price difference attributable to the fraud,the repair costs that the jury found were proximately caused by senske misconduct.
we also conclude that fcc presented the jury with substantial evidence that the in damages for truck were attributable to senske wrongful acts.fcc expert,swanson,testified that he was very confident that if the mileage shown on truck odometer had been accurate,it would not have needed a new engine.in addition,fcc mechanic,brownmiller,testified that it would be out of the ordinary for truck to need a new transmission if the truck actual mileage had been what its odometer indicated.this is sufficient evidence for a jury to attribute the bill for replacing truck engine and transmission to senske wrongful conduct.we also find it entirely reasonable
