introduction 
a year after refinancing a loan they had obtained from pacific shore funding,zoran and monika lozo attempted to rescind the original loan transaction on the ground pacific shore had violated various disclosure requirements of the truth in lending act tila et,as amended by the home ownership and equity protection act of hoepa,aa.the trial court granted pacific shore summary judgment motion following king state of cal.cir,cert.den.king california,d,rehg.den,d king,ruling that once having refinanced their first loan,the lozos had nothing left to rescind.
in the published portion of this opinion,we decline to follow king,and are instead persuaded by the reasoning of myriad federal courts from other circuits.we hold that borrowers are not precluded from rescinding a consumer credit transaction that is secured by their residence and subject to tila merely because they have already refinanced that loan.
in the unpublished portion,we hold that the trial court erred in granting summary judgment of the lozos claim under the unfair business practices act bus,the ucl because a lender violation of tila can be an unfair business practice or act under the ucl.accordingly,the judgment is reversed.

tila,hoepa,and regulation 
congress enacted tila in to protect consumers choice through full disclosure and to guard against the divergent and at times fraudulent practices stemming from uninformed use of credit.citations.king,supra,at.the stated congressional purpose behind tila is to assure a meaningful disclosure of credit terms so that the consumer will be able to compare more readily the various credit terms available to him and avoid the uninformed use of credit,and to protect the consumer against inaccurate and unfair credit billing and credit card practices.a b.
hoepa amends tila to ensure that consumers understand the terms of such loans and are protected from high pressure sales tactics the amendment also prohibits high cost mortgages from including certain terms such as prepayment penalties and balloon payments that have proven particularly problematic,reprinted in cong.admin.news.
toward this end,tila requires that specific disclosures be provided to borrowers of qualifying consumer credit transactions that are secured by the borrowers residence.section of title of the united states code mandates that lenders clearly and conspicuously disclose to borrowers that borrowers have a right to rescind the transaction until midnight of the third business day following consummation of the transaction.a b.hoepa further directs lenders to disclose that borrowers are not required to complete the loan agreement merely because they have received disclosures or signed the loan application that they could lose their home if they do not meet their loan obligations and the percentage rate,the amount of monthly payments,and in the case of adjustable rate loans,that the interest rate and payment could increase.a a.such disclosures must be made not less than business days prior to consummation of the transaction.b.
the remedies under tila include civil liability and damages.if any required disclosures are not given,the borrower right to rescind is extended from three days to three years after the date of consummation of the transaction.a f a.thus,a single violation of tila,whether it be substantive or technical,extends a borrower period for rescission.citations.wiggins avco financial services d,see semar platte valley federal s l ass cir,minor technical,as well as major,violations of tila or regulation z entitle the borrower to rescind.lenders who fail to notify the borrower correctly of the right to rescind are also liable to the borrower for damages plus costs and attorney fees.a,a a a.lenders who omit the disclosures under section are subject to liability in the amount equal to the sum of all finance charges and fees paid by the consumer,unless the failure to comply with the statute is not material.a.
as a consumer protection statute,tila is to be liberally construed in favor of borrowers.wiggins avco financial services,supra,d at riggs government emp.financial cir.
summary judgment of the lozos tila cause of action was improperly granted.
under the undisputed facts,the lozos were entitled to rescind.
