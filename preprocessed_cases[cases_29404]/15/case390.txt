plaintiff,jody holman,seeks our review of the district court dismissal of her second amended complaint for failure to state a claim against defendant,rock financial corporation,under the truth in lending act tila,and subsequent denial of her request to file a third amended complaint.for the following reasons,we reverse the district court dismissal of the second amended complaint,reverse the district court denial of leave to file a third amended complaint,and remand.
background 
on february,plaintiff borrowed money from defendant,a real estate lender,to refinance the purchase of her home.in making and settling the loan,defendant assessed plaintiff certain fees as part of defendant finance charge.prior to closing the loan,defendant disclosed some,but not all,of these fees to plaintiff.specifically,the settlement statement provided to plaintiff at closing identified two previously undisclosed fees a charge of for document preparation and a charge of to the title office for settlement or closing.
on december,plaintiff and,latonya inge inge,filed a complaint,styled as a class action,against defendant in the circuit court for kent county,michigan,seeking damages and injunctive relief and alleging in count i,unfair or deceptive acts or practices pursuant to.comp.laws ann.and in count ii,unauthorized practice of law in count iii,unjust enrichment in count iv,innocent misrepresentation and in count v,negligent misrepresentation.plaintiff and inge attached to their complaint a good faith estimate of loan closing fees issued to inge by defendant,statements of actual loan settlement costs issued by defendant to inge and plaintiff separately or forms,and a guide to settlement costs published by the united states department of housing and urban development hud.several months later,defendant removed the civil action to the united states district court for the western district of michigan.
on september,plaintiff and inge filed an amended complaint asserting tila claims against defendant and attaching copies of the same materials that accompanied the complaint in the state court.on november,defendant filed a motion to dismiss the amended complaint.two weeks later,magistrate judge doyle rowland issued a management order,setting a december,deadline for amendments to the pleadings.plaintiff and inge subsequently filed a timely motion for leave to file a second amended complaint,with accompanying brief and proposed second amended complaint.ten days later,defendant filed a reply brief in support of its motion to dismiss the amended complaint,addressing matters raised in the proposed second amended complaint.plaintiff and inge filed their second amended complaint on january,again attaching documents and a guide to settlement costs by hud.
on april,the district court granted defendant motion to dismiss the tila claims in the second amended complaint.the district court dismissed inge tila claim as pursuant to the statute of limitations in e the district court also held that plaintiff failed to state a claim under the tila because plaintiff had failed to plead that the difference between defendant initially disclosed finance charge and the actual finance charge exceeded,applying the tolerances for accuracy provision of f a.the court then remanded plaintiff remaining state law claims to the kent county circuit court,pursuant to the supplemental jurisdiction and removal statutes,and c.
seven days later,on april,plaintiff filed a motion for leave to file a third amended complaint,desiring to cure the defects in pleading identified by the district court in its order dismissing plaintiff tila claim.plaintiff accompanied the motion with a proposed third amended complaint.the third amended complaint elaborated on plaintiff claim that a fee assessed for document preparation was not bona fide and reasonable,citing document preparation instructions contained in appendix a of regulation x.
on july,the district court denied plaintiff motion for leave to file a third amended complaint.the district court first held that plaintiff had failed to show good cause under.b for modifying the december,amendment deadline set in the scheduling order.in the alternative,the court held that even if plaintiff desire to cure defects in the complaint constituted good cause under rule,plaintiff had not so cured because the third amended complaint still did not satisfy the tolerance.
discussion 
appellate jurisdiction 
prior to addressing the merits of plaintiff appeal,we must determine our jurisdiction.see acquisition,gencorp,cir.our appellate jurisdiction extends to all final decisions of the district courts.a district court decision is final for purposes of when it ends the litigation on the merits and leaves nothing for the court to do but execute the judgment.catlin united states.the question of appellate jurisdiction in this matter arises out of plaintiff notice of appeal,filed in the district court on august,wherein plaintiff references only the district court july,opinion and order denying leave to file a third amended complaint.ordinarily,the district court denial of leave to amend does not constitute an appealable order.soliday miami county,ohio,cir citing caldwell moore,cir.defendant argues that if any order of the district court should be considered final for purposes of authorizing this appeal,it is the district court opinion and order dismissing plaintiff second amended complaint on april.because plaintiff did not take an appeal from the april,order,defendant argues that we should dismiss this appeal on jurisdictional grounds.
we disagree with defendant jurisdictional argument.a timely motion to alter or amend judgment brought pursuant to.e tolls the deadline for filing a notice of appeal during the pendency of the motion to alter or amend.see fed.a.rule e imposes its own deadline for a motion to alter or amend.when a party files a motion to reconsider a final order or judgment within ten days of entry,we will generally consider the motion to be brought pursuant to rule e.cockrel shelby county sch,cir vance ex rel.hammons united states,cir.
here,seven days after entry of the district court order dismissing her second amended complaint,plaintiff filed her motion to file a third amended complaint.plaintiff april,motion makes no mention of rule e and does not facially purport to be a motion for reconsideration of the dismissal order rather,plaintiff references only,and requests leave to file an amended pleading.despite the styling of plaintiff april,motion,we construe the motion as a motion to alter or amend the april,dismissal order.see trotter regents of of,cir widell wolf,cir bodin gulf oil,cir.had the district court granted plaintiff motion and permitted her to file an amended complaint,it would have had to set aside and vacate its dismissal order of april.quartana utterback,cir.the district court july,opinion and order denying plaintiff leave to amend a third time therefore triggered the period for filing her notice of appeal,and plaintiff timely filed her notice of appeal on august.see id.at trotter,at see also brown local,int l of workers,cir construing motion to enter an alternative order as a rule e motion,although the motion did not name rule e and sought vacation of dismissal order,rather than a separately entered judgment pursuant to rule smith hudson,cir explaining that district courts can properly consider rule e motions that precede entry of judgment pursuant to rule and that a motion which asks a court to vacate and reconsider,or even to reverse its prior holding,may properly be treated under rule e as a motion to alter or amend a judgment citations omitted.
similarly,we do not find fatal to our jurisdiction the language contained in plaintiff notice of appeal.while plaintiff stated in her notice that she was tak ing an appeal from the july,denial of the motion to amend,it is abundantly clear to us that plaintiff sought our review of the district court april,dismissal order as well.both parties fully briefed us on their views of the propriety of the dismissal and dedicated the majority of their time at oral argument to presenting their respective positions on the sufficiency of plaintiff pleadings.see,foman davis,d noting,in concluding that the petitioner intended to appeal both the dismissal and denial of motions,that the parties briefed and argued the merits of the dismissal.plaintiff failure to name the april,dismissal order in her notice of appeal is,at most,harmless error under the circumstances of this case,and we will not view it as an obstacle to our jurisdiction.see am.employers ins.metro regional transit,cir concluding that failure to identify underlying judgment in second notice of appeal that named only the denial of a motion was harmless error boburka adcock,cir holding that failure to name a directed verdict in notice of appeal from the denial of motions did not defeat jurisdiction when appellant interest in appealing the directed verdict was clear from appellant briefs to the court petru city of berwyn,cir treating notice of appeal from denial of rule e motion as encompassing earlier judgment where the appellant intent to appeal judgment was clear and appellee suffered no prejudice charles alan wright,arthur miller,mary kay kane,federal practice and procedure,at ed if an appeal is erroneously taken from the denial of the motion,rather than from the judgment,the court will treat the appeal as being from the judgment.but united states universal mgmt,cir finding no appellate jurisdiction over denial of a motion to reconsider where the notice of appeal named only the prior order granting summary judgment.
ii.dismissal of plaintiff second amended complaint 
we review de novo the district court order granting a motion to dismiss for failure to state a claim upon which relief may be granted pursuant to.b.hammons norfolk,cir.we must accept all factual allegations of the complaint as true and construe the complaint in the light most favorable to the plaintiff.turker ohio dep t of rehab,cir.dismissal is proper only if it is clear that no relief could be granted under any set of facts that could be proved consistent with the allegations.hishon king spalding,d.
one of the primary purposes of the tila is to assure a meaningful disclosure of credit terms so that the consumer will be able to compare more readily the various credit terms available to him and avoid the uninformed use of credit.a.empowered in a to carry out the purposes of the tila through regulations,the federal reserve board promulgated regulation z,to promote the informed use of consumer credit by requiring disclosures about its terms and costs.b.prior to extending credit to a consumer in a residential mortgage transaction,among the items a creditor must disclose is the estimated finance charge the creditor will impose.a,b.a creditor who fails to make the required disclosures is liable to the consumer for damages,costs,and attorney fees.a.plaintiff claims that defendant violated the tila by failing to disclose,as part of its finance charge,its fees for document preparation and settlement or closing prior to the settlement date.plaintiff second amended complaint makes a specific demand for damages equal to the document preparation fee.
the tila defines finance charge as the sum of all charges,payable directly or indirectly by the person to whom the credit is extended,and imposed directly or indirectly by the creditor as an incident to the extension of credit.a.in computing the amount of the finance charge to be disclosed to the consumer,a creditor may exclude,among other items,f ees for preparation of documents.e.regulation z similarly allows a creditor to exclude f ees for preparing documents,such as deeds,mortgages,and reconveyance or settlement documents,but only if the fees are bona fide and reasonable.c ii.in paragraph of her second amended complaint,plaintiff alleges that defendant previously undisclosed document preparation fee was not bona fide and reasonable within the meaning of the tila.at.plaintiff specifically alleges defendant prepared the mortgage and promissory note but retained a fee in excess of defendant cost.
a finance charge also does not include fees and amounts imposed by third party closing agents including settlement agents,attorneys,and escrow and title companies if the creditor does not require the imposition of the charges or the services provided and does not retain the charges.a.in paragraph of her second amended complaint,plaintiff alleges that defendant required the services for which the settlement or closing fee was imposed and that the service was not primarily an excludable activity.at.
failure to plead disclosure variance exceeding 
defendant argues,and the district court concluded,that the allegations of plaintiff second amended complaint are insufficient as a matter of law because,before inviting examination of the bona fide or reasonable nature of defendant document preparation charges or the propriety of excluding settlement or closing fees,the tolerances for accuracy provision of tila,f,required plaintiff to allege in the complaint that the amount defendant disclosed as the finance charge varied from the amount it actually charged by more than.plaintiff failed to allege this amount,defendant argues,and therefore plaintiff tila claim must fail.
pursuant to f,a creditor finance charge disclosure shall be treated as being accurate if the amount disclosed as the finance charge does not vary from the actual finance charge by more than.f a.although defendant does not cite specific statutory,regulatory,or case authority mandating that a tila plaintiff must allege,pursuant to f,a finance charge disclosure variance greater than to state a claim,the district court buttressed its conclusion that tila required such an allegation on barry mortgage servicing acquisition.in barry,the plaintiff alleged that the understated the finance charge and overstated the amount financed as a matter of practice in their consumer credit transactions.see id.at.the barry defendants argued that a class action claim advanced by the plaintiff failed as a matter of law because the plaintiff had failed to allege disclosure errors exceeding.id.at.in granting the defendants motion to dismiss the plaintiff tila class claim for failure to allege a disclosure variance greater than,the barry court relied upon a amendment to the tila,codified as a.
section a provides,in relevant part 
for any closed end consumer credit transaction that is secured by real property or a dwelling,that is subject to this subchapter,and that is consummated before september,a creditor or any assignee of a creditor shall have no civil,administrative,or criminal liability under this subchapter for,and a consumer shall have no extended recission rights under section f of this title with respect to 
any disclosure relating to the finance charge imposed with respect to the transaction if the amount or percentage actually disclosed 
a may be treated as accurate for purposes of this subchapter if the amount disclosed as the finance charge does not vary from the actual finance charge by more than 
a a examining the legislative history behind the amendments to the tila,the barry court concluded that congress intended to impose a retroactive tolerance level of for disclosure violations.barry.at.although the class claims could not go forward in barry because the plaintiff had not alleged disclosure errors greater than the tolerance level,the plaintiff individual tila claim survived because b specifically exempted individual claims filed prior to june,from the tolerance requirement.see id.at.
we believe that the barry case supports neither defendant argument nor the district court conclusion that f requires a plaintiff to allege a variance of greater than as an essential element of a tila disclosure claim.first,the barry case only concerned a,which by its own terms is limited to credit transactions consummated before september.the credit transaction between defendant and plaintiff consummated on february,and is thus outside the scope of a.see moore flagstar bank,d,explaining that the plain language of a confirms its retroactive application to transactions consummated before this date kislak mortgage,noting application of a to,transactions.second,while the district court in barry dismissed the plaintiff class claim under a for failing to allege a variance exceeding,the court allowed the plaintiff individual claim to proceed,as exempt under b.third,the district court did not address the tolerance provision of f,also added to tila by amendment in.see,historical and statutory notes.finally,and most notably,a,the statutory basis for the barry court holding on the tila class claim,contains clear language submitting creditors to no civil,administrative,or criminal liability arising out of a disclosure variance of less than.a a emphasis added.section f,in comparison,treats disclosure variances as accurate if within the tolerance,but does not include any language explicitly absolving creditors from liability.f.we believe these distinctions render cases,such as barry,construing a inapposite to our examination of f.
our examination of f leads us to conclude that it does not impose an independent pleading hurdle for tila plaintiffs.our conclusion stems from the general nature of the tila as a whole,as well as the intent of congress in promulgating the tolerance provision in.as a remedial statute,we must construe tila terms liberally in favor of consumers.see begala pnc bank,ohio,ass n,cir murphy household fin,cir see also freed,bd.of governors of the fed.reserve,cir the act is remedial in nature,designed to remedy what congressional hearings revealed to be unscrupulous and predatory creditor practices throughout the nation.footnote and citations omitted.when we apply the tila liberally in favor of plaintiff,we reach the conclusion that congress remedial purpose for tila is best effectuated by construing the f tolerance provision as a potential affirmative defense,rather than as an essential element of a finance charge disclosure claim.moreover,in comparison to the stronger language of a explicitly precluding liability for creditors under specified circumstances,merely states that disclosures shall be treated as being accurate.a.at least one district court has refused to employ even the stronger language of a as a bar to a tila claim,adhering to a more construction of the tila.see weil long island savings bank,d.we therefore reject as inconsistent with the purposes of tila the district court view that a plaintiff must allege a variance exceeding the tolerance to state a claim.
our conclusion is reinforced by the statements of senator sarbanes,then the ranking democratic member and now chairperson of the banking committee,offered during senate consideration of the amendments 
this bill increases the tolerance for statutory damages,lifting the bar that determines what constitutes a violation 
this increased tolerance for errors is intended to protect lenders from the small errors of judgment that occurred in the rodash case.it is obviously not intended to give lenders the right to pad fees up to the tolerance limit of.for example,if a delivery associated with the closing cost on a home mortgage costs,should be charged and disclosed as part of the finance charge.a lender can not arbitrarily raise an additional simply because there is a wider tolerance.
cong.rec.s daily ed,statement of senator sarbanes.senator sarbanes comments,particularly his condemning the padding of fees up to the tolerance,continue to demonstrate congress intent to protect consumers against questionable lending practices.at the same time,as senator sarbanes explained,lenders also receive protection through the tolerance provision where they can show their disclosure minimally deviates from the actual amount charged.the overriding policy behind the tila,however,remains focused on consumer protection the responsibility to allege the minimal nature of the disclosure,and therefore the absence of a violation,should rest with the lender.
we therefore conclude that the district court erred in dismissing plaintiff second amended complaint for failure to allege a variance between the disclosed and actual finance charges exceeding the tolerance for accuracy of f.
exclusion of challenged fees 
although the district court focused almost exclusively on the tolerance provision in dismissing plaintiff second amended complaint,defendant argues that the allegations of plaintiff second amended complaint fail to state a tila disclosure claim because defendant was under no obligation to include the fees for document preparation and settlement or closing in its presettlement disclosures.while we believe the allegations of plaintiff second amended complaint adequately challenge defendant undisclosed document preparation fee,plaintiff allegations regarding fees for settlement and closing do not sufficiently state that these fees were from the finance charge.
fees for document preparation 
e lists certain items a creditor shall not include in computing the finance charge.among these items are f ees for preparation of documents.e.in its similar list of excludable fees contained in c,the federal reserve board excludes from the finance charge f ees for preparing documents,such as deeds,mortgages,and reconveyance or settlement documents,if the fees are bona fide and reasonable in amount.c ii see also supp.i,official staff interpretations,c in all cases,charges excluded under c must be bona fide and reasonable.
plaintiff second amended complaint alleges that defendant document preparation fee was not bona fide and reasonable and that defendant imposed the charge to cover its costs of preparing the mortgage and promissory note.plaintiff further alleges that the document preparation fee exceeded the cost of preparing the note and mortgage.defendant contends that these allegations are conclusory and lack sufficient factual components to state a tila violation.
defendant argues that plaintiff second amended complaint demonstrates that the document preparation fee was bona fide by alleging that defendant prepared the mortgage and note documents.concerning the reasonableness requirement,defendant argues that plaintiff allegation that the fee charged exceeded defendant cost is insufficient.according to defendant,to state a claim of improperly excluded document preparation fees,plaintiff was required to allege facts showing defendant charges differed from those of other local businesses.plaintiff complaint does not allege specific facts distinguishing defendant fees from others in the locality,and thus defendant argues that plaintiff complaint fails to state that defendant fees were unreasonable and ineligible for exclusion from the finance charge.
we can not agree with defendant analysis of plaintiff document preparation allegations.even though some discovery has apparently taken place during the course of this litigation,the district court dismissed plaintiff tila claim on a rule b motion,rather than on summary judgment.considering only the standard applicable to motions under rule b,whether it is clear that no relief could be granted under any set of facts that could be proved consistent with the allegations,hishon,at,plaintiff complaint is not so lacking as to foreclose any recovery for failure to disclose the document preparation fees.for instance,plaintiff alleges that the document preparation charge was not reasonable.this allegation invites some degree of inquiry into the facts and circumstances of the case,generally inappropriate at the pleadings stage,although perhaps resolvable on summary judgment after discovery.smith fid.consumer discount,cir remanding tila claim for resolution of material question of fact about reasonableness and bona fide nature of document preparation fees in re grigsby,quoting a treatise for the principles that a fee is bona fide if the creditors employees performed the services and reasonable depending on its comparison to charges imposed by local businesses,vacated on state law grounds only by.plaintiff could conceivably have alleged the unreasonableness of the fees with more detail and specificity,but we do not conclude that her merely describing the fees as not bona fide and reasonable fails to state a claim as a matter of law.
fees for settlement or closing 
a provides the finance charge shall not include fees and amounts imposed by third party closing agents including settlement agents,attorneys,and escrow and title companies if the creditor does not require the imposition of the charges or the services provided and does not retain the charges.in,the southern district of florida provided a succinct explanation of this section if the creditor required a third party to perform a service,is aware that the third party will perform the service,and imposes a separate charge on the consumer for the performance of the service,the fee is a disclosable finance charge.at citations omitted.other courts construing have not viewed the final clause if the creditor does not retain the charges as an additional requirement for tila liability.see,johnson fleet,cir first acadiana bank fed.deposit ins,cir see also a stating that fees charged by a third party closing agent are finance charges only if the creditor requires the services,requires imposition of the charges,or retains a portion of the charge.
the hud form given to plaintiff at closing includes a previously undisclosed settlement or closing fee to the title office of.at.plaintiff second amended complaint alleges that the settlement or closing fee was for a service defendant required and was not primarily for an excludable activity.at.defendant challenges plaintiff allegation regarding the settlement or closing fee as inadequate under regulation 
the staff of the federal reserve board has elaborated on regulation z treatment of closing charges for services provided by third parties the federal reserve board staff has explained 
required closing agent.if the creditor requires the use of a closing agent,fees charged by the closing agent are included in the finance charge only if the creditor requires the particular service,requires the imposition of the charge,or retains a portion of the charge.fees charged by a closing agent may be otherwise excluded from the finance charge under a charge for conducting or attending a closing is a finance charge and may be excluded only if the charge is included in and is incidental to a closing fee excluded under c.
supp.i,official staff interpretations,a.in addition,the federal reserve board staff provides the following explanation for the treatment of lump sum charges 
lump sum charges.if a lump sum charged for several services includes a charge that is not excludable,a portion of the total should be allocated to that service and included in the finance charge.however,a lump sum charged for conducting or attending a closing for example,by a lawyer or a title company is excluded from the finance charge if the charge is primarily for services related to items listed in c for example,reviewing or completing documents,even if other incidental services such as explaining various documents or disbursing funds for the parties are performed.the entire charge is excluded even if a fee for the incidental services would be a finance charge if it were imposed separately.
supp.i,official staff interpretations,c.according to this interpretation,a creditor has fairly broad,but not unlimited,authority to exclude lump sum charges for services provided by third parties.the interpretation goes so far as to allow exclusion where a charge is primarily related to an excludable fee,such as title examination or appraisal fees.see c.
here,for plaintiff to claim that defendant violated tila by excluding the lump settlement or closing fee paid to the title company,plaintiff needed,at a minimum,to identify the service provided by the title company.if,as plaintiff alleges,the service was not primarily for an activity excludable from the finance charge under c,then it would place a minuscule burden on plaintiff to allege what service defendant required the title company to perform.layell home loan inv.bank,remanding to bankruptcy court for determination of which part of a document preparation charge was.in the absence of any allegation of what service the title company provided,plaintiff second amended complaint failed to state a tila violation arising out of undisclosed fees for settlement or closing.
iii.denial of leave to amend 
we also believe the district court erred in denying plaintiff request to file a third amended complaint.the district court stated two reasons for denying plaintiff request to amend failure to demonstrate good cause for delay pursuant to.b and futility under its interpretation of the tila and.b.we ordinarily review the district court denial of a motion to amend a pleading for abuse of discretion.perkins am.power fuel supply,cir see also morales am.honda motor,cir stating that our review of denial of rule e motion is ordinarily for abuse of discretion.when,however,the district court denies the motion to amend on grounds that the amendment would be futile,we review denial of the motion de novo.parry mohawk motors of,cir see also dana blue cross blue shield mut.of ohio,cir reviewing district court denial of rule e motion de novo where district court rejected amended pleading as futile.
insofar as the district court relied on rule b as a basis for denying plaintiff request for leave to amend,we conclude that the district court abused its discretion.pursuant to rule b,a scheduling order establishing deadlines for matters such as joinder and amendments to pleadings shall not be modified except upon a showing of good cause and by leave of the district judge.b.the primary measure of rule good cause standard is the moving party diligence in attempting to meet the case management order requirements.bradford dana,cir citing johnson mammoth recreations,cir see also parker columbia pictures,cir joining eighth,ninth,and eleventh circuits in construing good cause as depending on the movant diligence.another relevant consideration is possible prejudice to the party opposing the modification.see bradford,at citing johnson,at.
the district court found an absence of good cause under rule b because plaintiff sought to remedy the matters giving rise to dismissal of her second amended complaint.the district court based its finding on an unpublished decision of this court,lower albert,wl cir.july.in lower,a panel of this court found that the district court did not abuse its discretion in refusing leave to amend when the plaintiffs sought to cure deficiencies identified in their pleading.lower,wl,at.for two reasons,however,lower has little bearing on our review of the district court denial of leave to amend in the instant case.first,this court unpublished decisions are never controlling authority.fonseca consol.rail,cir.second,because the lower court discussed the good cause issue in a very limited fashion,we do not find that panel disposition of the issue to be persuasive.
under the circumstances of the instant case,we believe that plaintiff presented good cause for requesting leave to amend after the expiration of the december,deadline in the scheduling order.defendant first raised the issue of the tolerance provision in its november,motion to dismiss the first amended complaint.even a cursory examination of defendant brief in support of that motion and subsequent reply brief seeking dismissal of the second amended complaint reveals no citation of authority,other than f,suggesting that failure to plead a variance exceeding the tolerance would preclude a tila disclosure claim.when she moved to amend a third time,just days after the dismissal order,plaintiff effectively brought the absence of authority to the district court attention,stating that no published judicial opinion had required a tila plaintiff to allege a variance exceeding the f tolerance provision.given the district court view of the tolerance provision as a legal bar to plaintiff tila claim as well the dearth of authority presented prior to the district court april dismissal order,we do not believe plaintiff failed to act diligently in seeking to file an additional amended pleading several months after expiration of the deadline in the scheduling order.further,because plaintiff request to amend was a prompt effort to remedy pleading deficiencies identified by the district court in the dismissal opposed to an effort to add new claims or envision no prejudice to
