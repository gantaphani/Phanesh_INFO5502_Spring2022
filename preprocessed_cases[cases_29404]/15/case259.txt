in this class action suit,plaintiffs denise minter,jason and rachel alborough,and lizbeth binks brought suit on behalf of a group of consumers alleging that wells fargo and long foster real estate collectively,defendants violated section of the real estate settlement procedures act respa.specifically,plaintiffs allege that defendants created a joint venture,prosperity mortgage company prosperity,to skirt respa prohibition on kickbacks while failing to disclose this business arrangement to its customers.
after a trial on a portion of plaintiffs claims,the jury returned a verdict that foreclosed plaintiffs untried kickback claims.plaintiffs moved for a new trial on the kickback claims but were denied.due in large part to plaintiffs failure to move for judgment as a matter of law before the jury reached its verdict,as well as the highly deferential lenses through which we must review the issues before us,we conclude that the district court did not abuse its discretion as to any of plaintiffs challenges.accordingly,we affirm.
in,wells fargo and walker jackson mortgage corporation,a subsidiary and affiliate of defendant long foster real estate,formed prosperity mortgage company as a joint venture prosperity was created as a mortgage lender that funded its loans via a wholesale line of credit provided by wells fargo.
plaintiffs denise minter and jason and rachel alborough,along with a class of similarly situated consumers,purchased their homes with a long foster realtor and obtained mortgages through prosperity in and.in late,plaintiffs brought this class action suit alleging that wells fargo and long foster created prosperity as a sham or a front organization formed to facilitate unlawful referral fees and kickbacks in violation of respa,as well as a variety of other state and federal law claims in particular,plaintiffs alleged that defendants created prosperity to allow long foster to refer mortgage clients to wells fargo in exchange for kickbacks.plaintiffs also alleged that prosperity performed little to no real work in connection with the mortgage transactions and that wells fargo was the real lender.plaintiffs asserted three respa violations 
the section a claim alleged that wells fargo paid kickbacks to long foster in exchange for settlement services.
the section c claim alleged that wells fargo and long foster operated prosperity as a sham lender,not a bona fide provider of settlement services,to funnel long foster real estate customers to wells fargo for mortgage products.
the section c claim alleged that defendants,as members of an affiliated business arrangement as defined by respa,did not comply with respa requirement to provide borrowers with valid affiliated business arrangement disclosures.
plaintiffs moved to certify a class for all of their claims.the district court bifurcated plaintiffs proposed class into two separate classes the timely class,including all the class members whose claims were brought within respa statute of limitations,and the tolling class,for all class members whose claims were brought after the statute of limitations period expired.
thereafter,the district court certified plaintiffs section c and c claims,but did not certify the section a claims because only those prosperity clients who were referred to prosperity by long foster may proceed under the section a claim and certifying a for that particular of members would unnecessarily complicate and obscure the central inquiry into prosperity legitimacy as a lender.the district court noted that s hould plaintiffs fail under their section c claims,the court may entertain further briefing with respect to the section a theory.the district court also chose not to certify the tolling class on any of the claims because it did not have a representative member.
in response,plaintiffs amended their complaint to include a new named plaintiff,lizbeth binks,as a representative of the tolling class,and renewed their motion to certify the tolling class on all their claims.the district court reiterated that it would not certify the section a claims for either the tolling or the timely class.after completing a class certification analysis,the district court certified the tolling class on its section c and c claims only.
defendants then moved for summary judgment on the timely and tolling classes claims.the district court denied their motions due to factual disputes that could not be resolved at the summary judgment stage before trial on the section c and c claims,plaintiffs suggested that the individual section a claims,although not certified as a class,should be tried in the same trial.the district court rejected that request,stating that f ollowing the upcoming trial,the court will solicit proposals from the parties related to scheduling a trial of plaintiffs individual a claims.see also plaintiffs individual claims under a will be tried at a later date.
before trial,defendants moved to decertify both the timely and the tolling classes.the district court decertified the tolling class due to the court concerns about the tolling doctrine individualized application the district court also amended the timely class by limiting it to class members who were referred to prosperity by long foster and excluding any class members whose loans were not transferred to wells fargo but were instead sold to others.
also before trial,plaintiffs moved to exclude evidence and argument about whether plaintiffs had suffered economic injury,including testimony from one of defendants experts,marsha courchane.the district court agreed,ruling that courchane testimony and other evidence of a lack of economic damages was minimally relevant and deemed the probative value of the expert testimony substantially outweighed by a danger of unfair prejudice,confusion,misleading the jury,or delay.however,the court stated that it would reconsider that ruling if plaintiffs open ed the door to evidence of economic injury during their.later,the district court ruled that defendants would be allowed to ask about whether plaintiffs shopp ed around for their mortgages and whether they chose prosperity because it was offering better rates,lower costs,or better service.quotation marks omitted.the court explained that this evidence is relevant background on the named plaintiffs claims,distinct from unfairly prejudicial evidence of their lack of economic harm.id.
after resolving these motions,the district court held the trial on plaintiffs section c and section c claims.during this trial,several matters arose to become the bases for the issues now on appeal.first,throughout the trial,plaintiffs objected to defendants questions regarding whether plaintiffs suffered economic harm from using prosperity,whether prosperity loans were competitive in the market,and whether prosperity gave the named plaintiffs the best deal.second,during closing arguments,long foster counsel stated that i think the only thing i agree with for sure is that long foster did refer the named plaintiffs to prosperity.there no dispute about that.third,counsel for prosperity and wells fargo stated that the named plaintiffs received financially beneficial deals in their loans.and finally,during his closing argument,wells fargo counsel implied that plaintiffs attorney had a financial interest in the case.
after the district court instructed the jury and deliberations concluded,the jury returned a verdict in favor of defendants.specifically,the jury decided that plaintiffs did not prove by a preponderance of the evidence that prosperity was a sham and not a bona fide provider of settlement services.in addition,the jury decided that plaintiffs did not prove that long foster referred or affirmatively influenced plaintiffs to use prosperity or that prosperity referred or affirmatively influenced plaintiffs to use wells fargo for settlement services.accordingly,the district court entered judgment in favor of defendants 
thereafter,plaintiffs moved for a new trial under federal rule of civil procedure a.the district court denied the motion and issued an order entering judgment in favor of defendants and against named plaintiffs on named plaintiffs claims under a of respa,claims that had not yet been tried as opposed to the section c claims,which had been tried.appellants br.at addendum.plaintiffs timely appealed.
plaintiffs first challenge the district court rejection of their rule a motion for a new trial.a district court denial of a motion for a new trial is reviewed for abuse of discretion,and will not be reversed save in the most exceptional circumstances.fdic bakkebo,cir quoting figg schroeder,cir.
rule states that t he court may,on motion,grant a new trial on all or some of the issues after a jury trial,for any reason for which a new trial has heretofore been granted in an action at law in federal court.a.we have recognized that,under this rule,the district court must 
set aside the verdict and grant a new trial if the verdict is against the clear weight of the evidence,or is based upon evidence which is false,or will result in a miscarriage of justice,even though there may be substantial evidence which would prevent the direction of a verdict.

plaintiffs brought three respa claims section a,section c and section c claims.the section c and section c claims proceeded to trial,but the section a claims did not but were instead adjudicated after trial.appellants rule motion is unusual in that plaintiffs are not seeking a new trial for the purpose of their section c claims.instead,they are seeking only a first trial on their section a claims.appellants br.at.
plaintiffs rule a motion specifically challenged the jury negative answer to question three of the verdict form have plaintiffs proved,by a preponderance of the evidence,that long foster real estate,referred or affirmatively influenced the plaintiffs to use prosperity mortgage company for the provision of settlement services.because plaintiffs section a claim also required plaintiffs to prove that long foster referred plaintiffs to prosperity,the district court held that the jury finding on this issue undermined both the plaintiffs tried and untried respa claims.plaintiffs thus seek to overturn the jury finding on this question and attain a trial on the section a claims.
on appeal,plaintiffs make two arguments for reversal of the district court denial of their rule motion long foster counsel made a judicial admission that removed the referral issue from dispute,and the jury verdict was against the clear weight of evidence.we disagree with both.
first,plaintiffs argue that the district court abused its discretion by finding that long foster counsel statement in closing argument that long foster referred the named plaintiffs to prosperity was not a judicial admission.
a judicial admission is a representation that is conclusive in the case unless the court allows it to be withdrawn.meyer berkshire life ins,cir quoting keller united states,cir further defining judicial admissions as formal concessions in the pleadings,or stipulations by a party or its counsel,that are binding upon the party making them.judicial admissions include intentional and unambiguous waivers that release the opposing party from its burden to prove the facts necessary to establish the waived conclusion of law.id.at.a lawyer statements may constitute a binding admission of a party if the statements are deliberate,clear,and unambiguous.fraternal order of police lodge prince george,cir quoting meyer,at.we review the district court determination as to whether a particular statement constitute d a judicial admission for abuse of discretion.meyer,at quotations omitted alterations in original.
in this case,during closing arguments,long foster counsel stated 
first of all,at the outset,i would just ask you to ask yourselves if your assessment of the witnesses,of the documents,of their credibility,of what you heard in this case really matches what plaintiffs counsel told you.it your job to weigh what occurred here.
and frankly,i sure you wo be surprised,i have a lot of differences,and differences of recollection,differences in what was said.
i think the only thing i agree way sic for sure is that long foster did refer the named plaintiffs to prosperity.there no dispute about that.
plaintiffs did not object,move for judgment as a matter of law,or seek to amend the jury verdict form after this alleged admission.after deliberations,the jury found that plaintiffs had not proven that long foster referred or affirmatively influenced plaintiffs to use prosperity.plaintiffs then moved for a new trial,arguing for the first time after the jury verdict,that counsel statement during argument had constituted a judicial admission that long foster had referred the plaintiffs to prosperity.
the district court recognized that t aken alone,long foster counsel statement could possibly be considered an admission,but rejected the motion for a new trial.the district court explained that 
giving due regard to the context of this litigation and considerations of fairness,the court is troubled by the fact that the supposed admission is being raised for the first time.while the time between long foster counsel statement and submission of the case to the jury was indeed short,the court believes it was a sufficient amount of time for plaintiffs to reconsider the task with which the jury would be charged in light of counsel statement,and to raise the supposed admission with the court and with counsel.obviously,plaintiffs did not and,the conclusion which urges itself at this time is that it occurred to no one at the trial that the remarks in question constituted an admission of the nature here urged.as a result,the court believes it would be decidedly unfair and inconsistent with the purpose of motions under rule to allow plaintiffs to do now,what they failed to do at trial.
quotation marks,citations,and footnote omitted.
on appeal,plaintiffs claim that this ruling was an abuse of discretion.we disagree.the record reflects that plaintiffs had ample opportunity to raise the alleged admission but failed to do so.and the fact that it occurred to no one at trial that this isolated remark constituted a binding admission undercuts the notion that the statement was sufficiently deliberate and clear so as to have preclusive effect.in the face of plaintiffs failure to undertake any steps whatsoever at trial to have the statement deemed an admission or have the issue removed from the jury province,it simply can not be said that an error occurred in the conduct of the trial that was so grievous as to have rendered the trial unfair.bristol steel iron works bethlehem steel,cir quotation marks omitted.accordingly,we conclude that the district court did not abuse its discretion on this issue.
second,plaintiffs contend that the district court abused its discretion by denying their motion for a new trial because the jury verdict was against the clear weight of the evidence.while a party is not required to make a rule motion for judgment as a matter of law before moving for a new trial,when,as here,a party does not do so,our scope of review is exceedingly confined,being limited to whether there was any evidence to support the jury verdict,irrespective of its sufficiency,or whether plain error was committed which,if not noticed,would result in a manifest miscarriage of justice.bristol steel,at quotation marks and citations omitted accord nichols ashland hosp,cir.
in other words,when reviewing the evidence through the medium of a motion for a new trial after failure to move for judgment as a matter of law,we do not review sufficiency in its technical sense.what is at issue is whether there was an absolute absence of evidence to support the jury verdict.bristol steel,at quotation marks and citations omitted.therefore,we must affirm the district court decision unless there was an absolute absence of evidence supporting the jury finding that plaintiffs did not prove by a preponderance of the evidence that long foster referred or affirmatively influenced them to use prosperity for settlement services.id.
