plaintiffs thomas and cindy leipart appeal the dismissal of their state tort claims against defendant guardian industries guardian.the district court held that their claims were by the consumer product safety act cpsa.see.we hold that plaintiffs claims are not,and accordingly reverse and remand for further proceedings.
plaintiffs allege that,while showering,thomas leipart lost his footing and fell against a glass shower door manufactured by guardian.they allege that the door broke into long,dangerous shards rather than into small,relatively harmless pieces,and that leipart arm was so severely cut by the glass that he required emergency surgery.plaintiffs brought suit in california state court based on several state claims strict and liability for design,manufacture and distribution strict liability for failure to warn negligent infliction of emotional distress and loss of consortium.
after removal to federal district court,all of plaintiffs claims were dismissed under federal rule of civil procedure b as by the cpsa.for purposes of this appeal,we assume that the facts alleged in the complaint are true.we review de novo the district court conclusions of law.see monterey plaza hotel,local,cir niehaus greyhound lines,cir.
federal law state law in three circumstances 
congress can define explicitly the extent to which its enactments state law second,in the absence of explicit statutory language,state law is where it regulates conduct in a field that congress intended the federal government to occupy exclusively finally,state law is to the extent that it actually conflicts with federal law.

congress enacted the cpsa 
to protect the public against unreasonable risks of injury associated with consumer products to assist consumers in evaluating the comparative safety of consumer products to develop uniform safety standards for consumer products and to minimize conflicting state and local regulations and to promote research and investigation into the causes and prevention of deaths,illnesses,and injuries.
pursuant to the act,the consumer product safety commission the commission has promulgated a consumer product safety standard requiring a glass shower door to undergo a test in which a leather punching bag strikes the door in a prescribed manner.the door passes the test if the glass is broken and the resulting hole is smaller than a specified size if the glass is broken and the ten largest pieces weigh less than a specified amount or if the glass does not break at all.id.e i e v.
the cpsa contains an express clause 
whenever a consumer product safety standard under this chapter is in effect and applies to a risk of injury associated with a consumer product,no state or political subdivision of a state shall have any authority either to establish or to continue in effect any provision of a safety standard or regulation which prescribes any requirements as to the performance,composition,contents,design,finish,construction,packaging,or labeling of such product which are designed to deal with the same risk of injury associated with such consumer product,unless such requirements are identical to the requirements of the federal standard.
a.the clause is,however,subject to two saving clauses.the first saves remedies when a defendant violates a safety standard under the cpsa.the second saves remedies when a defendant complies with a safety standard.
the first saving clause is included in.that section provides for recovery of damages,attorneys fees,and expert witness fees for knowing including willful violations of a consumer product safety rule issued by the commission.a.the saving clause specifies that other remedies,including remedies,are not by a 
the remedies provided for in this section shall be in addition to and not in lieu of any other remedies provided by common law or under federal or state law.
id.c.the second is included in.it provides that common law and state statutory remedies are not even when a defendant has complied with federal consumer product safety rules 
compliance with consumer product safety rules or other rules or orders under this chapter shall not relieve any person from liability at common law or under state statutory law to any other person.
before addressing plaintiffs specific claims,we address a threshold question common to both saving clauses.the clause of the cpsa specifies that a federal safety standard a state safety standard or regulation.a.the implementing federal regulation applicable to this case also refers to a federal safety standard.a.however,both saving clauses refer,somewhat confusingly,not to federal standards,but to federal rules and orders.a,c a.
we conclude that the difference in terminology is not material.any other conclusion would lead to an unlikely,even absurd,result.if the word standard in the clause means something different from the words rule and order in the saving clauses,the saving clauses would have no meaning,for they could not save state laws that have been by federal safety standards they could save only state laws that have been by federal rules or orders.a more natural reading is that the words standard,rule,and order all refer to obligations imposed by regulations promulgated under the cpsa.we draw support for this conclusion from,which,in specifying rulemaking procedures under the cpsa,refers interchangeably to a federal safety standard and safety rule.id.a,a,a.
we now turn to plaintiffs claims.
plaintiffs assert state tort claims for strict and product liability for design,manufacture and distribution.some of these claims are premised on a violation of a safety standard promulgated under the cpsa.a straightforward reading of the cpsa clause indicates,even without reference to a saving clause,that such claims are not.
section a safety standards that deal with the same risk of injury as the federal standard,unless the state standards impose requirements that are identical to those imposed by the federal standards.it is clear that plaintiffs state tort claims for design,manufacture and distribution would impose requirements that deal with the same risk of from broken the federal safety standard in.as we discuss below,we believe that the cpsa expressly only requirements imposed by state standards or regulations,not requirements imposed by state common law.however,even if we were to assume,for the limited purpose of this argument,that the cpsa does some requirements,it clearly does not claims premised on violations of requirements imposed by federal safety standards that is,the cpsa does not common law claims that are premised on violations of requirements that are identical to those already imposed by federal standards.
this conclusion is reinforced by the saving clause contained in c.as noted above,a provides a federal remedy of damages,attorneys fees and expert witness fees when a defendant knowingly violates a federal product standard.section c provides that these remedies are available in addition to other remedies,including state remedies.to the degree that state common law provides additional remedies for violations of federal safety therefore provides additional incentives for potential defendants to comply with the federal law is not.because such state remedies supplement the federal remedies provided in a,they provide additional protection for the public against unreasonable risks of injury associated with consumer products.id.b.
moreover,state remedies for violations fill what would otherwise be a gap in the statutory scheme.the saving clause in a preserves additional state remedies when there has been compliance with consumer product safety rules.we believe it is unreasonable to construe c as not saving state remedies for violations of a cpsa safety standard when a explicitly saves such remedies in cases where there has been compliance with that same safety standard.
