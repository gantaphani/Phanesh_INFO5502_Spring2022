introduction 
in our previous,unpublished opinion in this case,filed november,we held that the million punitive damages verdict against defendant ford motor company was based on an impermissible theory of recovery and was,in addition,constitutionally excessive.we concluded the maximum constitutionally permissible punitive damages award was,or three times the compensatory damages awarded by the jury.
plaintiffs greg and jo ann johnson petitioned for review by the supreme court.the court granted the petition.although the court agreed with our conclusions that the punitive damages award was based on an impermissible theory and that the verdict was constitutionally excessive,the court reversed the judgment of this court and remanded the matter for a new determination of the maximum constitutional award of punitive damages in accordance with a correct understanding of the law as expressed in the supreme court decision.johnson ford motor cal th,d,johnson.
facts and procedural historya.the plaintiffs transaction 
the facts were thoroughly summarized in the supreme court opinion 
in february,plaintiffs greg and jo ann johnson bought a used ford taurus from a car dealer,decker ford decker,for.when greg johnson asked about the previous ownership,the salesman told them only that the taurus had been traded in for a newer model.when he asked to see the taurus repair history,he was shown a computer printout that indicated there had been no significant repairs.the jury found decker had acted as ford agent in this sales transaction.
in fact,the previous drivers,the mcgills,had experienced repeated and seemingly unrepairable difficulty with the car transmission after leasing it in late.after at least four trips to the dealership for the transmission problems,one transmission replacement,and an incident in which the transmission locked in low gear on the freeway,the mcgills,in july,requested that ford repurchase the car as a lemon.
ford district customer service manager reviewed decker records and decided the automobile did not qualify for mandatory repurchase under california lemon law.the jury later found to the contrary.instead,she approved issuance of an owner appreciation certificate worth on any at decker.though the mcgills were never told they had received an owner appreciation certificate from ford,decker applied the credit to their trade of the taurus for a new pickup truck,then recovered the from ford.
after decker resold the taurus to plaintiffs,they also experienced transmission problems with it.when,in august,greg johnson complained that it delayed in shifting and slammed into gear,decker replaced the transmission.in march,the transmission would not shift into reverse decker again replaced it.at that point,in discussion with decker service writer,greg johnson asked to see and was finally shown the car complete repair file,thus learning of the mcgills earlier problems.
the johnsons sued ford and decker for intentional and negligent misrepresentation and concealment,violations of the consumer warranty act,lemon law,the consumer legal remedies act,the unfair competition law bus,and the prohibition on false or misleading advertising bus.plaintiffs settled with decker prior to trial and,after the jury verdict,voluntarily dismissed their unfair competition and false advertising causes of action against ford.johnson,supra,cal th at,d,fn.omitted.
ford owner appreciation certificate program 
plaintiffs presented evidence concerning the scope and profitability of defendant owner appreciation certificate oac program in california,as well as evidence concerning the program in the context of california lemon law,civil code sections.all further section references are to this code unless otherwise indicated.the supreme court opinion thoroughly summarized this evidence as well 
ford stated policy was that oac credits of up to on for new ford vehicles provided as goodwill to help satisfy the customer and to restore the customer confidence in ford products were to be issued only for vehicles that did not meet the state definition of a lemon and therefore were not subject to mandatory reacquisition.but plaintiffs introduced evidence that,in evaluating eligibility,at least some ford managers employed a narrow concept of what constituted a repair attempt for purposes of applying state lemon laws,including california,under which a vehicle that can not be repaired in a reasonable number of attempts must be reacquired or replaced.see,subd.d.specifically,the regional customer service manager who handled the mcgills complaint and authorized issuance of the oac testified she interpreted the ford training and policy materials to provide that an occasion on which the customer brought the vehicle in with a complaint,but the service staff was unable to find or confirm the problem,was not counted as a repair attempt.ford former policy manager for the reacquired vehicle program similarly stated that i f the technician does not replace a part or make an adjustment to the vehicle,and it properly documented as no problem found,then i would not count it as a repair.
in addition,ford reacquired vehicle program looked almost exclusively to whether a vehicle met the law presumption of reasonable repair attempts,based on a specified number of attempts in a certain period see,subd.b,rather than whether the number of attempts was itself reasonable regardless of the presumption see,subd.d.thus,the reacquired vehicle program manual repeatedly instructed customer service managers that vehicles meeting state lemon law presumption s were not eligible for an oac,stated that a used car would be eligible for an oac if it does not meet lemon law presumption,and gave as examples of ineligible vehicles those with more repair attempts or days out of service than specified under a state lemon law presumption.in line with these written policies,the regional customer service manager testified she understood an oac could not be offered if the vehicle met the presumption of lemon law,and the former policy manager explained that we do determine anything by reasonable repair attempts because we can not define reasonable repair attempts.by these narrow constructions,ford allowed itself to issue oac for dealer of vehicles that arguably should have been reacquired as lemons,thereby avoiding the title branding and additional notice requirements involved in reselling a lemon.see,subd.c.
ford managers also testified that the company regarded oac as assistance to the customer,not the dealership.ford thereby avoided the requirement of california law to notify future buyers of defects that led to a vehicle reacquisition by the manufacturer or the dealer with manufacturer assistance in response to a request by the buyer or lessee that the vehicle be either replaced or accepted for restitution because the vehicle did not conform to express warranties,a requirement that applies even if the vehicle is not reacquired as a lemon,subd.d in such cases,the manufacturer must give the subsequent buyer the warranty buyback notice prescribed in.the reacquired vehicle policy manual specified that while oac were ordinarily mailed to the dealer,in california they were to be sent instead to the customer though,as noted earlier,no certificate was in fact mailed to the mcgills.according to the former policy manager,the policy of mailing to the customer was adopted t o avoid anyone getting the impression we trying to assist a dealer.
plaintiffs presented further evidence that ford san francisco and los angeles offices issued about to oac per year in the year of trial and the previous year and.the average face amount of oac issued over the four previous years was between and.finally,testimony was given to the effect that the cost of reacquiring a vehicle as a lemon,the cost of repurchasing or replacing the vehicle less its resale or salvage value was between and,depending on the year and the method of reacquisition refund or replacement.johnson,supra,cal th at,d.
the jury awarded plaintiffs in compensatory damages and punitive damages of million the supreme court summarized our disposition of defendant appeal the court of appeal found substantial evidence not only that ford had fraudulently concealed material facts from the johnsons by failing to provide them the warranty buyback notice required under section,but also that punitive damages against the corporation were justified because defendant entire customer response program was structured precisely to lemon law claims whenever defendant plausibly could,by restrictively interpreting state lemon laws and ignoring the possibility of nonpresumptive lemons.johnson,supra,cal th at,d.in conducting our de novo review of the punitive damages for constitutional excessiveness,however,we modified the million judgment,concluding that punitive damages of three times the compensatory damages was the maximum award permitted under the due process clause of the federal constitution.
the supreme court granted plaintiffs petition for review,reversed our judgment,and remanded the matter with instructions,described further in the discussion section,below.
discussion 
as discussed both in this court previous opinion and in johnson,the united states supreme court has held that grossly excessive or arbitrary punitive damages awards violate a defendant right to due process under the fourteenth amendment.see state farm mut.auto.ins.campbell,d state farm.the high court has mandated that appellate courts,state and federal,engage in exacting de novo review of punitive damages awards and make an independent assessment of the reprehensibility of the defendant conduct,the relationship between the award and the harm done to the plaintiff,and the relationship between the award and civil penalties authorized for comparable conduct.simon san paolo holding,cal th,d,simon.these three considerations have become known as the bmw guideposts,after the supreme court decision first announced them in bmw of north america,gore,d bmw,or the state guideposts because the high court further refined the guideposts in state farm,supra,d.see,simon,supra,at,d.
in reviewing this court previous opinion,the supreme court recognized that we discussed the three state guideposts,but it concluded that we gave no express weight to the scale and profitability of defendant scheme to defraud consumers,when we applied the first reprehensibility guidepost.johnson,supra,cal th at,d.in addition,the court concluded that our discussion of the remaining two state guideposts did not explain the drastic reduction ordered in the punitive damages judgment.ibid.finally,the court deemed that we had applied a standard of due process review that is blind to the state interest in punishing and deterring a wrongful corporate practice.ibid.since the supreme court could not be sure the lower court made its decision under a correct understanding of the law,a remand for a new determination of the maximum constitutional award is appropriate.ibid.
we have received supplemental briefing from the parties and now address the issues designated by the supreme court.we have also received an amicus curiae brief in support of plaintiffs filed on behalf of united policyholders.
a.the state interest in punishment and deterrence 
on the same date we filed our unpublished opinion in the present case,we filed an opinion for publication in a separate case that raised related punitive damages issues,romo ford motor th,d.our earlier opinion in the present case made reference to romo extended discussion of punitive damages as a vindication of the state interest in punishment and deterrence.in romo,we sought to reconcile state farm insistence that a punitive damages award bear a reasonable relationship to the harm to individual plaintiffs and what we perceived to have been a broader focus of california punitive damages law that permitted the award of punitive damages to reflect more or less directly the harm to all persons affected by the defendant course of conduct.see id.at,d.our conclusion was that due process required that the state interest in punishing and deterring oppressive,fraudulent,or malicious conduct see be vindicated through the punitive damages imposed for the harm to the individual plaintiffs,not through an award based upon similar harm to other residents of california as is,based upon the entire course of oppressive,fraudulent,or malicious conduct that gave rise to the individual plaintiffs injury.see romo ford motor,supra,th at,d.
this court opinion did make it clear,however,that evidence of an entire course of conduct was relevant and admissible on the issue of the state reprehensibility guidepost because a state is permitted to punish recidivist conduct more severely than an individual instance of malfeasance.romo ford motor,supra,th at,fn,d.when we applied the reprehensibility guidepost in romo,we concluded ford conduct was extremely reprehensible,in part,because it put at risk all who drove or rode in this model bronco.id.at,d.
in our earlier opinion in the present case,the sole basis cited for our conclusion that defendant conduct was highly reprehensible was that defendant conduct in the present case reflected a formal policy that was designed to obtain in as many cases as possible the same wrongful result obtained in the present case.johnson ford motor,slip opn.at,wl.the scope and scale of the potential harm in this case was the basis for gauging the state interest in punishment and deterrence through punitive damages.
accordingly,neither in romo nor in the present case were we blind to the state interest in punishing and deterring a wrongful corporate practice johnson,supra,cal th at,d,or course of conduct.rather,those opinions merely sought,albeit unconvincingly id.at,d,to give a historical rationale for state farm due process rule,aptly summarized by our supreme court in johnson,as follows the scale and profitability of a course of wrongful conduct by the defendant can not justify an award that is grossly excessive in relation to the harm done or threatened to the present plaintiffs,but scale and profitability nevertheless remain relevant to reprehensibility and hence to the size of award warranted,under the guideposts,to meet the state interest in deterrence.id.at,d.
when we consider that defendant is a major participant in a highly regulated industry in california,and that its formal policies were designed to circumvent one important part of that regulation,we reiterate that defendant conduct was highly reprehensible and the state has a very strong interest in deterrence of similar conduct.
b.the weight of scope and profitability in determining reprehensibility 
as discussed above,our earlier opinion in this case expressly recognized that because defendant treatment of plaintiffs occurred pursuant to a formal policy designed to circumvent the lemon law,that conduct was highly reprehensible.johnson ford motor,supra,slip opn.at.in our discussion of defendant claim of insufficient evidence of corporate misconduct,we noted the compelling evidence that supported an inference that the present transaction with plaintiffs was typical of owner appreciation certificate transactions,which numbered over per year,and that the use of such certificates was intended,as a matter of policy,to lemon law claims.id.at.we summarized the evidence supporting this inference.this evidence and the inference therefrom,in turn,formed the basis for our conclusion of high reprehensibility.
in reversing the judgment in this case,the supreme court expressed concern that we may have given insufficient,if any,weight to the scale and profitability of ford fraudulent conduct.johnson,supra,cal th at,d.there was,however,no evidence of the scale and profitability of the practice beyond the summary stated above.as the supreme court recognized earlier in its opinion,plaintiffs proof of the scope and profitability of the fraudulent practices suffers from several major deficiencies.id.at,d.as to scope,plaintiffs offered no proof that all oac transactions involved defective vehicles subject to california lemon law.id.at,d.the evidence in the current record would show the scope of the fraudulent practices as opposed to the overall scope of the oac program only if we assume the customer is always right in such disputes,an assumpt
