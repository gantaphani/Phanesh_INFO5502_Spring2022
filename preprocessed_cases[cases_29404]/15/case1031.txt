the money transmission law chapter of the california financial code 
division,chapter of the financial code is entitled,transmission of money abroad,et in enacting these laws,the legislature declared,it is the intent of the legislature in enacting this chapter to protect the people of this state from being victimized by unscrupulous practices by persons receiving money for transmission to foreign countries and to establish a minimum level of fiscal responsibility and corporate integrity for all entities engaging in the business of receiving money for transmission to foreign countries without regard to the method of transmission,subd.a.accordingly,money transmitters other than insured financial institutions must be licensed by the commissioner of financial institutions,subd.a.
financial code section,subdivision a,provides that a money transmitter must forward funds received for transmission to a foreign country within days of receipt,unless the customer orders otherwise.financial code section provides that the money transmitted must refund a customer money upon the customer request if the funds are not forwarded in the requisite days,subd.a.the money transmitter must give the customer a receipt for each transaction that clearly informs the customer of his or her right to a refund,subd.b.
financial code section,at the heart of this action,governs disclosures that must be given to a customer.financial code section,subdivision a,provides the receipt presented to each customer for each transaction pursuant to subdivision b of section shall clearly state the rate of exchange for the particular transaction,the amount of commission or fees,and the net exchange after all fees and commissions have been deducted.the receipt shall also state the total amount of currency presented by the customer and the total amount to be delivered to the beneficiary designated by the customer similarly,financial code section,subdivision b,provides all window and exterior signs concerning the rates of exchange shall clearly state the rate of exchange for exchanging the currency of the united states for foreign currency.all interior signs and all advertising,if rates are quoted,shall clearly state the rates of exchange for exchanging the currency of the united states for foreign currency and shall state all commissions and fees charged on all transactions.

the complaintthe original complaint 
mccann original complaint alleged lucky money was licensed to and was engaged in the business of receiving money from members of the general public for transmission to designated persons in foreign countries.as a part of the money transfer transaction,lucky money exchange s united states dollars into foreign currency.
in accordance with the financial code,lucky money gives each customer a receipt stating the rate of exchange for the particular transaction,the amount of commissions or fees being charged,and the net exchange after all fees and commissions have been deducted,how many units of foreign money the recipient will get.lucky money also posts the rate of exchange.because under the financial code lucky money has up to days to transmit the money in foreign currency to the foreign recipient,it is able to pool its customers monies to obtain a more favorable rate of exchange from the bank.lucky money realizes a profit from that more favorable rate.
accordingly,mccann alleged,lucky money misleads its customers by telling them a false rate of exchange and by failing to disclose the true exchange rate.additionally,the difference between the rate the customer is given and the rate lucky money gets from the bank constitutes an undisclosed commission or fee.finally,mccann alleged that because customers monies are trust funds,lucky money is a trustee and owes a fiduciary duty towards the customer to not profit from customers funds.in other words,lucky money must give its customers the wholesale exchange rate it receives from the bank.
the first amended complaint 
after lucky money demurrer was sustained with leave to amend,mccann filed an amended complaint phrasing his allegations somewhat differently.he again alleged lucky money was in the business of accepting money from members of the general public and transmitting those funds to designated persons in foreign countries,and was properly licensed.but,mccann now alleged,lucky money does not exchange dollars into foreign currency.instead,after receiving customers monies,lucky money takes those funds to an institution,bank authorized to exchange dollars into foreign currency,where the actual currency exchange takes place.upon obtaining a customer money,lucky money gives the customer the receipt required by law,showing a rate of exchange,commissions and fees being charged,and a net exchange.but the receipt is false,because it purport s to disclose a rate of exchange which is not a rate of exchange at all rather,it is a fictionalized number created by defendants which they falsely represent to be the actual rate of exchange received by defendants from an institution authorized to exchange dollars into foreign currency.
mccann further alleged the customer receipt is also false because it does not accurately disclose the commissions and fees lucky money is getting.specifically,lucky money pockets the difference between the higher fictional rate of exchange it tells the customer he or she is getting and the invariably lower actual rate of exchange lucky money actually gets from the bank.the receipt is also false because it does not show the customer true net exchange since it is based on a rate of exchange and does not account for the undisclosed being received by lucky money.
mccann alleged lucky money does not set or otherwise designate the rate at which any particular customer transmission monies will be exchanged into foreign currency.there is only a single exchange of money,based on a single rate of exchange,and that exchange takes place at the bank that actually transmits the money to the foreign country.lucky money misleads customers when,in advance of the actual money exchange that takes place at the bank,it tells them what the rate of exchange will be.mccann alleged lucky money simply holds its customer money in trust for the customer to later exchange that money into foreign currency.by telling the customer a higher rate of exchange than the rate lucky money will subsequently get from the bank,lucky money is in essence misappropriating customers monies it holds in trust.
mccann alleged lucky money violated the ucl by failing to properly disclose to the customer the actual rate of exchange,the commissions it receives,and the customer net exchange lucky money violates the ucl by not giving the customer the same rate of exchange it gets from the bank lucky money violated the ucl when it breaches its fiduciary duties owed to customers under the probate code and lucky money violates the ucl and fal by posting deceptive signs at its place of business stating a false or fictionalized rate of exchange,rather than the actual rate of exchange obtained from the bank.
the trial court sustained lucky money demurrer without leave to amend and dismissed the action.mccann appeals.

unlawful,unfair or fraudulent business practice financial code section,subdivision a 
two of mccann causes of action claimed violations of the ucl based on alleged violations of financial code section,subdivision a.the first cause of action alleged lucky money commits an unlawful business practice,violating financial code section,subdivision a,by not disclosing to its customers,and giving them the benefit of,the exchange rate at which lucky money purchases foreign currency.the second cause of action alleged lucky money commits an unfair business practice based on the same conduct.
we begin with some explanation as to the nature of the money transmission transactions that are the subject of this litigation.in short,a customer desiring to send united states dollars to a foreign country may purchase the foreign currency from a money transmitter at one exchange rate,retail rate.money transmitters,like lucky money,typically purchase the foreign currency at a more favorable exchange rate,wholesale rate.the difference between the retail exchange rate and the wholesale exchange rate is typically referred to as the fx foreign exchange spread,and needless to say the fx spread is often a source of additional profit to the money transmitter beyond the fees it charges the customer for the exchange.see generally in re mexico money transfer litigation d.at the time of the transaction,a customer must be given a receipt stating the exchange rate for the particular transaction,commissions or fees being charged,the net exchange after commissions and fees have been deducted,the total amount of united states currency the customer has presented to the money transmitter,and the total amount of foreign currency to be delivered to the beneficiary in the foreign country,subd.a.the receipt must also explain to the customer his or her refund rights,subd.a.
in his original complaint,mccann alleged customer transactions with lucky money essentially comporting with the above description,lucky money accepts dollars from a customer for transmission to a foreign country,it gives the customer one rate but buys foreign currency for a better rate,illegally or improperly profiting off the difference.in his amended complaint,mccann tried to change tacks by characterizing the transaction as involving only one actual foreign currency exchange one in which lucky money buys foreign currency from a bank.mccann alleged lucky money does not in fact sell foreign currency to its customer or exchange currency for the customer when the customer presents herself.rather,lucky money merely acts as a fiduciary by taking customer monies,which it then exchanges at an authorized financial institution on the customer behalf.thus,mccann alleges,the exchange rate lucky money quotes to the customer on the exchange receipt and upon which all other information is based such as the net exchange and how much foreign currency the beneficiary in the foreign country will get is a fictionalized or false exchange rate.whereas,the exchange rate at which lucky money acquires the foreign currency from the bank is the true or actual exchange rate.
mccann has employed clever semantics rate instead of retail rate rate instead of wholesale rate to get around the nature of the transactions at issue.we are unimpressed.we look at the pleading in the context of the economic substance of the challenged transaction described therein,not the appellations mccann has chosen.no matter what the transactions are called,the economic substance is that customers buy foreign currency from lucky money at one rate,and lucky money buys the foreign currency elsewhere for a better rate.it is in that context that we consider whether the complaint alleges a violation of the financial code.
mccann admits lucky money gives its customers the legally required receipt at the time of the customer transaction.nonetheless,mccann argues lucky money violates financial code section,subdivision a,because the customer receipt does not disclose the wholesale,true or actual rate of exchange,quoting the customer instead of the retail,false or fictionalized rate of exchange the customer receipt does not disclose the difference between the two rates hereafter called the fx spread or include it as a fee or commission and lucky money gives the customer a false net exchange because it bases the net on the retail exchange rate and does not give the customer the benefit of the wholesale other words,the customer does not get all the units of foreign currency to which is entitled.
the allegations raised by mccann were the subject of two federal court opinions that emphatically rejected the same arguments in the context of approving the settlement of a class action lawsuit based on the same conduct by other licensed money transmitters in the matter of mexico money transfer litigation cir,and in re mexico money transfer litigation,supra,d.
the mexico money transfer litigation cases involved a class action lawsuit brought on a variety of legal theories challenging the defendant money transmitters practices of failing to disclose to their customers the existence of the fx spread,and secretly profiting off the fx spread.a class settlement was reached.in re mexico money transfer litigation,supra,d at.a group of california residents objected to the settlement arguing it was unfair to california residents who had much stronger claims under the california financial code.id.at.
the district court considered and rejected each of the objectors arguments.first,the court considered whether the defendants practices violated financial code section,subdivision a,whether the wholesale rate of exchange had to be disclosed whether the fx spread had to be disclosed as a commission or fee,concluding no disclosure was necessary.t he financial code draws a distinction between commission or fees and the rate of exchange,suggesting that the disclosure requirements with respect to the former will not apply to the latter.further,while california banking officials have been aware for years that money transmitters purchase foreign currency at one rate but offer their customers a less favorable higher rate,they have never interpreted the statute so as to require disclosures of the exchange rate spread to customers notably,financial code section makes explicit requirements for disclosure of terms necessary for a customer to understand the financial aspects of a money transfer,including the rate of exchange,the service charge,and the number of pesos the recipient will recover.the rate at which the money transmitter itself purchases pesos is arguably not relevant to the customer and is not mentioned in financial code section.id.at.
the district court then went on to consider the argument that money transmitters must provide customers with pesos at the same rate of exchange that money transmitters themselves enjoy on the wholesale market t he california legislature failure to expressly prohibit the collection of revenue from fx spreads provides a powerful argument that the legislature did not intend to do so.as noted earlier,department officials have been aware of the practices of money transmitters for many years,but have never interpreted financial code section,subdivision a as a prohibition against such practices i t would be impracticable for money transmitters to carry out their money exchange practices in the fashion that california objectors urge is required money transmitters purchase currency in bulk without regard to the specific date or rate for each retail transaction,in some instances purchasing pesos after the retail transaction is already complete.because the wholesale rate fluctuates frequently,it would not be possible to advise customers of the precise exchange rate at the time of the transaction,if that rate must be equal to the rate paid by the transmitter itself.in re mexico money transfer litigation,supra,d at.
the district court also expressed serious doubt as to the objectors argument that financial code section characterization of funds received for transmission as trust funds,created a fiduciary duty claim.see pt,infra.california law imposes no fiduciary obligations on commercial providers of goods or services.see mcdermott western union.nor have department officials interpreted financial code section as prohibiting money transmitters from collecting fx spread revenue t he department instead has interpreted this language as authorizing department officials to segregate funds received from customers in circumstances when the department seizes the assets of a money transmitter,and protect those funds from the claims of general creditors.in re mexico money transfer litigation,supra,d at.
finally,in view of its conclusion the objectors had no private right of action for violation of the financial code,the district court also concluded the objectors had no cause of action under the ucl.that legislation permits a private party to bring a claim for certain unfair,unlawful,or fraudulent business practices.to the extent that the objectors argue that defendants practices are unlawful because they violate the california financial code,however,the court rejects this argument for the reasons set forth above.the objectors further argument that,even if not unlawful under the financial code,defendants practices are unfair,is not persuasive.defendants are engaged in business for a profit.their failure to disclose their own costs or profit margins is not,on its face,unfair.the fact that california comprehensive regulation of defendants practices does not label the challenged practices unfair is a further defense to any such claim courts may not simply impose their own notions of the day as to what is fair or unfair.specific legislation may limit the judiciary power to declare conduct unfair.if the legislature has permitted certain conduct or considered a situation and concluded no action should lie,courts may not override that determination.when specific legislation provides a safe harbor,plaintiffs may not use the general unfair competition law to assault that harbor,supra,cal th at d.in re mexico money transfer litigation,supra,d at.
after the district court approved the settlement in the in re mexico money transfer litigation,the california objectors appealed.the seventh circuit affirmed,concluding the objectors had failed to demonstrate they would have fared better under california law.in re the matter of mexico money transfer litigation,supra,at.the court of appeals concluded the claims had only nuisance value because,no state or federal law requires either currency exchanges or firms to disclose the interbank rate at which they buy specie,as opposed to the retail rate at which they sell currency and the retail price is invariably disclosed.id.at.the court of appeals then made the following cogent observation on the dispute money is just a commodity in an international market.citation.pesos are for one price for those who buy in bulk parcels of mi
