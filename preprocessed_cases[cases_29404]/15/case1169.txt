in this case we decide whether a lessee of an automobile may sue for breach of warranty under the federal warranty act.the second district court of appeal answered this question in the affirmative in cerasani american honda motor,so d dca,and certified conflict to the extent that the first district court of appeal held to the contrary in sellers frank griffin amc jeep,so d dca.we have jurisdiction.see art.v,b.const.
the issue presented by the certified conflict requires interpretation of both the federal warranty act and florida motor vehicle warranty enforcement act,more commonly known as the lemon law.we hold that a lessee who is entitled to enforce a warranty under florida lemon law also has a cause of action under the warranty act.we approve the second district decision in this case to the extent that court reached the same conclusion and disapprove sellers to the extent that the first district held there that an automobile warranty is not enforceable under the warranty act unless the automobile has been sold.
facts and procedural history 
jennifer cerasani acquired a new honda civic through a lease and began to have problems with the car.she took the car to a honda dealership for repairs several times but remained dissatisfied with the results.cerasani eventually filed suit against the manufacturer,american honda,under the warranty act mmwa or the act.she alleged one count of breach of written warranty and one count of breach of implied warranty.the trial court dismissed the complaint with prejudice on grounds that the provisions of the mmwa covering a written warranty as defined in the act do not apply to persons who lease rather than purchase vehicles,and that cerasani was not in privity of contract with honda as required under florida law for an implied warranty claim.
the second district affirmed the dismissal of the implied warranty claim but reversed the dismissal of the claim based on honda express warranty.the second district concluded that the first count of cerasani complaint was legally sufficient to withstand the motion to dismiss.the second district determined that cerasani assertions that the warranty was part of the basis of the bargain in the sale of the car to the lessor,honda leasing,and that the sale was for purposes other than resale were sufficient to allege a written warranty as defined by the mmwa.further,the second district ruled that cerasani satisfied the second and third of the three alternative definitions of consumer under the mmwa because she was a person to whom the car was transferred during the duration of a written warranty and because she was entitled under the terms of the warranty to enforce the warranty,as reflected by honda willingness to provide repair service.see cerasani,so d at.
the second district certified conflict with sellers on the issue of whether the mmwa applies to lease transactions.id.at.in sellers,which involved a lease of a motor vehicle from a dealership which then assigned its interest in the lease to a finance company,the first district held that there must be an identifiable purchase and sale before the provisions of the act apply.so d at.
the issue before a lessee such as cerasani is entitled to bring a cause of action for breach of a written warranty under the a matter of pure statutory interpretation.our review of a lower court ruling on an issue of statutory interpretation is de novo.daniels.dep t of health,so d.in construing a statute,this court endeavors to effectuate legislative intent,which is primarily derived from the language used in the enactment.see borden ins,so d.
congress enacted the mmwa to enhance the enforceability of warranties on consumer products and protect the ultimate user of the product.cerasani,so d at quoting bmw of,llc,so d dca.the mmwa authorizes a lawsuit for damages and other equitable relief by a consumer who is damaged by the failure of a supplier,warrantor,or service contractor to comply with any obligation under this chapter,or under a written warranty,implied warranty,or service contract.d.the mmwa definition of consumer is critical in that only a person or entity defined as a consumer may bring a cause of action under the act.to qualify as a consumer who may file suit under the act,a person must come within one of the three alternative categories of consumer 
the term consumer means category one a buyer other than for purposes of resale of any consumer product,category two any person to whom such product is transferred during the duration of an implied or written warranty or service contract applicable to the product,and category three any other person who is entitled by the terms of such warranty or service contract or under applicable state law to enforce against the warrantor or service contractor the obligations of the warranty or service contract.
bold text supplied.an individual qualifies as a consumer under the mmwa if he or she meets any of these three definitions.ryan am.honda motor.
for the reasons that follow,we conclude that because the facts as alleged in cerasani complaint would create a cause of action under chapter,florida statutes the lemon law,she is entitled to enforce the obligations of the warranty under applicable state law,and therefore qualifies as a consumer under the second part of category three.because this conclusion renders unnecessary an additional determination of consumer status under categories one or two or the first part of category three,we decline to address whether and under what circumstances a lessee can qualify as a consumer under these alternative criteria.
as noted,category three of section provides that a person may be a consumer if entitled to enforce the warranty either by the terms of the warranty or under applicable state law.the second district focused on the terms of the warranty in concluding that the allegations in her complaint qualified cerasani as a category three consumer.the court stated 
in the present case,we hold that cerasani has alleged sufficient facts in her amended complaint to qualify as a category three consumer under the act.cerasani alleged that she was able to enforce the terms of the warranty she took the vehicle to authorized honda dealerships for repair on numerous occasions,and honda never asserted that the vehicle was not covered by the written warranty.
cerasani,so d at.the third district has similarly concluded,based on repair and service records,that a lessee qualified as a category three consumer entitled to enforce the warranty under the mmwa.see mesa bmw of,llc,so d,dca mesa was entitled to enforce the manufacturer written warranty,as evidenced by the service and repair records of the vehicle.
in this case,the second district did not address whether cerasani also qualified as a category three consumer on grounds that she was entitled to enforce the warranty under state law.however,it relied on its previous decision in bmw of north america,llc,so d,dca,in which it had concluded that a lessee qualified as a category three consumer both because repair and service records established that she was able to enforce the warranty and because the manufacturer admitted that she was entitled to enforce the warranty under florida lemon law.cerasani,so d at.courts in other jurisdictions have also conferred category three consumer status on lessees based on their entitlement to enforce warranties under state law.see voelker porsche cars of,cir dekelaita nissan motor in usa,d,ryan,at.
florida lemon law,contained in chapter,florida statutes,entitles lessees to enforce the obligations of automobile warranties.see,bmw of,singh,so d dca applying chapter to claim by automobile lessee.section imposes a duty on the manufacturer or its authorized service agent to conform a vehicle to the warranty if the nonconformity is reported by the consumer within the lemon law rights period.section includes lessees within its definition of consumer,and section b provides that when a vehicle does not conform to the manufacturer warranty,t he lessee shall receive the lessee cost and the lessor shall receive the lease price less the lessee cost.finally,section authorizes a consumer to file suit
