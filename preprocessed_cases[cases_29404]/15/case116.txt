this case requires us to determine if the consumer protections of the fair debt collection practices act fdcpa,et,and the truth in lending act tila,et,apply to a mortgage lender that has purchased mortgages initially payable to other lenders and,after the homeowners defaulted on their mortgages,hired a law firm to send allegedly deceptive debt collection letters on its behalf.plaintiffs appellants lori jo vincent,ruth ann gutierrez,linda garrido,and john garrido collectively,the plaintiffs appeal from a judgment of the united states district court for the southern district of new york koeltl,which granted defendants motion for summary judgment on plaintiffs tila claims and denied plaintiffs motion for reconsideration of the district court sprizzo,earlier dismissal of their fdcpa claims against defendants appellees the money store,tms mortgage,and homeeq servicing collectively,the money store.
with respect to plaintiffs fdcpa claims,although creditors are generally not considered debt collectors subject to the fdcpa,the statute contains an exception to creditor immunity where the creditor,in the process of collecting its own debts,uses any name other than its own which would indicate that a third person is collecting or attempting to collect such debts.plaintiffs contend that the money store used the name of the law firm moss,codilis,stawiarski,morris,schneider prior,llp moss codilis by hiring the law firm to send out collection letters that falsely indicated that moss codilis had been retained to collect the debts the money store was in fact collecting.the district court rejected that argument,finding that the money store had not used a name other than its own,and therefore could not be found liable for violating the fdcpa through the false name exception.
similarly,with respect to plaintiffs tila claims,the district court found that the money store could not be held liable under tila for charging plaintiffs unauthorized fees on their accounts and failing to refund the resulting credit balances.tila applies only to a creditor,which is defined in the statute as the person to whom the debt is initially payable.g because the money store was an assignee of the plaintiffs notes,and therefore not the person to whom the debts were initially payable,the district court determined that the money store did not qualify as a creditor under tila.
for the reasons set forth below and resolving all factual disputes in plaintiffs favor,we respectfully first hold that the district court erred in concluding that the money store was not a debt collector under the false name exception to fdcpa liability.where a creditor,in the process of collecting its own debts,hires a third party for the express purpose of representing to its debtors that the third party is collecting the creditor debts,and the third party engages in no bona fide efforts to collect those debts,the false name exception exposes the creditor to fdcpa liability.with respect to the tila claims,however,we conclude that the district court correctly determined that,because plaintiffs mortgage documents did not name the money store as the person to whom the debt was initially payable,the money store is not a creditor under tila and is therefore not subject to liability.accordingly,we affirm the judgment of the district court in part,vacate in part,and remand the case for further proceedings consistent with this opinion.
background 
factual background 
the following facts are drawn from the record before the district court and are undisputed unless otherwise noted 
plaintiffs appellants are homeowners who defaulted on their mortgages.the money store,a mortgage lender,serviced the loans on which plaintiffs defaulted.
a.the plaintiffs mortgages 
plaintiff lori jo vincent took out a mortgage loan on her home in carrollton,texas on february.she executed a promissory note and a deed of trust with her lender,accubanc mortgage corporation.in the promissory note vincent agreed 
in return for a loan that i have received,i promise to pay this amount is called principal,plus interest,to the order of the lender.the lender is accubanc mortgage corporation.i understand that the lender may transfer this note.
app x.in adddtion,the deed of trust states 
borrower vincent owes lender accubanc the principal sum of sixty seven thousand six hundred and dollars.this debt is evidenced by borrower note dated the same date as this security instrument note,which provides for monthly payments,with the full debt,if not paid earlier,due and payable on march.this security instrument secures to lender accubanc a the repayment of the debt evidenced by the note,with interest,and all renewals,extensions and modifications of the note 
app x.neither the promissory note nor the deed of trust mentions the money store.
at the time of the loan execution on february,accubanc gave vincent the disclosure statement required by tila,immediately after executing the mortgage,accubanc transferred its interest in the loan to equicredit corporation of america by endorsing the promissory note to equicredit.months later,on april,equicredit assigned and endorsed the note and deed of trust to the money store,which is reflected on the note with a stamp that reads without recourse pay to the order of tms mortgage vincent first loan payment was due on april,before the note had been assigned to the money store.
on april,plaintiff ruth gutierrez took out a mortgage loan on her home in stockton,california.gutierrez executed a note and deed of trust identifying the lender as first financial funding group and using language very similar to the loan documents described above for vincent mortgage.again,neither of these documents mentions the money store.at the time first financial and gutierrez executed the loan,first financial also gave gutierrez the disclosure statement.two days later,on april,first financial assigned and endorsed the note and deed of trust to the money store.gutierrez first loan payment was due on may,meaning that gutierrez first payment,unlike vincent,was not due until after the loan had been assigned to the money store.
on may,plaintiffs linda and john garrido took out a mortgage loan on their home in huntington station,new york.the promissory note they executed on that date again used language similar to the notes applicable to the other loan transactions,and listed fhb funding corporation as their lender.the garridoses additionally signed a mortgage that referenced the note and identified fhb funding as the lender and the garridoses as the borrower.once again,neither the note nor the mortgage mentions the money store.like vincent and gutierrez,the garridoses also received the disclosure statement from fhb funding at the time they executed the loan.three weeks later,on june,fhb funding assigned and endorsed the note and mortgage to the money store.the garridoses first loan payment was due on july,two weeks after the loan had been assigned to the money store.
after the loans had been assigned to the money store,plaintiffs all eventually defaulted on their mortgages.they subsequently received letters from moss codilis informing them of their default.in addition,the money store allegedly charged plaintiffs improper fees on their accounts,including,inter alia fees for multiple property inspections that did not occur vague and unwarranted fees for file reviews,senior lien monitoring,and outsource management fees excessive late fees surcharges for breach letters attorneys fees that were never paid out to attorneys costs for purported motions in the bankruptcy court that were never filed and fees for other bankruptcy services that were in excess of what was contractually allowed.
b.the breach letter program 
by agreement dated april,the money store contracted with moss codilis to prepare and mail breach notices to borrowers who,like plaintiffs,had defaulted on their loans.such notices inform homeowners that they are in default and are generally a prerequisite before mortgage lenders like the money store can foreclose on a borrower property.labeled the breach letter program moss codilis generate d the thirty day breach letters based on information provided by the money store within a spreadsheet.app x letter of agreement.in return,moss codilis received fifty dollars later dollars for each breach letter generated.outside of the breach letter program,the firm performed no role in the money store collection of its debts.
moss codilis promoted the program to lenders as a means of leveraging its status as a law firm to encourage repayment of loans from borrowers in default.the promotional materials state 
this program allows the client to send breach letters on attorney letterhead at a reasonable cost.most of these costs are recovered through the reinstatement of the loans which is at a higher level as a result of the impression which the attorney breach letter makes it is an excellent collection tool.
app x.at least one executive at the money store confirmed at his deposition that the purpose of the breach letter program was to hopefully gain the attention of the borrower,since it was coming from the law firm.app x deposition of john dunnery,the money store vice president.
the letters,which were printed on moss codilis letterhead,state that this law firm has been retained in order to collect a debt for our client,and that the this firm has been authorized by the money store to contact you and provide notice that you are in default on the mortgage.app x.the letters further state that if the default is not resolved within days,then 
our client shall accelerate the entire sum of both principal and interest immediately due and payable,and invoke any and all remedies provided for in the note and security instrument,including but not limited to the foreclosure sale of the property.
app x.finally,the letters state that,with limited exceptions,a ll communication about this matter must be made through the money store.app x.from up through,moss codilis sent letters on the money store behalf,and thus received approximately between and million in fees.
moss codilis work for the money store was supervised by christina nash and,after july,valerie bromley,who assisted nash in sending breach letters on the money store behalf.according to moss codilis,one of its partners,leo stawiarski,bore primary responsibility for the legal aspects of the firm work for the money store,and supervised nash in all aspects,legal and,of her work.the breach letters were jointly drafted by nash and the money store legal department.
the parties disagree markedly as to the nature of the tasks that moss codilis performed for the money store.each marshals evidence supporting its respective position.although characterizing itself as a law firm,moss codilis describes the breach letter program as an exercise in mass processing that involved little to no legal or otherwise independent judgment.in particular,moss codilis represented to the district court that the only element of the breach letter program that required legal analysis was the drafting of language for the breach letter templates to ensure that they were in compliance with applicable state and federal laws.vincent money store vincent ii,civ.jgk,wl,at,summarizing moss codilis position.
for their part,plaintiffs assert that moss codilis role in the default process began and ended with the mass generation of the breach letters.appellants br.plaintiffs further note 
apart from the breach letters themselves,moss codilis had no authority to initiate contact with debtors,no right to negotiate payment plans,no right to settle for any amount other than what money store said was in default,and no right to bring any legal action.if the breach letters sent out by moss codilis failed to elicit payment,it was money store not moss codilis who would then determine whether the matter should be referred out to their network of foreclosure counsel 
id.citations and internal quotation marks omitted.moreover,plaintiffs point to nash deposition testimony where she stated that if a debtor contacted her with regard to a legal matter she escalated it by referring the matter to the money store instead of handling it herself.
in contrast to the foregoing,the money store contends that moss codilis did more than simply print and mail letters.in addition to moss codilis role in reviewing the breach letters for their compliance with the fdcpa,the money store notes that nash testified at her deposition that she was the primary drafter of the breach letters,with attorneys for the money store limited to review ing the letters for format.further,the money store points to nash deposition testimony that moss codilis conducted an independent review of the data on delinquent borrowers sent to it by the money store,and that if there was questionable data,those loans were pulled and sent back to the money store.app x testifying that questionable data includes things like incomplete borrower information or incomplete address information,as well as data suggesting that the borrower was not actually in default on his or her loan obligations.stressing moss codilis independence,the money store asserts that when moss codilis disagreed with the money store request to send a breach letter,moss codilis did not send out the letter.
the money store also notes that the breach letters invited debtors to contact moss codilis if they wished to verify the debt or the identity of their creditors.pursuant to that invitation,nash testified that she directly corresponded with the money store debtors and their attorneys around one hundred times.nash testified that on occasion she corresponded with a debtor bankruptcy counsel and attorneys at the money store with regard to a debtor bankruptcy proceedings,as well as whether the debts in question had been discharged in bankruptcy.when legal action against a debtor was necessary,the money store claims that lawyers affiliated with moss codilis handled the legal proceedings through their own practices.
ii.procedural history 
on april,plaintiffs filed the instant action in the district court alleging that the money store had violated provisions of the fdcpa and tila.plaintiffs argued that the breach letters were unlawful under the fdcpa because they creat ed the false impression that a third party had been hired to collect the debt and falsely impl ied that a law firm had been retained by the money store to collect the debt and was authorized to commence legal action against the borrower.with respect to their tila claims,plaintiffs claimed that the money store had charged their accounts for fees and expenses which it had no right to collect,and had failed to refund the overcharges as required by tila.neither the fdcpa claims nor the tila claims were asserted against moss codilis.separately,plaintiffs brought a number of claims against the money store and moss codilis under colorado and california state law.
by order dated december,the district court sprizzo,j.granted summary judgment to the money store plaintiffs fdcpa claims,relying on its prior decision in the separate,related case of mazzei money store,d.vincent money store vincent i,d,in mazzei,the district court found that plaintiffs could not rely on the false name exception because the money store had not used moss codilis name.the district court reached this conclusion on the grounds that moss codilis,not the money store,sent out the breach letters,that the money store did not pretend to be moss codilis,and that the money store did not so thoroughly control moss codilis as to render moss codilis its alter ego.mazzei,d at citing maguire citicorp retail,cir.accordingly,the district court concluded that the money store was not subject to fdcpa liability pursuant to the false name exception.id.the court declined to dismiss plaintiffs tila claims,however,concluding that plaintiffs had adequately alleged that the money store had violated tila by charging unauthorized fees and expenses and failing to refund the resulting credit balances on their accounts.id.at.
following judge sprizzo death this case was reassigned to judge koeltl on january.the money store subsequently moved for summary judgment on plaintiffs tila claims,arguing that it was not a creditor as defined by the statute.by order dated september,the district court agreed and dismissed the tila claims.noting that tila defines a creditor as the person to whom a debt is initially payable on the face of the indebtedness,g,the district court found that the money store did not fit within this definition because e ach of the notes identifies an entity other than the money store defendants as the original lender and indicates an assignment to the money store defendants.the court also declined to exercise supplemental jurisdiction over plaintiffs remaining state law claims,and denied plaintiffs motion for reconsideration of the judge sprizzo decision to grant defendants summary judgment on plaintiffs fdcpa claims,concluding that the subsequent declaration of nash introduced by plaintiffs,where she explained that both she and moss codilis had a limited role in the breach letter program,would not have altered judge sprizzo decision.
plaintiffs timely appealed the dismissal of their tila and fdcpa claims against the money store

fdcpa liability 
we start with plaintiffs fdcpa claims against the money store.congress enacted the fdcpa to eliminate abusive debt collection practices by debt collectors,to insure that those debt collectors who refrain from using abusive debt collection practices are not competitively disadvantaged,and to promote consistent state action to protect consumers against debt collection abuses.e.to further these ends,the fdcpa establishes certain rights for consumers whose debts are placed in the hands of professional debt collectors for collection.desantis computer credit,cir.as is relevant here,section of the fdcpa provides generally that a debt collector may not use any false,deceptive,or misleading representation or means in connection with the collection of any debt.in addition,w ithout limiting the general application of the foregoing,section proscribes sixteen specific debt collection practices,including t he false representation or implication that any individual is an attorney or that any communication is from an attorney.id.
under our prior precedent,the plaintiffs have a triable claim that moss codilis breach letters violated section prohibition on the use of false,deceptive,or misleading representation s in connection with the collection of any debt.see clomon jackson,cir nonetheless,we must decide whether the plaintiffs may press this claim against the money store.they may do so only if the money store,in the process of collecting its own debts,has use d any name other than its own,thereby indicat ing that a third person is collecting or attempting to collect such debts.this provision of the statute is a departure from the general rule that creditors are not subject to the fdcpa.maguire citicorp retail,cir see also mazzei,d at such a rule makes sense given that creditors already have a strong incentive to refrain from badgering their customers about overdue debts.citing,at.thus,we must decide whether the money store used moss codilis name in order to suggest that moss codilis,rather than the money store,was collecting the relevant debts.we conclude that,resolving all factual disputes in plaintiffs favor,it did.
we have previously addressed the scope of the fdcpa false name exception only once before,in maguire citicorp retail services.in maguire,the creditor,citicorp,used the name debtor assistance in its collection letters,which was the name of its collection unit.at.we held that,in determining whether this constituted the use of a false name,a court must apply an objective standard of whether the least sophisticated consumer would have the false impression that a third party was collecting the debt.id.citing clomon,at.
we found that the letterhead in maguire created the impression that a third party called debtor assistance was collecting citicorp debt,and that the evidence in the record was unclear as to whether the plaintiff would have known that debtor assistance was affiliated with citicorp.we therefore held that the letters were potentially misleading enough to trigger the application of the false name exception.accordingly,we reversed the district court grant of summary judgment,and remanded for further proceedings.see id.at.maguire did not,however,address the situation we are confronted with here whether the false name exception can be invoked when the creditor uses the name of an actual,to collect its debts.
to resolve this question of statutory interpretation,we begin with the statutory text.see gross fbl fin,d statutory construction must begin with the language employed by congress and the assumption that the ordinary meaning of that language accurately expresses the legislative purpose.internal quotation marks omitted.because the fdcpa is remedial in nature,its terms must be construed in liberal fashion if the underlying congressional purpose is to be effectuated.freed bd.of governors of fed.reserve,cir accord johnson riddle,cir collecting cases see also pipiles credit bureau of lockport,cir congress painted with a broad brush in the fdcpa to protect consumers from abusive and deceptive debt collection practices.section of the fdcpa provides,in relevant part,that any creditor,who,in the process of collecting his own debts,uses any name other than his own which would indicate that a third person is collecting or attempting to collect such debts,will be deemed a debt collector and subject to liability under the fdcpa.the text of the exception thus sets forth three elements that must be satisfied before deeming a creditor a debt collector pursuant to the false name exception the creditor is collecting its own debts the creditor uses a name other than its own and the creditor use of that name falsely indicates that a third person is collecting or attempting the collect the debts that the creditor is collecting.the first element,that the creditor is collecting its own debts,is undisputedly satisfied here.
turning to the latter two elements,in maguire we described three ways that these elements could be satisfied the creditor uses a name that falsely implies that a third party is involved in collecting its debts the creditor pretends to be someone else or the creditor uses a pseudonym or alias.maguire,at.by separating the situation where a creditor falsely implies the involvement of a third party from the situation where a creditor uses a pseudonym,maguire makes clear that the mere fact that the whose name is used by the creditor is a real entity not affiliated with the creditor is not dispositive.see white goodman,cir conceivably the false name exception could be read so narrowly as to reach only the case in which the creditor is using a pseudonym but this reading,as the cases interpreting section make clear,is too narrow t he statute distinguishes between the use of pseudonyms and a false representation that a third party which may exist is participating in debt collection citations omitted.when presented with the allegation that a creditor has falsely implied that a third party is collecting the creditor debts,we must examine both the actions of the creditor,whether the creditor has used a name,and the role of the third party,whether the third party is collecting or attempt to collect the creditor debts.
because neither use nor collect is defined in the statute,see,we give these terms their ordinary meaning.taniguchi kan pac.saipan,d.starting with use,dictionaries define use as,inter alia,to make use of some immaterial thing as a means or instrument to employ for a certain end or purpose.the compact edition of the oxford english dictionary see also the american heritage dictionary of the english language new college edition to employ for some purpose webster third new international dictionary t o carry out a purpose or action by means of by requiring the creditor to use or employ for some purpose a name other than its own,the text of the statute is clear that there must be some active involvement in the misrepresentation by the creditor before triggering liability under the false name exception.the exception does not create backdoor vicarious liability for creditors simply because the collection agencies they hire to collect their debts engage in deceptive practices.williams citibank,d,
here,the relevant affirmative action by the money store was retaining moss codilis for the express purpose of sending breach letters that appeared to be attorney collection letters to its debtors.although we did not address what constitutes sufficient affirmative action by the creditor in maguire,an analogous case from the seventh circuit,boyd wexler,makes clear why the alleged misrepresentation of moss codilis role here can be attributed to the money store use of moss codilis name in the breach letters.cir.in boyd,the seventh circuit addressed the issue of a collection agency liability for paying a lawyer to use his letterhead on its collection letters.the court of appeals explained that such a practice violates section because the lawyer is allowing the collection agency to impersonate him.the significance of such impersonation is that a debtor who receives a letter signed by a lawyer will think that a lawyer reviewed the claim and determined that it has at least colorable merit.id.at emphasis added.although boyd addressed section liability as against a debt collector,we see no reason why this impersonation would not apply equally to a creditor use of a name under section false name exception.see taylor perrin,landry,delauney durand,cir holding that creditor may be held liable under false name exception for sending a form attorney demand letter that had been by an attorney for the creditor to use in collecting or attempting to collect from the debtor and which bore the letterhead of the attorney law firm and the facsimile of the attorney signature.when a creditor that is collecting its own debts hires a third party for the purpose of sending letters that represent that the third party is collecting the debts,that is sufficient to show the use of a name by the creditor other than its own.see also white,at describing the creditor as the primary violator in a case.
the use element focuses on whether the creditor has actively engaged in misrepresenting its identity in some way by contrast,the collecting or attempting to collect element focuses on whether the third party role is in fact being misrepresented.see id.noting that if a third party is participating in the debt collection,there is no deception.even if the money store use d moss codilis name in collecting its own debts,the false name exception does not apply if in fact moss codilis was collecting or attempting to collect the money store debts such that there was no misrepresentation to the consumer greco trauner,cohen thomas,cir holding no misrepresentation,and thus no liability against the debt collector law firm,where the law firm retained by the creditor clearly disclosed in the letter that the law firm was not acting as an attorney.
the plain meaning of collect in the context of debts is t o gather contributions of money,or money due,as taxes,from a number of people.the compact edition of the oxford english dictionary see also the american heritage dictionary of the english language new college edition to call for and obtain payment of webster third international dictionary t o receive,gather,or exact from a number of persons or other sources.this definition,while useful to the inquiry,is ultimately ambiguous as applied to the facts of any particular case.it does not define how involved a debt collector must be before we can fairly say it is gathering money on behalf of the creditor the money store argues that moss codilis was involved in the debt collection process by generating the breach letters and sending them to the debtors.moss codilis,however,described its breach letter program as an exercise in mass processing.according to plaintiffs and moss codilis,other than printing and mailing the letters and dealing with some limited to directing substantive phone calls from debtors to the money store,all meaningful collection efforts or attempts to gather the money owed were handled by the money store.
we reject the money store contention that by generating and mailing the breach letters alone,moss codilis was collecting or attempting to collect the money store debts.under our holding in maguire,if the money store had simply purchased letterhead from moss codilis and sent out the debt collection letters on moss codilis letterhead,the money store would be liable.see maguire,at taylor,at,see also sokoloski trans union,d,a creditor participating in a arrangement can be liable under the false name exception.and if instead the money store had provided the precise text of the letters to moss codilis,which then printed them on moss codilis letterhead and mailed them it would be a distinction to conclude that moss codilis was collecting or attempting to collect the money store debts by physically printing and mailing the letters.thus,collecting debts must mean something more than any role,no matter how tangential,in the collection process.merely changing the return address from the money store to moss codilis does not alter the force of maguire because it does not change whether the letter misleads consumers,which we have explained is the statutory touchstone for all aspects of the fdcpa,including the false name exception.maguire,at see also clomon,at.accordingly,the fact that moss codilis sent deceptive letters in and of itself is not conclusive evidence of moss codilis collecting or attempting to collect the money store debts.
our rejection of this argument is supported by the federal trade commission interpretative guidance on section,which prohibits a debt collector from us ing any business,company,or organization name other than the collector true name.see ftc,statements of general policy or interpretation staff commentary on the fair debt collection practices act,addressing the scope of the section as applied to creditors,the ftc has suggested 
a creditor violates this section if he uses the name of a collection bureau as a conduit for a collection process that the creditor controls in collecting his own accounts a creditor does not violate this provision where an affiliated and differently named debt collector undertakes collection activity,if the debt collector does business separately from the creditor,where the debt collector in fact has other clients that he treats similarly to the creditor,has his own employees,deals at arms length with the creditor,and controls the process himself.
id.emphasis added the ftc staff commentary distinguishes between a acting as a mere conduit for a collection process that the creditor controls from undertak ing collection activity separate from the creditor.id 
the seventh circuit approach to creditor liability lends further support to this conduit test in nielsen dickerson,the seventh circuit held that creditors who retain an attorney to mass mail debt collection letters are debt collectors under the fdcpa false name exception if the attorney has neither made a considered,professional judgment that the debtor was delinquent on her debt and a candidate for legal action nor meaningfully involved himself in the decision to send the collection letter to any individual debtor.nielsen dickerson,cir internal quotation marks omitted.the seventh circuit in nielsen relied on several factors to determine that the true source of the letter was the creditor,not the attorney.id.at.
first,the court of appeals noted that the attorney review of the debtor information provided by the creditor was ministerial in nature,and did not call for the exercise of professional judgment.id.at.in particular,the court noted that the attorney who signed the letters 
did not make the decision to send a letter to a debtor the creditor did to the extent the attorney eliminated some names from the list of delinquent debtors that the creditor provided based on anything more than obvious gaps or errors in the creditor information,the record suggests that he did so based solely on the discovery that the debtor had declared bankruptcy,had already been sent a letter,or lived in one of three states which would not permit a letter of the kind that dickerson had prepared t his was purely a categorical assessment rather than one calling for an individualized,discretionary assessment 
id.at.the court also noted that the attorney did not have access to debtors files,but rather was simply given basic information on debtors by the creditor,id.at the collection letter sent to debtors was a form letter that the firm prepared and issued en masse in an assembly line fashion,id.at noting that the creditor referred around accounts to the attorney each month the attorney played barely more than a ministerial role in handling the responses to the letter from debtors,the creditor paid the attorney a flat fee for each letter sent regardless of the result if any that the letter produced,and the attorney never took legal action in pursuit of the creditor debts,id.
similarly,in white goodman,the plaintiffs sued the debt collection agency as a under section who was not attempting to actually collect the debts owed,and sued the creditor under the false name exception.white,at.the seventh circuit noted in dicta that if north shore,the debt collection agency,were a,book of the month club the creditor might be liable under section.id.however,the seventh circuit determined that north shore was not a because it did more than simply process and mail letters to debtors.if the debtors failed to pay after receiving the letters,the book of the month club would turn the debts over to north shore to determine what efforts to undertake to collect the debts.id.north shore was then entitled to keep of any amount it collected.id.because north shore was a bona fide collection agency,it could not be liable as a,and book of the month club could not be liable under the false name exception.id 
we therefore hold that,when determining whether a representation to a debtor indicates that a third party is collecting or attempting to collect a creditor debts,the appropriate inquiry is whether the third party is making bona fide attempts to collect the debts of the creditor or whether it is merely operating as a conduit for a collection process that the creditor controls.at.this is a question of fact.in this case,at the summary judgment stage,we can not find as a matter of law that moss codilis was engaged in such bona fide efforts.moss codilis described its breach letter program as an exercise in mass processing.resolving the disputed issues of fact in favor of plaintiffs,the sole function of the program appears to have been to allow creditors to falsely represent to debtors that debt collection letters were from a law firm that had been retained to collect the delinquent debt.
viewed in this light,the jury could conclude that the letters received by plaintiffs appear to be from the money store in every meaningful sense of the word.the money store reviewed and maintained possession over its debtors files.according to nash,moss codilis merely received spreadsheets from the money store containing the information of debtors who the money store had determined were delinquent,added the debtor information onto a form letter with moss codilis letterhead,and mailed the letters.while nash performed minimal reviews of the debtor information provided to her and could request loan documents for a questionable account,her statements suggest that this review was limited to purely ministerial tasks like ensuring that the money store had provided her with complete address information.indeed,nash indicated that the money store typically sent moss codilis batches of borrower information that usually exceeded borrowers,and required moss codilis to mail all the breach letters by the next day.
notwithstanding its limited involvement,moss codilis sent out letters to plaintiffs stating that this law firm has been retained in order to collect a debt for our client.the jury could find that this falsely implied that moss codilis was attempting to collect the money store debts and would institute legal action against debtors on behalf of the money store if the debtors did not resolve the delinquency.thereafter,plaintiffs argue that moss codilis performed virtually no role in the actual debt collection process besides the essentially ministerial tasks of verifying the debt with the money store,informing debtors of the identity of their creditor,and verifying whether a debtor debts had been discharged in bankruptcy.
indeed,the facts here,taken in the light most favorable to plaintiffs,are nearly identical to nielsen,where the seventh circuit found 
having reached the conclusion that the attorney,dickerson,violated sections,the actual source of the letter is obvious.it was household the creditor that selected the debtors to whom dickerson letter was to be sent.it was household that provided the information that dickerson needed regarding the identity of the debtor and the amount of his or her delinquency in order complete the letter.it was household on which dickerson relied for the determination that the debtor was indeed delinquent and therefore an appropriate recipient of the letter.it was household that reserved the right to approve issuance of the letters.it was ultimately household that handled all responses to dickerson letter.and it was household that decided what further action including legal action would be taken in the wake of dickerson letter.
nielsen,at.
we therefore conclude that a jury could find that moss codilis was not collecting the money store debts and instead acted as a mere conduit for a collection process that the money store controlled.at.and if the breach letters falsely indicated that moss codilis was collecting or attempting to collect the money store debts,the money store can be held liable under the fdcpa pursuant to the false name exception.accordingly,the district court erred in granting the money store summary judgment on plaintiffs fdcpa claims,and we vacate its dismissal of their claims and remand for further proceedings 
ii.tila liability 
we next turn to plaintiffs claims that the money store violated the truth in lending act.plaintiffs contend that the money store violated section of tila by failing to refund credit balances owed to them on their accounts.see whenever a credit balance in excess of is created in connection with a consumer credit transaction the creditor shall refund any part of the amount of the remaining credit balance,upon request of the consumer.see also implementing regulation.specifically,plaintiffs argue that the money store charged their accounts unauthorized fees and expenses in excess of that permitted under state law,resulting in credit balances that defendant failed to refund.
tila seeks to protect consumer s against inaccurate and unfair credit billing and credit card practices and promote the informed use of credit by assur ing a meaningful disclosure of credit terms.a.it imposes general liability only on creditors and greatly circumscribes the liability of assignees.see a e.tila defines a creditor as a person who both

in addition to this statutory definition of a creditor,the federal reserve board regulation z interprets the second prong of tila definition of creditor as applying to only a person to whom the obligation is initially payable,either on the face of the note or contract,or by agreement when there is no note or contract.a i gambardella fox,cir describing regulation z as among the regulations promulgated by the federal reserve board to implement tila.the supreme court has indicated that regulation z is entitled to chevron deference where the federal reserve has reasonably interpreted an ambiguous term of tila.household credit,pfennig,d reversing court of appeals for failing to defer.the federal reserve board official staff commentary to regulation z further provides that i f an obligation is initially payable to one person,that person is the creditor even if the obligation by its terms is simultaneously assigned to another person.pt,supp.i at see riviere banner chevrolet,cir holding that a car dealer to whom loan obligation was initially payable was the sole creditor even though loan was immediately assigned to a financing company mayfield capital,civ,wl,at,interpreting the official staff commentary to regulation z to mean that the person to whom the debt is initially payable is the only creditor even when the contract provides for the immediate assignment of the obligation.t he official staff commentary promulgated by the federal reserve board as an interpretation of regulation z may warrant deference as a general matter.chase bank usa,mccoy,d accord ford motor credit milhollin,d unless demonstrably irrational,federal reserve board staff opinions construing tila or regulation z should be dispositive.
we agree with the district court that the money store is not the person to whom the debt arising from the consumer credit transaction was initially payable on the face of the evidence of indebtedness,g,and is therefore not a creditor under tila with respect to the transactions at issue here.specifically,the district court correctly rejected plaintiffs central argument that the loans in question were initially payable to the money store because the assignments to the money store defendants occurred before the funds were disbursed to some of the plaintiffs and before those plaintiffs made their first loan payments.vincent money store,civ.jgk,wl,at.tila establishes a straightforward,objective inquiry for determining the identity of the creditor it is the person to whom the debt arising from the consumer credit transaction is initially payable on the face of the evidence of indebtedness.g.here,the initial lenders on the loans were entities other than the money store.see,app x vincent note stating that in return for a loan that i have received,i promise to pay to the order of the lender.the lender is accubank mortgage corporation.i understand that the lender may transfer this note.
while all the notes were eventually assigned to the money store,the federal reserve board official staff commentary to regulation z provides that i f an obligation is initially payable to one person,that person is the creditor,even if the obligation by its terms is simultaneously assigned to another person.pt,supp.i,at.the notes in question here were not even simultaneously assigned to the money store.each of the assignments took place by means of a separate endorsement,commenced after the notes had been fully executed.
plaintiffs are correct that,at least with respect to the gutierrez and garrido notes,these assignments occurred before the first payment was due on the loan and so,in a literal sense,the initial payment was made to the money store.this,however,is irrelevant under the federal reserve board commentary to regulation otherwise,the commentary guidance that simultaneous assignments do not alter the identity of the creditor under tila would make no sense the assignee of a simultaneous assignment will presumably always be the first person to whom an initial loan payment is made.tila does not define creditor as the person to whom the first loan payment is made rather,it asks to whom the loan is initially payable on the face of the evidence of indebtedness.with respect to each of the plaintiffs loans,that person is an entity other than the money store.
although we conclude that the district court correctly determined that the money store is not a creditor under tila,we note that plaintiffs have identified an apparent oversight in the statute.specifically,the provision of tila plaintiffs claim the money store has violated,section,requires a creditor to credit the amount of any credit balance over to the consumer account and refund any part of the amount of the remaining credit balance,upon request of the consumer.a b.we agree with plaintiffs that restricting the application of section to the initial lender does not make much sense.unlike most of tila provisions,which require creditors to make certain disclosures to debtors at the time of a loan execution,see,id,section imposes obligations on creditors throughout the life of the loan.indeed,we can think of no reason why congress would require a credit balance in a consumer account be refunded only if the balance was maintained by the original creditor and not a subsequent assignee.moreover,as plaintiffs note,given the widespread prevalence of mortgage loan originators selling such loans for securitization,this definition renders section inapplicable to a substantial number of mortgage loans.
legislative history suggests that this gap may be an unintended consequence of congressional reform to tila.see union carbide subsidiaries comm r,cir agencies are charged with implementing legislation that is often unclear and the product of an oftenmessy legislative process.trying to make sense of the statute with the aid of reliable legislative history is rational and prudent.internal quotation marks omitted.in,congress amended tila to limit assignees exposure to liability,allowing the imposition of liability on an assignee only if the violation for which such action or proceeding is brought is apparent on the face of the disclosure statement.taylor quality hyundai,cir quoting a.prior to this amendment,the statutory provisions that assured transfer of the forms containing the tila disclosures to the assignee also made it possible for the debtor to claim that the assignee had knowledge of the violation.id.at.accordingly,based on the recommendation of the federal reserve board,congress simplifie d the definition of creditor to eliminate confusion under the current act as to the responsibilities of assignees,at.
in its initial report accompanying the amendments to tila,the senate banking,housing,and urban affairs committee explained as follows 
this amendment eliminates two uncertainties under present law as to an assignee liability for an original creditor violation of the act.under present law,an assignee is generally liable only where a violation is apparent on the face of the disclosure statement.what types of violations are covered is unclear.this section provides that violations are apparent on the face of a disclosure statement when disclosures are inaccurate or incomplete based on the statement or other documents involved,and where incorrect terminology is utilized.
in addition,this section eliminates ambiguity on the question of assignee liability for rescission by stating explicitly that a consumer exercise of this right is effective against an assignee.without such protection for the consumer,the right of rescission would provide little or no effective remedy.
during the hearings held on the precursor reform bill,the truth in lending simplification and reform act,the testimony related to the issue of assignee liability focused almost exclusively on disclosure requirements.for example,testifying in support of the amendment,the american bankers association noted that decisions by federal courts of appeals had complicated situations where multiple parties financed loans,and that limiting the definition of creditor to the initial creditor clarif ies that only one creditor must make disclosures.truth in lending simplification and reform act hearing on before the comm.on banking,housing,and urban affairs,cong.emphasis added statement of david smith,on behalf of the am.bankers ass n see,meyers clearview dodge sales,cir.the federal reserve recommendation cited in the senate report accompanying the final bill noted 
one issue that spawned extensive litigation is who must make the disclosures if there is more than one creditor in the transaction.the board recommends that only one disclosure statement be required and that the obligation to disclose be placed upon the creditor to whom the obligation is made payable on its face.this provides a simpl e mechanical rule for creditors to follow and should insure that consumers get the required disclosures.
id.at statement of robert evans,consumer fin.ass n quoting testimony of federal reserve board governor jackson.
based on the foregoing,it appears reasonable to conclude that when congress amended tila,its primary concern was limiting assignee liability for an initial creditor violations of tila disclosure requirements.indeed,in the same breath,the senate banking committee report clarified that consumers could continue to exercise their right to rescission against assignees,in the absence of which the right would provide little or no effective remedy,at see also a debtor has right to rescind any credit transaction that creates a security interest in the debtor principal dwelling within three business days consumer information hearings before the subcomm.on consumer affairs of the comm.on banking,finance,and urban affairs,cong.statement of christian white,assistant director for special statutes,ftc requesting amendments to tila to ensure rescission provisions can be enforced against assignees.but by changing the definition of creditor to exclude assignees without also creating an explicit carveout for a consumer ongoing right to be refunded a credit balance,consumers can not rely on tila as a remedy to force an assignee to refund a credit balance,as is the case here 
we can not say congress was unaware of the consequences of changing the definition of creditor as it debated the amendments to tila.at the senate hearing,the statement of robert hobbs,a staff attorney at the national consumer law center,explicitly addressed the issue we are faced with here.hobbs explained 
section.return of customer credit balances.a series of ftc actions against large creditors who were holding millions of dollars of their customer unpaid refunds focused attention on the problems addressed by section.this section adds to the present law the responsibilities of paying such balances after six months and of taking reasonable steps to trace the consumer present address if it has changed.this section also expands these obligations to all creditors although that term is considerably circumscribed by section of.the obligations of tila should also run to assignees.truth in lending simplification and reform act hearing on before the comm.on banking,housing,and urban affairs,cong.emphasis added.
it is well established that when the statute language is plain,the sole function of the courts at least where the disposition required by the text is not absurd is to enforce it according to its terms.lamie trustee,d internal quotation marks omitted.we may think it unwise to allow an assignee to escape tila liability when it overcharges the debtor and collects unauthorized fees,where the original creditor would otherwise be required to refund the debtor promptly.but such a result is not absurd.we will not rewrite the text of the statute,nor will we refuse to defer to the federal reserve consideration of the liability of assignees in regulation z.we note this discrepancy,however,for the benefit of congress and the federal reserve.see generally robert katzmann,statutes,suggesting judiciary should inform congress of its opinions interpreting federal statutes.for the reasons stated above,the money store is not a creditor under tila and the district court correctly dismissed the plaintiffs tila claims.
conclusion 
accordingly,the district court judgment is affirmed in part,vacated in part,and remanded for further proceedings consistent with this opinion.
unsurprisingly,i concur in the court judgment and agree with its reasoning.i write separately to address the argument regarding the false name exception to creditor liability under the fdcpa that the majority opinion declined to address as unnecessary.see supra,at.specifically,i agree with the seventh circuit that where a creditor uses the name of a lawyer or law firm to represent falsely that an attorney has been retained to collect the creditor debt,the false name exception should apply if the lawyer misrepresents his role as an attorney.see nielsen dickerson,cir.
as the majority opinion notes,where the third party is held out by the creditor as an attorney retained to collect the creditor debts,the seventh circuit asks whether the has exercised his independent judgment as an attorney in reviewing each debtor individual case before sending out a letter.see id.our circuit has applied an identical standard to whether an attorney has engaged in deceptive practices in violation of section to the question of whether to pierce creditor immunity under section false name exception.compare,with miller wolpoff abramson,cir citing nielsen with approval.although the majority opinion here does not reach the issue because there is a dispute as to whether moss codilis acted as even an ordinary debt collector,i write to explain why i think we should adopt nielsen wholesale.
my reasoning is simple.we have previously held that the focus of the false name exception indeed,the focus of the entire fdcpa is on what the least sophisticated consumer believes to be true based on the representations made in the debt collection letter.see maguire citicorp.retail,cir see also greco trauner,cohen thomas,cir.where a debt collector holds himself out to the consumer as an attorney retained to collect the debt,we have held that an attorney must be meaningfully involved,exercise some degree of professional judgment so as not to misrepresent his role to the consumer.miller,at,clomon jackson,cir.therefore,it would be entirely consistent with the approach to fdcpa liability we have followed thus far to hold that where the creditor uses the name of an attorney to collect its debts,we should evaluate whether the use of that name misleadingly indicates that the attorney acted in his professional capacity.see nielsen,at.nielsen accords with both the text of the statute and our prior precedent.
one may object that such an approach may expose a creditor to liability where the creditor hired a debt collector to collect its debts,but the debt collector impersonated an attorney on his own accord.not so.as the court opinion explains,a creditor must be actively engaged in the misrepresent ation to use the name of another and be held liable under the false name exception.supra,at.if the creditor is not involved in misrepresenting the debt collector as an attorney,then the false name exception does not apply.accordingly,if such a case presents itself,i believe we should follow nielsen.
finding abundant evidence of the use of abusive,deceptive,and unfair debt collection practices by many debt collectors,u.a emphasis added,congress enacted the fair debt collection practices act,et,fdcpa or act,to eliminate such practices,to ensure that debt collectors who abstain from such practices are not competitively disadvantaged,and to promote consistent state action to protect consumers.jerman carlisle,mcnellie,rini,kramer ulrich lpa,d.to this end,the fdcpa imposes civil liability for prohibited debt collection practices on debt collectors those who regularly collect or attempt to collect debts owed or due or asserted to be owed or due another.the act does not,by its terms,impose liability on creditors.see maguire citicorp retail,cir see also schmitt fma alliance,cir noting the distinction between creditors and debt collectors is fundamental to the fdcpa,which does not regulate creditors activities quoting randolph imbs,cir internal quotation marks omitted.
there is one narrow exception to this rule the act treats as a debt collector any creditor who,in the process of collecting his own debts,uses any name other than his own which would indicate that a third person is collecting or attempting to collect such debts.this false name exception thus limits creditor liability to those creditors who collect their own debts while operating under a pseudonym or name of another perhaps on the theory that such creditors,by freeing themselves of any motivation to protect their own names,have become sufficiently like debt collectors as to merit fdcpa regulation.see harrison nbd,noting false name exception addresses circumstance where natural restraint exerted on creditors by desire to protect good will not present.at any rate,and whatever the rationale behind the false name exception,creditors are not otherwise subject to the fdcpa,be it under the act plain language or under this circuit case law.
or at least not until today.the majority now interprets the fdcpa as imposing liability not just on those creditors who deceptively employ false names to collect their own debts,but also on those who take the unremarkable step of hiring a debt collector to collect their debts so long as that debt collector is,in the majority view,insufficiently involved in bona fide collection efforts.see op.at.today,the majority approach conflates the deception of a creditor who uses a third party name with the deception of a debt collector who falsely claims to be acting as an attorney.more fundamentally,its bona fide test will over time sow ambiguity into an otherwise straightforward statutory scheme,auguring both difficult exercises for future courts and uncertain liability for creditors who contract with debt collectors to collect those creditors debts.i therefore respectfully dissent from the majority determination that the district court erred in granting summary judgment on plaintiffs appellants fdcpa claim.i concur in the judgment that the money store is not a creditor under the truth in lending act,et.
the fdcpa defines debt collector as any person who uses any instrumentality of interstate commerce or the mails in any business the principal purpose of which is the collection of any debts,or who regularly collects or attempts to collect,directly or indirectly,debts owed or due or asserted to be owed or due another.failure to comply with the act requirements exposes such persons to civil liability.see id.a.one such requirement is that a debt collector may not use any false,deceptive,or misleading representation or means in connection with the collection of any debt.id.this includes t he false representation or implication that any individual is an attorney or that any communication is from an attorney.id.
in contrast,creditors,defined in relevant part as persons who offer or extend credit creating a debt or to whom a debt is owed,id,are not regulated by the fdcpa and are not subject to liability under the act for their own debt collection practices.the only exception is when creditors collect debts using the name of another,which then classifies them under the act as debt collectors 
the term debt collector includes any creditor who,in the process of collecting his own debts,uses any name other than his own which would indicate that a third person is collecting or attempting to collect such debts.
the fdcpa further provides that third persons who assist a creditor in using a false name by providing a form which creates the false impression that someone usually a collection agency besides the actual creditor is participating in collecting the debt,white goodman,cir are also liable 
a it is unlawful to design,compile,and furnish any form knowing that such form would be used to create the false belief in a consumer that a person other than the creditor of such consumer is participating in the collection of or in an attempt to collect a debt such consumer allegedly owes such creditor,when in fact such person is not so participating.
b any person who violates this section shall be liable to the same extent and in the same manner as a debt collector is liable under section of this title for failure to comply with a provision of this subchapter.
as relevant here,plaintiffs lori jo vincent,ruth ann gutierrez,and linda and john garrido brought a putative class action against the money store on behalf of themselves and all others similarly situated alleging violations of the fdcpa in attempting to collect amounts purportedly owed on residential home equity loans.the record is devoid of evidence,however,that the money store itself ever communicated with any of the named plaintiffs regarding their loan defaults,much less that it attempted to collect money from them using any name other than its own.instead,each plaintiff received a letter from moss,codilis,stawiarski,morris,schneider prior,llp moss codilis.these letters informed each debtor of his or her default,noting variously that moss codilis had been retained,authorized,or designated to contact the debtor regarding the status of the account as required by the fdcpa,see a,the letters further advised the debtors that if they disputed the debt in writing within days of receipt,moss codilis would provide verification of the debt.also as required by the fdcpa,see id.a,the letters advised that moss codilis would inform the debtors of the name and address of the original creditor upon timely written notice.the breach letters provided contact information for both moss codilis and the money store,referring recipients to moss codilis in connection with the notifications,among other things,and generally referring debtors to the money store for the purpose of addressing payment.
moss codilis prepared and sent these letters pursuant to an april agreement between it and the money store.in the letter of agreement,moss codilis principally agreed to prepare and send breach notification letters on a monthly basis to borrowers who had defaulted on their mortgage loans.the firm further agreed to provide a systems person or persons to facilitate the transfer of data from the money store to moss codilis for use in generating the breach letters and to designate a contact person operations manager to address questions,suggestions,or areas of concern and to assist the money store in developing periodic training courses for the money store own staff.moss codilis also agreed to indemnify the money store in connection with the breach letter program for any losses incurred resulting from the violation of an existing federal or state statute regulations.
the money store,in turn,committed in the letter of agreement to provide moss codilis with access to books,records,databases,investor guidelines,and files necessary for the completion of contract duties.the money store reserved the right to initially and from time to time review and approve sample forms of the breach letters based on the format of the breach letter only.the agreement memorializes the money store objectives in connection with its arrangement with moss codilis 
meet all federal,state,agency and investor requirements 
reduce the money store costs of handling defaulted loans 
develop process improvements 
reduce losses on defaulted loans 
obtain training for current staff.
neither party disputes that moss codilis,with the money store assistance,drafted template breach letters to comply with applicable state and federal laws that moss codilis thereafter generated over breach letters from through,using information regarding defaulted loans provided by the money store and that the firm had numerous communications with debtors and their lawyers,both orally and in it is further undisputed that moss codilis at all relevant times conducted business separately from the money store,had its own employees,acted under its own name,and represented many other clients in connection with debt collection services.the record additionally reflects,moreover,that when its breach letters on behalf of the money store proved ineffective at prompting debtors to pay monies owed,lawyers affiliated with moss codilis often became involved in subsequent legal proceedings on the money store behalf.
neither party disputes that moss codilis drafted,printed,and mailed letters informing the plaintiffs that they owed money to the money store and that
