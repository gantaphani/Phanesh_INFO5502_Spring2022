after public utilities commission puc determined that telephone company engaged in deceptive marketing practices and ordered relief,certain state residents and customers petitioned for relief from puc decision,not to adjudicate their claim that company violated the unfair competition law.the court of appeal,parrilli,held that puc did not have jurisdiction over unfair business practices claims,and puc did not have jurisdiction over false advertising claims.
this petition for writ of review arises out of proceedings brought before the public utilities commission puc by several consumer groups and individual consumers against pacific bell pacific,alleging that pacific engaged in deceptive marketing of its optional telephone services.the puc determined that certain of pacific practices were unlawful and ordered prospective and retrospective relief 
the greenlining institute,the latino issues forum,and individuals identified as california residents and customers of pacific collectively,greenlining seek review of the puc decision not to adjudicate greenlining claims that pacific conduct violated the unfair business practices act bus,et and the false advertising act et,together,the unfair competition law ucl.we conclude greenlining arguments lack merit.
ordinarily,we would issue a summary denial of a petition found to lack merit.however,we take the somewhat unusual step of writing to express our reasoning for denying greenlining petition because of the importance of the legal issue presented 
factual and procedural history 
in,the utility consumers action network ucan,greenlining,and the telecommunications union,california local,international federation of professional and technical engineers,tiu filed complaints against pacific with the puc.the complaints alleged that pacific was using a variety of misleading and deceptive marketing practices to sell optional services to customers in violation of various laws and puc orders.all the allegations relate to marketing practices on incoming calls to pacific service representatives from residential customers.
greenlining complaint alleged violation of public utilities code sections,and,subdivision a and tariff rule.greenlining also alleged that pacific conduct constituted unfair competition in violation of section et and false and deceptive advertising in violation of section et.
in june,the administrative law judge consolidated the complaints into one adjudicatory proceeding and included a petition filed by the puc office of ratepayer advocates that raised similar issues.the utility reform network turn and the communications workers of america cwa were allowed to intervene.
on september,the puc ruled by a three to in favor of pacific on some issues,but also found that pacific had engaged in misleading or potentially misleading marketing practices.turn pacific bell cal,wl hereafter final opinion.it declined to rule on the ucl claims.
the puc ordered various remedies,including that pacific must provide certain notices and disclosures to customers and must file an advice letter modifying tariff rule,which deals with disclosures of rates and information to the public.it also ordered changes to the manner in which service representatives handle customer calls and capped incentive compensation.pursuant to public utilities code section,the puc assessed a fine for two violations,pacific marketing of caller id blocking options and its sequential marketing of optional services.finding that the violations were continuing,the puc imposed penalties totaling million.
greenlining,cwa and pacific filed applications for rehearing.greenlining contended that it was error for the puc to decline to rule on its business and professions code claims and that the fines assessed against pacific were too low.the puc granted limited rehearing to change the ending date for the penalty period,which reduced the amount of penalties to million,eliminate the cap on incentive compensation,and correct errors and insert additional language.order granting limited rehearing and modifying.cal.hereafter rehearing order.in rejecting greenlining claim that the puc was required to adjudicate its ucl claims,the rehearing order indicated that the commission has discretion to leave enforcement of certain claims to the courts.the puc concluded that it had resolved the issues presented in this case and that it did not have to rely on business and professions code sections to fashion a remedy to dispose of the complaints.
greenlining timely petitioned this court for review.
ii.discussion 
greenlining makes a number of arguments that the puc erred in declining to rule on its ucl claims and that this court should remand to the puc for appropriate determinations.but the threshold issue the petition presents is the purely legal question whether the puc has jurisdiction over such claims in the first place.because we conclude it does not,greenlining other arguments are moot.
greenlining bases its argument that the puc has jurisdiction over ucl claims on the legislature broad grant of authority to the puc to adjudicate complaints.public utilities code section provides that the puc has adjudicatory power over complaints made by the commission of its own motion or by any person by written petition or complaint,setting forth any act or thing done or omitted to be done by any public utility in violation or claimed to be in violation,of any provision of law or of any order or rule of the commission.according to greenlining,because pacific is a public utility and sections et and et are provisions of law,i t follows that the commission has jurisdiction over greenlining claims under those provisions.
our analysis of whether the puc has jurisdiction over unfair business practices claims must begin with section.section provides,in relevant part actions for any relief pursuant to this chapter shall be prosecuted exclusively in a court of competent jurisdiction by the attorney general or any district attorney or by any person acting for the interests of itself,its members or the general public.respondent puc and real party in interest pacific contend this provision is dispositive against greenlining.
in stating that it would not rule on the ucl claims,the puc cited section our disposition of the instant complaint rests on public utilit ies code issues,and we do not adjudicate the unfair competition law claims.see business and profession s code.final opinion at.despite its obvious relevance,greenlining did not even mention this section in its petition.in fact,greenlining went so far as to quote from the final opinion in its petition,including the same sentence quoted above but omitted the puc citation to section,noting only citations omitted.
the statutory language is clear.actions seeking any relief under section et shall,must,be brought in court.if the words of a statute are reasonably free of ambiguity and uncertainty,we look no further than those words to determine the meaning of that language.lazar hertz th,d see also common cause board of supervisors cal d,noting the principle of statutory construction that the word may is ordinarily construed as permissive,whereas shall is ordinarily construed as mandatory,particularly when both terms are used in the same statute.
moreover,the amendment to section leaves no doubt as to the appropriate forum for section actions.the amendment substituted shall be brought exclusively in a court of competent jurisdiction for may be prosecuted.historical and statutory notes,west ann.bus.ed.foll,emphasis added.the legislative history,although sparse,is clear.entitled clarifying proper forum for unfair competition actions,the proposal analysis stated,t his proposal would clarify that actions for remedies under the unfair competition statute should be filed with and adjudicated by the court of competent jurisdiction,generally the superior court in the county in which the unfair acts or practices took place.assem.com.on judiciary,coms.on bill reg.sess.for hearing of july,proposal of thomas papageorge,head deputy district attorney,consumer protection division,los angeles district attorney office.
