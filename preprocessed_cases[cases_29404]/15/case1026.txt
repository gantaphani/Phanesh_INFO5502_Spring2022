on ez site,to obtain a plasma television valued at,a participant enters the plasma television matrix by purchasing the required three for.upon payment,he or she receives a link to download the and has his or her name placed on the list of those eligible to receive the television.w hen persons have each paid,the first person to enter will receive the plasma television for free and his name is removed from the list.in that event,the second name on the list moves to the top and more people need to enter for that person to receive the television.ez encourages participants to recruit others to enter the matrix.
plaintiff alleged he entered five matrices,including the plasma television matrix,paying more than.when he realized the ez matrix was a scam,he asked for a refund,which ez refused.he further alleges the have minimal,if any,value,and that b y offering the chance to win valuable prizes,ez has sold the worthless e books for millions of dollars.
plaintiff alleged that paysystems and ginix are the former and current credit card processing and billing services for ez whom many of the matrix participants used to pay for their purchases.he pleaded that ez requested these defendants process credit card orders and sent its website to them for their review.he alleged paysystems and ginix realized ez site was an unlawful lottery and knew ez was making false claims and engaging in unfair business practices,but authorized ez to use their payment services with the knowledge and specific intent of aiding and abetting and facilitating the illegal lottery plaintiff further alleged that these defendants perceived that use of credit cards would lend an aura of respectability to the site,deceive consumers into believing the activity was legal,and make participation easier,thereby generating more revenue.
plaintiff alleged paysystems and ginix contracted with ez to display their logos and create links to their respective websites so they could process payments.the orders were actually placed on defendants websites,where defendants charged the credit cards,collected the money,and then paid ez after deducting what ez owed them for processing the transactions.

plaintiff alleged neovi relationship with ez was similar to that of ginix and paysystems,except customers paid with a virtual check.plaintiff pleaded neovi knew ez operations were illegal but knowingly and intentionally aided and abetted the operation and directly profited by receiving a percentage of each check transaction or collecting a fee

plaintiff brought the second,third,and fourth causes of action for unfair competition solely as a private attorney general under business and professions code sections and against ginix,paysystems,and paypal,respectively,for their payment processing services to entities other than ez.
ginix,paysystems,and paypal each demurred to the causes of action alleged against them neovi joined in paysystems demurrer.essentially,all defendants argued the complaint did not sufficiently allege facts to support a cause of action for aiding and abetting unfair competition.the trial court sustained the demurrers without leave to amend and entered judgment.
after the appeal was filed and briefing was completed,on november,the voters passed proposition,which amended several sections of the unfair competition law.we asked the parties for letter briefs addressing whether the amendments applied to this case.
in april we issued an opinion in which we held that proposition barred plaintiff from proceeding against all defendants except ginix and that plaintiff sufficiently pleaded a cause of action against it for aiding and abetting unfair competition.we remanded to allow plaintiff the opportunity to amend that cause of action to allege sufficient facts to comply with the requirements of the amended unfair competition law.the california supreme court granted review and subsequently transferred the case to this court with directions to vacate our prior opinion and reconsider the matter in light of branick downey savings loan cal th,d.
