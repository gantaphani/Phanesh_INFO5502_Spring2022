the interstate land sales full disclosure act isla,et,protects individual buyers or lessees who purchase or lease lots in large,uncompleted housing developments,including condominiums,by mandating that developers make certain disclosures.bacolitsas owner,llc,cir.the question presented in this appeal is whether a condominium unit in a building is a lot,thus triggering ilsa protections.see a statutory requirements apply to the sale or lease of any lot that is not otherwise exempt.
the consumer financial protection bureau cfpb and the department of housing and urban development hud the agencies presently and formerly charged,respectively,with administering ilsa have defined the term lot to mean any portion,piece,division,unit,or undivided interest in land located in any state or foreign country,if the interest includes the right to the exclusive use of a specific portion of the land.b as relevant here,the cfpb and hud have consistently maintained that this definition applies to condominium units,including units in buildings.in particular,the cfpb and hud have interpreted the phrase exclusive use of land to mean exclusive use of realty,see,cfpb letter br.at,thus concluding that the statutory term lot applies to condominiums because they carry the indicia of and in fact are real estate,land registration,formal procedures,and advertising sales practices,and posting of notice of suspension.
we hold that the cfpb and hud have reasonably interpreted their own definition of the term lot.accordingly,the united states district court for the southern district of new york frederick stamp,judge of the united states district court for the northern district of west virginia,sitting by designation properly granted summary judgment to the plaintiffs.we also hold that the district court did not err or abuse its discretion by awarding attorneys fees.
background 
the facts in this case are straightforward and undisputed.in,bruce and nancy berlin jointly,berlin contracted to purchase a condominium unit on the sixteenth floor of the residence at the ritz carlton,westchester a building then under construction in white plains,new york from the developer,renaissance rental partners,llc,and its principal,louis capelli jointly,renaissance.two years later,and before title was transferred,berlin renounced the agreement and demanded a full refund of the deposit.berlin argued that the contract was voidable because renaissance had not furnished a printed property report,as required by a b when renaissance refused the rescission and denied the refund request,berlin brought this suit pursuant to,which provides a right of action at law or in equity against a developer or agent if the sale or lease was made in violation of section a of this title.id.a.
applying principles of agency deference,the district court granted summary judgment to berlin in a memorandum decision and order dated april.see berlin renaissance rental partners,llc,civ.fps,slip op.at.the court explained that the agency definition of the term lot does not reveal any intention to limit the application of ilsa to horizontal condominiums,and to exclude or vertical condominiums.id.at.because condominiums carry the indicia of and in fact are real estate,id.at quoting.at,the court continued,the proper focus regarding the analysis of whether a unit has exclusive rights to the use of land under is whether the purchase of the unit gave the purchasers the exclusive right to a unit,or any type of realty,id.referencing winter hollingsworth,cir.finally,the court noted the marked absence of an opinion by any court which has found that ilsa is inapplicable to any type of condominium,much less a condominium in particular.id.at.
also relevant to this appeal,the district court decision and order partially granted berlin motion for attorneys fees by awarding fees incurred from the date of this court memorandum decision and order denying the defendants motion to dismiss on august,until the date of this memorandum decision and order.id.at.in support of its decision to award fees,the district court explained that renaissance argument that the condominium unit was not a lot within the meaning of ilsa had been all but foreclosed by other case law interpreting isla.id.
on appeal,renaissance asserts that ownership of a condominium unit in a building does not include the right to the exclusive use of a specific portion of the land,b,because the term land refers to the tangible surface of the earth,appellants br.renaissance also contests the district court decision to award attorneys fees.
after receiving the parties briefs,we invited the cfpb,which did not participate in the district court proceedings,to submit a letter brief offering its views.the cfpb responded by letter brief on march,explaining,in part 
hud explained when it promulgated the definition of lot in that condominiums carry the indicia of and in fact are real estate.rule.at.accordingly,the proper focus regarding the analysis of whether a unit has exclusive rights to the use of land under is whether the purchase of the unit gave the purchasers the exclusive right to a unit,or any type of realty.dist.op.at.in that regard,the preamble to the rule makes clear that a condominium is equivalent to a subdivision,each unit being a lot.at emphasis added.because the condominium unit is itself a lot for purposes of ilsa,a purchaser of the unit need not have a separate interest in raw land to be entitled to the protections of ilsa disclosure and requirements.
as hud explained in,the application of ilsa to condominiums has been consistent hud policy since the issue was first raised in the year that ilsa took effect.rule.at see ilsa,stat.at effective date provision hud consistently reaffirmed that determination in subsequent guidance documents.see.at for jurisdictional purposes,a condominium unit is a lot.guidance.at stating that the definition of lot applies to the sale of a condominium or cooperative unit 
appellants argue that the regulation,by using the term land,was intended to apply only to condominiums that were horizontal developments and campgrounds,br.quoting rule.at,and not condominiums where purchasers have only exclusive use of their unit,ibid.that argument is contradicted by contemporaneous hud statements that demonstrate its understanding that ilsa applies to multistory condominium developments.in the preamble to the rule,hud made clear that ilsa would apply to condominiums intended as primary residences in metropolitan areas that did not qualify for the construction exemption.rule.at.as the district court found,hud discussion of condominiums in metropolitan areas reflected its view that ilsa protections extend to purchasers of or vertical condominiums.dist.op.at.indeed,less than six months after issuing the rule,hud removed any doubt on the matter by issuing guidelines designed to accommodate the realities of condominium construction,especially construction.guidance.at emphasis added.the guidance thus makes clear that the term lot is not confined to horizontal developments and campgrounds.
appellants argue br that the definition of the term land used in is determined by new york state property law,which they claim defines land to exclude structures or improvements constructed on the land.as this court observed,however,ilsa creates a national standard to guarantee full disclosure for the benefit of prospective buyers.bacolitsas,at emphasis added.ilsa national reach requires that the meaning of the federal regulatory term land be determined under federal law.

discussion 
the only merits dispute at issue in this appeal is whether a condominium in a building includes the right to the exclusive use of a specific portion of the land,b emphasis supplied,thus qualifying as a lot within the meaning of ilsa.we review this legal question de novo.see maslow bd.of elections in,cir.
the consistent and longstanding view of the cfpb,hud,and all courts that have considered this issue is that a condominium unit in a building is a lot within the meaning of ilsa when ownership of the unit includes the right to exclusive use of the unit.it is well established that an agency interpretation need not be the only possible reading of a regulation or even the best one to prevail.when an agency interprets its own regulation,the court,as a general rule,defers to it unless that interpretation is plainly erroneous or inconsistent with the regulation.decker nw.envtl.def,d,internal quotation marks omitted.we conclude that the interpretation by the cfpb and hud of their own regulation is reasonable and therefore warrants deference.
in common usage,the term land brings to mind the surface of the earth.in legal parlance,however,land can have a different meaning.the term land is sometimes used to mean a n estate or interest in real property,a concept that is not restricted to the earth surface,but extends below and above the surface.black law dictionary ed quoting peter butt,land law ed.moreover,ownership of land,in this technical sense,does not require ownership of soil or other physical matter tied to the earth.ultimately,as a juristic concept,land is simply an area of space,its position being identified by natural or imaginary points located by reference to the earth surface.id.quoting the same.
inasmuch as land is sometimes used as a term of art referring to real estate,the cfpb and hud have reasonably concluded that their own definition of lot applies to a condominium unit in a building.condominium ownership had only emerged in the continental united states in the but by the time hud promulgated its definition of lot in,the agency was already applying ilsa to sales of condominium units on the basis that those units are real estate.as hud explained at that time 
the application of the act to condominiums has been consistent oilsr policy since the issue was first raised in.the bases for this position are that condominiums carry the indicia of and in fact are real estate,whether or not the units therein have been constructed.a condominium is accordingly viewed by oilsr as equivalent to a subdivision,each unit being a lot.adverse comment,particularly from builders,asserts that condominiums are equivalent to houses and the sale of houses was not intended to be covered by the act.however,the right to condominium space is a form of ownership,not a structural description.this condominium concept is employed as an ownership form for completely horizontal developments and even for campgrounds.congress recognized the need to exempt professional builders from the act and provided an appropriate exemption in a.for a condominium unit sale to be exempted from the act,it must accordingly qualify for exemption,either it must be completed before it is sold,or it must be sold under a contract obligating the seller to erect the unit within two years from the date the purchaser signs the contract of sale.
at.in other words,a right to exclusive use of a condominium unit is a right to exclusive use of real estate,and therefore a condominium unit whether in a building or even in completely horizontal developments and campgrounds is a lot within the meaning of ilsa 
the relevant agencies originally hud and now the cfpb,see note,ante have consistently maintained this understanding ever since the issue was first raised in.see,cfpb letter br.at,hud guidance lot includes a condominium or cooperative unit.congress has at least implicitly recognized that interpretation.see winter,at congress did more than acquiesce in hud longstanding interpretation congress took specific action in to exempt the sale of some condominiums from the act scope,implying that,absent such an exemption,ilsa must apply to the sale of condominiums.and courts,too,have consistently held that a condominium unit constitutes a lot.becherer merrill lynch,pierce,fenner smith,cir.finally,this interpretation accords with the text and purposes of ilsa.as the court of appeals for the eleventh circuit explained 
ilsa was intended to curb abuses accompanying interstate land sales.the act accomplishes that goal by including within it all sales of lots and then exempting a number of transactions,including sales of fully improved property.it is reasonable to conclude,as hud did,that the term lot was used to refer generally to interests in realty.the legislative history supports this construction,employing the terms lot,land,and real estate in discussing the act.this construction is also reasonable in terms of the purpose of the statute.a fraudulent sale of land is not rendered any less fraudulent if the condominium form of ownership is utilized.
winter,at.for these reasons,we defer to the agency rule defining lot and to the consistent and longstanding agency understanding that this rule applies to condominium units in buildings when ownership of those units includes the right to exclusive use of those units 
on appeal,renaissance has not asserted any other defense to berlin action to revoke the contract pursuant to c,see note,ante,and we therefore affirm the district court grant of summary judgment to berlin.
renaissance also argues that the district court erred or abused its discretion by awarding attorneys fees to berlin.before reaching the merits of this claim,however,we must address berlin argument that we lack appellate jurisdiction to consider the district court fees award because renaissance filed a premature notice of appeal after the entry of judgment ordering an award of particular costs and fees,but prior to the district court actual calculation of that award amount 
in the circumstances of this case,we have jurisdiction to review the district court decision to award fees it is true that a award of attorneys fees and costs is not appealable until the amount of the fees has been set by the district court,o g,passenger,cir,and therefore renaissance appeal of the fees award was premature,see fed.a a period for filing notice of appeal starts after entry of appealable order or judgment.nonetheless,a premature notice of appeal from a nonfinal order may ripen into a valid notice of appeal if a final judgment has been entered by the time the appeal is heard and the appellee suffers no prejudice.houbigant,img fragrance brands,llc,cir quotation marks omitted.these two conditions have been met here.following renaissance notice of appeal,the district court amended the judgment to account for the fees amount,see note,ante,and we detect no prejudice to berlin.accordingly,we proceed to the merits of the decision to award fees.see,laforest honeywell int l,cir because there is now an appealable final order regarding fees and costs,that order is ripe for review.iberiabank beneva i,llc,cir 
ilsa provides district courts with wide discretion in fashioning a suitable monetary award.according to the statute,t he amount recoverable in a suit authorized by this section may include interest,court costs,and reasonable amounts for attorneys fees,independent appraisers fees,and travel to and from the lot.c.the statutory authorization that a district court may award attorneys fees clearly connotes discretion,martin franklin capital,d quoting fogerty fantasy,d,and we therefore review a district court decision whether to award attorneys fees under ilsa for abuse of discretion,see barbour city of white plains,cir we review a district court award of attorneys fees for abuse of discretion.see also in re sims,cir a district court abuses its discretion if it base s its ruling on an erroneous view of the law or on a clearly erroneous assessment of the evidence,or render s a decision that can not be located within the range of permissible decisions internal citation and quotation marks omitted.
in this case,the district court acted well within its discretion by awarding attorneys fees.in its careful and memorandum decision and order,the court reasonably and correctly concluded that it has been the longstanding and unanimous view of the cfpb,hud,and various courts that ilsa can apply to condominium units in buildings.see part a,ante.to be sure,renaissance legal argument is not frivolous the term land can,in some contexts,refer specifically to the earth surface,and prior to this opinion we had not yet ruled directly on this question.but ilsa does not limit fee awards to
