on this appeal we consider a class action suit commenced in new york state supreme court on february.the action was brought by michael galeno and other plaintiffs as disgruntled customers of defendant blockbuster,defendant or blockbuster.they charged in their complaint that defendant no late fee program,begun on january,is a deceptive forced sale scheme,which in their view is worse than a bait and switch scheme because a customer who holds a video beyond its due date is charged without notice for a sale of the item.this conduct by the defendant,plaintiffs allege,is a deceptive business practice under new york law and constitutes unjust enrichment under the common law.defendant conduct resulted in a suit being brought by attorneys general and the district of columbia,and after a settlement was reached in that suit,the program entitled no late fee was scrapped by defendant by march.
after blockbuster removed galeno action to federal court,plaintiffs moved to send this class action case back to state court.plaintiffs have appealed the district court denial of their motion and assert that the statutory requirement has not been met.it is against this backdrop that we must decide the jurisdictional question raised on the appeal which or the burden of demonstrating federal jurisdiction to answer this question we address the jurisdictional requirements of the class action fairness act of cafa,stat.codified in scattered sections of.
background 
plaintiff michael galeno plaintiff or appellant,the named plaintiff in this putative class action,appeals from the july,order of united states district court for the southern district of new york daniels,denying his motion to remand the action for lack of federal subject matter jurisdiction to the new york state supreme court.
because appeals from an order denying a motion to remand under cafa must be decided not later than days after the date on which such appeal was filed,c,on march,we vacated the district court denial by summary order and remanded the case to that court.see galeno blockbuster.cir.in this opinion we explain our reasons for doing so.
a.the parties and the class complaint 
on february,galeno,a new york resident,filed this putative class action against defendant blockbuster in new york state supreme court,on behalf of himself and all similarly situated new york customers who rented videos from blockbuster stores from january,to the present.plaintiff alleged that blockbuster had engaged in deceptive business practices through its program.
the program was a widely advertised innovation by blockbuster that the company initiated on january.under the program,blockbuster no longer charged customers a late fee for keeping rental videos past their due dates.rather,if a customer chose to keep a rental or otherwise failed to return it on time,blockbuster automatically converted the rental to a sale of the video on the eighth day past the video original due date.the customer was then billed an additional amount for the selling price of the video,minus the initial rental fee already paid.blockbuster referred to this action as a converted sale.if a customer returned the video within days after the sale date,blockbuster agreed to refund or credit the customer the sale price,and to charge the customer only a restocking fee for costs associated with the conversion of the video from rental to sale and then back to rental.blockbuster advertised that customers could celebrate the end of late fees and declared that there are no more late fees at blockbuster.
plaintiff complaint alleged that blockbuster advertising was deceptive in that it omitted the material fact that instead of being assessed a late fee,customers would be charged a sale fee,or if they returned the video,a restocking fee.blockbuster included on its website some information regarding converted sales and restocking fees.nonetheless,according to plaintiff,blockbuster did not make those details clear,but required customers to search the website to find them.similarly,blockbuster omitted pertinent details from its store signage and television advertising.this,averred plaintiff,violated new york general business law deceptive business practices and enriched blockbuster unjustly.plaintiff claimed that there were thousands of members of the class,though their exact number and identities are currently unknown.for relief,the complaint requested actual or statutory damages,whichever are greater.plaintiff stated that statutory damages would be per customer.the complaint also sought injunctive relief and attorney fees.
federal district court proceedings 
blockbuster removed the action on april,to federal court,asserting diversity jurisdiction under both the general diversity provision,a,and cafa,d.after blockbuster filed its answer to the complaint,plaintiff promptly moved to remand the case back to state court on the ground that the federal court lacked subject matter jurisdiction because blockbuster could not satisfy the requisite of million,see d.blockbuster then filed under seal with the district court a declaration by its senior vice president and corporate controller,james howell,that described the total amount of restocking fees and converted sales incurred by new york customers under the program from january,to may.
before the district court,blockbuster asserted that cafa had reversed the traditional rule that the party seeking removal to federal court bears the burden of establishing federal jurisdiction,citing a recent decision by the united states district court for the central district of california,yeroushalmi blockbuster,wl.july,overruled by abrego abrego dow chem,cir per curiam.the district court,agreeing with blockbuster,denied galeno motion to remand.the court stated,on my review of the case,so far i in substantial agreement with the yeroushalmi court.the trial judge did not make any factual findings as to the amount in controversy or the diversity of the parties,nor did he explain the basis on which he found subject matter jurisdiction,except to say 
obviously the issue is whether or not a defendant should have the right to be in federal court.and there is a presumption that there is such a right given,sic sufficient factual basis consistent with the statute.therefore,i going to deny the motion to remand i think on the record as it exists,i think the defendant has met its burden at this stage of the proceeding to demonstrate a right to be in federal court and the plaintiff has not met the burden to demonstrate,and that there is not sufficient basis to conclude that there federal jurisdiction.
on july,the district court issued a brief order denying plaintiff motion to remand.
appellate proceedings 
galeno filed a motion,pursuant to c,for permission to appeal the district court ruling,which we granted.as noted above,on march,we issued a summary order in this case.in that order we vacated and remanded the order of the district court,instructing that court to explain its calculation of the reasonably probable damages.galeno.at.
