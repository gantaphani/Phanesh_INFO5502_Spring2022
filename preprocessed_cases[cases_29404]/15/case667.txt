appellant timothy hauk appeals the district court grant of summary judgment in favor of appellee chase bank usa,on his claims for violations of the truth in lending act tila,california unfair competition law ucl,cal.bus.and california false advertising law fal,id.we affirm the district court grant of summary judgment on hauk tila claim but reverse and remand the district court grant of summary judgment on his ucl and fal claims.
factual and procedural background 
in june,hauk opened a chase credit card account and received a cardmember agreement cma.after hauk had maintained his chase account for about sixteen months,chase sent him a balance transfer offer bto in october.the bto offered hauk a promotional fixed annual percentage rate apr of for any balances he transferred to his chase account.it also incorporated the terms of the cma and indicated that chase could impose an increased rate apr in lieu of the promotional rate if hauk made a late payment to chase or any of his other creditors.during a telephone conversation with a chase representative on or about october,hauk transferred a balance with another creditor to his chase account,thereby accepting the bto.
on hauk october statement,chase indicated the promotional apr of for transferred balances.when hauk received his november statement,however,he learned that chase had applied a apr of to his account,resulting in a finance charge.in response to the increased rate,hauk contacted chase and was informed that he was no longer eligible to receive the promotional.
according to chase,hauk lost eligibility for the apr because of a late payment he had made to another creditor about three months before he accepted the bto.specifically,in july,hauk had made his final mortgage payment to home coming funding hcf one day after the grace period,and hcf reported that hauk account was delinquent to experian,a credit report agency.
to evaluate hauk eligibility for promotional and preferred rates,chase performed monthly account reviews and relied on information it received from experian.prior to sending hauk the october bto,chase had accessed his experian credit report in august and september.if chase had discovered hauk late payment to hcf during either of those credit reviews and elected to impose a apr because of that late payment,chase computer system would have automatically cancelled any pending offers,including the bto.chase,however,did not cancel the bto before hauk accepted it,and hauk account does not reflect chase knowledge of his late payment to hcf until the end of october.
based on this information,chase contends that it did not discover hauk late payment to hcf until after hauk accepted the bto.hauk,on the other hand,alleges that chase discovered his late payment to hcf in august or september but waited to apply a apr until after he accepted the bto.hauk also argues that,irrespective of when chase learned about hauk late payment to hcf,the cma and bto did not disclose that chase could impose a apr based on a late payment he made before accepting the bto.
hauk filed his class action complaint in state court on march.in his first amended complaint filed less than three months later,hauk alleged claims for violations of tila ucl fal california consumers legal remedies act clra,cal.and the fair credit reporting act fcra.asserting jurisdiction under,chase removed the matter to the united states district court for the central district of california on july.
chase moved for summary judgment on the grounds that hauk state law claims were preempted and that chase disclosures defeated hauk tila and state law claims.after providing for limited discovery,the district court granted chase motion for summary judgment on hauk tila claim.with respect to hauk ucl,fal,and clra claims,the district court found that the state law claims were not preempted and deferred addressing the merits until the parties conducted discovery on the question of when chase first learned of hauk late payment to hcf.after additional discovery and supplemental briefing,the district court granted chase motion for summary judgment on hauk state law claims,explaining that chase disclosures defeated the claims and that hauk could not prove chase had knowledge of his late payment before he accepted the bto.hauk has withdrawn his fcra claim and does not appeal the district court grant of summary judgment on his clra claim.hauk therefore appeals only the district court grant of summary judgment in favor of chase on his tila,ucl,and fal claims.
ii.discussion 
we review a district court grant of summary judgment de novo,thereby applying the same standard as a district court.laws sony music entm t,cir.summary judgment is proper if the pleadings,the discovery and disclosure materials on file,and any affidavits show that there is no genuine issue as to any material fact and that the movant is entitled to judgment as a matter of law.c.when determining whether a genuine issue of material fact remains for trial,we must view the evidence and all inferences therefrom in the light most favorable to the party and may not weigh the evidence or make credibility determinations.anderson liberty lobby,d.we also review a district court interpretation of state law de novo.laws,at.
hauk tila claim 
congress enacted tila to assure a meaningful disclosure of credit terms so that the consumer will be able to compare more readily the various credit terms available to him and avoid the uninformed use of credit,and to protect the consumer against inaccurate and unfair credit billing and credit card practices.to effectuate tila purpose,a court must construe the act provisions liberally in favor of the consumer and require absolute compliance by creditors.in re ferrell,cir see also jackson grant,cir even technical or minor violations of the tila impose liability on the creditor.
tila entrusts the federal reserve board with implementation of the act,and the agency has imposed even more precise disclosure requirements via regulation virachack.ford,cir see also household credit,pfennig,d congress has expressly delegated to the board the authority to prescribe regulations containing such classifications,differentiations,or other provisions as,in the judgment of the board,are necessary or proper to effectuate the purposes of tila,to prevent circumvention or evasion thereof,or to facilitate compliance therewith.quoting a alteration in original.courts must defer to the decisions of the federal reserve board and can not apply t he concept of meaningful disclosure that animates tila in the abstract.ford motor credit milhollin,d see also anderson.ford valencia,d a bsent some obvious repugnance to the statute,regulation z should be accepted by the courts,as should the board interpretation of its own regulation.
hauk account with chase provided him with the use of credit,rendering the disclosures in subpart b of regulation z controlling.see a because the bto constituted a credit device,subdivision b mandated the applicable disclosures in subsection a.see official staff,supp.i,b cmt.specifically,subsection a required that the bto disclose the applicable apr and any increased penalty rate that may apply upon the occurrence of one or more specific events,such as a late payment.id.a cmt.
regulation z also required that chase disclosures reflect the terms of the legal obligation between the parties.c.pursuant to subsection c,a disclosure would have violated tila if it inaccurately described the creditor or cardholder rights or obligations as they existed at the time the disclosure was made.demando morris,cir see also official staff,supp.i,c cmt.the disclosures should reflect the credit terms to which the parties are legally bound at the time of giving the disclosures.the legal obligation is determined by applicable state or other law and normally is presumed to be contained in the contract that evidences the agreement.
here,while the bto stated that chase had sent hauk balance transfer checks with a low fixed apr,it disclosed that hauk may lose that rate upon the occurrence of certain events.specifically,a footnote on the first page of the bto stated,this special rate applies only when you make your required minimum payments by the payment due date and your account is eligible for preferred customer pricing as described in the terms of offer.on the reverse side of the bto,the terms of offer indicated that hauk acceptance of the offer will result in the apr until his balance is paid in full but expressly limited hauk continued eligibility for that rate 
any promotional rate or regular preferred pricing purchase apr may change to your apr if any minimum payment on any loan or account of yours with us or your other creditors was not made by the payment due date 
the cma also disclosed that,as a condition to remaining eligible for preferred rates,hauk must have made at least the required minimum payments when due on his account and loans with chase and his other creditors.by referencing any late payments in the past tense was not made and have made,the bto and cma sufficiently disclosed that hauk could lose the promotional apr if he had made a late payment to any of his creditors.
as both parties recognize,the cma and bto did not give chase an unlimited right to impose a apr based on any past late payment.if chase had learned of a late payment in a particular month and elected not to increase the cardholder apr because of it,chase arguably would have waived its right to increase the cardholder apr in a subsequent month based on that same late payment see klein am.luggage works,waiver is the voluntary relinquishment of a known right or conduct such as to warrant an inference to that effect.it implies knowledge of all material facts and of one rights,together with a willingness to refrain from enforcing those rights.accord aeroglobal capital,cirrus.
chase could not,however,be deemed to have waived its right to impose a apr based on a late payment it discovered after it mailed the bto,even if that late payment occurred before it mailed the bto.see klein,at it is obvious that one can not waive that of which he had no knowledge at the time of the alleged waiver.see also aeroglobal capital,at t he standards for proving waiver under delaware law are quite exacting.the facts relied upon to prove waiver must be unequivocal.citations omitted.
nonetheless,while chase may have breached the cma if it knew of hauk late payment before he accepted the bto,the injury hauk suffered neither resulted from any lack of tila disclosures nor gave rise to a claim under tila.unlike hauk state law claims,tila is only a disclosure statute and does not substantively regulate consumer credit but rather requires disclosure of certain terms and conditions of credit before consummation of a consumer credit transaction.rendler corus bank,cir citation omitted see also grimes new century mortgage,cir mckeown,dissenting the plaintiffs may indeed have been duped by an unethical loan officer.whether they have a claim under tila is another matter.tila focuses on disclosure and does not serve as an umbrella statute for consumer protection in real estate transactions.rather,tila is designed to foster the informed use of credit by assur ing a meaningful disclosure of credit terms.quoting a third alteration in original szumny am,cir a creditor substantive rights are still governed by state law tila merely classifies those rights for disclosure purposes.
the legislative history from congress enactment and amendment of tila is consistent with the language of the statute limiting its scope to disclosure.see,at the basic purpose of the truth in lending bill is to provide a full disclosure of credit charges to the american consumer.the bill does not in any way regulate the credit industry,as reprinted in,title i,the truth in lending and credit advertising title,does not regulate the credit industry it provides for full disclosure of credit charges,rather than regulation of the terms and conditions under which credit may be extended,at,as reprinted in,the committee believes that early disclosure of relevant cost information,coupled with widespread publication of the costs of different cards,will help remedy the problem of enabling consumers to shop around for the best cards.
consequently,while an inaccurate disclosure that itself breaches a credit agreement may also violate tila,see hubbard fidelity fed.bank,cir,the breach of a credit agreement based on conduct independent of the disclosures does not necessarily give rise to a tila claim.
hauk nonetheless argues that misleading disclosures can violate tila and that chase disclosures were misleading because the bto offered him a promotional rate even though chase knew of his past late payment and intended to impose the apr after he accepted the offer.indeed,the third circuit has held that a disclosure that is adequate when viewed in isolation could still be misleading,and thereby give rise to a tila claim,if the creditor undisclosed intent was inconsistent with its disclosure.rossman fleet bank ass n,cir accord clark troy nichols,cir thornberry,dissenting.specifically,the court concluded that,even though the creditor initial no annual fee disclosure was accurate in the narrowest of senses,the creditor alleged intent to impose an annual fee six months later rendered the initial disclosure misleading and gave rise to a tila claim.rossman,at.
the third circuit expansive reading of regulation z appears to have originated with its general premise that tila prohibits not only literal falsities,but also misleading statements.id.at citing taylor quality hyundai,cir smith chapman,cir.while a misleading statement may violate tila,wilson credithrift of,cir,our circuit has neither rejected nor adopted the blanket proposition that a misleading statement violates tila.instead of determining whether a particular disclosure is misleading in the abstract,our circuit has focused on subsection c requirement that disclosures reflect the terms of the legal obligation between the parties and the requirements in other relevant subsections of regulation z or tila.
the third circuit,in contrast,did not rely on a particular provision of tila or regulation z to support its conclusion that a disclosure could violate tila based on a creditor undisclosed intent to act contrary to the disclosure.in holding that a lender intent may render a disclosure misleading,the court focused on the difficulty a cardholder would face upon receipt of a notice imposing a new annual fee if the cardholder had already accumulated a high balance and could not pay off the balance to avoid the fee.rossman,at.congress,however,has already vested responsibility for determining whether regulation z should require additional disclosures to protect against such hardships exclusively with the federal reserve board 
the concept of meaningful disclosure that animates tila,can not be applied in the abstract.meaningful disclosure does not mean more disclosure.rather,it describes a balance between competing considerations of complete disclosure and the need to avoid informational overload.and striking the appropriate balance is an empirical process that entails investigation into consumer psychology and that presupposes broad experience with credit practices.administrative agencies are simply better suited than courts to engage in such a process.

as the supreme court has emphasized,when neither congress nor the federal reserve board has elected to require a particular disclosure,such as a disclosure about a creditor intent,a court should not impose that disclosure requirement 
l egislative silence is not always the result of a lack of prescience it may instead betoken permission or,perhaps,considered abstention from regulation.in that event,judges are not accredited to supersede congress or the appropriate agency by embellishing upon the regulatory scheme.accordingly,caution must temper judicial creativity in the face of legislative or regulatory silence.
