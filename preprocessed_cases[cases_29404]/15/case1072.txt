tobacco product manufacturer reynolds promoted its tobacco products in california as part of reynolds promotion of its winston brand of cigarettes,reynolds sponsored the nascar winston cup series,a series of races characterized by reynolds as a points competition where competitors in various venues in the united states vied for points needed to win awards.events comprising a portion of the nascar winston cup series were held at the sears point raceway sears point in northern california 
in november reynolds and the people signed the msa that settled the people litigation against various tobacco product manufacturers,including reynolds further,the parties stipulated to entry of a consent decree and final judgment.as part of the consent decree,the superior court of san diego county approved the msa people philip morris,no.the court also retained exclusive jurisdiction for purposes of implementing and enforcing the msa.
the placed various detailed express restrictions on reynolds advertising and marketing practices.however,despite generally banning all billboard and other outdoor advertising of tobacco products,the msa expressly permitted reynolds to continue to promote and advertise its nascar winston cup series as a brand name sponsorship.eventually,a dispute arose between the parties about whether by not removing some outdoor advertising signs mentioning winston at sears point,reynolds violated the msa limitation on outdoor advertising.
in march after communications between the parties failed to resolve the matter,the people brought this litigation against reynolds to enforce the msa and obtain relief for reynolds alleged violation of the msa restrictions on outdoor advertising.ultimately,the superior court granted the people motion for summary judgment against reynolds.reynolds appeals.

discussion 
reynolds contends its advertising in california of the nascar winston cup series complied fully with the msa restrictions on outdoor advertising.however,the people contend reynolds violated the msa provisions involving the length of time that reynolds advertising signage was allowed to be posted at sears point.in particular,the parties dispute the meaning of the phrase initial sponsored event as used in the msa subsection iii c a and later in the msa subsection iii c e ii.
specifically,reynolds contends that since the phrase initial sponsored event in the msa subsection iii c a undisputedly referred to the first event in reynolds brand name sponsorship series in a period,the phrase initial sponsored event in the msa subsection iii c e ii should be interpreted as conveying the same meaning,to wit,that reynolds outdoor advertising could be placed at any site where a brand name sponsorship event took place as long as such advertising was placed no more than days before the first event in the brand name sponsorship series as a whole and was removed no later than days after the last event in the entire series.thus,applying its proffered interpretation,reynolds concludes the protracted schedule of the nascar winston cup series from february to november allowed for uninterrupted signage at sears point.
however,though concurring in reynolds interpretation of the meaning of the phrase initial sponsored event as used in the msa subsection iii c a,the people contend the phrase initial sponsored event as used in the msa subsection iii c e ii referred to the first event at each particular race track where a portion of the brand name sponsorship series took place.hence,applying their proffered interpretation,the people conclude reynolds outdoor advertising at each of those particular sites was temporally limited to the period between days before and days after the events at each such respective site.
in sum,reynolds contends the text of the msa subsection iii c e ii indicated that the phrases initial sponsored event and last sponsored event referred to the first and last events of reynolds brand name sponsorship series as a whole,while the people contend those phrases referred to the first and last days of events at particular races sites.analyzing the disputed portions of the msa under established principles of contract interpretation,we conclude the people interpretation of the meaning of the phrase initial sponsored event in the msa subsection iii c e ii is correct.however,in reaching our conclusion,we decline to apply the people proffered analysis based on the theory that the overall general intent of the msa was to reduce youth smoking and promote public health.though the parties pleadings acknowledged that the msa stated goals included reduction of youth smoking and promotion of public health,the msa was fundamentally a means of settling litigation by striking a balance between competing interests.as such,the parties expressly agreed that although some outdoor advertising by reynolds would be prohibited,some would nevertheless be allowed.
legal standards for interpreting the msa 
when a dispute arises over the meaning of contract language,the first question to be decided is whether the language is reasonably susceptible to the interpretation urged by the party.if it is not,the case is over.citation.if the court decides the language is reasonably susceptible to the interpretation urged,the court moves to the second question what did the parties intend the language to mean oceanside,fidelity federal bank th,d.in interpreting an unambiguous contractual provision we are bound to give effect to the plain and ordinary meaning of the language used by the parties.coast plaza doctors hospital blue cross of california th,d.thus,where contract language is clear and explicit and does not lead to absurd results,we ascertain intent from the written terms and go no further.shaw regents of university of california th,d.if the contract is capable of more than one reasonable interpretation,it is ambiguous citations,and it is the court task to determine the ultimate construction to be placed on the ambiguous language by applying the standard rules of interpretation in order to give effect to the mutual intention of the parties citation.badie bank of america th,d.however,the mere fact that a word or phrase in a contract may have multiple meanings does not create an ambiguity.palmer truck ins.exchange cal th,d,palmer.
the goal of contractual interpretation is to determine and give effect to the mutual intention of the parties.safeco ins.robert cal th,d,bank of the west superior court cal th,d.thus,a court paramount consideration in construing a stipulation is the parties objective intent when they entered into it.sy first family.partnership cheung th,d accord,pardee construction insurance of the west th,d southern pacific transportation santa fe pacific pipelines,th,d.that intent is to be inferred,if possible,solely from the written provisions of the contract.pardee,at,d.all the rules of interpretation must be considered and each given its proper weight,where necessary,in order to arrive at the true effect of the instrument.city of manhattan beach superior court cal th,d.generally speaking,the rules of interpretation of written contracts are for the purpose of ascertaining the meaning of the words used therein miscione barton development.th,d.
thus,a contract must be so interpreted as to give effect to the mutual intention of the parties as it existed at the time of contracting,so far as the same is ascertainable and lawful.the language of a contract is to govern its interpretation,if the language is clear and explicit,and does not involve an absurdity.when a contract is reduced to writing,the intention of the parties is to be ascertained from the writing alone,if possible.the whole of a contract is to be taken together,so as to give effect to every part,if reasonably practicable,each clause helping to interpret the other.a contract must receive such an interpretation as will make it lawful,operative,definite,reasonable,and capable of being carried into effect,if it can be done without violating the intention of the parties.the words of a contract are to be understood in their ordinary and popular sense,rather than according to their strict legal meaning unless used by the parties in a technical sense,or unless a special meaning is given to them by usage,in which case the latter must be followed.
in sum,courts must give a reasonable and commonsense interpretation of a contract consistent with the parties apparent intent.renee superior court cal th,d,renee.the language in a contract must be construed in the context of that instrument as a whole.palmer,supra,cal th at,d.further,if possible,the court should give effect to every provision of the contract.national city police officers city of national city th,d national city.
same meaning rule 
seeking reversal of the summary judgment,reynolds contends the phrase initial sponsored event used in the msa subsections iii c a and iii c e ii must be interpreted under the same meaning rule,a rule of contract interpretation requiring that an identical phrase or word used in a contract be given the same meaning throughout the contract in the absence of anything in the contract suggesting otherwise.palmer,supra,cal th at,d,victoria superior court cal d,caminetti pac.mutual ins.cal d,ml direct,tig specialty ins.th,d principal mutual life ins.vars,pave,mccord freedman th,d levi strauss aetna casualty surety d.words used in a certain sense in one part of a contract are deemed to have been used in the same sense elsewhere in that instrument.specifically,reynolds characterizes the phrase initial sponsored event in the msa subsection iii c a as an arbitrary combination of words with a fixed meaning that clarified a time restriction on brand name sponsorships by limiting any brand name sponsorship to a period measured from the first event in the brand name sponsorship series as a whole.attaching the same meaning to the phrase initial sponsored event as used later in the msa subsection iii c e ii,reynolds concludes the time restriction imposed by that subsection should also be interpreted as measured from the first event of the brand name sponsorship as a whole.however,when reasonably read in context,the phrase initial sponsored event had different meanings in those two disputed msa subsections.palmer,at,d.
we agree with reynolds that when considered in context,the phrase initial sponsored event as used in the msa subsection iii c a referred to the first event of reynolds brand name sponsorship series as a whole in limiting reynolds to a single brand name sponsorship in any period measured from the date of the initial sponsored event in the series.however,we reject reynolds contention that there was no difference in context between the msa two uses of the phrase initial sponsored event sufficient to overcome the presumption such phrase had the same meaning in the two disputed msa subsections.instead,a reasonable reading of those two subsections in context indicates the same meaning rule should not apply here.palmer,supra,cal th at,d.the msa contained no express definition of the phrase initial sponsored event.the phrase initial sponsored event was simply a series of words to be interpreted in light of the context where they were used.thus,in a parenthetical clause in the msa subsection iii c a,the phrase initial sponsored event was used to identify the date constituting the beginning of the month period when reynolds could not engage in more that one brand name sponsorship.the msa subsection iii c a did not purport to define the term event or make any reference to the location of any such event.
in contrast to the msa subsection iii c a,the language of the msa subsection iii c e ii expressly referred to the location of the initial sponsored event.specifically,as used in the msa subsection iii c e ii,the phrase initial sponsored event appeared in the context of limiting the period of time when reynolds outdoor advertising could be placed at the site of a brand name sponsorship.the term the site in the msa subsection iii c e ii conveyed the plain meaning of one particular location,not multiple locations.further,each event in the brand name sponsorship series occurred at a particular racetrack at a distinct time.as such,no individual racetrack constituted the site of the sponsored series as a whole.thus,reasonably read,the phrase initial sponsored event as used in the msa subsection iii c e ii referred to the first event at each particular racetrack where a portion of the brand name sponsorship series took place in limiting reynolds placement of advertising at each respective racetrack to a period beginning days before the initial sponsored event at that racetrack and ending days after the last sponsored event at that racetrack.further,when the two disputed msa subsections are reasonably read in context,there is no conflict between the two meanings of the phrase initial sponsored event.manifestly,on the one occasion that the first event at a particular site is also the first event in the brand name sponsorship series as a whole,the phrase initial sponsored event reasonably conveys both meanings with respect to that one event.
in interpreting the meaning of the phrase initial sponsored event used in the msa subsection iii c e ii as,we reject reynolds contention that the phrase at the site of a brand name sponsorship used in that subsection referred only to the location where the outdoor advertising could be placed and had no effect on the subsection assertedly independent temporal requirement.more particularly,citing the language of the msa subsection iii c d,reynolds contends that if the msa drafters had intended to make the temporal restriction in the msa subsection iii c e ii,they could have done so however,the msa subsection iii c d ii parenthetical phrase during such event is itself open to interpretation.although reynolds characterizes the temporal restriction of the msa subsection iii c d ii as limited to the duration of a single event,nothing in such subsection or elsewhere in the msa defined the term event.thus,to the extent reynolds contends the word event in the msa subsection iii c e ii referred to the brand name sponsorship series itself,the word event in subsection iii c d ii could also refer to the brand name sponsorship itself.however,since the term brand name sponsorship as defined by the msa subsection ii j was not solely in the singular,brand name sponsorship did not necessarily mean only one event but instead,as reynolds acknowledges,expressly included one or more events within a single national or series or tour.hence,if the msa subsection iii c e ii had been meant to convey the interpretation proffered by reynolds,the drafters would have used the term brand name sponsorship in that subsection in place of the phrases initial sponsored event and last sponsored event.
interpretation of the phrase initial sponsored event in the msa subsection iii c e ii as is consistent with a reasonable and commonsense application of the rules of contract interpretation congruent with the parties apparent intent.renee,supra,cal th at,d.considered in context,the temporal restriction set forth in the msa subsection iii c e ii was meant to permit reynolds to place outdoor advertising signs to alert race fans to brand name sponsorship series events that were scheduled or ongoing at various individual race tracks at various times as well as to afford reynolds a reasonable period of time to remove those signs.thus,by allowing reynolds to give race fans ample notice of its sponsorship of an event at a particular race track and to remove the signs after the last event at such race track,the people proffered interpretation of the msa subsection iii c e ii gave effect to each provision of that subsection in the context of the msa as a whole.palmer,supra,cal th at,d,national city,supra,th at,d.in sum,since when reasonably interpreted the phrase initial sponsored event as used in the two disputed msa provisions had different meanings,reynolds reliance on the same meaning rule is unavailing.palmer,at,d.
last antecedent rule 
also unavailing is reynolds reliance on the last antecedent rule,a rule of statutory and contractual interpretation requiring that prepositional phrases be read to modify the preceding term or phrase.renee,supra,cal th at,d,a longstanding rule of statutory last antecedent rule provides that qualifying words,phrases and clauses are to be applied to the words or phrases immediately preceding and are not to be construed as extending to or including others more remote,citing white county of sacramento cal d,white city of victorville county of san bernardino d.state farm mut.auto.ins.eastman d.anderson state farm mut.auto.ins.d.anderson a limiting clause is to be confined to the last antecedent,unless the context or evident meaning requires a different construction.
reynolds characterizes the people interpretation of the msa subsection iii c e ii as hinging on interpreting the subsection phrase at the site as modifying its assertedly remote phrases initial sponsored event and last sponsored event,an interpretation deemed by reynolds to violate the last antecedent rule.asserting the phrase at the site appeared only once in the msa subsection iii c e ii as the locational object of the clause it is placed,reynolds contends the phrase at the site does not even arguably modify the phrase initial sponsored event.reynolds thus concludes that application of the last antecedent rule here would compel the interpretation that the phrase at the site in the msa subsection iii c e ii modified the immediately preceding term placed and simply limited where signs could be placed without any bearing on the subsequent phrase initial sponsored event that limited when signs could be posted.
however,the last antecedent rule is not immutable and should not be rigidly applied in all cases.in re phelps th,d phelps.one exception to the last antecedent rule provides that when several words are followed by a clause that applies as much to the first and other words as to the last,the natural construction of the language demands that the clause be read as applicable to all.renee,supra,cal th at,d,white,supra,cal d at,phelps,at,d board of trustees judge d.board of trustees.further,the rule of the last antecedent is merely an aid to construction,applicable only where there exist uncertainties and ambiguities.citations.this merely means,however,that if the clear intent of the parties is opposed to the application of the rule,the rule must yield.anderson,supra,d at.
the exemplar application of the last antecedent rule is a case where a modifying phrase appears after a list of multiple items or phrases.see,white,supra,cal d at.this is not the classic case for application of the last antecedent rule since the msa subsection iii c e ii did not consist of a list of multiple words followed by a modifier.instead,the msa subsection iii c e ii simply stated that nothing in the provisions of the msa subsection iii d involving outdoor advertising would apply to outdoor advertising advertising the brand name sponsorship,to the extent that such outdoor advertising is placed at the site of a brand name sponsorship no more than days before the start of the initial sponsored event,is removed within days after the end of the last sponsored event,and is not prohibited by subsection a above.
further,the language of the msa subsection iii c e ii manifestly came within the exception to the last antecedent rule identified in renee,supra,cal th at page,d,white,supra,cal d at pages,phelps,supra,th at page,d and board of trustees,supra,d at page.specifically,with respect to the central clause in subsection iii c e ii that exempted reynolds outdoor signage to the extent that such outdoor advertising is placed at the site of a brand name sponsorship no more than days before the start of the initial sponsored event,the words at the site of a brand name sponsorship were followed immediately by the temporal restrictions relating to the start of the initial sponsored event without interruption by a comma and later by the temporal restrictions relating to the end of such event.white,at,phelps,at,d.thus,the natural construction of the central clause language compelled that its phrase at the site be read as applying to the subsection temporal restrictions as well as to the restriction on where reynolds outdoor advertising could be permissibly placed
