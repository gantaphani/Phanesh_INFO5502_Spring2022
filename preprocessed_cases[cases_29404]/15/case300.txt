on march,cohen malad,llp,an indiana limited partnership,sued resource bankshares corporation and resource bank resource in indiana state court on behalf of a class of recipients of resource faxes.the lawsuit was based on the private right of action provided by the telephone consumer protection act,tcpa.during the times relevant to the lawsuit,resource had a series of materially identical general commercial liability insurance policies with paul mercury insurance company.resource sought a declaration in the united states district court for the eastern district of virginia that the suit triggered coverage under two separate provisions of the policies.on for summary judgment,the district court found that one of the two provisions mandated a duty to defend.we hold that the policies do not compel paul to defend resource for the suit,and thus affirm in part and reverse in part the decision of the district court.
the tcpa prohibits,among other things like the use of certain automated telephone equipment for telemarketing,the use of any telephone facsimile machine,computer,or other device to send an unsolicited advertisement to a telephone facsimile machine.id.b c.section b creates a private right of action so recipients of such faxes can sue the senders.it provides that 
a person or entity may,if otherwise permitted by the laws or rules of court of a state,bring in an appropriate court of that 
a an action based on a violation of this subsection or the regulations prescribed under this subsection to enjoin such violation,
b an action to recover for actual monetary loss from such a violation,or to receive in damages for each such violation,whichever is greater,or 
c both such actions.
if the court finds that the defendant willfully or knowingly violated this subsection or the regulations prescribed under this subsection,the court may,in its discretion,increase the amount of the award to an amount equal to not more than times the amount available under subparagraph b of this paragraph.
the indiana complaint alleged that resource violated the tcpa by engaging in the mass transmission of unsolicited fax advertisements over a period of four years to an unknown class of recipients,numbering at least.consistent with the straightforward and nature of the tcpa,beyond simply noting that the faxes were advertisements,the complaint never claimed that the faxes content injured anyone by,for example,claiming that the fax libeled them,divulged a trade secret,or infringed on a trademark.rather,the complaint indicated that the mere receipt of the ads was harmful 
the insurance policies at issue,written in admirably plain english,contain two relevant provisions one describing the coverage for property damage caused by an event and one for damages resulting from an advertising injury offense.the provision states that paul will pay amounts any protected person is legally required to pay as damages for covered bodily injury or property damage,and explains that 
property damage means 
physical damage to tangible property of others,including all resulting loss of use of that property or 
loss of use of tangible property of others that is physically damaged.
to trigger coverage under this provision,any property damage must flow from an event,which the policies define as an accident,including continuous or repeated exposure to substantially the same general harmful conditions.emphasis added.
as for the advertising injury provision,the policies state that 
we pay amounts any protected person is legally required to pay as damages for covered advertising injury that 
results from the advertising of your products,work,or completed work and 
is caused by an advertising injury offense committed while this agreement is in effect.
the limitation to advertising injury offense means that coverage extends only to damages arising from the following offenses 
libel or slander.
making known to any person or organization written or spoken material that disparages the products,work,or completed work of others.
making known to any person or organization written or spoken material that violates a person right of privacy.
unauthorized use of any advertising idea,material,slogan,style,or title of others in your advertising.
emphasis added.the offense making known to any person or organization written or spoken material that violates a person right of privacy is chiefly at issue here.
resource notified paul of the suit and claimed coverage,which,on june,paul denied.on august,a district court in north carolina issued an opinion styled prime tv,llc travelers ins,d.prime tv held that,under north carolina law,both the property damage and advertising injury sections of the insurance policy in that case mandated coverage for a suit alleging a tcpa violation.in june of the next year resource told paul of the prime tv case and argued that the policy was materially identical to paul.paul again denied that the policies entitled resource to coverage.then,on november,resource brought this declaratory judgment action.resource seeks a declaration that paul must defend,indemnify,and reimburse resource for all costs associated with the litigation.
the parties filed for summary judgment.recognizing that courts of several other jurisdictions had already held for insureds seeking coverage for defense of tcpa suits under generally similar policies the district court held that the property damage provision was inapplicable because resource conduct was not an accident,but found that the advertising injury offense provision applied because the faxes violated the recipient right to privacy.both parties appeal the judgments unfavorable to them.

a federal court hearing a diversity claim must apply the rules of the state in which it sits.klaxon stentor.am.online,paul mercury ins,cir.this appeal arises from a complaint filed in the eastern district of virginia,so we look to virginia rules.under virginia law,a contract is made when the last act to complete it is performed,and in the context of an insurance policy,the last act is the delivery of the policy to the insured.seabulk offshore,at buchanan doe,generally,the law of the place where an insurance contract is written and delivered controls issues as to its coverage.since the policies were delivered to resource in virginia,the parties correctly agree that virginia law governs.
under virginia law,an insurer obligation to defend an action depends on comparison of the policy language with the underlying complaint to determine whether the claims alleged in the complaint are covered by the policy.am.online,at quoting superformance int l,hartford cas.ins,cir see erie ins.exch.state farm mut.auto.ins.cir.cir.courts apply the eight corners rule,comparing the four corners of the policy with the four corners of the complaint.a policyholder bears the burden of proving that the policyholder conduct is covered by the policy.see furrow state farm mut.auto.ins,citing.cas.cole.yet this burden is not especially onerous since the insurer must defend unless it clearly appears from the initial pleading the insurer would not be liable under the policy contract for any judgment based upon the allegations.reisen aetna life and cas,citing travelers indem.obenshain.the duty to defend is broader than the duty to indemnify because it arises whenever the complaint alleges facts and circumstances,some of which,if proved,would fall within the risk covered by the policy.brenner lawyers title ins,reisen,at.however,if it appears clearly that the insurer would not be liable under its contract for any judgment based upon the allegations,it has no duty even to defend.brenner at quoting obenshain,at.
in virginia an insurance policy is a contract to be construed in accordance with the principles applicable to all contracts.seabulk offshore,at citing graphic arts mut.ins.warthen.as with other contracts,when interpreting a policy courts must not strain to find ambiguities,see,salzi virginia farm bureau mut.ins,a s in the case of any other contract,the words used are given their ordinary and customary meaning when they are susceptible of such construction.quoting graphic arts,at,or examine certain specific words or provisions in a vacuum,apart from the policy as a whole.see,tm delmarva power,ncp of,first am.title ins.seaboard sav.loan ass n.a policy provision is ambiguous when,in context,it is capable of more than one reasonable meaning.see caldwell transp.ins,citing paul ins.nusbaum.
because insurance companies typically draft their policies without the input of the insured,the companies bear the burden of making their contracts clear.accordingly,if an ambiguity exists,it must be construed against the insurer.see,craig dye,caldwell,at ocean accident guar.washington brick terra cotta,it is a well recognized rule that insurance policies,in case of doubt,should be construed most strongly against the insurer.but this does not authorize the court to make a new contract for the parties,nor to adopt a construction not justified by the language or intent of the parties.
for the following reasons,we hold that neither the property damage nor the advertising injury provision covers the lawsuit.paul thus owes resource no duty to defend the suit.
as the policy language quoted above makes plain,resource is entitled to coverage for property damage liability only for actions that are reasonably termed an accident.what can be called an accident has,at times,been a puzzling question yet often,as here,the answer is clear enough.
to decide whether something is an accident under an insurance policy,virginia courts ask whether an event was a natural and probable consequence of the insured intended actions.under this formulation,an accident is an event which creates an effect which is not the natural or probable consequence of the means employed and is not intended,designed,or reasonably anticipated.lynchburg foundry irvin,see also citizens home ins,nelson,same.stated otherwise,the question is whether the incident or injury was a reasonably foreseeable result of the insured actions.see,patch metro.life ins,cir noting that the crucial inquiry in the natural or probable consequence test is the forseeability of consequences and not intent of the insured utica mut.ins.travelers indem,accident is an incident unexpected from the viewpoint of the insured intentional actions are not accidents smith combined ins.of,insured who resisted arrest,wounded a police officer,and took refuge in a building that was set on fire by police tear gas bombs was not entitled to benefits from policy because his death was a reasonably foreseeable consequence of his actions ocean accident guarantee glover,adopting a dictionary definition of accident baker.employment comm n,wl.cir.an accident is a befalling an event that takes place without one foresight or expectation an undesigned,sudden,and unexpected event a mishap resulting in injury to a person or thing.citing derby swift.
resource does not deny that it intentionally sent advertisements by fax.rather,as we understand it,resource submits the possibility that it only intended to fax ads to recipients who actually wanted them,and only did otherwise inadvertently.in other words,resource suggests that it could not foresee that the faxes were unsolicited.in support of the claim that a tcpa violation could be an accident,resource cites park university enterprises,american casualty of reading,d.resource also cites several cases from other contexts although none from the virginia supreme court which could all be called mistaken identity means accidental action.these cases basically hold that various actions which are not necessarily injurious when consent exists can be an accident under insurance law when they are mistakenly performed on an un consenting party.see,york indus.mut.liab,under north carolina law,insured who intentionally cut down a neighbor trees in the mistaken belief that they were on the insured property was covered by accident insurance erie ins.exchange sipos.cir.cir.insured who disposed of property from an apartment under the mistaken belief that it was unwanted debris when it really belonged to a new tenant was entitled to coverage because action was an accident 
resource accidental fax argument does not persuade us.the tcpa prohibits all unsolicited advertisements sent by fax.specifically,the tcpa defines the term by noting that t he term unsolicited advertisement means any material advertising the commercial availability or quality of any property,goods,or services which is transmitted to any person without that person prior express invitation or permission.a emphasis added.here lies the problem resource has offered precisely no evidence that would cause a reasonable person to mistakenly believe that they had received prior express consent to send their fax ads.
without such evidence,resource can not begin to carry its burden,see furrow,at,of establishing that its conduct potentially merits coverage,even though at this stage in the proceedings all that it needs to prove is that a reasonable jury could find as much,see anderson liberty lobby,at.there is no issue for trial unless there is sufficient evidence favoring the nonmoving party for a jury to return a verdict for that party.citations omitted.as anderson explained,a party opposing a properly supported motion for summary judgment may not rest upon the mere allegations or denials of his pleading,but must set forth specific facts showing that there is a genuine issue for trial.id.at.quoting.e emphasis added.thus,while resource disputes the forseeability of its consequences,this dispute is not a genuine one under the summary judgment standards and,unlike universal underwriters,at,the forseeability of resource conduct is not an open factual question,id.because resource plainly intended to transmit the faxes to someone,and fails to present evidence that could reasonably be mistaken as express permission to send these faxes,we can only conclude that the sending was not accidental.it is obvious to anyone familiar with a modern office that receipt is a natural or probable consequence of sending a fax,and receipt alone occasions the very property damage the tcpa was written to address depletion of the recipient time,toner,and paper,and occupation of the fax machine and phone line.in this way we fully agree with the seventh circuit opinion on this issue in american states ins,cir,which explained that 
junk faxes use up the recipient ink and paper,but senders anticipate that consequence.senders may be uncertain whether particular faxes violate b c but all senders know exactly how faxes deplete recipients consumables because every junk fax invades the recipient property interest in consumables,this normal outcome is not covered.

resource other claim is based exclusively on the third prong of the offense part of the policies making known to any person or organization written or spoken material that violates a person right to privacy.
we first note that neither the complaint nor the tcpa private right of action ever actually mentions the word privacy.see.rather,the district court held that the complaint implied an allegation of a violation we can grant to resource that the harm occasioned by unsolicited faxes involves protection of some sort of privacy.junk faxes cause some economic damage each instance may be small but is nonetheless real,and the amount becomes especially serious when aggregated and what might be called some kind of harm to privacy in the same sense that certain nuisances invade privacy.the tcpa private right of action obviously meant to remedy and prevent these twin harms,so the complaint could imply some sort of privacy concern but the word privacy carries different mea
