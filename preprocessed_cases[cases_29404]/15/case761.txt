plaintiff joseph cassara brought this civil action under the fair credit reporting act,fcra,alleging that dac services,dac,a consumer reporting agency under the fcra,has violated b by failing to adopt appropriate procedures ensuring the accuracy of the reporting of his employment history in a report furnished to prospective employers,and that dac has failed to disclose to cassara the identity of all of the recipients of that report,a violation of a a i dac answered by denying liability and pleading a counterclaim alleging that cassara claims were frivolous and filed in bad faith.
on december,the district court denied cassara motion for partial summary judgment as to liability,dismissed dac counterclaim,and granted dac motion for summary judgment.judgment was entered on january.cassara filed a notice of appeal on february.
we have jurisdiction of this appeal pursuant to.on appeal,the district court grant of summary judgment is reviewed de novo,considering the evidence and all reasonable inferences drawn therefrom in the light most favorable to the nonmoving party.cooperman david,cir.summary judgment is proper if the record shows that there is no genuine issue as to any material fact and that the moving party is entitled to a judgment as a matter of law.c.when,as in this case,the moving party does not bear the ultimate burden of persuasion at trial,it may satisfy its burden at the summary judgment stage by identifying a lack of evidence for the nonmovant on an essential element of the nonmovant claim.adler stores,cir.to avoid summary judgment,the nonmovant must establish,at a minimum,an inference of the presence of each element essential to the case.hulsey kmart,cir.
factual and regulatory background 
the federal motor carrier safety regulations 
in an effort to promote greater safety in the operation of large trucks on the nation highways,in the united states department of transportation promulgated the federal motor carrier safety regulations fmcsr establishing minimum qualifications for commercial motor vehicle drivers and requiring employers to investigate the driving record and employment history of prospective employees being hired to drive large trucks.the investigation of an applicant driving record must include inquiries to the appropriate agency of every state in which the driver held a motor vehicle operator license or permit during the preceding three years.a.the investigation of the applicant employment record for the preceding three years may consist of personal interviews,telephone interviews,letters,or any other method of obtaining information that the carrier deems appropriate,but the employer must maintain a written record as to each past employer that was contacted.c.
the regulations require that drivers applying for employment likewise must disclose detailed information,including the nature and extent of the applicant experience in the operation of motor vehicles,a list of all motor vehicle accidents in which the applicant was involved during the three years preceding the application,specifying the date and nature of each accident and any fatalities or personal injuries it caused,and a list of all violations of motor vehicle laws or ordinances of which the applicant was convicted or forfeited bond during the three years preceding the application.b.a driver applicant must detail the facts and circumstances of any denial,revocation or suspension of any license,permit,or privilege to operate a motor vehicle that has been issued to applicant,as well as furnish a list of the applicant employers during the years preceding the date the application is submitted indicating the term and reason for leaving employment.b.
as used in these regulations,accident means 
an occurrence involving a commercial motor vehicle operating on a highway in interstate or intrastate commerce which results in 
i a fatality 
ii bodily injury to a person who,as a result of the injury,immediately receives medical treatment away from the scene of the accident or 
iii one or more vehicles incurring disabling damage as a result of the accident,requiring the motor vehicles to be transported away from the scene by a tow truck or other motor vehicle.
the definition expressly excludes an occurrence involving only boarding and alighting from a stationary motor vehicle or only the loading or unloading of cargo.id.
these fmcsr requirements establish a minimum standard for the evaluation of driver qualifications.the regulations also provide that trucking companies may enforce more stringent requirements relating to safety of operation than the general requirements found in the federal motor carrier safety regulations,d,and may require driver applicants to provide information in addition to that required to be disclosed by the regulations.c.
dac and fmcsr investigations 
as often is the case,the federal regulation of one commercial activity gave birth to another new business this case,the gathering and reporting of drivers records and employment histories for a fee.dac was formed in to exploit that opportunity,first by building a database of truck driver employment histories.beginning in,dac offered employment histories,employee driving records,and other reports to its trucking industry members nationwide,augmenting its database with information reported by its participating employers.
in its own words,dac acts as a file cabinet,storing employment histories on terminated drivers for over truck lines and private carriers from across the country.participating member employers can access the dac database,which currently contains over four million records,to gather key employment history information.dac advertises that its employment history files comply with the federal regulations and are accepted by the united states department of transportation to satisfy section c of the federal motor carrier safety regulations,governing investigations of driver applicants employment history.
cassara and dac 
joseph cassara worked as a truck driver for watkins shepard trucking,wst from march to october,and then for trism specialized carriers trism from december through december.after cassara left employment with these companies,each company made reports to dac concerning cassara driving record and employment history.dac compiled this information into a report.it then furnished the report to other companies inquiring about cassara.
wst initially reported two accidents involving cassara according to wst,on june,cassara struck another truck while trying to back his equipment into a customer dock,causing in damage to the other truck.aplee.app.vol.ii,at.the wst safety department reviewed the accident and determined it to be preventable.id.on october,cassara damaged a ladder while backing at a customer place of business,an accident which wst safety department determined also to be preventable.id.at.
based on the wst information,dac report on cassara read as follows 
of accidents equipment was involved in an accident or damaged while assigned to the driver regardless of fault 
eligible for rehire no 
reason for leaving discharged or company terminated lease 
status company driver

id.at.at cassara request,trism provided him with a list of the six reported accidents in a letter dated august,
on backing out of the tractor shop at nie maryland terminal right side of tractor hit a parked trailer.posted as collision damage.
on near laural,montana,hit a deer,posted as damage.
on near cleveland,tennessee,turning around on parking lot damaging surface of parking lot.to date no claim for damage has been paid.
on,worth,texas,backing and struck a utility pole.you have indicated that an employee of the consignee was acting as a flagger for you on that occasion.a claim for is posted as damages.
on at pekin il,drove over lawn to exit parking lot and bottomed out blocking street.to date no claim for damage has been paid.
on at harrisburg,pa,pulling into parking space and rear of trailer cut trailer tire on another vehicle.to date,no claim for damage has been paid.
in february,and again in september,cassara contacted dac,first disputing the accuracy of the wst information,and later,the trism information reflected in the dac report dac contacted wst and trism to verify the disputed entries.wst verified its report on march,and trism did so on october.aplee.app.vol.i,at see id.vol.ii,at.wst amended its report on april,deleting one of the two accidents initially reported because wst did not have to pay a claim arising out of the event.id.vol.i,at.
upon further inquiry by dac based upon cassara continuing dispute of its report,wst again verified its reported information,this time by letter dated october,detailing the reported accidents as well as a litany of company policy violations and disciplinary.aplee,vol.ii,at.as to the accidents,wst advised dac that wst policy as it relates to accidents was and continues to be is to report all accidents to dac which involve third party property damage if the accident is determined to be preventable.id.at.wst also recounted several other occasions on which cassara vehicle had been damaged,including a accident resulting in damage of unknown sources to his driver side mirror of his assigned tractor.id.at.
as the district court pointed out in granting summary judgment,cassara acknowledges that each of the events reported by wst and by trism did occur.those events remain uncontroverted facts for purposes of this appeal.
cassara does not argue with history.instead,he disputes dac reporting of these events as accidents.reporting of accidents,cassara urges,should be standardized by applying the definition found in.if the definition was applied to his own driving history,then no accidents would have been reported by either wst or trism.
the district court ruling 
the district court granted summary judgment in favor of dac,concluding that cassara complaint about inconsistent reporting of accidents unsuccessfully attempts to circumvent the fact that the reports concerning his driving are,in fact,accurate,and that dac has established it followed reasonable procedures to insure maximum possible accuracy,entitling dac to summary judgment on cassara claims brought pursuant to b.order,entered january,at.the district court rejected cassara contention that dac should be applying the definition of accident,noting that public safety is best protected by the broadest possible interpretation and reporting.id.at.
the district court summary judgment ruling also,at counterclaim against cassara for costs and attorney fees pursuant to for having to defend claims brought in bad faith or for purposes of harassment.the district court ordered that dac was awarded its costs,but that e ach party is to bear its own attorney fees.id.at.dac has from that ruling.
cassara fair credit reporting act claims 
dac acknowledges that its reporting activities are governed by the fair credit reporting act,and that its employment history reports are considered to be consumer reports governed by fcra.aplee.app.vol.i,at affidavit of richard wimbish,dated october,at.section b of the fcra,b,reads whenever a consumer reporting agency prepares a consumer report it shall follow reasonable procedures to assure maximum possible accuracy of the information concerning the individual about whom the report relates.
the official federal trade commission commentary elaborates upon the language of b 
the section does not require error free consumer reports.if a consumer reporting agency accurately transcribes,stores and communicates consumer information received from a source that it reasonably believes to be reputable,and which is credible on its face,the agency does not violate this section simply by reporting an item of information that turns out to be inaccurate.however,when a consumer reporting agency learns or should reasonably be aware of errors in its reports that may indicate systematic problems by virtue of information from consumers,report users,from periodic review of its reporting system,or otherwise it must review its procedures for assuring accuracy.examples of errors that would require such review are the issuance of a consumer report pertaining entirely to a consumer other than the one on whom a report was requested,and the issuance of a consumer report containing information on two or more consumers,information that was mixed in the file in response to a request for a report on only one of those consumers.
to prevail in a private civil action under b,a plaintiff must establish that the consumer reporting agency failed to follow reasonable procedures to assure the accuracy of its reports the report in question was,in fact,inaccurate the plaintiff suffered an injury and the consumer reporting agency failure caused the plaintiff injury.see,whelan trans union credit reporting agency.
cassara urges reversal of the district court grant of summary judgment,arguing that the district court weighed and determined fact issues still in genuine dispute.cassara contends that as to accident,dac defines the term so loosely that there is absolutely no way of predicting what is or is not recorded on dac reports,that dac reported that cassara had been involved in eight accidents when he had arguably been involved in none,and that when asked,dac failed to conduct any substantial factual investigation of the factual basis for its report.aplt.br.at.cassara further contends that this court should grant judgment in his favor on the question of liability and remand the matter to the district court only on the issue of damages and attorney fees.id.at.
cassara complains that dac accepts employers reporting of accident data without taking adequate steps to ensure that the events reported as accidents are accurately and consistently characterized as such.he asserts that dac reporting system is flawed because dac allows differences in reporting standards by different companies,making a driver employed by one company look worse than a driver employed by another for no other reason than the employer s disparate reporting policies.aplt.br.at.
dac offers some guidance to its member employers as to what events should be reported as accidents,but otherwise leaves to the employers the determination whether a particular event should be characterized as an accident.cassara argues that dac passive approach to the problem of definition results in serious inconsistencies among the reporting practices of various member employers.one employer reportable accident may be another employer unreported loss.without uniformity in reporting,a driver working for one employer may have several accidents reported,while a driver working for another employer may have,even where the drivers histories are equivalent.the difference is not one of driving record it is a matter of employer reporting practices.this disparity,cassara submits,proves unfairly misleading and renders the reporting inaccurate.
to resolve this problem,cassara asserts that only those events that qualify as accidents under should be reported as accidents by dac.by limiting reporting of accidents to the definition,the reporting process gains uniformity.enforcing the definition would eliminate misleading inconsistencies among employers reporting to dac,resulting in treatment of driver histories concerning accidents.
dac responds that its reporting procedures assure maximum accuracy of the data reported to its members that its report concerning cassara was accurate that dac investigated the underlying facts in a fashion that satisfies the requirements of the fcra and that the district court erred in dismissing dac counterclaim against cassara seeking costs and attorney fees for cassara filing an fcra action in bad faith or for the purposes of harassment.aplee.br.at.
dac contends that there is a common understanding in the trucking industry of what an accident is,and that dac is justified in relying on the employers application of that common understanding in their reporting of employee driving histories.the definition,dac insists,proves too narrow,omitting many incidents in a driver history that prospective employers want to know about.applying the commonly understood meaning to the events of cassara employment history,dac insists that both wst and trism reported accurate information concerning cassara accidents,that the information is reflected accurately in dac report,and that if the report is accurate,then the procedures utilized by the consumer reporting agency to create the report become irrelevant,and the court inquiry need go no further.aplee.br.at.
dac report on cassara was it accurate 
accepting dac suggestion that the initial focus of this court inquiry is the accuracy of the report after dac investigated cassara dispute,aplee.br.at,we start from the uncontroverted premise that the events referred to in the verified wst and trism reports did in fact occur.the events as events are not in dispute.
the dispute concerns the manner in which these events have been each event has been placed in the proper category accident or other.to speak in a meaningful way about whether the placement of events in a specific category is accurate,we must first apprehend the criteria that define the content and limits of the category 
what is an accident 
dac approach to the reporting of driver accident data has been evolving in recent years,but at all times pertinent to this appeal,dac has consistently treated accident as a term.dac september guide to termination record form instructed employers to r ecord the total number of accidents,whether preventable or nonpreventable chargeable or nonchargeable.the number of accidents does not necessarily reflect fault on the part of the driver involved.aplee.app.vol.ii,at see also id.at deposition of kent ferguson at.
dac has since developed a more detailed reporting option,one made available to members beginning in april of.aplee.app.at.in the more detailed version,dac accidents category is divided into two more categories dot recordable accidents and.a dot recordable accident is an accident within the meaning of kind of accident that the federal regulations require to be listed in the employer own records,and that cassara agrees should be reported.a is an event that falls outside the definition,but nevertheless is still thought of as an accident or an incident.aplee.app.vol.ii,at.
by,dac had modified its driver employment history reporting format to read 
the equipment was involved in an accident or damaged while assigned to the driver regardless of fault during the period of employment referenced above 
no additional information available 
id.at.this statement indicates that while employed by trism,cassara was involved in six reported accidents,however defined,or incidents involving damage to his equipment.but to say that the equipment was involved in an accident does not describe or explain what an accident is,or how to tell whether someone has had one.
apart from the more recent reference to dot recordable accidents,and some generalized guidance as to the immateriality of fault,dac has left the meaning of accident to be defined by its reporting employers 
i do know that we normally get involved with discussing what a particular company description of what an accident is.we allow them a means to certainly give this information out they are the ones determining 
q.what an accident is 
what an accident is,what goes in that particular section of the form.
vol.ii,at deposition of kent ferguson at.
words,meanings,categories,criteria 
common use of a common word invokes implicit criteria.absent common agreement,however,no implicit criteria come into play,and if the word is to have useful if the category is to have a meaningful explicit criteria must be supplied to define the word,and to limit the category.without common,criteria defining the scope of the category,accident may mean something different to each reporting employer.
absent a common understanding or explicitly stated criteria,the reporting of numerical data grouped into the accident category necessarily would lack the precision needed to assure consistency.richard wimbish,dac president,acknowledges this for the dac report to be effective,it is best to have uniform terms in order to compare apples to apples.aplee.app.vol.i,at affidavit of richard wimbish at.without consistency,the accuracy of the reporting is cast into doubt.
dac recognized this problem in,when it considered language to be added to its guide indicating that accident included preventable or nonpreventable chargeable or nonchargeable accidents without regard to fault 
s ome companies were only putting chargeable accidents,some only preventable,some everything that occurred.so we were getting very wide variance of what was included in that particular category.so the definition was being expanded to try and cover all that was being reported there,which was difficult.
at deposition of kent ferguson at.dac revisited the problem in when it incorporated incidents into the category of reportable accidents in order to address the lack of agreement with many drivers as to what an accident is.as explained by dac president 
w e have added the word incident along with the word accident and our report now states the number of.our definition of accident to our customer has not changed the word incident was added because we have learned over the years that some drivers like to refer to minor accidents as incidents and that,to them,accidents were occurrences of a more serious nature.further,there is no clear line or distinction between what is an incident or an accident and i believe that line normally depended upon the opinion of the driver in question with his attempt to limit what was an accident.because of this mind set among many drivers,our consumer department received many driver disputes relating to the listing of accidents in their employment history reports.this created substantial work for that department we decided that the drivers might better understand that the report covered all accidents whether minor or major if we added incident to the term accident.we did this and it seems to have lessened the number of disputes in this area and the workload of our consumer department.
vol i,at affidavit of richard wimbish,dated october,at.thus,the inclusion of incident in the reporting of accidents used a term on the face of the report that was familiar to drivers and better communicated what was being reported by the employers,a broader usage of the term accident than many drivers had previously understood id.
even with these efforts by dac to clarify,member employers still rely largely upon their own criteria for reporting accidents,incidents,and other events worthy of note,and these criteria vary.cassara asserts that wst reports accidents that involve third party property damage that is determined to be preventable.wst itself avers that o ur company chooses to report accidents that we deem to be preventable,or where the driver was at fault.aplee.app.vol.i,at affidavit of tom walter at.cassara asserts that trism,on the other hand,believes in reporting and considering all accidents,big and small,regardless of fault.reply br.at.
cassara argues that this kind of variation is widespread.dac responds that among its members,the meaning of accident is commonly understood.as one dac representative explained,accident is a very general term.most people know what an accident is aplee.app.vol.ii,at deposition of kent ferguson at.
in order for words to function in communication,they must mean something.robert harris james jarrett,language and informal logic emphasis in original.if the meaning of accident is commonly understood,as dac suggests,then what is that commonly understood meaning 
dictionary definitions offer some guidance.webster says an accident is a happening that is not expected,foreseen,or intended,or an unpleasant and unintended happening,sometimes resulting from negligence,that results in injury,loss damage,webster new world college dictionary ed see also webster ii new riverside university dictionary an unexpected and undesirable event.black law dictionary defines accident as an unintended and unforeseen injurious occurrence.black law dictionary ed.according to one insurance law treatise,where in the act which precedes an injury,something unforeseen or unusual occurs which produces the injury,the injury results through accident.john appleman jean appleman,insurance law and practice,at.
dac president suggests that t he term accident is used in its ordinary sense in the motor carrier and insurance industries,an unexpected occurrence.aplee.app.vol i,at affidavit of richard wimbish,dated october,at.another affiant avers that an accident as used in the motor carrier industry is merely an unanticipated event as defined by the national safety council.aplee.app.vol.i,at affidavit of david kuehl,dated september,at.
in fact,the national safety council has formulated an american national standard manual on classification of motor vehicle traffic accidents,now in its sixth edition.see national safety council,ansi manual on classification of motor vehicle traffic accidents american national standards institute,ed hereinafter ansi.according to ansi,an accident is an unstabilized situation which includes at least one harmful event.id.at.an unstabilized situation is defined as a set of events not under human control.it originates when control is lost and terminates when control is regained or,in the absence of persons who are able to regain control,when all persons and property are at rest.id.at.a harmful event refers to an occurrence of injury or damage.id.at.ansi also refers to a collision accident,that is,a road vehicle accident other than an overturning accident in which the first harmful event is a collision of a road vehicle in transport with another road vehicle,other property or pedestrians,and a noncollision accident,meaning any road vehicle accident other than a collision accident.id.at,
to date,dac has not adopted the ansi definitions of accidents.the ansi definition nevertheless proves to be instructive an accident generally involves at least one harmful event,one occurrence of injury or damage.at least one dac witness defined accident in similar terms an unexpected event that involved damage to company equipment or someone else property or person.aplee.app.vol.ii,at deposition of alicia jeffries at.
in its brief,dac seems to argue that the occurrence of damage or injury is not essential to an accident,that an unexpected occurrence or unanticipated event would be sufficient.see aplee.br.at yet there are many unexpected occurrences or unanticipated events encountered by commercial truck drivers and other motorists on a daily and events that few would characterize as accidents.
what criteria really define the category 
dac brief asserts that dac has defined each term in its report,and that there was never a misunderstanding with the motor carriers regarding what was being reported.id.at.this assertion may overstate things a bit.
from the materials in the record now before the court,it seems clear that dac,responding to industry needs and concerns,intends accident to have a broad scope,and that dac leaves it to the employers to define that scope according to their own needs.those needs reach beyond concerns about highway safety to matters of economics and profitability.as dac president explains 
in my experience,drivers want to minimize the lesser accidents because they view these accidents differently than do the employers.our members have made it very clear to dac over the years that they want these minor accidents reported.a driver who has a record of breaking off mirrors,cracking fenders,wind guards,tearing off hinges,can be a driver.
vol.i,at affidavit of richard wimbish,dated october,at emphasis added.inclusion in dac reports of minor accidents or incidents in which equipment was damaged while assigned to the driver regardless of fault thus speaks to economic profitability and company loss well as public safety concerns.in explaining to cassara counsel why dac reporting of accidents is broader than the definition,counsel for dac wrote 
let me give you a couple of examples of why the dac definition is broader that the dot definition.driver a may continually break off mirrors,hinges,doors,wind guards,on the equipment entrusted to him.as a result,driver a is not a profitable driver.his carelessness takes the profit out of the load.none of these incidents would fall under the dot definition of accident.the dot does not care how profitable a particular load is,but the employer does.driver b has accidents of backing into fixed objects,docks,buildings,light poles,cars,trucks.no one was killed or injured,nor did serious property damage occur,but this is obviously a driver who does not pay sufficient attention and he would have killed someone except by the grace of god there was no one in the way.when selecting a driver,a company would prefer,if it has a choice,to pick a driver with the best driving record.the quality of drivers is not only measured by the results of their inattention 
vol.ii,at emphasis added.as discussed above,in responding to these concerns,dac has attempted to integrate incident with accident in order to encompass even minor occurrences involving damage to equipment or property,regardless of driver fault in its optional reporting forms,employers may distinguish dot recordable accidents from other accidents or incidents outside of the definition.but even these more recent efforts have stopped short of explicitly defining what dac means by the term accident.
when we do know the meaning of a word,or when we suspect we may have connected the wrong meaning with the right word,or when for us a word is ambiguous or vague,we feel the need for a definition.we may ask,what does this word mean or we may ask,what do you mean by this word in the former case,the supposition is that the word has some standard,regular,normal,correct meaning.in the latter case there seems to be implicit the recognition that a word meaning may vary with its user.
robert harris james jarrett,language and informal logic emphasis in original.
whatever the common understanding of the term accident among dac member employers may be,or whatever dac chooses accident to mean,dac remains somewhat at a loss to articulate it.the criteria defining the category of accidents reported on its forms remain largely implicit.
were cassara reported events accidents 
on their face,in and today,dac reports concerning cassara indicate that as to the accidents reflected in each report,t he equipment was involved in an accident or damaged while assigned to the driver regardless of fault during the period of employment referenced above.aplee.app.vol.ii,at.the district court read this language to mean that a dac report includes accidents a driver may have regardless of the seriousness,and that the dac report contains the objective fact that damage occurred to the equipment while it was assigned to the driver.order,entered january,at.
in this instance,however,a close look at the dac reports reveals that neither of these readings is entirely correct.
the evidence in the present record indicates that dac reports on cassara do not include all of cassara accidents while employed by wst,regardless of the seriousness.when cassara disputed the initial dac reporting in,wst removed one of two accidents it had reported three years earlier.subsequently,a wst representative indicated that cassara had as many as four accidents while driving for wst,only one of which is currently reflected in the dac report.aplee.app.vol.i,at affidavit of tom walter,dated september,at.cassara disputes whether the events were accidents at all.
the verification that dac obtained from trism reflects events which cassara argues were neither accidents nor incidents even as dac uses those terms.according to trism,on august,near cleveland,tennessee,cassara turned around on a private parking lot,apparently damaging the surface of the parking lot.cassa
