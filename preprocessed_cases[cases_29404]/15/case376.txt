this case presents an appeal from the district court order granting summary judgment in favor of sunny chevrolet.baker and zalewski argue that the district court erred when it determined that even if defendant had violated b,defendant was not liable for statutory damages.we affirm.
background 
on december,plaintiff baker signed a retail installment sales contract risc to purchase a car and took possession of the vehicle on that date.although she asked for a copy of the contract,defendant refused the request.on january,citing inability to obtain financing under the risc defendant requested that plaintiffs return to the dealership to the deal adding the latter as a buyer.at the dealership,defendant informed plaintiffs that they would each have to sign a second contract.once again,despite being asked for a copy of the signed contract,defendant refused to provide plaintiffs with a copy of either contract.plaintiffs finally received a copy of the second contract approximately three weeks later,around january.plaintiff baker never received a copy of the first contract that she signed.it is undisputed that plaintiffs were given the actual risc document for review prior to signing it and that the actual risc accurately disclosed all of the transactions credit terms.
plaintiffs filed a class action lawsuit for violations of truth in landing act tila and the underlying regulation z,alleging that defendant repeatedly failed to give the consumer a copy of the contract in connection with the purchase and finance of a motor vehicle to keep prior to consummation of the transaction.first am.class action compl.at.plaintiffs,however,do not allege any actual damages,nor do they claim that any of the disclosures that were made before they signed the risc were inaccurate.plaintiffs sued only for statutory damages under.the district court,per order dated february,denied the motion for class certification because the plaintiffs were not typical of their proposed class and because the class definition was inadequate.the district court also,per order dated march,granted defendant motion for summary judgment and dismissed plaintiffs complaint in its entirety on the basis that defendant refusal to provide the copies of the disclosures,while seemingly inappropriate,could not give rise to tila statutory damages.plaintiffs appealed both orders to this court.both sides,however,only briefed the issue of statutory damages.plaintiffs asked for reconsideration of the class certification ruling pending a reversal of the statutory damages ruling.

congress enacted tila in with the broad purpose of promoting the informed use of credit by assuring meaningful disclosure of credit terms to consumers.see generally,a ford motor credit milhollin,d begala ohio ass n,cir.this court has held that the statute must be considered liberally in the consumer favor.jones transohio sav.ass n,cir.the sections of tila principally involved here are a and b which required creditors to make specific disclosures,and a which provides consumers with a cause of action for certain violations of the act.also of relevance on this appeal is regulation z,et,a regulation promulgated by the federal reserve board to implement tila.regulation z prescribes the form in which a creditor must disclose the items pursuant to 
the district court assumed,without so holding,that defendant violated b it then held that statutory damages were not available for this violation.baker sunny chevrolet,slip op.at.march.the district court further held that failure to provide plaintiffs with a copy of their contracts at signing did not entitle plaintiffs to statutory damages for violations of a a,a 
plaintiffs are not entitled to statutory damages for violations of b 
plaintiffs argue that defendant violated the form and timing requirements of b of tila,and the related provisions of regulation regulation z provides,in relevant part,that t he creditor shall make the disclosures required by this subpart clearly and conspicuously in writing,in a form that the consumer may keep.a.defendant first argues that this court should assume without deciding,as did the district court,that a violation of b occurred.defendant then argues that statutory damages are not recoverable for violations of b because consumers aggrieved by disclosure violations of may seek statutory damages only in those case involving violations of a some.
as noted above,the district court assumed for the purposes of the summary judgment motion that a violation of b took place.plaintiffs urge us to go beyond the district court opinion and find that a violation did actually occur.this court will typically refrain from considering issues not passed upon by the lower courts.see,blue cross blue shield mut.of ohio blue cross and blue shield ass n,cir.this restraint,however,is simply a matter of discretion,as the courts of appeals remain free to resolve such issues if the proper resolution is beyond doubt or where injustice might otherwise result.id.citing singleton wulff,d.defendant relies on the district court discussion in its opinion denying class certification to argue that proper resolution is not beyond doubt.baker sunny chevrolet,slip op.at,because the facts have not been fully developed,the court can not determine whether a violation has occurred.plaintiffs do not address this argument in the appellate brief.we decline to resolve the factual question of whether a violation occurred and instead assume,as did the district court,that a violation did occur.
the district court,relying heavily on a seventh circuit decision,found that statutory damages are not available for a violation of b.the seventh circuit found that 
statutory damages are available,this final sentence says,only for failing to comply with the requirements of section of this title or of paragraph insofar as it requires a disclosure of the amount financed,or of section a of this title,or for other situations not presented by these cases.only,the word we have italicized is conclusive against plaintiffs,for it confines statutory damages to a closed list.failure to emphasize the typeface of finance charge and annual percentage rate violates a omission of descriptive explanations violates a appearance of extra matter in the federal box violates b.none of these subsections is on the list of violations eligible for statutory damages.
baker sunny chevrolet,slip op.at quoting brown,cir.the district court also noted that a number of district courts outside the seventh circuit have followed the brown decision.id.at.
plaintiffs,relying almost exclusively on lozada dale baker oldsmobile,d,argue that the seventh circuit and the district court misread a to reach their respective holdings.the lozada opinion makes a very intricate argument that the a discussion of statutory damages simply does not apply at all to b claims.in other words,the limitation on the availability of statutory damages in violations applies only to disclosures in section and b is not a disclosure but is merely a form and timing of disclosure requirement.lozada,d at noting that s uch a reading is consistent with the other types of violations described by the enumeration.see also daenzer wayland ford,d,discussing both brown and lozada and adopting the reading in lozada.but see kilbourn candy,discussing both brown and lozada and adopting the reading in brown.according to this position,b is not mentioned in the discussion of limitation on damages and thus a full array of damages is available for its violation.the problem with this interpretation,however,is that,standing alone,the form and timing requirement has no substance,it only makes sense if it is combined with substantive disclosures of a.for example,a applies to disclosures referred to in subsections a and b of section.each subsection of contains its own timing requirement it would therefore seem that untimely disclosure of items in a and b would be subject to a statutory damages.a.we therefore reject this reading of the statute.
plaintiffs,relying once again on lozada,make a following second argument in the alternative 
however,if a failure to deliver disclosures under b is considered a disclosure referred to in section within the meaning,then the failure to deliver disclosures in the manner provided by b must be considered failure to disclose the required terms under a.the requirements of b may not be considered disclosures for purposes of and yet not part of the disclosure requirements of a.moreover,no basis exists for considering a disclosure made if it is not made in accordance with the requirements of b.since b expressly provides the form and time in which disclosures under a must be made,a disclosures may not be said to be made unless and until they are made in compliance with b.section b,by saying when and how a disclosure is made,becomes part of the definition of what constitutes a disclosure under tila.
lozada,d at.
defendant,relying on brown,argues that such a reading of tila creates a back door theory that the alleged failure to make timely written disclosures is not a disclosure at all.defendant reliance on brown,however is misplaced.in brown,the defendant provided the plaintiff with a timely written disclosure.the problem in brown was that there were two minor errors in the actual disclosure which resulted in violations of a and a,neither of which is an enumerated violation contained in a.brown,at.the brown court then rejected a back door theory that information has been disclosed in compliance with only if all of the tila and all of regulation z have been followed.id.at.the brown court went on to explain that 
accepting this argument would destroy the point of a.what sense would it make to omit,a,a in part,a,a,a,a,a,and all of b,c,and d from the candidates for statutory damages if they came in through the back door on the theory that all formal shortcomings infect the disclosures of the items that are on the list.
brown,at emphasis added.on the facts before it,the brown court properly rejected the back door theory.the facts of this case are clearly distinguishable,however,since plaintiffs did not timely receive a copy of the risc.plaintiffs therefore allege that a,were violated because disclosures required under those subsections were not properly made.
defendant reliance on two other cases to argue against plaintiffs position is likewise misplaced.in collins ray skillman truck,wl,the court rejected an argument similar to the one advanced here by plaintiffs however,the collins court read brown to reject the argument that the alleged failure to make timely written disclosures was not a disclosure at all.collins,wl,at.as explained above,we believe that this is a misreading of brown.in the second case,graham rrr,llc,d.may,the court also rejected a similar argument advanced by a plaintiff who was allegedly asked to sign a blank retail installment sale contract there are several problems with relying on graham.first,there was a factual dispute about whether the plaintiff signed a blank risc.id.at.second,the court actually dismissed the entire argument as untimely raised.id.at.after dismissing the case,the court engaged in a completely unnecessary dicta about the merits of the plaintiff argument with a single reference to a and without any discussion of other courts decisions.we therefore find its holding entirely unpersuasive.
as the foregoing discussion illustrates,we are therefore left with two readings of the statute,both of which find support in the relevant caselaw and neither of which appears to be clearly correct on its face.the two arguments can best be summarized as follows.
first,b form and timing disclosures should be read to apply to each subsection of a individually a is violated whenever a disclosure is not made prior to consummation of the sale and whenever it is not made in writing in a form that a consumer may keep.it should not be read as an independent disclosure violation.this interpretation is supported by the language and structure of regulation,which is the first section under subpart credit,provides that t he creditor shall make the disclosures required by this subpart clearly and conspicuously in writing,in a form that the consumer may keep.a emphasis added.section,titled transactions other than under an open end credit plan,is a section dealing with credit transactions,such as the one in this case.a defining credit.requirements of a are explained in,which appears within the same subpart c as does the general disclosure requirements of a and b.the regulation therefore appears to demand that every credit disclosure be provided in this manner.see,polk crown auto,cir per curiam however,on balance we believe that the plain meaning of the regulation must be understood to be that written disclosure in the form specified in subpart a must be provided to the consumer at the time specified in subpart b.that is,crown auto was required to make the disclosures to polk in writing,in the form that he could keep,before consummation of the transaction.emphasis in the original.finally,b does not contain a writing in a form the consumer may keep requirement.there is,thus,no reason to conclude that the violation of is a b violation and not a a violation.
second,b is a separate requirement that relates only tangentially to the underlying substantive disclosure requirements of a.under this theory,a b violation is not one of the enumerated violations that warrant a statutory damages award.this theory thus creates two types of violations a complete of enumerated items in a,which is punishable by statutory damages and b disclosure of the enumerated items in a but not in the manner required by the regulation and b,which is not subject to the statutory damages.this theory still recognizes that the proper manner of making a disclosures is in writing,in the form that the consumer may keep.it also,however,recognizes that in a situation like the case at bar,where plaintiffs were clearly not prejudiced by the untimely delivery of the risc the failure to deliver the written disclosures in the form that the consumer may keep is actionable only if the consumer can show actual damages.
we now expressly adopt this second interpretation because it is the only way to reconcile the imposition of damages under a with the excuse of certain violations under b 
section b forecloses plaintiffs recover of any damages in this case.
the problem of resolving this complicated question of statutory construction is aided by the provisions in b.neither party briefed this issue on this appeal or before the district court.nevertheless,our independent review of the statute leads us to the conclusion that the plain meaning of b bars any recovery for plaintiffs.in re allied supermarkets,cir recognizing that although in general appellate courts do not review questions raised for the first time on appeal,it is appropriate to do so when the question is a legal one.see also washington gas light virginia power,cir if deemed necessary to reach the correct result,an appellate court may sua sponte consider points not presented to the district court and not even raised on appeal by either party.citing continental can,d.
