in a complaint filed in the united states district court for the eastern district of new york,the plaintiffs allege that certain billing practices of the defendant providers with respect to their provision of real estate settlement services to the plaintiffs were contrary to the real estate settlement procedures act,et.respa,in particular respa b codified at b.respa b provides 
no person shall give and no person shall accept any portion,split,or percentage of any charge made or received for the rendering of a real estate settlement service in connection with a transaction involving a federally related mortgage loan other than for services actually performed.
id.b.the district court leo glasser,judge,concluding that the practices in question were not prohibited by respa,granted the defendants motion for judgment on the pleadings pursuant to federal rule of civil procedure c and dismissed the complaint.
background 
according to the complaint,the plaintiffs wayne kruse,lisa mcleod,and robert schill are homeowners who obtained settlement services from the defendants while financing their purchases of homes in brooklyn,new york.the plaintiffs david and barbara legro obtained settlement services from the defendants while refinancing their home in santa rosa,california.according to the complaint,the defendants wells fargo financial services,and wells fargo home mortgage,are wholly owned subsidiaries of the defendant wells fargo company,which is in turn a wholly owned subsidiary of wfc holdings corporation 
the complaint further alleges that between february and april,each of the plaintiffs,while obtaining federally related home mortgage loans,was required by the defendants to purchase certain settlement services,see id.including tax service,flood certification,document preparation,and underwriting,compl.
the plaintiffs challenged two categories of commercial practices adopted by the defendants relating to the provision of settlement services,which the plaintiffs call overcharges and.overcharges arise out of settlement services provided by the lender itself but charged to consumers seeking home mortgages for substantially more than the provider cost.specifically,the plaintiffs allege that the defendants performed underwriting in this case consist of analyzing a borrower ability to repay the loan in order to determine whether the federal national mortgage association fannie mae or the federal home loan mortgage corporation freddie mac will guarantee to purchase the loan on the secondary market,removing most of the lender risk on the automated software obtained from fannie mae and freddie mac at a cost of per loan underwritten.the defendants are said to have charged home mortgage borrowers as much as times that amount for the service.
a settlement service provider marks up the fee for a settlement service when the provider outsources the task of providing the service to a vendor,pays the vendor a fee for the service,and then,without providing an additional service,charges homeowners seeking mortgages a higher fee for the settlement service than that which the provider paid to the vendor.in this case,the defendants are alleged to have paid third parties to perform tax services,flood certification,and document preparation,and then,without providing further services,to have charged plaintiffs amounts substantially in excess of the amount the defendants paid to the third parties for the services.for example,the plaintiffs alleged that the defendants outsourced document preparation to third parties at a typical cost to the defendants of to,and then,without performing any additional services,charged consumers seeking home mortgages to for the service.
on may,relying on a statement of policy issued by the united states department of housing and urban development hud stating that both overcharges and violate section b,see statement of policy,the policy statement,the plaintiffs filed a putative class action pursuant to federal rule of civil procedure in the united states district court for the eastern district of new york.the action was brought by and on behalf of the plaintiffs and similarly situated persons who,on or after january,received automated underwriting scores indicating that their loans would be guaranteed for purchase by fannie mae and freddie mac,and who paid fees to the defendants for any of the settlement services described above.the plaintiffs assert that the proposed class consists of thousands of residential mortgage borrowers,that common questions of law and fact predominate,and that the plaintiffs claims are typical of those of the class.the plaintiffs seek treble damages pursuant to respa d d for defendants asserted violations of section b.the plaintiffs also allege unjust enrichment on the part of the defendants,apparently as a supplemental claim under state law,and request disgorgement of funds in an amount equal to the amount by which the defendants were unjustly enriched.
on april,the defendants moved for judgment on the pleadings pursuant to federal rule of civil procedure c with respect to the plaintiffs section b claim.in a decision delivered orally from the bench on may,an order issued on may,and a judgment entered on may,the district court granted the defendants motion in its entirety,dismissing the plaintiffs section b claim with prejudice.in reaching this decision,the district court relied heavily on the interpretation of section b advanced by the three federal courts of appeals that had,at the time of the district court ruling,decided for defendants in litigation in which similar claims were alleged.see haug bank of,cir krzalic republic title,cir,cert.denied,d boulware crossland mortgage,cir.the district court agreed with the conclusion of these circuits that section b unambiguously does not apply to and overcharges,and that hud interpretation of the section to the contrary was either an impermissible one or entitled to no deference.during the pendency of this appeal,though,the eleventh circuit,in sosa chase manhattan mortgage,cir,advanced a textual interpretation of section b language at odds with that expressed in haug,krzalic,boulware,and the district court in the instant case.
having dismissed the federal respa claim,the district court declined,pursuant to c,to exercise supplemental jurisdiction over the plaintiffs claims,dismissing them without prejudice.

standard of review 
we review the judgment of the district court de novo,both because it was a judgment on the pleadings rendered pursuant to federal rule of civil procedure c,hardy city health hosps,cir,and because it involved questions of statutory construction,united states koh,cir,cert.denied,d.moreover,the question of the appropriate level of deference to accord agency regulations is one purely of law,subject to de novo review.coke long island care at home,cir.
ii.framework of the analysis 
the plaintiffs allege that they are the victims of two of the defendants and they argue violate respa b.in addressing these allegations,we begin as we must with the text of the statute.the initial question is whether or not the statute clearly and unambiguously prohibits the practices of which the plaintiffs complain.if the intent of congress is clear,that is the end of the matter for the court,as well as the agency,must give effect to the unambiguously expressed intent of congress.chevron,natural res.def.council,d accord household credit,pfennig,d quoting chevron.
if the provisions of the statute are unclear or ambiguous,then,because the policy statement addresses the questions of statutory interpretation here in issue,we must decide whether to defer to hud reading of them as reflected in the policy statement.if we decide that we are to defer,we must then decide the appropriate level of deference.compare chevron,at.calling for mandatory deference,in certain situations,to permissible agency interpretations,with skidmore swift.requiring deference,in other situations,to the extent of the interpretations persuasiveness.
if chevron deference is required,we must defer to the interpretation hud advances unless it is arbitrary,capricious,or manifestly contrary to the statute.household credit.at quoting chevron,at.accord evangelista ashcroft,cir same.so long as the agency reading fills a gap or defines a term in a reasonable way in light of the legislature design,we give that reading controlling weight,even if it is not the answer the court would have reached if the question initially had arisen in a judicial proceeding.regions hosp.shalala,d citation and internal quotation marks omitted.were we to conclude that the statute is ambiguous but decide that no deference to the agency interpretation is required,then,of course,we would resolve the ambiguity ourselves using the customary means of judicial statutory interpretation.
iii.overcharges 
the plaintiffs urge us to defer to the view taken by hud in the policy statement.hud has concluded that charging unreasonably high prices for certain settlement services,as the plaintiffs assert the defendants did with respect to services the defendants provided to them,is a violation of section b under this reading of the statute,the amount by which a fee or charge for a service exceeds the reasonable value of the service provided in return is the portion,split,or percentage of the charge that is other than for services actually performed and thus in violation of section b.
we do not think that the text of section b can bear that interpretation.section b does prohibit the giv ing and accept ing of any portion,split,or percentage of any covered charge made or received other than for services actually performed.respa b,b.but nothing in that language authorizes courts to divide a charge into what they or some other person or entity deems to be its reasonable and unreasonable components.whatever its size,such a fee is for the services rendered by the institution and received by the borrower.
it would,moreover,be an odd reading of the statute to conclude that it instructs federal courts to award treble damages,see respa d,d,for unreasonable charges made by financial institutions without giving those courts so much as a hint as to how to differentiate between what is and is not reasonable.there is nothing in the language of section b to suggest that congress meant for us to create such a regulatory regime out of whole cloth.
we conclude that section b clearly and unambiguously does not extend to overcharges.
whether it is appropriate for us to consider respa legislative history in determining at the outset whether the statute is clear and unambiguous on this point is not at all clear.see,coke,at t he supreme court has issued mixed messages as to whether a court may consider legislative history at step one of chevron analysis.id.collecting cases we note nonetheless that,as pointed out by haug bank of america,at,our conclusion is supported by the legislative history of respa.
prior to passage of respa,senator proxmire submitted a separate bill proposing that hud be empowered to establish the maximum amounts of the charges to be imposed upon the borrower and seller for services incident to or a part of a real estate settlement which shall be designed to reflect the reasonable charges for necessary services and to assure that settlement costs do not exceed such reasonable charges a bill to regulate closing costs and settlement procedures in federally related mortgage transactions,cong.a see also cong.rec.describing senator proxmire bill as direct ing hud to issue regulations to limit the amount of closing costs which can be charged in each section of the country.congress did not adopt this explicit proposal.instead,it directed hud to report to congress on whether federal regulation of the charges for real estate settlement services in federally related mortgage transactions is necessary and desirable.respa,b,stat,id.a requiring that such a report be given by hud three to five years after the date of respa passage,repealed by,h,stat.we think the failure of congress to enact senator proxmire bill,coupled with its charge to hud to produce a report on whether such legislation was advisable,provides a persuasive complement to our textually based conclusion that congress did not intend section b to serve as a mechanism.
we thus conclude that we can not,and we therefore do not,defer to this reading of section b by hud.see chevron,at.section b did not impose price controls and therefore does not prohibit overcharges.accord krzalic,at respa is not a statute.boulware,at respa was meant to address certain practices,not enact broad price controls.
we affirm the judgment of the district court as to the plaintiffs overcharges claim.
a.the language of section b 
the plaintiffs also argue that the district court erred in concluding that the defendants do not as a matter of law violate section b.the term as the plaintiffs use it in this context refers to fees that the defendants allegedly charged to the plaintiffs for settlement services provided by vendors in excess of the fees that the vendors charged to the defendants for those services,w ithout performing any additional services.compl.because hud policy statement interprets section b to prohibit,see policy statement.at,our initial inquiry is whether the text of section b is clear and unambiguous on the issue so as to foreclose our deference to the policy statement in this regard.
the fourth,seventh,and eighth circuits have held that the text of section b clearly and unambiguously does not prohibit.haug,supra krzalic,supra boulware,supra.these courts reason,inter alia,that the word and in section b phrase no person shall give and no person shall accept requires that there be both one or more persons who give and one or more persons who receive a settlement services fee other than for services actually performed for there to be a violation of the statute so that,unless there is at least one giver and one acceptor who simultaneously violate the law,there can be no violation of section b.see haug,at section b unambiguously requires at least two parties to share a settlement fee in order to violate the statute.boulware,at the use of the conjunctive and indicates that congress was clearly aiming at an exchange or transaction,not a unilateral act.these courts conclude that reading section b to apply to is therefore absurd because it renders givers of consumers ostensibly protected by the well as financial institutions from whose practices they are being guilty of violating the statute.boulware,at it would be irrational to conclude that congress intended consumers to be potentially liable under respa for paying unearned fees t he giver in b must be some party in the settlement process besides the borrower herself.krzalic,at on the plaintiffs understanding,they themselves violated the statute because they gave the defendant a portion of the fee charged by the county recorder.
in sosa chase manhattan mortgage,cir,however,the eleventh circuit found nothing absurd about a conclusion that section b covers.the and in subsection b operates to create two separate prohibitions giving a portion of a charge is prohibited regardless of whether there is a culpable acceptor,and accepting a portion of a charge is prohibited regardless of whether there is a culpable giver.id.at.the lender can thus be liable for a section b violation while the borrower is not.and if the lender pays a third party for services and,though performing no additional services itself,charges an additional amount to the borrower,it receives that additional amount other than for services actually performed,in violation of the statute.see id.at 
the words of the statute do not seem to compel either reading.the different interpretations described above derive largely from divergent,but plausible,constructions of the word and.we thus conclude,because section b is not clear and unambiguous with respect to its coverage of,that we must determine whether deference is due to hud interpretation of the statute as expressed in the policy statement.
