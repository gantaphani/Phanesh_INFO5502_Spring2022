this appeal presents us with a unique variant of the more common general question of when a settlement requires subclassing of the plaintiff class to ensure adequacy of representation pursuant to federal rules of civil procedure e and a.the district court certified the plaintiff classes,which comprise more than current and former occupants of apartments in new york city,pursuant to rules b damages and b injunctive relief.the settlement that was eventually approved by the district court provides no damages relief for claims that tenants were overcharged rent by prior landlords,rather than by defendants,or for claims for rent overcharges that predate july,together,the excluded overcharge claims.appellant objectors to the settlement contend that the lack of separate representation for tenants with excluded overcharge claims during settlement negotiations violated rule and constitutional due process,and that the district court was therefore required to establish subclasses for tenants who had such claims.because we reject that contention,and because we also conclude that the settlement was fair,reasonable,and adequate,as required by rule e,we affirm the judgment of the district court.
background 
plaintiffs allegations 
on september,plaintiffs marjorie charron,theodore charron,andres mares muro,raymond andrew stahl david,and kim powell,along with buyers and renters to save harlem,anthony casanovas,karen flannagan,tracey moore,russell taylor,and diane trummer,filed an amended complaint in the united states district court for the southern district of new york.that complaint,as amended again on october,alleged that defendants had engaged in a conspiracy to fraudulently increase rents payable by tenants in over buildings they owned in new york city,in violation of the racketeer influenced and corrupt organizations act,and the new york consumer protection act nycpa,which prohibits d eceptive acts or practices in the conduct of any business.law a.specifically,plaintiffs alleged that defendants pinnacle group llc,pinnacle group corporation,and pinnacle group,llc collectively,pinnacle and its principal,joel wiener,charged tenants higher rents than allowed by new york city rent regulations refused to acknowledge tenants succession rights,misrepresented tenants rent payment histories,filed meritless eviction suits,and otherwise harassed tenants.the complaint alleged that defendants did so in order to raise rents above legally chargeable levels and to drive tenants out of units,leading to the deregulation of those units and thus allowing defendants to sell the units or charge new tenants a higher,monthly rent.
ii.class certification 
on june,plaintiffs moved pursuant to federal rules of civil procedure b and b to certify a class of approximately former and current residents of buildings.on behalf of the class,they sought compensatory,punitive,and statutory treble damages,as well as attorney fees.they also sought injunctive relief prohibiting defendants from engaging in the conduct alleged in the complaint,appointment of an independent monitor to supervise defendants compliance,and regular audits of defendants books.plaintiffs proposed class was defined in the second amended complaint as 
all persons who,at any time from july,to the date of certification,leased an apartment in the city of new york directly or indirectly owned in whole or in part by the pinnacle enterprise.this class seeks certification of claims for declaratory and injunctive relief,and for damages pursuant to d and new york general business law h.
pls.second am.compl.emphasis added.
on april,the district court certified two classes an class comprising all current residents of apartments owned by pinnacle,and a damages class comprising all persons who,at any time between july,and the date of this opinion april,were tenants in apartments in new york city directly or indirectly owned in whole or in part by pinnacle.charron pinnacle group llc.the district court found that the proposed injunctive relief class satisfied rule a four requirements numerosity,commonality,representativeness,and adequacy of representation as well as rule b requirement that injunctive relief be appropriate to the class as a whole.the district court found that while the proposed damages class satisfied rule a requirements,it did not satisfy rule b requirement that questions of law or fact common to the members of the class predominate,given the members individualized issues relating to injury and causation however,even though the action as a whole failed to satisfy rule b predominance requirement,the district court nonetheless certified a class that was limited to certain common liability issues that did satisfy rule b predominance and superiority requirements.see.c a n action may be brought or maintained as a class action with respect to particular issues.
iii.the settlement 
after class certification but before any discovery on the merits of the claims had taken place,the parties engaged in extensive settlement negotiations under the supervision of a magistrate judge ronald ellis,magistrate judge.the parties were represented by prominent law firms the class by jenner block,and pinnacle by gibson,dunn crutcher.class counsel were assisted by andrew scherer,an expert in new york law and rent regulation statutes,and the author of the treatise residential landlord tenant law in new york.see charron pinnacle group n.llc,d.
negotiations began in the fall of and a preliminary formal settlement agreement was reached on august.on august,the magistrate judge approved the settlement.under the settlement,pinnacle agreed to maintain best practices,enforced by a claims administrator,with respect to setting initial rents for new tenants and rent increases for existing tenants eviction proceedings against tenants repairs and tenant services and staff training.pinnacle was also required to undergo an audit of a random sample of its leases issued from to and,depending on the outcome of that audit,potentially to submit to a more extensive audit of all its leases from that period.
pinnacle also agreed to institute a claims process to pay damages for past rent overcharges as well as for harassment claims.under this system,to be administered by a court appointee,tenants alleging rent overcharge claims may recover their actual damages or,if they can prove willfulness on the part of pinnacle,double damages.for harassment claims,tenants may recover the greater of a penalty ranging from to or their actual damages.the process is informal tenants may prove their claims through a simple form and are not required to adhere to traditional rules of evidence.pinnacle further agreed to pay a total of million to certain community legal services organizations and other nonprofit groups,to enable them to provide assistance to tenants wishing to participate in the claims process.
finally,pinnacle agreed to pay class counsel million in attorney fees and another in expenses.
importantly for purposes of this appeal,the settlement excluded certain types of claims.in particular,two subgroups of claims otherwise included by the class definition were excluded from the settlement.first,the settlement provided damages relief only for rents set by pinnacle after july,second,the settlement specified that,under the claims administration process,it would be a defense to any allegation of overcharge that pinnacle relied on a rent registered by a prior owner with the new york state division of housing and community renewal or contained in documentation from a prior owner of the tenant building.app x at.
following an extended notice period with substantial outreach to class members,only about of the class members opted out or objected to the settlement.of the more than class members,only objected,and opted out submitted unsolicited letters in support of the settlement.id.at.
after conducting a fairness hearing,the district court issued a page opinion approving the settlement.id.it found that notice of the proposed settlement was adequate,that the settlement was fair,adequate,and reasonable pursuant to rule e,and that there were no conflicts.
discussion 
appellants,the initial class representatives as well as three other class members who objected to the settlement,now challenge both the fairness,adequacy,and reasonableness of the settlement and the adequacy of the class members representation.
standard of review 
a district court approval of a class action settlement is reviewed for exceeding its discretion.mcreynolds richards cantave,cir.a district court abuses its discretion when its decision rests on an error of law or a clearly erroneous factual finding,or when its decision can not be located within the range of permissible decisions.in re literary works in databases copyright,cir.in class settlement cases,we accord the trial judge views great weight because of her position on the firing line,where she is exposed to the litigants,and their strategies,positions and proofs,joel giuliani,cir internal quotation marks omitted,and we will disturb a settlement only when an objector has made a clear showing that the district court has abused its discretion,deutsche bank,cir internal quotation marks omitted.we review factual findings relating to the settlement for clear error and issues of law de novo.mcreynolds,at.
ii.analysis 
fairness of the settlement 
federal rule of civil procedure e provides that a court may approve a class action settlement only if it is fair,reasonable,and adequate.e.the court must review the negotiating process leading up to the settlement for procedural fairness,to ensure that the settlement resulted from an arm length,good faith negotiation between experienced and skilled litigators.see mcreynolds,at,at.
the court must also evaluate substantive fairness,considering the nine grinnell factors set forth in detroit grinnell 
the complexity,expense and likely duration of the litigation the reaction of the class to the settlement the stage of the proceedings and the amount of discovery completed the risks of establishing liability the risks of establishing damages the risks of maintaining the class action through the trial the ability of the defendants to withstand a greater judgment the range of reasonableness of the settlement fund in light of the best possible recovery and the range of reasonableness of the settlement fund to a possible recovery in light of all the attendant risks of litigation.

the district court carefully analyzed each factor in its thorough opinion,finding that o n balance,the grinnell factors weigh ed heavily in favor of final approval of the settlement agreement.charron,d at.it found that eight of the nine factors weighed in favor of approval,while the ninth defendants ability to withstand a greater judgment was neutral.id.at.we can not say that the district court conclusion constituted an abuse of discretion,especially given the deference we accord to trial courts in these situations.see joel,at.the district court reasoning is set out in detail in its opinion,and only a few of the factors require further discussion on appeal 
the need for further discovery 
appellants argue that concluding the settlement before merits discovery infected the analysis of virtually every other grinnell factor to their detriment.we conclude,however,that the discovery conducted was sufficient to permit the district court to evaluate the claims and settlement.objectors to a settlement have no automatic right to discovery or an evidentiary hearing in order to substantiate their objections.see,malchman davis,cir,abrogated on other grounds by amchem,windsor,d.instead,where objectors raise cogent factual objections to the settlement,id.at internal quotation marks omitted,and prior discovery was insufficient or nonadversarial,we instruct district courts to exercise particular care to see to it that the plaintiff or,by logical extension,objecting class member has had a full opportunity to develop the basis for his objection.saylor lindsley,cir maywalt parker parsley petroleum,cir the ultimate responsibility to ensure that the interests of class members are not subordinated to the interests of either the class representatives or class counsel rests with the district court.
here,the district court treated the objections seriously,delaying the fairness hearing many months,requiring revised notice and a building sampling,and ordering the parties to answer detailed questions about the effects of the settlement on various hypothetical class members actions that imposed significant cost and burden on pinnacle and on class counsel.while the district court denied the objectors request for lease and rent registration histories for each of the buildings in the sampling,it did so because the objectors could not articulate why they needed the information to substantiate their objections.ultimately,the preliminary discovery did not bear out the opponents objections.on this record,we can not find that the district court exceeded its discretion by declining to order further discovery and approving the settlement based on the information before it.
the risks of maintaining a class action 
appellants argue that the district court heavily relied on the specter of decertification if the case were to proceed without explaining why the supreme court decision in wal mart stores,dukes,d,posed a significant risk of decertification in this specific case.the district court concluded,after examining the facts of this case and recent jurisprudence interpreting dukes,that there was a substantial chance that a motion to decertify the class would succeed were the settlement to be rejected,and that this possibility weighed strongly in favor of approval.
it is unnecessary,and would be inappropriate,for us to conduct a purely hypothetical discussion of the ultimate merits of a potential decertification defendants repeated statements that they will immediately move for decertification if the settlement is rejected,the large size of the class,the complicated and diverse claims asserted by plaintiffs,and the heightened legal uncertainty necessarily injected by significant recent supreme court authority relevant to the propriety of class certification,however,we can not find that the district court abused its discretion in finding that the class faced significant risks of decertification,that decertification would drastically reduce the chances of any member of the class achieving meaningful relief,and that the litigation risks attendant to these possibilities weighed heavily in favor of the fairness of a settlement under which plaintiffs achieved substantial benefits that as in any settlement fell short of what they might have hoped to achieve 
in conclusion,the district court careful review of the settlement warrants the great deference we normally accord to trial court findings with respect to the fairness of class action settlements.the district court did not simply the settlement on the basis of boilerplate findings,but wrote a long and careful opinion after engaging in a serious process to air and examine the objections to the settlement.appellants claims that the district court balancing of the grinnell factors was inadequate boil down to the usual contention that the settlement did not get enough for the class.we find no fault in the district court rejection of that contention.
adequacy of representation 
federal rule of civil procedure a requires that in a class action,the interests of the class must be fairly and adequately protect ed.a.to ensure that all members of the class are adequately represented,district courts must make sure that the members of the class possess the same interests,and that no fundamental conflicts exist among the members.in re literary works,at see also denney deutsche bank ag,cir.adequacy of representation must be determined independently of the fairness of the settlement rule requires protections under subdivisions a and b against inequity and potential inequity at the precertification stage,quite independently of the required determination at postcertification fairness review under subdivision e that any settlement is fair in an overriding sense.ortiz fibreboard,d see also amchem,at f
