defendant rv sales,rv appeals a judgment in favor of plaintiff reta thompson on her complaint for violations of the automobile sales finance act asfa et,the consumers legal remedies act clra et,california unfair competition law ucl bus,et and other causes of action the action arose in connection with a contract between thompson and rv for the purchase and sale of a previously owned motor home.the court found rv violated various consumer protection statutes and its acts and practices constituted fraud,entitling thompson to rescission of the contract,restitution,punitive damages and a permanent injunction.on appeal,rv challenges only the validity of the injunction,which prohibits it from rolling over allowances on vehicles into the cash price of the motor homes it sells and backdating sales contracts.we affirm the judgment 
factual and procedural background 
on may,thompson signed a conditional sale contract in the form required by the asfa contract to purchase a previously owned safari motor home from rv for a cash price of.rv estimated the safari could be sold for,but based on its customary discount of to percent,a cash customer could buy it for.
thompson required financing to purchase the safari and as part of the sales transaction,agreed to trade in her shasta motor home,which was subject to a loan balance of.although rv appraised the shasta at,it credited thompson on the,creating an of.the permitted thompson to show on the face of the contract a net value of to apply toward the downpayment of the safari.rv admittedly created the to enable thompson to obtain lender approval for the purchase.the would not have been created for a cash buyer,even one with a vehicle,because a cash buyer does not require a loan to complete the purchase and would not need to qualify to finance the purchase.
thompson made a cash downpayment of.several days after signing the original contract,thompson made an additional downpayment of at rv request the second contract,backdated to may,reflected a total downpayment of the net value of the shasta plus the cash downpayment of.
rv did not disclose to thompson that it had created a on her vehicle.without thompson knowledge or consent,the was added to the price of the safari a cash purchaser would pay,to show a cash price of.the standard form contract signed by thompson contains a section entitled itemization of the amount financed,which requires inserting the cash price of the vehicle on line and any prior credit or lease balance paid by the seller on line in the contract for this transaction,rv inserted as the cash price on line and not applicable on line.see,post.
after purchasing the safari and traveling in it for several months,thompson began having problems with the motor home.thompson attempted to have repairs made under the extended warranty service contract she purchased from rv,but the service contract did not contain the required coverage because it applied to a new,not previously owned,motor home.rv refused to refund thompson money for the service contract or issue her another service contract covering her motor home.
thompson sued rv for damages,restitution and injunctive relief under the asfa,clra and ucl she alleged the value of the shasta was inflated to hide the negative equity associated with the transaction the negative equity was included in the cash price of the safari there was no disclosure the negative equity was included in the cash price and it is rv standard practice not to disclose inclusion of negative equity in the cash price on line of the contract.see,post.
the parties waived jury.at trial,matthew leffingwell,rv sales manager who prepared and signed thompson contract,testified a was included in the cash price in thompson transaction.he explained a is the difference between the vehicle value stated in the contract and the dealer valuation of the vehicle.here,the shasta value in the contract was,but rv valued the shasta to be worth.this created a of.
leffingwell testified he valued thompson vehicle at rather than for purposes of obtaining credit approval for thompson purchase.because thompson owed on the shasta,there was negative equity of.he explained lenders generally prefer a buyer not be in a negative equity position and require a certain downpayment to meet their percentage guidelines.increasing the value of the vehicle to resulted in showing thompson had an positive value to submit to the lender.leffingwell admitted negative equity is not included in the selling price for a cash buyer because the only reason for this practice,which rv continues to use,is to obtain financing for a credit buyer.he testified there is no document for the consumer to sign that acknowledges negative equity has been included in the cash price.rather,he customarily shows the buyer rv value of the vehicle during negotiations and then explains that amount is marked up and the cash price is correspondingly increased.
rv,arthur brady,testified it is standard practice for the dealership to include an in the cash price of vehicles for credit buyers,but not for cash buyers.he explained the dealer value of a vehicle is increased to eliminate negative equity and that increased amount is added to the cash price of the vehicle being purchased.raising the value of the vehicle to equal or exceed the amount owed on it allows a credit buyer to show on a credit application a higher value for the vehicle and therefore less debt.brady admitted no disclosure of this practice was made to thompson.
thompson testified that during the sales negotiations,there was no discussion that the value of her shasta was.she was never told there was a or that the amount still owing on the vehicle was being included in the cash price.
richard ross,thompson financial expert and a former compliance officer for various federal credit laws and regulations,testified about the importance of properly disclosing the cash price in a vehicle credit sales transaction to comply with both state law and federal regulations.he explained any cost in a financed purchase that would not be incurred in a cash,transaction is a finance charge that must be properly and fairly disclosed so the consumer can understand the true cost of credit.further,accurate disclosure is required because the cash price of the vehicle affects sales tax and license and registration fees which are computed on the cash price.
ross testified that in a transaction involving a vehicle,the dealer must determine whether an existing loan on the is greater than the value of the vehicle.if so,there is a negative trade that creates the need to finance the prior loan balance and triggers certain disclosures.although the contract must reflect the value,this value should be the value the dealer can immediately obtain from converting the vehicle to cash value because it determines the contribution of the vehicle to the transaction.a dealer can allocate a higher amount for the vehicle,as long as the dealer does not use that higher amount to increase the cash price of the vehicle being purchased.if an amount higher than the existing loan balance on the vehicle is added to the cash price of the vehicle being purchased,the dealer has included negative equity in the cash price.this practice violates the asfa and its corresponding federal regulation,regulation z because the cash price inserted on line of the contract is greater than the cash price of the vehicle for a customer paying cash.see,post.moreover,the disclosure provisions of the asfa are violated because the buyer is unaware that he or she is financing part of the existing loan on the as well as a portion of the purchase price of the new vehicle.
ross reviewed the transaction here as reflected in rv business records.those records showed the value to rv of thompson vehicle was.because rv agreed to a value of,a of was created,which was then improperly added to the price of the vehicle were it purchased by a cash buyer,and was improperly disclosed as a cash price of on line of the contract.see,post.ross testified,without objection,that rv failure to specify a cash price of violated the asfa and regulation ross confirmed with the federal reserve board,the entity that issued and interprets regulation z,that this disclosure violated regulation 
according to ross,the contract also showed a violation in the required downpayment amount.by specifying a value of when there was a loan balance of on the vehicle,rv created an positive value.in reality,thompson had a remaining loan balance of because the actual cash value of the vehicle was only.thus,the allocated to the downpayment was a phantom or straw number.because the value of the vehicle was a straw number,as admitted by rv representatives in their depositions,ross concluded rv did not make a fair and accurate disclosure in the contract.
ross noted thompson made a cash downpayment,which,under the asfa,must first be applied to the outstanding loan balance leaving to be paid on thompson loan on the vehicle.where,as here,there is a negative number,a remaining amount to be paid on an existing loan,it must be disclosed under the itemization of amount financed on line prior credit balance of the contract.see,post.ross explained that in effect,this amount is a loan that is being consolidated with the new purchase loan to pay off the balance owing on the vehicle.nothing in the contract showed the downpayment was used to pay the loan balance on the vehicle.
ross pointed out that contracts with undisclosed negative equity also create problems from the lender perspective.the lender sets its risk policies,how to set rates and reserve losses,and how to determine the value of collateral and potential loss in the event of default based on ratios that necessarily include the real selling price of the vehicle.if the inflated value of a vehicle is added to the cash price,the affects the lender risk position because it is then loaning against a fictitious selling price.lenders are not in the business of advancing excess amounts over the actual purchase price of a vehicle.
according to ross calculations,the on thompson shasta,which was included in the cash price of the safari,increased the sales tax thompson paid on the safari by.because this amount was financed over years at an annual rate of percent,thompson would pay an additional in interest during the term of the contract.similarly,the vehicle license fee paid by thompson was increased in proportion to the amount of the on the vehicle.
the court heard the testimony of several other customers of rv on the issue of.lucille cline and sherry adams testified to sales transactions similar to thompson contract.rv misled cline and adams as to the value of their vehicles and the inclusion of in the cash price of the vehicles they were purchasing.they were not told about the cash price increases or the effect the increased price had on their interest payments and vehicle license fees.neither cline nor adams would have completed the transactions had they known the true facts.
rv customers rick mathis and wayne pecjak testified they each negotiated a sales transaction in which they knew the cash value of the vehicles they were purchasing.however,after the terms were agreed upon,rv told them the numbers needed to be changed for financing purposes.specifically,mathis and pecjak were told their vehicles must be and the resulting added to the cash price to obtain financing.rv did not disclose that the sales tax and license fees would also be increased by these new values.
the court issued a statement of decision,finding thompson met her burden of proof to establish violations of the asfa,clra and ucl.specifically,the court found rv violated the asfa by inflating the cash price of the safari motor home to include the on the shasta,failing to disclose the loan balance on the vehicle on line of the contract and backdating the second contract.see,post.the court concluded thompson was entitled to restitution and rescission of the contract.
the court further found rv had a pattern and practice of including in the cash prices of the vehicles it sells,without full and complete disclosure to its customers,in violation of the asfa and clra.by engaging in this pattern and practice,the court found,rv committed intentional fraud and acted in conscious disregard of the rights of thompson and other consumers,justifying an award of punitive damages.the court also awarded a senior citizen penalty under section,subdivision b,and issued an injunction prohibiting rv from including in the cash price of the vehicles it sells.
the court found rv acts and practices of including in the cash price of its vehicles are fraudulent and unfair in violation of the ucl.violations of the asfa and crla are per se violations of the ucl.further,rv acts are likely to deceive the public and thus are fraudulent within the meaning of the ucl.because the unlawful,unfair and fraudulent acts of rv are continuing,the court issued an injunction prohibiting rv from including on vehicles in the cash price of vehicles it sells the court entered judgment in accordance with its statement of decision.
discussion 
rv contends the court erred by issuing a permanent injunction prohibiting it from including on vehicles in the cash price of vehicles it sells.rv asserts the injunction prohibits legal conduct under the asfa and regulation z,and is too vague to be enforced

disclosure of cash price,downpayment and amount financedacash price 
the asfa requires inclusion of the cash price of a vehicle and the amount financed in a conditional sale contract.under section,subdivision a,the contract must contain an itemization of the amount financed.this includes a the cash price,exclusive of document preparation fees,taxes imposed on the sale,pollution control certification fees,prior credit or lease balance on property being traded in,and the amount charged for a service contract.italics added.the cash price to be included on line of the contract necessarily excludes the amount owed on a vehicle,subd.a a see,post.instead,that amount must be included in the calculation for information inserted on line under prior credit or lease balance see downpayment and calculation,subd.a g see,post.
regulation z defines cash price as the price at which a creditor,in the ordinary course of business,offers to sell for cash the property or service that is the subject of the transaction the term does not include any finance charge.a.similarly,the asfa defines cash price as the amount for which the seller would sell and transfer to the buyer unqualified title to the motor vehicle described in the conditional sale contract,subd.e.the federal reserve board official staff interpretation to regulation z explains that the definition of cash price includes a ny charges imposed equally in cash and credit transactions.a.thus,the cash price required to be itemized in accordance with section,subdivision a a must be the same for both a credit and cash customer.to the extent the cash price for a financed purchase is inflated above the selling price in a comparable cash transaction,the difference is a finance charge.official staff interpretation,a.
tila requires creditors to separately disclose finance charges to consumers.a.regulation z defines finance charge as any charge imposed directly or indirectly as a condition or incident of credit.a.under the asfa,finance charge has the same meaning set forth for that term under regulation,subd.i.in determining whether there is a finance charge in a credit transaction,a creditor evaluates comparable charges in a cash transaction.official staff interpretation,a.thus,when a creditor charges credit customers a higher price for an item than it charges cash customers,the extra amount is a finance charge and must be disclosed as a finance charge.gibson bob watson,cir,automobile purchasers stated claim against dealers under tila for failing to disclose finance charge on extended warranty contracts see also walker wallace auto sales,cir,defendant artificially inflated cost of vehicle to cover discount at which finance company purchased contract,and thus imposed hidden finance charge on plaintiff.
the cash price set forth in the contract in accordance with section,subdivision a a is increased by adding other specified costs to determine the total cash price,subd.a i.the total cash price as stated in the contract includes the loan balance remaining on property being traded in to be paid by the seller,which has been separately itemized and disclosed in accordance with section,subdivision a g,and which is not part of the cash price required by section,subdivision a a.
downpayment 
section,subdivision a requires the amount of the buyer downpayment be itemized as follows 
a the agreed value of the property being traded in.
b the prior credit or lease balance,if any,owing on the property being traded in.
c the net agreed value of the property being traded in,which is the difference between the amounts disclosed in subparagraphs a and b.if the prior credit or lease balance of the property being traded in exceeds the agreed value of the property,a negative number shall be stated.
f the remaining amount paid or to be paid by the buyer as a downpayment.
g the total downpayment.if the sum of subparagraphs c to f,inclusive,is zero or more,that sum shall be stated as the total downpayment and no amount shall be stated as the prior credit or lease balance under subparagraph g of paragraph.if the sum of subparagraphs c to f,inclusive,is less than zero,then that sum,expressed as a positive number,shall be stated as the prior credit or lease balance under subparagraph g of paragraph,and zero shall be stated as the total downpayment 
amount financed 
under section,subdivision a,the amount financed must be separately disclosed and labeled by first calculating a subtotal for the total cash price,subd.a a h,plus license,registration and various other fees,subds.a a c,a,a and then subtracting the sum of the amount of the buyer downpayment,subd.a and any administrative finance charge,subd.a.requiring disclosure in this way permits the amount financed to be clearly identified and segregated from other charges to enable the consumer to understand the cost of financing and thereby make an informed use of credit.a.
amendments to the asfa 
the current version of section was the result of various revisions to the asfa by senate bill in to clarify the total cash price,downpayment and itemization of the amount financed disclosure requirements in a conditional sale contract for a motor vehicle when a vehicle is involved in the sale.the amendments were made to conform with federal law,specifically regulation z pertaining to the disclosure of negative equity financing,which 
describes the circumstances when,in addition to financing the purchase of a new product,a creditor agrees to finance the remaining credit or lease balance owing on the property being traded in.
apparently,it was a common practice for automobile dealers to disclose a negative number on the downpayment line in circumstances involving a negative equity trade in,and then to increase the total amount financed of the newly financed vehicle by a like sum.however,this practice confused consumers,who,when looking over the itemization sheet,believed that a negative number on the downpayment line should reduce the total amount financed rather than increase it.
under the revised staff commentary to regulation z,a zero,not a negative number,is now required to appear on the downpayment line,unless there is also a cash payment involved.in addition,any prior credit or lease balance remaining on property being traded in is now required to be separately listed as a positive figure in the itemization of amount financed.assem.com.on judiciary,analysis of bill reg.sess.as amended june.
thus,section,subdivision a g requires the negative equity in a vehicle to be disclosed as a positive number identified as prior credit or lease balance,subd.a g,and the total downpayment to be stated as zero.
the asfa was violated because the cash price in thompson contract was greater than the cash price for a cash customer 
rv contends that adding the cost imposed by money owed on a vehicle to the sales price of a replacement vehicle is a legal act under the asfa and is standard industry practice.rv asserts there was no violation of the asfa because the cash price would have been the same for both a credit and cash customer with the same vehicle and the price thompson paid for the safari was not increased as a result of her credit purchase.
the amount paid by a credit buyer that is not paid by a cash buyer is the finance charge.to the extent the cash price in a credit transaction is increased above the cash price in a comparable cash transaction,the difference is a finance charge which must be disclosed.official staff interpretation,a gibson bob watson,supra,at walker wallace auto sales,supra,at.
here,the undisputed evidence showed the cash price of the safari was determined based on thompson financing needs.rv admittedly overvalued thompson vehicle by and then added to the cash price of the safari as set forth on line of the contract.see,post.the was created expressly for the purpose of allowing thompson to show a lender a positive equity in the vehicle.rv admitted it would not have increased the cash price by the amount of the for a cash buyer who did not require financing and did not need credit approval.the was added to the cash price only because there was a credit transaction and thus was required to be disclosed as a finance charge.see yazzie ray vicker special cars,supra,d at finance charge is imposed if the seller refuses to extend credit until the consumer agrees to pay the charge details of the manner in which the charge is imposed are irrelevant berryhill rich plan of pensacola cir,charge imposed for service agreement was condition incident to extension of credit and therefore a finance charge.because inclusion of the in the cash price of the safari was a condition of credit and therefore a finance charge,failing to disclose the as a finance charge violated the disclosure provisions of the asfa and regulation 
further,when rv increased the cash price of the safari by more than the cash price a cash buyer would have paid,the higher cash price caused thompson to pay more in sales tax and license fees,which were calculated on the increased cash price.the increase in sales tax and fees,imposed as a condition of financing for thompson,was also a finance charge and was required to be so disclosed.et.
rv practice of manipulating numbers in this manner would not occur in a cash transaction,even with a comparable,because there would be no need to increase the cash price of the vehicle without the need for financing.at trial,ross testified he confirmed with the federal reserve board legal department that adding an on a vehicle to the cash price of a vehicle being purchased is a disclosure violation under regulation despite rv claim this is standard industry practice,failing to disclose the true nature of these finance charges violates the asfa.
the asfa prohibits increasing the cash price to include an on a vehicle in a credit transaction 
rv contends that even in credit transactions,the asfa does not prohibit increasing the cash price of a vehicle to include the value of a vehicle.rather,it argues,the asfa requires a dealer to include the increased value in the cash price of the vehicle being purchased,as was done here,because the definition of cash price in section,subdivision e includes payment of a prior credit balance remaining on property being traded in.thus,rv asserts,it properly included the value of the shasta in the cash price of the safari on line of the contract.see,post.
rv reliance on section,subdivision e to support its argument is misplaced.section sets forth the definitions used in the asfa,unless the context otherwise requires.emphasis added.under section,subdivision e,c ash price means the amount for which the seller would sell and transfer to the buyer unqualified title to the motor vehicle described in the conditional sale contract,if the property were sold for cash at the seller place of business on the date the contract is executed,and shall include taxes to the extent imposed on the cash sale and the cash price of accessories or services related to the sale such as delivery,installation,alterations,modifications,improvements,document preparation fees,a service contract,and payment of a prior credit or lease balance remaining on property being traded in.italics added.by its inclusionary language,section,subdivision e defines the total cash price of a vehicle.however,section controls the formalities of what a conditional sale contract must contain and how its disclosures are to be made in a purchase that is being financed.in the context of disclosing the itemization of the amount financed,section,subdivision a a expressly excludes from cash price the prior credit balance on the vehicle.instead,the prior credit balance must be separately itemized in accordance with section,subdivision a g to accurately disclose the amount being financed.this interpretation is consistent with regulation z,which excludes from its definition of cash price any finance charge.a.the definition of cash price in section,subdivision e,which includes all costs associated with the purchase of the vehicle,more aptly applies to the total cash price as required to be disclosed under section,subdivision a i after those costs have been separately itemized for purposes of disclosing any finance charges 
in its statement of decision,the trial court judicially noticed the definition of cash price under the asfa by the california department of consumer affairs.the state official policy relating to negative equity reflects that adding either disclosed or undisclosed negative equity to the cash price of the vehicle is illegal under the asfa,clra and ucl because the cash price can not be influenced by a value.here,the uncontroverted evidence showed rv determined the cash price of the safari by overvaluing thompson vehicle by and then increasing the cash price of the safari by.in so doing,rv did not properly disclose the cash price as required by section,subdivision a a.by overvaluing the shasta,rv did not disclose its accurate net value,subd.a c.this,in turn,made the disclosure of the itemization of the amount financed inaccurate,in violation of the asfa and regulation 
the cost of credit was not properly disclosed 
rv contends the asfa regulates the credit financing of motor vehicles and not their sale,and thus the asfa only disclosure requirement is the cost of credit,not the value of the vehicle.rv asserts it negotiated with thompson the cash price of the safari and the allowance for the shasta,and then accurately disclosed the amount financed on the contract thompson signed.
we agree with rv position there is nothing unlawful in negotiating sales prices of vehicles and values.see stasher cal d,discussing predecessor statute to the asfa.however,the evidence here showed that although the cash price,the value of the vehicle and the amount financed were stated in the contract signed by thompson,rv did not disclose that the or the amount still owing on thompson vehicle were included in the cash price of the vehicle she purchased.the contract showed thompson had no prior credit balance on her vehicle when,in reality,she had a remaining loan balance of in addition to the value rv believed the was worth.the numbers were then manipulated to show the shasta had an positive value so thompson could get financing approved consequently,cost items that comprised the amount financed were inaccurate and violated the asfa disclosure provisions and regulation 
the injunction does not attempt to regulate the sales price of vehicles 
rv contends the court erred by adopting the particular concept of value for previously owned vehicles that have no manufacturer suggested retail price.rv asserts the court concept of value has no application under the asfa or regulation z,and can not serve as a valid component in calculating an enjoined from being added to the cash price of a vehicle.
cash price of the safari 
rv asserts that to determine the cash price for the safari purchased by thompson,it was not legally bound by an internal bookkeeping document showing the approximate price for which it hoped to sell the vehicle,reduced to a figure never disclosed or known to thompson at the time of sale.
the evidence showed the original asking price for the safari was,and based on rv customary price reduction policy,a cash customer could buy it for about.leffingwell and brady admitted the cash price was based on determining how thompson negative equity and shortfall in downpayment could be accommodated and absorbed into the pricing of the safari.thompson was never told this was the manner in which the cash price was determined.thus,the cash price for the safari in the contract included amounts a cash buyer would not have paid and therefore should not have been included in the cash price.
although a dealer has no obligation to sell a vehicle at the price listed on its inventory sheet or other internal document and may discount or increase that price based on a variety of factors,the dealer can not in a credit sale determine the cash price of a vehicle by creating an on a vehicle and then adding that amount to the cash price.when a dealer does so,consumers are defrauded because there is no disclosure the new purchase includes financing the unpaid credit balance on the vehicle and no disclosure they are paying sales tax and license fees on these increased amounts.rather,the dealer must offer the vehicle at a price that reflects an amount imposed equally in cash and credit transactions,so any additional charge is explicitly identified and disclosed as a finance charge a.rv violated the asfa and regulation z when it did not identify and disclose the items comprising the finance charge imposed on thompson purchase.
value of the shasta 
rv asserts the court erred by finding the shasta had a particular value setting its allowance.because a vehicle has no set value,it argues,the negotiated allowance was the agreed value and was properly disclosed as the value of the shasta.rv further claims the value reflected in its internal documents was the vehicle fire sale value and has no application under the asfa or regulation z,and no relevance to this case.
the concept of value and its relevance to thompson purchase transaction were explained at trial.leffingwell testified he typically uses the fire sale value of a vehicle as a negotiating tool and explains to the customer how he marks up that value and then increases the cash price of the vehicle being purchased by a corresponding amount.leffingwell admitted he valued thompson vehicle as rather than the fire sale value for the sole purpose of extending credit to her.in so doing,leffingwell was able to show on thompson contract an positive value for the shasta to submit to the lender.thompson testified this was never explained or disclosed to her.
thompson expert ross testified rv practice of valuing a vehicle higher than its fire sale value and then adding the overvalued amount to the cash price of another vehicle violates the asfa and regulation z.he explained the value of a vehicle is significant in determining compliance with the asfa disclosure requirements.although the asfa does not require the fire sale value of the vehicle be disclosed in the contract,that value must be used in the sales transaction to accurately determine the contribution of the to the dealer.a dealer can agree to allocate a greater value to a vehicle but the dealer must itemize that increased value in a manner other than increasing the cash price of the vehicle being purchased.
when rv disclosed a value of for the shasta,it created a straw number that was included in the downpayment,thereby concealing thompson negative equity position in the vehicle.as a result,the cash price of the safari in the contract contained hidden or buried costs passed on to thompson through an undisclosed additional amount financed.
under section,subdivision a a,the amount of the buyer downpayment must be itemized to show the agreed value of the property being traded in.although the statute does not specifically define agreed value,the asfa overriding policy of full and fair disclosure presupposes the dealer has honestly disclosed the true value of a vehicle as a starting point in the parties good faith negotiations.the parties may ultimately agree to any value after the dealer has met its obligation to honestly disclose to the customer the value the vehicle has to the dealer and how any variation from that value will affect the buyer total downpayment,including payment of any prior credit balance remaining on the vehicle,subd.a a g.what the dealer can not do,as was done here,is value a vehicle at a figure that has no relationship to the true value to the dealer.further,the dealer can not use this fictitious agreed value to accommodate the buyer financing needs,and then hide that amount in the cash price of the vehicle being purchased.
no evidence was presented at trial that the value was bargained for or negotiated to be the agreed value or that other factors affected the value of the shasta that thompson was trading in.rather,rv admitted it determined a value by the shasta for financing purposes and then it recaptured that amount in the cash price of the safari.although the parties ultimately agreed on a allowance for the shasta,the absence of full and fair disclosure prevented thompson from having any meaningful choice in the purchase transaction.
the fact that a false statement may be obviously false to those who are trained and experienced does not change its character,nor take away its power to deceive others less experienced.there is no duty resting upon a citizen to suspect the honesty of those with whom he or she transacts business.laws are made to protect the trusting as well as the suspicious.t he rule of caveat emptor should not be relied upon to reward fraud and deception.federal trade commission standard ed.soc.lavie procter gamble th,d.the fraudulent and deceptive practice that occurred here is precisely what the spirit and policy of the asfa is meant to address.see hernandez atlantic finance,supra,d at.the asfa was designed to protect the unwary naive purchaser lande jurisich d,remedial statute must be liberally construed so as to suppress the mischief at which it is directed and advance or extend the remedy provided.the court properly found,on these facts,the value of the shasta to rv should have been its value and consequently its agreed value.failure to use this value resulted in a contract that did not contain fair and accurate disclosures 
negative equity
